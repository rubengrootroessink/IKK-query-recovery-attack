   Broadcom Announces World's Broadest Offering of Bluetooth Qualified Comp=
onents   MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bluetooth Cong=
ress 2001   Bluetooth Version 1.1 Qualifications of BCM2001, BCM2002X, BCM2=
019,    BCM2039 and LMP Make Blutonium(TM) the Broadest Line of Qualified  =
                   Bluetooth Components Available  Broadcom Corporation (Na=
sdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband =
communications, today announced the broadest line of Bluetooth(TM) version =
1.1-qualified components in the industry. Broadcom's qualified components i=
nclude a full suite of radio and baseband chips, as well as Link Manager Pr=
otocol (LMP) firmware, providing end-to-end enabling technology for a range=
 of Bluetooth applications. This means that devices developed using Broadco=
m's Blutonium(TM) chips and firmware can attain Bluetooth qualification wit=
h minimal effort, accelerating the time-to-market for these products.   "Ou=
r Blutonium line provides our customers with unmatched flexibility in the d=
evelopment of their pre-qualified Bluetooth products," said Scott Bibaud, D=
irector of Bluetooth Marketing for Broadcom. "With multiple Bluetooth-quali=
fied basebands and radios, as well as a qualified LMP, Broadcom can provide=
 equipment developers with the solution that's right for their application.=
"   The Blutonium line consists of two standalone all-CMOS Bluetooth radios=
, the Broadcom(R) BCM2001 for general applications and the BCM2002X, a radi=
o-only chip optimized for use in mobile phones. In addition, the family inc=
ludes two baseband processor chips, the BCM2039 standalone baseband and the=
 BCM2019 host-based baseband chip that includes no on-board processor and i=
nstead leverages the processor of its host device. Broadcom's LMP firmware =
stack provides the processor logic that manages connections between Bluetoo=
th devices.   "One of the benefits of Bluetooth is the ability to allow man=
y different types of data devices to share information over the air," Bibau=
d said. "As a result, no `one-size-fits-all' solution can truly accommodate=
 the breadth of applications created by this technology. We've developed th=
e Blutonium line to include a variety of Bluetooth-qualified silicon and sy=
stem solutions to enable whatever applications our customers dream up, prov=
iding functionality optimized for their product needs and getting those pro=
ducts through the qualification process and to the market in short order." =
  With high receiver sensitivity and excellent blocking performance, the Bl=
utonium product line is ideally suited to perform well in harsh radio frequ=
ency (RF) environments such as inside mobile phones and laptop computers or=
 in geographical areas with high concentrations of radio interference. Blut=
onium supports the complete Bluetooth 1.1 feature set, including full data =
rate, seven slave piconet with master/slave switching, and scatternet. Manu=
factured in a standard digital CMOS process, the Blutonium line features hi=
gh levels of integration, incorporating all RF circuits on-chip and requiri=
ng very few external passive components, which reduces system cost and boar=
d space requirements.   Qualifications of the BCM2001 and BCM2002 were perf=
ormed by Hyper Corporation, a Bluetooth Qualification Body (BQB) in Pleasan=
ton, California, while qualifications of the BCM2019 and BCM2039 were perfo=
rmed by 7 Layers, a BQB located in Irvine, California. The qualification pr=
ocess consisted of testing of the baseband chips and LMP firmware, as well =
as some radio testing by the BQBs, and verification of test data against sp=
ecifications set by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). In accordan=
ce with these procedures, Hyper and 7 Layers performed testing and reviewed=
 Broadcom's test results, verifying compliance of the transceivers and ensu=
ring that products using the chips will be eligible to bear the Bluetooth l=
ogo. The Broadcom transceivers were qualified with no waivers.   About Broa=
dcom  Broadcom Corporation is the leading provider of highly integrated sil=
icon solutions that enable broadband communications and networking of voice=
, video and data services. Using proprietary technologies and advanced desi=
gn methodologies, Broadcom designs, develops and supplies complete system-o=
