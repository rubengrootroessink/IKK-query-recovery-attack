Dear Investor,

The market is in clear RALLY mode. Last week's NICE
MOVES-on top of growing strength this fall-are just a
harbinger of things to come.  Stocks are headed much higher
still.

There's no way they couldn't be.  Not starting from such
oversold levels.  Not with interest rates near zero.  Not with
easy money and the Feds pumping $100 billion or so into the
economy.

Since the beginning of October, the S&P is up 12%?the
NASDAQ is up 36%?and my entire POWERHOUSE
portfolio (that's every single stock I recommend, not some
made-up "best of" list) is UP 46%.  How about you?  Are
you making money like this-right now-or are you
MISSING OUT???

Take a look at some of the stocks my clients and I own-and
how well they're doing RIGHT NOW:

* Analysts are jumping back on the cell phone bandwagon.
Why?  New personal security issues; soaring sales in China;
and a generational shift in technologies.  Powerhouse Nokia
is UP 72% since in October 1st.

* Chip-makers that power sophisticated communications
devices are hot now, too.  Our Taiwan Semiconductor is UP
96%.

* And that's a boon for KLA Tencor, which provides critical
in-line testing equipment that keep small mistakes from
costing millions for chip-makers.  The stock?  UP 76% since
the beginning of October.

* Security is a HUGE issue now.  And many of the answers
that will make our lives and businesses more secure are
technology-based.  Security POWERHOUSE Check Point
Systems is UP 96%.

* What's more, this rally is exceptionally broad.  An
example-even the enterprise software sector is booming.
Since the beginning of October, our stake in Peoplesoft has
SOARED 127%!

Get the picture?  If you're sitting on the sidelines, you're
missing out!

I'VE GOT a dozen ways for you to make a pile of cash in the
months ahead.  But there's one HOT STOCK, in particular,
I want to tell you about today.  In fact, I've just put the
finishing touches on an Urgent Profit Bulletin detailing this
opportunity-and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

It's a LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your
money by this time next year-then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.  But sadly, most
investors will MISS OUT-because they believe the myth
about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic cable.

Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed
down-very noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came
to a grinding halt!  That means there isn't nearly enough
capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate
a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about
this problem.  After all, this is the second time it's happened.
Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to
a crawl for two full days.

That means our communications systems-and therefore our
economy-are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on
those systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds?how dispatchers
route fleets of trucks?how many Americans get paid
through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest-one of America's biggest carriers-recently said
they're 60% loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too
bad?until you understand how these networks operate.  You
can't load a network much past 65%.  In fact, 70% is
virtually CATASTROPHIC- because the network spends
so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend
any time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes
to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster in
Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's because
we push out more data than everyone else-but we're not
increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.

We've got to catch up-and we've got to catch up fast!
Otherwise business, the economy and our national security
all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber
glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid
is "dark"-that is, it's not activated.  And the company I'm
recommending is the #1 supplier of the components needed
to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE-possibly a
TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to
multiply our money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this
stock truly has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was some
13-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government is
ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending into the
economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need
isn't just vital for the economy anymore-it's a question of
NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time if you
miss out. Get this company's name--and full details--in my
urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times Richer By 2007.  It's yours

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING


P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT
on.  It's already UP 51% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.  Yet that's
still some 90% off its old highs-so it has miles to run.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained
to the limits.  And get this-data traffic is DOUBLING every
year now.  That means a network running at 63% of capacity
needs to double its load by this time next year just to keep
up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber
will be lit.  Click here to get your FREE report now.
