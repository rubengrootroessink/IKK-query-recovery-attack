Dear Trader:

Some of our readers experienced some difficulty yesterday with
the link to the audio interview.

Below please find the direct link to Michael Pinson's interview
with Liberty Trading President James Cordier in which the
concept of option selling and Liberty Trading's option selling
method is discussed in depth.

If you do not have Real Player  you can download it once you
link to the site.

If you have an interest in writing options, we think you will find the
Radio Show very interesting.

Feel free to call with questions.

Sincerely,
James Cordier
