CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES

_________Volume 3, Number 111___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.

Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/06)
--------------------------------------------------------
CTS Hot Today Special Edition

Football analogy- "Wisdom from a CTS customer"

Every day, I read e-mails from subscribers. A typical day will
yield several comments about our services. All in all, it is
typically the best part of my day.

Sometimes, I get a comment that also offers personal
observations. These are often loaded with
wisdom directly from a trader. CTS Hot Today is
meant to convey a little wisdom every day, and
it doesn't always have to be my own. Yesterday, a good
customer of CTS wrote an excellent testimonial about his
experience and then elaborated on his approach with an
analogy to the great game of football. We asked and he
agreed to let us publish his comments, and I hope you
will enjoy reading a fellow traders wisdom in today's
special edition...

-------------------------------------------------------
From David Breen Jr. (CTS customer since 1997)
In this business it's rare to find someone selling subscriptions
and services that are worth the money. I must say that your
service is honest and excellent. In addition to your total
professionalism, I also admire your companies image and style.
I always look forward to receiving your daily emails. I
appreciate your bits of wisdom and no-nonsense approach. Some
traders may not want to hear about the personal or psychological
side of trading which you sometimes write about, but it's just
as, if not more important than any other aspect of trading!  The
information, strategies, methods, and wisdom you provide are
obviously based on the truth of the markets and not hype or BS!
Most people don't seem to realize that trading to win is about
strategy and trade management. It's not about being right or
wrong regarding price direction. It's not about the best
indicator, system, or method. The only thing we have control of
as traders is our decisions about trades and capital. We cannot
predict or control the price line, we can only identify high
probability setups and then call and execute a play.
 I sometimes compare it to football. Smart coaches know the basic
keys to winning a championship are a solid running game (short
consistent swing profits) and a great defense (always, always
use stops). Winning football teams practice hard (backtest and
paper trade new theories). When they're in a real game they call
plays (execute trades) based on field position (price), down
(time), yards-to-go (volatility), and opponent (commodity).
Although they do have their favorite high percentage plays
(patterns,indicators,systems), they don't call the same play
every time in every situation against every opponent! Winning
teams know when to settle for less points and kick a field goal
(never let a gain turn to a loss), and they know when to punt
(scratch a trade when it's going nowhere). But most important,
they never go for it on 4th down in their own territory (violate
stops). Plays don't work every time (win every trade), but some plays
break out for a touchdown (quick windfall profit), while other
plays result in a loss (happens all the time), and sometimes
they even result in a fumble/interception for a touchdown
(gaps or limits)!  But in the end, if they have solid coaching
(trade management skills) and use the best players to execute
the plays (broker with good fills), they will win most of their
games and have a winning season (profitable week\month\year).
Keep up the excellent service and information. Best Regards,
-David Breen Jr.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Much thanks to David Breen Jr. for letting us publish his
comments. I would welcome anyone to write down their words
of wisdom and send them in. Our CTS "community" is based
on the credo of "Traders Helping Traders", and we can all
improve our successes with helpful insights driven by
our experience. David & I will see you in the winners circle.

Key Technical Developments (close of 06/05)
-------------------------------------------------------
December Euro's are still trading at a 30 basis point discount
to September. Unless the the Fed switches to a tightening bias,
there's 30 points to be be made here without any move in September.

Action in gold looks very bearish to me! Commercials sold more on
the recent decline and are now holding their largest net short
since 1996.....At -68k contracts, they sold hard into the rally!
The current price pattern appears to be a symmetrical triangle on
hourly charts with a down side target near 254!

The US dollar is still acting very strong again all major currencies!
Another 100 to 150 point rally is expected near term.

The commodity rally fizzled and the CTS Power Trend rating is now in
neutral territory at -3! If the energies don't get legs soon, we
could see major selling pressure across the board!
