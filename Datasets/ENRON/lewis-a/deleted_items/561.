               THE DRUG INDUSTRY'S DEADLY LITTLE SECRET
                       THAT ALMOST NOBODY KNOWS!

Today's $48-billion drug industry is hiding a deadly little secret:
106,000 deaths and 2.2 million injuries a year from drug side
effects.

That makes prescription drugs-even when taken exactly as
prescribed-the fourth leading cause of death in this country. Not
much of a cure.

But what if you discovered five companies that use the newly mapped
human genome sequence to predict how you individually will respond
to drugs?

Their patented "bioinformatics" technologies could save hundreds of
thousands of lives a year. Imagine: Drugs with a market of one. One
person, for whom the drug will be designed to be nearly 100%
effective.

This reality is closer than you think.

The great thing for investors is, virtually no one knows anything
about it.

Yet.

I'm Tobin Smith, founder of ChangeWave Investment Research and
author of the New York Times best seller ChangeWave Investing:
Picking the Next Monster Stocks of the New Economy.

If you think infotech was big, wait until you really learn about
biotech. Because when the scribes write the history of our time, the
bursting of the tech-bubble won't be the lead story. The lead story
will be biotech-specifically, the genomics revolution.

BIOTECH SECTOR GIVES INVESTORS GREAT OPPORTUNITY-DESPITE RECENT
SETBACKS

You might not understand the science behind genomics. That's ok.
Because what you really need to understand is that the bioeconomy
means one thing for savvy investors: Huge profits... IF you own the
right stocks. IF you really find out where the winners are, and why
they'll win.

The five companies profiled in Biotech Boom!-ChangeWave's FREE
special report-are the real deal. They already have a lot of these
'miracle' drugs progressing through their respective "pipelines."
They are the up-and-coming leaders of the biotech story-the elite
group of forward-thinking, profit-generating companies whose
products give investors a once-in-a-lifetime shot (literally!) at
capitalizing on the profits locked in the human gene sequence.

COMPANIES LIKE:

Biotech Boom Stock #1: A deal maker with nearly $2 billion in cash
in its coffers. Currently engaged in the development of breakthrough
drugs and predictive medicine called "gene to patient." Its
anticancer drug was brought to market in an incredible 18 months!
The royalties from this breakthrough might be in the billions!
Companies currently funding its growth include Eli Lilly and Bristol
Myers Squibb.


Biotech Boom Stock #2: The leader in capturing the most sought after
intellectual property in the proteomics sector. This future Game
Over Dominator just entered the drug development with plans to
license the targets it develops to the monsters of Big Drug Inc.
This company is the leading candidate to dominate this potential
multi-billion dollar industry.


Biotech Boom Stock # 3: This leading genomics-based drug company and
development company is revolutionizing the industry by merging
biology with information technology. There's no aspect of a person's
life that will not be affected by this company's work. Recently
announced a huge landmark biotechnology agreement with Bayer. Keep
an eye on this one!


Biotech Boom Stock # 4: You might call this company the "Intel of
Biotech." Its intellectual property consists of the microchip arrays
that are used for DNA testing. If personalized, genomics-based drugs
take off, this chip is the proprietary technology that will be
widely used in testing. A huge opportunity for big profits.


Biotech Boom Stock #5: A development-stage company that is the
potential grand slam in the post-genomics sector. Its partner list
reads like a Who's Who of the drug world including GlaxoSmithKline,
Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, and Pharmacia. .

When it comes to biotech, the five stocks profiled in Biotech Boom!
are the pick of the litter. But you'll have to get them before they
grow up. There's simply no time to waste. Although I can't give you
all the details here, I reveal them in your FREE special report,
Biotech Boom! To get your FREE COPY, just click below.
