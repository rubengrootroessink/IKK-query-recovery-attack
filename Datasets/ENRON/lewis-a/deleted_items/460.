2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Multiple groups within the Basic sector have been showing
strength as of late, though the most two most notable groups
are Basic/Mining/Gold {.MGO} and Basic/Mining/Junior Gold
{.MJG}.  Gold prices rose throughout last week with Friday's
closing price of $287.55 the highest since October 9.  Part
of the buying pressure was spurred by Bruce Hansen's, CFO
of Newmont Mining {NEM}, prediction that gold could reach
$300 per ounce.  Gold stocks have also been bid up on merger
speculation with NEM and AngloGold {AU} both trying to
acquire Normandy Mining {NMDMF}.  Other groups within the
sector showing upward momentum include Basic/Mining/Copper
{.MCP}, Basic/Paper-Products {.PAP}, Basic/Steel-Iron
{.STE}, Basic/Steel-Iron/Minimill {.SMN}, and
Basic/Steel-Iron/Specialties {.SOS}.

Banks {.BAN}, Banks/Savings & Loan {.BSL}, and
Banks/Savings Banks {.BSB} have rebounded recently, with the
first group rising the to the 50th percentile for the first
time in four weeks.  Volume for mortgage and refinancing
applications continues to be strong, but what was also
helping the sector were New York City area banks.  Commerce
Bancorp {CBH} and Hudson City Bancorp {HCBK} both reported
better than expected earnings last week, boosting prices of
competitors Staten Island Bank {SIB} and Astoria Financial
{ASFC}.

Other groups with rising rankings include Beverages {.BEV},
Beverages/Bottlers {.BBO}, Broadcasting/Television {.BTV},
Electronics/Defense {.EDE}, Energy/Oil-Gas/Refiner {.ORF},
Finance/Leasing {.FLE}, Homes/Hotels-Motels-Inns {.HOT},
Home/Pet & Supplies {.PET}, Leisure/Musical Instruments
{.LMU}, and Telecommunications/Satellite {.TSA}.

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

The ranking for Vehicles/Auto Parts-Equipment {.APT} dropped
materially last week, from the 56th percentile to the 36th
percentile primarily because of the fallout from Ford's {F}
problems. Ford announced that it would be laying off workers,
closing several plants and ending production of certain
models in an effort to return to profitability.  Visteon {VC}
was the most adversely affected because of its dependency on
sales to Ford and because of a dispute with the automaker
over price reductions.  Magma {MGA} also sold-off following
its first quarter earnings guidance.  The guidance was
inline, but had a lower end of the range, which caused
concerned about weakening business conditions among many
investors.

Other groups with declining rankings include Building {.BUI},
Electronics/Radios-TV-Tape {.ERT}, Finance/Diversified
Miscellaneous {.FDM}, Publishing/Textbooks {.PTE}, and
Textiles/Leather Shoes/Producer {.LSP}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

Building/Homebuilding {.BHO} has been retreating off of its
recent highs, pulling back for the third consecutive week to
the 87th percentile.  The pullback appears to be technical
in nature, with many having set or trading near 52-week highs
during the past few weeks.  Given that a strong earnings
report out of KB Homes {KBH} did little to renew buying
interest, the group's direction may be dependant on overall
market sentiment, with positive news appearing to have been
already priced in - at least over the short-term.
