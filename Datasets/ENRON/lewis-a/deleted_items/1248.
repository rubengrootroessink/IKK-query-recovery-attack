follows from EquityAlert.com.     New IEEE 802.11g Draft Standard a Win for=
 WLAN Market Offering 802.11a Data-Rates in the 2.4GHz Band - Includes TI's=
 22Mbps Technology=1D- Mandatory Modes: 802.11a OFDM in the 2.4GHz band and=
 802.11b CCK - Optional Modes: PBCC-22 From TI and CCK-OFDM   DALLAS, Nov 1=
6, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- As a leading participant in the ongoing =
work of the IEEE 802.11g Task Group, members from Texas Instruments Incorpo=
rated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) helped the body reach a critical technology selectio=
n for the 802.11g standard for high-rate wireless networking in the 2.4GHz =
band, which will allow multimedia applications to be wirelessly networked a=
nd enable the next generation of wireless LAN devices for consumers. The ne=
w draft standard, a compromise proposal from TI, Intersil Corp. and several=
 other companies, combines elements from the final two independent proposal=
s that were originally considered for the 802.11g standard. It offers compa=
tibility with 802.11b and a set of data-rates up to 54Mbps in the 2.4GHz ba=
nd. In addition, the new draft standard also contains modes of operation us=
ing PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM. This integration of modes will enable consumer pr=
oducts to support multiple modulations and provides a clear bridge from 11M=
bps to 54Mbps data rates.   "The IEEE has defined a clear path for 802.11g =
that bridges 11, 22 and 54 Mbps, making multi-mode products based on one st=
andard a reality," said Allen Nogee, senior analyst Cahners In-Stat/MRD. "B=
y already offering 22Mbps capabilities with the ACX100, TI and its customer=
s are well positioned to enable the first step in the deployment of 802.11g=
 compliant products in the 2.4GHz band."   The 802.11g draft standard utili=
zes framework from the original proposals for 802.11g which called for OFDM=
 in the 2.4GHz band as an optional mode to the primary proposed modulation,=
 either PBCC-22 or CCK-OFDM. The 802.11g draft standard has two mandatory m=
odes, OFDM offering 802.11a data rates in the 2.4GHz band, and implementati=
on of 802.11b CCK for full backward compatibility. It also offers two optio=
nal modes of PBCC-22 and CCK-OFDM, to support rates up to 24Mbps. This bala=
nced compromise offers a much clearer bridge between the 802.11a and 802.11=
b standards, plus is a straightforward means to develop true multi-mode/RF =
devices.   "TI supports the new IEEE 802.11g draft standard and commends th=
e group for its work to reach a well-balanced compromise that offers the WL=
AN industry a clear path to support multiple modes within a single standard=
," said Marc Cetto, general manager Wireless Networking at TI. "This is a p=
ositive development for customers offering or developing products based on =
TI's ACX100 solution providing 802.11b compliance with differentiating exte=
nded data rates via PBCC-22 now, and be confident that their solutions are =
fully embraced by the 802.11 standards organization."   Now that the techno=
logy behind 802.11g has been clarified, TI will be developing 802.11g-compl=
iant devices by using elements of its existing 802.11b solution, as well as=
 its 802.11a work in progress, for availability in mid- 2002. Additionally,=
 since TI's PBCC-22 is specified in the 802.11g draft, the company's existi=
ng devices, which already offer this higher rate feature, will be able to i=
nteroperate at 22Mbps with the company's 802.11g-compliant devices that wil=
l also offer PBCC-22. This ensures a high degree of forward- compatible int=
eroperability at this higher data rate, while maintaining full 802.11b comp=
liance. TI is currently shipping the ACX100 to customers offering 802.11b c=
ompatibility with 802.11g standards compliant 22Mbps extended data rates al=
lowing them to quickly differentiate their products in a less confusing WLA=
N ecosystem.   "TI is a strong proponent of industry standards and has cons=
istently and proactively worked with TGg to find a compromise proposal that=
 would be acceptable to all the members. This effort has paid off in the cr=
eation and selection of a compelling proposal in which multiple parties can=
 walk away as winners, most notably, end consumers of WLAN products," said =
