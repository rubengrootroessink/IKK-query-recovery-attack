Whose Desktop Is It, Anyway?

Over the weekend and today, everybody went high with stories about the
AOL-Microsoft talks. They're off. No, they're back on. You could find
support for any theory you liked, amid all the leaking and the
spinning.

The Washington Post's Saturday story said that the talks had broken
down on Friday, and it outlined some of the possible reasons for the
rift. The paper cited a theory that the sticking point was Microsoft's
desire that AOL make its Instant Messaging service compatible with
Microsoft's. Another version claimed that Microsoft wanted AOL to sign
an exclusive deal to use its Media Player, locking out rival
RealNetworks, the media solution now used by AOL. The Post's reporter
was skeptical of both explanations of why the talks tanked.

Today's stories all noted that the talks had resumed over the weekend.
The Wall Street Journal explored some of the nuances in the giants'
relationship with an explanation of how Microsoft is changing what it
means to be "on the desktop." It seems the company's new Windows XP,
to be released in the fall, will boot up initially without the
familiar scatter of icons on the desktop. Users will be able to add
icons, according to the Journal, but a new program called "the
sweeper" will ask them periodically if they want to remove the less
frequently used ones. Microsoft's detailed control over the user's
experience prompted AOL to tell lawmakers recently that Windows XP is
"anti-innovation, anti-consumer and anti-competitive," according to
the Journal.

Writing in the New York Times, John Markoff updated the story with the
help of his own anonymous sources, who told him that Microsoft had
been "trying to persuade AOL to agree not to lobby against Microsoft
in current or future court battles," but that AOL is "holding open the
possibility of pursuing (antitrust) action" against Microsoft if the
talks break down. No-namers inside AOL told Markoff that the media
giant has grown increasingly concerned of late over Microsoft's
Dot-Net strategy and its plans for Hailstorm, a technology intended to
aggregate consumers' personal information and transactions. Markoff
concluded with a review of the Internet appliance that AOL had once
planned to introduce. Markoff quoted another no-namer who said that
AOL has "backed off on that and decided not to compete and to come in
through the living room instead." - Keith Dawson

Wal-Mart Wants You to Surf Like It's 1999

A number of outlets ran an AP story by Chuck Bartels about Wal-Mart's
much-delayed introduction of its own branded online service. The
offering results from a 1999 partnership with (who else?) AOL. It will
be based on the CompuServe online service, which has long since been
acquired by AOL. Bartels reported that it will be priced below $10 per
month.

Bartels questioned the wisdom of introducing a bargain ISP service at
this point in the tech slump, noting that other "experiments to offer
free or low-cost Internet service have been largely unsuccessful." The
reporter quoted a Gartner analyst who "questioned the buying power of
those consumers that Walmart.com is aiming to reach." A Wal-Mart
spokesman responded with this spectacularly mixed metaphor, "We can't
back off on growth. The ball's on our shoulders."

Wsj.com's Melinda Patterson Grenier compared the planned Wal-Mart
Connect service in detail with its rival Kmart's bluelight.com, which
has offered three-tier Internet service since December 1999. By some
odd coincidence, this is the same month that saw the announcement of
the Wal-Mart-AOL deal. Grenier raised more questions about Wal-Mart's
business model by pointing out that bluelight.com had recently changed
its terms of use to charge users who are not buying anything from the
site. Wal-Mart has no plans for such a tie-in.

SatireWire gets the last word on Wal-Mart Connect. Here's how the
site's brief story sets the scene for the retailing giant's
announcement: "Emerging from the deep, isolated cavern where its
executives apparently have been hibernating for the past two years,
Wal-Mart Friday proudly announced ..." Boy, it's bright out here. -

Every Net Company Needs a Textbook Publisher

Guessing Vivendi Universal's next move in its alleged march to Net
domination could become the next office betting pool. On Friday,
Vivendi - which has already cobbled together a music company, a
Hollywood studio and a Euro digital-TV outfit - forked over $1.7
billion for publisher Houghton Mifflin. What's next? Pick a square:
Women's clothing? How about fast food?

No matter how much Vivendi spends to transmogrify its business into a
Net-age dynamo - and you'll recall it just forked over $372 million
for MP3.com - reporters feel compelled to mention its low-tech past.
Several outlets mentioned that Vivendi has nipped and tucked its way
to 25 acquisitions over the last five years or so. Despite the
cosmetic enhancements, the New York Times noted that Vivendi is
"traditionally a water-treatment company." At least the Washington
Post's Paris-based correspondent explained that it "started out as a
water utility before becoming a multimedia empire." The Los Angeles
Times even invoked its sewer utility past. Ooh, the indignity.

As for Houghton Mifflin, if your response was "Houghton who?" you
weren't alone. Vivendi ponied up $1.7 billion, mostly for Houghton's
textbook business, but in the publisher's hometown of Boston,
newspapers skipped that angle to focus on Houghton's smaller but
historically glam nonfiction division, which brought us everyone from
Mark Twain to James Carroll to that more recent literary coup, "The
Wind Done Gone."

One gloomy Bostonian even wondered whether the sale was somehow an
extension of the Curse of the Bambino. The Red Sox haven't won a World
Series since they traded Babe Ruth to the hated New York Yankees in
1918. Given Wall Street's skepticism over Vivendi's makeover and the
severity of the curse - the BoSox's championship drought is the
league's second longest - Grok wonders whether the French gave this
angle its due.

Reporters didn't, but they turned thumbs-down on the deal anyway,
scratching their heads as to what Vivendi chairman Jean- Marie Messier
was thinking. The juiciest rebuke came from the Guardian, which
knuckle-rapped Messier for "reading from last year's new-economy
script." Enough with the trophy transactions, the Brit daily
tsk-tsked. It's time to "start proving that this extraordinary
corporate entity can actually make substantial profits." In other
words, batter up, Vivendi. Oh, and don't choke. - Deborah Asbrand
