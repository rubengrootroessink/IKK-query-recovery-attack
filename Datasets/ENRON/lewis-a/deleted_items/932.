GLOBAL SEAFOOD TECHNOLOGIES INC.
ENTERS INTO A PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND FRESHWATER
SHRIMP PRODUCTION FACILITIES

BILOXI, Miss. --
Aquaculture Corporation of America (ACA), a
subsidiary of GLOBAL SEAFOOD TECHNOLOGIES INC.
(OTC Bulletin Board: GSFT) has entered into
a joint venture agreement with Controlled Environment
Aquaculture, LLC (CEA) to significantly expand
the Company's indoor aquaculture facilities for
raising freshwater shrimp, Clay Gutierrez,
vice president of Global Seafood Technologies
Inc., announced today.

COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS

*** GSFT currently has the largest freshwater shrimp
    hatchery in the United States capable of producing
    up to 10 million juvenile shrimp per month.

*** GSFT successfully grew their first
    commercial crop of giant freshwater shrimp in
    FY 2000.

*** Each new indoor facility is expected to produce up
    to 28,000 pounds of shrimp annually, which is
    equivalent to $70,000 in wholesale revenues,
    for ACA.

Aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of the
agriculture industry and currently provides 25 percent
of the world's seafood. These new indoor facilities will
add to ACA's international shrimp farming output
and will also provide the Company with four grow-out
seasons as opposed to the one or two seasons we are
currently limited to with their outdoor farms.
With these new facilities in place, GSFT
is better positioned to significantly expand
their revenues and profitability during 2001.

GLOBAL SEAFOOD TECHNOLOGIES IS
ONE OF THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL
QUICK FREEZE (IQF) SHRIMP
PROCESSORS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Its subsidiary, Custom Pack, processes and
packages shrimp for many of the nation's
largest seafood chains and grocery outlets.
The company's Killer Bee Bait subsidiary markets
frozen recreational fishing bait. In addition,
Global Seafood is expanding its aquaculture
activities with freshwater shrimp production.
