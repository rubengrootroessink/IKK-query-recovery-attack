My readers are up 64% in 2.5 years...and now I want to show
YOU the core principles of our winning investment strategy.

Join Me for My First-Ever FREE Email Seminar:
Success Secrets of a Tech Stock Pro

Dear Investor,

How many technology investors do you know who have
outperformed the NASDAQ by more than 64% since 1998?

My Technology Investing readers have done exactly
that...and I believe I can help YOU do the same. That's why
I've developed a brand new email seminar, Success Secrets
of a Tech Stock Pro, that I'd like to offer you--absolutely
FREE!

In this four-week email series, I'll show you:

*How to Identify the Companies That Will Survive the Market Meltdown.
September 11th changed everything.  Good ideas and
innovation are no longer enough. Bet on that, and you'll
lose--plain and simple. Here's what you SHOULD look
for, instead.

*How to Spot Tomorrow's Top Technology Performers Today.
Hint: It has NOTHING to do with price/earnings OR
price/book ratios, and Wall Street doesn't have a clue.
Learn the 4 factors you MUST evaluate before buying a
single tech company--the right criteria can mean the
difference between millions of dollars in profits...and
more gut-wrenching losses.

*How YOU Can Avoid the 3 Costliest Mistakes Most Investors
Made Last Year. My readers and I were able to lock in
profits even as the NASDAQ crashed by knowing these three
simple rules--and we're turning them to our advantage this
year, too. (That's how we've racked up gains of up to 32%
in several of our stocks in 2001alone.) Here's your chance
to put them to work for you, too.

PLUS, I'll reveal my top picks to help you DOUBLE YOUR
MONEY OR BETTER in just the next 12 months, including:

*Unparalleled cash resources. This industry frontrunner has
a whopping 75%-80% of the fiber optic components market
LOCKED UP. With companies looking to increase their data
storage and disaster recovery efforts after the recent
terrorist attacks, this area is going to gain a HUGE boost.
Every investor must own this stock!

*Military Electronics. Biometric Identification Technologies.
Cell phone boom. MP3 craze. PDAs. E-Z Pass.
Internet Gaming: Find out how you can make +150% profits
with one innovative powerhouse.

*More profitable than the rise of computers AND the
Internet.  This company's making gene-based drugs --fast--
and giving cancer a run for its money! Here's how YOU can
profit.

After the terrorist attacks?the market crash...and the
recent inventory glut, it's a WHOLE NEW BALLGAME for
technology stocks. Sadly, most investors don't know the new
rules--and they're missing out on a slew of unbelievable
profits that a small handful of investors is quietly taking
to the bank. (So far, my Technology Investing readers are
sitting on gains of 31% in Applied Materials?106% in
Oracle?32% in Immunex and more.)

Which crowd do YOU want to run with?

You CAN make money in this market and you CAN set yourself
up for even more phenomenal profits when technology stocks
finally turn around. With the new rules...a savvy, seasoned
guide...and my FREE email seminar on your side, you can
hardly lose! So go ahead, visit
