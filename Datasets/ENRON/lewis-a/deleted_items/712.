Presentation Discussion: Traders often find themselves letting winning
trades turn into losing trades. Many times this is a discipline issue, but
more often it relates to a lack of effective order routing. Your primary
objective, once you make a decision to enter or or exit, is to route your
order at the best price with a high likelihood of getting filled! Many
traders over complicate the level II screen and order routing options by
trying to memorize the components of Level II/order routing options. Keep
it Simple! Learn how to properly use Level II information together with
time & sales prints as your "play by play" announcer telling you who is
buying and who is selling and how to best route your order to get filled
NOW! Join Scott McVicker, visiting us from Rochester, NY is former VP of
Education and Head Instructor of MarketWise Stock Trading School in
Denver, for this entertaining presentation on proper Level II
interpretation and order execution. (www.MarketWise.com was created by
David Nassar, author of the popular book, "How to Get Started in Electonic
Trading")

"Scott's January presentation of this topic was rated as one of the best
offered in Orange County within the past 12 months.  He is a master trader
as well as an excellent speaker"  Richard V Rueb
