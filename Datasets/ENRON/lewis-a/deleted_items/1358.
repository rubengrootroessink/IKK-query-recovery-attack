Dear CultureFinders:

We know it's the holiday season, but we're going to interrupt our normal
schedule to talk to you about the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City, so you can start making your travel plans. The Olympic Arts Festival is
going to be a spectacular series of arts events beginning February 1 and
running through the 2002 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, with some of
the art exhibits opening in early January.

The festival highlights some of America's great contributions to the arts and
humanities, with specially commissioned works by contemporary artists. Here
are a few of the highlights of the Arts Festival which will include more than
60 performances, 10 major exhibitions and 50 community programs and
exhibitions:

Dale Chihuly, the creative force who elevated glassworking to an art form, is
one of the most recognized artists in the world. He has been honored as
America's first National Living Treasure. "Dale Chihuly: Salt Lake 2002" will
be presented at the Salt Lake Art Center, featuring 16 new chandeliers as
well as other work by Chihuly. The exhibition runs January 25 - March 17.

The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will present an Olympic premiere of a
ballet based on the life of the gifted Olympian Florence Griffith Joyner.
Judith Jamison, award-winning choreographer and Artistic Director of Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater, merges dance, athleticism and art in a new work
to celebrate and honor a great American sports hero. The company will perform
February 9-10 at the Capitol Theatre, and February 12-13 at the George S. and
Dolores Dore Eccles Center for the Performing Arts.

Throughout the Olympic Arts Festival, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir will
perform with international artists in the historic Salt Lake Tabernacle.
Featured guest artists include Frederica von Stade on February 9, Richard
Stoltzman on February 16 and Evelyn Glennie on March 9.

Enjoy! and check CultureFinder.com when making all your travel plans.
