Natural Gas Futures Driven Lower by Lack of Fundamentals=20

Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.13 to $2.106 per =
MMBtu yesterday on mild weather and a continuing huge storage inventory. Th=
e March contract lost $0.118 to $2.118 per MMBtu. Contracts were in contang=
o with each succeeding month more expensive than the prior month. There's a=
 lack of support across the board. Cash prices will likely weaken more by t=
he weekend ahead of next Tuesday's February contract expiration with foreca=
sts again predicting above normal temperatures for the next two weeks acros=
s most of the nation. A general lack of fundamentals and technical weakness=
 should pressure the market below $2 soon. This weeks AGA storage report is=
 expected to show a 130  140 Bcf withdrawal. Anything less and the market c=
ould looking at $1.70 per MMBtu by expiration. As storage operators face re=
quirements to release volumes out of storage, that extra gas hitting the ma=
rket could force prices down quickly. Natural gas for next day delivery acr=
oss the US! and Canada was generally $0.20  $0.40 lower yesterday. Natural =
gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.23 to $2.18 per MMBtu.=

Enrons Assets Being Sold Off=20

Now that Enron's energy trading business, which produced about 90% of the i=
ts $100 billion of sales in 2000, has been sold to UBS for no cash and a sh=
are of future profits, the rest of the companys assets are being sold off t=
o pay creditors a small portion of over $40 billion that they are owed. Alt=
hough company officials have said they are committed to keeping the core in=
tact, it is slowly being dismembered and there may be little left to reorga=
nize. Enron claimed assets of more than $50 billion in its bankruptcy filin=

d derivative contracts that Enron entered into before filing for bankruptcy=
 were estimated to be worth up to $8 billion last month, but now it says th=
e about 700 open position are worth about $1.3 billion. It is seeking court=
 permission to settle the contracts to raise cash. Since it collapsed, Enro=
n has sold about $520 million of contracts and assets and lost control of i=
ts $2.7 bi! llion Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, but is contesting Dynegy's=
 rights to the pipeline. As part of its plans to emerge from bankruptcy, En=
ron wants to place litigation against it in a trust and raise between $4 - =
$6 billion by selling assets in Latin America and Asia. Centrica Plc has ag=

Enron could also ask the bankruptcy judge to allow the $2.98 billion sale o=

Enron's Dabhol Project Nears Auction Block

Lenders to Enrons $2.9 billion Dabhol Power in India are set to put it on t=
he auction block, with 6 major companies likely to express interest. The pl=
ant has been idle since last June after a dispute over the cost of the powe=
r for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Due dilig=
ence is expected to begin early next month, with a possible deadline of the=
 middle of March for submitting offers. Interested foreign companies are Sh=
ell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, =
Tata Power and Gas Authority of India. Publicity which focused on Enron's p=
roblems in India has given the country's image a black eye as a safe place =
to invest. Some in India claim that Enron coerced and hoodwinked a freshly =
elected state government into signing off on a power project it had previou=
sly tried to stop. The World Bank, which refused to fund the project, said =
it was too large, too costly and the terms were slanted in Enrons favor. Ma=
harashtras! demand for energy did not rise as expected and meanwhile, the d=
evaluation of the Indian rupee and climbing prices for naphtha raised the p=
rice of power production. Enron owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bech=
tel each own 10% and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%. Those int=
erested in acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in ear=
nest money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders ma=
y bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data room w=

Debt Rating Agencies Considering Reforms

Following complaints by investors, analysts and lawmakers that Moody's, S?a=
nd Fitch were too slow to downgrade Enron, the credit agencies have all sai=
d they are considering reforms that would speed up their review process for=
 altering a company's ratings. The changes could lead ratings to become mor=
e volatile and affect stock and bond prices. It could also raise the cost o=
f  borrowing for companies that need cash. Fitch and Moodys have said they =
may eliminate outlooks, meant to be a guideline of a rating's possible futu=
re direction. There will now be more rating changes that are multiple notch=
es and corporate ratings will become more volatile and lower than they have=
 been over the last decade. The agencies have already changed their criteri=
a for the assessment of a companys ratings. All are taking a closer look at=
 rating triggers and a companys ability to raise needed cash. This month, t=
he agencies downgraded Kmart, which has now filed for bankruptcy, several n=
otches i! n a matter of days. Moodys rated Kmarts debt as investment-grade =
a little more than a month ago. Moody's put Calpine on review for only one =
day before lowering its debt rating. It also kept Ford on review for only 5=
 days before downgrading its debt. The effects of the Enron collapse could =
hurt other companies facing a cash crunch by subjecting them to more string=

PanCanadian to Spend C$1.7 Billion This Year

PanCanadian Energy plans to spend C$1.7 billion in 2002 to increase both it=

xpenditures will be directed at natural gas projects with C$430 million spe=
nt on prospects in Canada's East Coast offshore region, the deepwater Gulf =
of Mexico and the North Sea. PanCanadian plans to drill 1,800 wells this ye=
ar, down from about 2,150 in 2001. Last had major offshore and internationa=
l exploration successes, with preliminary results showing that it replaced =
about 170% of production. Oil production is expected to decline by 5% year =
over year, although phase one work on the Christina Lake oil sands project =
will be completed early this year, and has the potential to add significant=
 reserves and production in the medium term. PanCanadian also is evaluating=
 production options with its partners at its Buzzard oil project in the Nor=
th Sea. PanCanadians share of the discovery is more than 180 million barrel=

PNM Plans to Retire Transmission Line Debt

Public Service Company of New Mexico has asked the New Mexico Public Regula=
tion Commission for authority to enter into a transaction that would cause =
the retirement of $27 million of Secured Facility Bonds due 2012. The propo=
sed transaction will reduce PNM's long-term debt and give the company major=
ity ownership of the 216-mile long Eastern Interconnection Project line, wh=
ich connects PNM and the Western US with the West Texas electrical grid. PN=
M entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in 1985 that allowed the compan=
y to levelize the EIP's cost to PNM and its customers over the lease period=
. The proposal would result in the redemption on April 1, 2002 of the Secur=
ed Facility Bonds at a price of $1054.30 per $1000 principal plus accrued i=
nterest to April 1, 2002.=20
