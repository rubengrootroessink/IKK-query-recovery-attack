Dear Former CTS  Subscriber,
=20
     Welcome to your new  Family?Welcome to Vestec.  By now you should have=
 received  the letter from Nick Van Nice explaining to you that Trader Tech=
 University  (TTU) was successful in acquiring the assets and products of t=
he former  CTS.  He also mentioned that yours truly, Dr. Goldman, of the Co=
ach's  Corner, will be leading Vestec, and the parent company (TTU),  to an=
 amazing future.
=20
     Before I lead you through  the journey of what is to come, and how it'=
s going to affect your finances and  your life, please allow me to introduc=
e myself to those who have not read The  Coach's Corner, or may not be fami=
liar with Oscar Goldman.  Those of you  who have read The Coach's Corner al=
ready know that I am a 'no nonsense', let's  get to the truth, 'show me the=
 money', kind of guy.  You will also  remember, from past experience, that =
I will never tell you what you want to  hear, bur rather always tell you wh=
at you need to hear.  If you talk with  any one of a whole lot of TTU stude=
nts who have gone through our training  programs, they will always tell you=
 the same thing?This man IS tough, but you  sure don't want to go through a=
ny trading battle without  him.
=20
     So, why do I tell  you all this?  It's because you need to know that a=
ny  company that I start, or acquire in this industry, is strictly done out=
 of  SELF-defense.  Let me explain?Just like a good number of you, I have b=
een  trading for a long time (17 years to be exact), and just like you I we=
nt through  the school of 'hard knocks', even though I started out with big=
 hopes and  dreams.  And just like most of you, in the beginning I lost my =
butt.   So, out of self defense, and being sick and tired of being told wor=
thless  information, that seemed ok in the beginning, because I didn't know=
 any better,  I decided to start the school that I would want to go to - a =
process that truly  took me from beginner to advanced trader/investor.  And=
 I'm very proud and  grateful to say that Trader Tech University has become=
 the  premier training institute in the world.  I can say that with a great=
 deal  of confidence because the proof is in many of our students' bank acc=
ounts.   Now that you have a picture of who I am, and what we already have,=
 let me tell  you where we're going, and why Vestec.
=20
     About two years ago, I was  invited to take a tour of the CTS offices =
in Florida, before I decided whether  or not to write The Coach's Corner.  =
At that time, Nick  Van Nice shared with me that CTS was owned by a group o=
f investors (as in  investment capital), rather than a group  of traders, w=
hich I found very curious, considering the fact they had some of  the best =
tools in the industry.  I now know that a lot of the credit had to  go to N=
ick Van Nice, his father before him, and the group of talented people who  =
helped him run the company.  Amazingly enough, it was at that time that I  =
heard that 'little voice' (we all seem to experience this at one time or an=
other  in our lives) that told me that my involvement was going to be much =
bigger than  just writing a column.  I will tell you more about the details=
 of this  story when I see you face to face, but for now, rest assured  tha=
t what happened in the ensuing two years was nothing short of  miraculous. =
 Because the tools that Joe Van Nice started building more than  20 years a=
go were the last missing pieces of the puzzle in my mind that create -  alo=
ng with the other pieces that were there in the TTU company - the perfect  =
command center for the knowing trader/investor - my original  mission was a=
ccomplished.
=20
     So, how does all this  benefit you greatly?  It's simple, really.  I h=
ave  recruited and trained the finest team of Generals you would ever want =
to take to  battle (the Markets).  We have assembled the finest simulator i=
n the world  (TTU).  We have acquired, refined, and reassembled the  finest=
 tools and weaponry around (Vestec).  And, we have  assembled the finest bl=
ow-by-blow, real time action plan, which continues to put  us on top time a=
nd time again (Power Trade Signals).  And  now, you even have a Coach, who =
will help you put it all together, and hopefully  keep you from getting hur=
t, or hurting yourself.
=20
     The only decision  you have to make, at this point, is whether you wan=
t to be on this  battle ship we have assembled, or facing it.  If you knew =
what I know, you  would know that you want to be on it, because God help th=
ose who will be facing  it.  Those of you who were a part of CTS in the pas=
t will be allowed to  join without going through 'boot camp'.  You will be =
given an amazing  enrollment package.  You must, however, respond**to this =
email within the next 72 hours, with  your updated and accurate contact inf=
ormation.  In order for me to send you  the package to 'grandfather' you in=
to Vestec, again, I must  receive your timely and accurate information in o=
rder for us to send you this  amazing package that will also give you infor=
mation on my upcoming (critical)  face-to-face meeting with you.  The time =
has come?for  things to REALLY happen.  I will be talking with you again  v=
ery soon.
