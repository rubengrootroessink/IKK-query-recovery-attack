Helpful Hint: Take your lumps; just be sure they are  little lumps. Very successful traders generally have more losing trades than  winning trades. They don't have any hang-ups about admitting they're wrong, and  have the ability to close out losing positions  quickly.

If you would like to open an account  you can download an application  over the Internet or we  can mail you one today.

There is a significant risk of loss in  futures and options trading and is not suitable for  everyone.

Weekly Humor:  A Call From  Teacher
Sarah and Louise met for lunch the other day. While discussing  their
children, Sarah said, "My son's teacher called me last  night."
In a concerned tone, Louise replied, "Uh-oh! Is something  wrong?"
Sarah explained that the teacher had told her that her son was  failing
math.
"That's terrible!" said Louise, "Did she tell you what  to do to help him?"
"Yeah," said Sarah, "she told me to stop doing his  homework."
