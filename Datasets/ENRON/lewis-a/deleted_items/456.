1. Overall Sentiment

The popular averages traded higher in the first five days
of the market week for Jan. 7-11, confirming the so-called
January Barometer that says that if the first five trading
days are positive, then this bodes well for the remainder
of the year.

This doesn't mean that the popular averages won't
experience one or two relatively serious stumbling blocks
by the end of the last trading session of 2002.

During the past five days, the Standard & Poor's 600 Small
Cap Index reached an all-time high, giving further
confirmation that small cap stocks will reward investors in
2002.

But what about the Big Cappers such as Microsoft, IBM, Sun
Microsystems, Cisco Systems?

In my view, I figure these companies won't surprise Wall
Street by announcing that they've entered into Chapter 11
bankruptcy the way Enron and Exodus Communications did in
2001.

Of course, the speculators went after Enron and Exodus
after the bad news, figuring this is where we can make a
double, triple, much less God knows how rich we can get if
these companies actually come back from the abyss.

If this is all Wall Street has to offer in the year 2002:
speculating in busted companies and forget about an
economic recovery and all that such a concept implies, then
let's hope that more companies go bankrupt.

In other words, you buy them at 0.035 a share and sell them
at 0.07 a share and you've doubled your investment.

Still, that's a double, and who can argue with that?

Speaking of doubles, a lot of beaten up Internet stocks
from the 1998-2000 Era have doubled off the lows since the
9/11 Attack on America.

But will they be the 10-Baggers of 2002?


2. Observations

The price for a gallon of regular gasoline remained the
same: $1.07.99, since my last once-a-week taxi ride to the
supermarket.

Despite the attempts of OPEC to create a bull market in oil
futures, the February contract for West Texas Intermediate
Crude that trades at the New York Mercantile Exchange went
out at $19.68 a barrel on Friday, Jan. 11.

On Friday, Jan. 4, the nearby contract closed at $21.62 a
barrel.

That meeting between President George W. Bush and Russian
Premier Vladimir Putin last December is having its effects
on the international crude oil markets.

In my view, we're still dependent on oil and natural gas to
keep the U.S. economy humming, much less the rest of the
world.


3. A Visit to HQ In South Beach

This newsletter will be relatively short by default.

I was scheduled to show up at 123Jump.com headquarters at
407 Lincoln Rd. in Miami Beach on Monday afternoon, Jan.
14.

My CEO, Manish Shah, phoned me Friday evening, Jan. 11,
with instructions that I show up in Miami Beach sometime
Sunday, Jan. 13.

This is a situation of "you gotta do what you gotta do."

I want to apologize for not providing more "insight" that
some readers think I seem to possess in this week's
newsletter.

I compile the basic outline for this newsletter over the
weekend and then finish it on Mondays prior to publication
on Tuesday.


4. Sonny T. Crosses The Line

In my regular e-mail and telephone conservations with Sonny
T., the former International Business Machines employee
turned full-time trader, I have learned that he is filing
with the Internal Revenue Service for full-time trader
status.

That is a major step.

Basically, what it amounts to, for better or for worse, is
that one says, "I am a trader."

Still, as we all know, that climb up the mountain begins
with that first step.
