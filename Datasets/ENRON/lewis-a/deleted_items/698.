CYBER DIGITAL, Inc. (OTCBB:CYBD)

o A $250 Billion International Target Market

The tremendous growth of the Internet has revolutionized
the communications industry.  Today, the Internet connects
millions of people around the world who are able to share
information instantly without geographic boundaries. The
Internet is bound only by the voice network upon which it
resides; without this network in place users cannot take
advantage of powerful Internet applications.

 In developed countries, such as the United States, the
requisite voice network is already in place, hence the number
of Internet users is growing at unprecedented rates.  In
developing countries such as Nigeria, China, India and
Brazil, there is little or no basic voice network, leaving many
of these nations struggling to take part in the Internet
revolution.

The demand for Internet applications, such as distance
learning, municipal virtual private networks and
medical/emergency communications systems have induced
developing countries to aggressively invest in
communications infrastructure. These countries must first
build a basic voice network, the platform of the Internet,
before they can become part of this information revolution.

The total incremental information infrastructure spending is
projected to reach $1.5 trillion over the next ten years,
according to Pyramid Research.

The following table shows projected five-year information
infrastructure spending for selected countries:


Projected Information Infrastructure Investment by 2005

o A $32 Billion Domestic Market

According to International Data Corp. (IDC) the worldwide
Internet firewall market will grow to $11 billion by 2004.
IDC also projects that the investment in the US market for
network service provision by digital broadband means will
grow to $32 billion by 2003.

What is fueling these explosive growth estimates? The
answer is simple - the vast expansion of electronic
commerce (e-commerce); both business-to-business
commerce, and business-to-consumer commerce.

We are all familiar with the household names in e-commerce
like Dell Computer and Amazon.com. These businesses are
large enough and sophisticated enough to handle networking
and e-commerce technology largely on their own. But what
about small to medium size businesses? What about branch
offices of larger organizations? How will they survive and
compete in the e-commerce marketplace?

Much of the forecasted growth in firewall and digital
broadband markets will come from the tens of thousands of
small to medium-size enterprises that have historically lacked
the human resources to address e-commerce on their own
and the financial resources to acquire expensive
technological solutions. These businesses will require
vendor-partners who can help them with affordable, simple
"do-it-yourself" Internet solutions.

One company, which stands out as a potential leader in
voice and Internet switching industry with the vision and
strategy to leverage this tremendous telecommunications
growth opportunity is NY-based, Cyber Digital (OTCBB:
CYBD). Cyber Digital is a well-established
telecommunications company with:

* Agreements to market promote and sell its products
throughout Nigeria;

* a veteran management team;

* a firm grasp of the issues and opportunities of the
telecommunications market;

* a successful, synergistic alliance with telecommunications
giant AT&T;

* and a suite of affordable products and services to
complement its other strengths.

Priced at only $1.13 per share as of the market close on May
25, 2001 Cyber Digital, Inc. is unquestionably undervalued
and worth a closer look.

o A Brief History of Cyber Digital

Since its inception in 1983, Cyber Digital, Inc. has designed
and manufactured high-quality software controlled
distributed digital voice switching infrastructure systems for
public telephone network operators worldwide, especially for
developing countries.

Cyber Digital is also a leading software developer and
manufacturer of an array of high performance Internet
systems such as routers, gateways, firewalls and servers for
the creation of digital broadband and virtual private network
("VPN") services by Internet service providers (ISP).

The Company's voice and Internet systems incorporate
digital wireless transmission, which enable developing
countries to easily and rapidly deploy telecommunications
services to under-served consumers within months rather
than years. Such long years are typical of competitor's
monolithic voice-only centralized switches, which require
underground cabling infrastructure.

The Company believes that it is one of a very few, if not the
only, company in the world with proprietary technology of
distributed digital switching, ideally suited for the developing
countries.

In early 1999, the Company made the strategic decision to
expand and leverage its many years of telecommunications
experience by entering the broadband Internet products
market. Recognizing the enormous need and opportunity to
provide a comprehensive suite of e-business products to
small and medium size businesses, Cyber Digital has
developed a full set of Internet Protocol (IP) security, access
and storage products, in conjunction with its strategic
partner, AT&T.

o Recent Developments

--Expects to earn $0.52 per share for FYE 2002

In April 2001, Cyber Digital announced that it expects to
earn $0.52 per share for FYE 2002 from projected revenues
of $26 million generated from the Nigerian market.

Due to the Company's early mover advantage position in the
Nigerian market, it anticipates profitability in each of the last
three quarters of FYE 2002. In addition, the Company
expects to realize revenues from the digital wireless
telephone network projects in five Nigerian states in the
aggregate sum of $35 million, which have not been
incorporated in these projections.

"We feel that our Company's stock is highly under-valued
and does not reflect the true value of its technology and
growth potential. Once the Company has the resources, it
may buy-back its shares in the open market from time to
time," said J.C. Chatpar, Chairman of Cyber Digital, Inc.

--Received approval of its proposals to build digital wireless
telephone networks in five states of Nigeria.

In April 2001, Cyber Digital announced that it has received
approval of its proposals to build digital wireless telephone
networks in five states of Nigeria for an aggregate sum of
$35 million.

"Cyber Digital's wireless CDCO exchange was approved
based on its ability to rapidly deliver telephone service at
affordable network cost requiring no stranded capital," said
His Royal Highness Austin Ezenwa, Chairman of Sydney
Telecommunications. "Each of the five states has
appropriated capital for the implementation of Cyber
Digital's wireless telephone network."

"In addition to existing contracts, this accomplishment
signifies our long-term viability by capturing a significant
share of this market in early stages," said J.C. Chatpar,
Chairman of Cyber Digital, Inc. "We expect to engineer,
furnish and install these systems within the next twelve
months."

--Enters the $5 Billion Internet Firewall Appliance Market

In January 2001, Cyber Digital announced that the
Company is entering the $5 Billion Internet firewall
appliance market, with the introduction of its Cyber Firewall
(CFW) Series firewall appliances.

Cyber Digital Offers Simple Do-It-Yourself Installation
Software on Its Standalone IPSec Firewall Appliance For
B2B e-Commerce Secure Access and Virtual Private
Network Applications.

IPSec is an industry-wide standard for assuring the privacy,
integrity and authenticity of information crossing public IP
networks. Cyber Digital's CFW series firewalls offer simple
do-it-yourself installation software for even the most
complex IPSec-based security application. CFW - IPSec
provides a cost-effective way of creating an enterprise-wide
virtual private network (VPN) by enabling secure use of the
Internet. CFW - IPSec, based on Cyber Digital's proprietary
technology, is a standalone firewall appliance and is totally
independent of the customer's computing operating system
platform. It does not need to be integrated into customer's
environment by specialists, often a costly proposition.
Non-technical customers can easily install the CFW firewall
appliance. In addition, CFW series firewalls are fully
interoperable with Cisco Systems, Check Point Software
Technologies, and Nortel Networks firewalls. Cyber Digital's
CFW appliance type security offerings will facilitate the
secure access and implementation of VPNs for B2B
e-commerce companies.

"Our unique CFW series firewall appliance will be marketed
through major strategic partners or distributors on a
worldwide basis. The simplicity of implementing CFW in
any network will cause a profound impact on the firewall
market. As an Internet firewall appliance, it offers cost
savings in excess of 50% over competitors' offerings," said
J.C. Chatpar, Chairman of Cyber Digital, Inc.

According to International Data Corporation (IDC), the
worldwide Internet firewall market increased 32%, from
$3.0 billion to $3.98 billion during 1998 to 1999. Similar
growth is projected for the period 2000 to 2001, leading to a
worldwide market of $5 billion.

--Expands into the PABX market with CSX to government
institutions.

In January 2001, Cyber Digital jointly announced with
Sidney Telecommunications (Nigeria) Ltd. their expansion
into the PABX market.

"Demand for Cyber Digital's CSX PABX, by government
institutions, is overwhelming due to rapid growth of the
capital city of Abuja," said His Royal Highness Austin
Ezenwa, Chairman of Sydney Telecommunications. "On
behalf of Cyber Digital, Sydney Tel is expecting to receive a
blanket order for 10,000 CSX PABX lines from one of the
government institutions for a number of its offices. Sydney
Tel is confident that Cyber Digital's CSX PABX will
become a standard office telephone system among many
government institutions as it offers modern communications
features."

"We are pleased with Sydney Tel's efforts in expanding the
market for our CSX PABX product line," said J.C. Chatpar,
Chairman of Cyber Digital, Inc. "The initial order for 10,000
CSX lines reflects approximately $4 million in revenues."
Pursuant to the terms of the order, payment terms are: 50%
cash in advance, with the order, and 50% by irrevocable
letter of credit upon shipment.

--Enters the Nigerian Telecommunications Market

In November 2000, Cyber Digital, Inc. signed an agreement
with Sidney Telecommunications (Nigeria) Ltd., a private
company, to market, promote and sell Cyber Distributed
Digital Central Office Exchanges (CDCO), Cyber Tandem
Switch Exchanges (CTSX) and Cyber Switch PABX (CSX)
throughout Nigeria.

Under the terms of the agreement, Sydney
Telecommunications will also market Cyber Digital's
Exchanges to the Nigerian Telecommunications Ltd.,
(NITEL), the sole, government owned provider of public
switched telephone network services in Nigeria.

In order to enter the untapped Nigerian telecommunications
market, Cyber Digital, Inc. has already registered Cyber
Digital (Nigeria) Ltd., as its subsidiary and established its
offices in the capital city of Abuja. "With about 400,000
lines in operation, for a country with a population of 120
million people, the current telephone density is one of the
lowest in the world," said His Royal Highness Austin
Ezenwa, chairman of Sydney Telecommunications.
"NITEL's goal to increase telephone density through
deployment of two million lines by year 2003 can only be
achieved by Cyber Digital's unique technology that renders
rapid deployment coupled with affordability. Cyber Digital
will carve out a significant share of the Nigerian
telecommunications market as its digital switches are ideally
suited for developing countries."

"Demand for our CDCO and CTSX exchanges will increase
as NITEL places great effort in building its
telecommunications infrastructure," said J.C. Chatpar,
chairman of Cyber Digital, Inc. "We believe Cyber Digital
will be an important participant in the rapidly expanding
Nigerian telecommunications marketplace."

With the assistance of Sidney Telecommunications, Cyber
Digital has bid on a public tender issued by NITEL for the
supply and installation of 10,000 digital lines in the capital
city of Abuja. Pursuant to the bid requirements,
manufacturers of digital exchanges were exclusively
permitted to make an offer to NITEL. All such tenders were
publicly opened and results were announced at the corporate
headquarters of NITEL. Offers varied from low end of $26
million from Cyber Digital to high end of $65 million from
Siemens. Bids from Cyber Digital, Alcatel, Ericsson and
Siemens were the only bids technically qualified. While the
other three bidders were major European manufacturers,
Cyber Digital was the only American manufacturer to
qualify.

Payment terms are 15% cash advance upon contract award
and 85% by irrevocable letter of credit upon shipment of
digital exchanges. Supply and installation of digital
exchanges are expected to be completed within nine months.

--Made a strategic shift to enter the fast growing, lucrative
high-speed Internet access market.

During FYE 2000, the Company made a strategic shift to
enter the fast growing, lucrative high-speed Internet access
market. The Company rapidly developed its Cyber Business
Internet Gateway ("CBIG") and Cyber Internet Access
Network ("CIAN") switch. The Company forged an alliance
with AT&T Corporation to become a provider of high-speed
Internet access and to create Virtual Private Networks
("VPN") for businesses using Internet Protocol (IP)
"broadband" technology.

At the heart of Cyber Digital's unique set of product
offerings is its unique distributive voice and broadband
solutions, which offer many advantages over the traditional
voice and broadband approaches.

-Cyber Digital's Unique Distributive Voice Solution-

Current Telephone Network:
Building telecommunications infrastructure using traditional
monolithic centralized switching systems from multinational
suppliers poses tremendous financial constraints and
deployment time limitations because of outside plant
underground cabling.

Cyber Digital Wireless Network:
The modularity derived from the nodal structure of the
CDCO provides an economical digital switching exchange
from as low as a few hundred lines to over a million lines
capacity. In addition, it offers fully integrated local, tandem,
toll and transit exchange capabilities. The CDCO has
interfaces for digital microwave systems, digital copper wire
systems, digital radio relay systems, digital wireless systems,
fiber optic systems and satellite systems. The costs
associated with this approach is dramatically less than the
installation cost associated with laying fiber or copper on the
network side (material costs, right-of-way issues, and
regulatory obstacles).

-Cyber Digital's Unique Distributive Broadband Solution-

In the traditional broadband solution offered by most digital
broadband Internet Services Providers today, office
buildings are "daisy-chained" together with fiber or T1
wiring.  This results in "several hops to the POP."

This traditional solution has three inherent disadvantages:

1) a point of failure at each building in the chain;

2) security vulnerability at each building in the chain;  and

3) decreased network performance.

With Cyber Digital's innovative Distributive Broadband
solution, there is no daisy-chain.  Each office building is
connected directly by fiber or T1 lines to the AT&T POP,
i.e. there's only "one hop to the POP."

In bringing the Internet closer to the user, the Cyber Digital
solution offers enhanced performance, enhanced security,
and eliminates the disadvantage of multiple points of failure.

o Business &Financial Outlook

During the past two fiscal years, the Company was primarily
engaged in accelerated research and development activities
towards the creation of CBIG, CIAN, CFW, CNAME and
CWEB digital broadband systems and incurred losses of
approximately $2.0 and $1.1 million for FYE 2000 and
2001 respectively.

The Company anticipates to begin execution of NITEL's
$26 million contract to supply digital voice switches within
the next few months contemporaneous with the issuance of
15% cash in advance ($3.9 million) and an irrevocable
confirmed letter of credit for 85% ($22.1 million) of the full
contact amount. The Company will generate net revenue of
$21 million after deducting for local custom duties and
services provided by other vendors. The Company expects
EBITDA of $10.5 million from this project in FYE 2002.

Since, the Company has $14 million loss carryforward, the
effective income tax rate for FYE 2002 is expected to be 0%
instead of 39%.

Year Ending March 31              2001E            2002E

Net Sales ($000)                          $38             $26,000
Net Income (Loss) ($000)         (1,117)             10,500
EPS ($)                                        (0.06)                 0.52
Avg. Shares Outstanding (000)   20,162             20,162

The Company has no long-term debt

Moreover, Cyber Digital's forecasts portend a market
capitalization of approximately $608 million by the end of
fiscal year 2003. Assuming a projected 20.5 million shares
outstanding at that time, that would suggest a stock price in
the range of $29.00-30.00 per share.

This is a challenging time in the high-tech sector, but the
New Economy is here to stay. Predicting the winners and
losers in the New Economy is difficult, but the winners will
undoubtedly require the right vision, the right investments,
the right products, and the right timing. We believe that
Cyber Digital has articulated a strong vision, made astute
investments, and entered the e-business marketplace with a
strong suite of products at a perfect time. The initial results
of Cyber Digital's efforts show excellent potential. We
encourage you to take a close look at this promising
company?
