AMCC and Plexus Announce Design Partnership=1DPlexus Announces Completion
of OC-192 Reference Design Resulting From Partnership

SAN DIEGO and NEENAH, Wis., May 31, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Applied
Micro Circuits Corporation (AMCC) (Nasdaq: AMCC) and Plexus Corp. (Nasdaq: =
PLXS)
announced today that they have entered into a strategic design partnership.=
 AMCC
is the leader in high-bandwidth silicon connectivity solutions for the worl=
d's
optical networks. Plexus is a leading provider of product development, desi=
gn,
manufacturing and testing services to the electronics industry.

The reference design partnership gives Plexus early access to AMCC's leadin=
g
edge optical networking components, along with pre-release of technical
information and direct access to AMCC's technical staff. In exchange, Plexu=
s has
demonstrated the interoperability of AMCC's optical networking components,
incorporating them into a reference design that supports OC-192, OC-48, OC-=
12,
OC-3 and DS-3 bandwidths on a single, configurable card. The reference desi=
gn
will be unveiled by Plexus at the Supercomm show in Atlanta, June 5-7.

Brent Little, senior vice president of marketing for AMCC, said "We have be=
en
extremely impressed with the design skills of the Plexus engineers. In just=
 six
weeks, they developed and prototyped a first class reference design using
several of our industry-leading optical components. The reference design
demonstrates the interoperability of our devices, and makes it easy to
incorporate AMCC components into end products."

"Using this reference design, we can accelerate our customers' time to mark=
et",
added Bob Kronser, executive vice president and chief technology and strate=
gy
officer of Plexus. "By combining a broad spectrum of AMCC's optical compone=
nts
with our best-in-class optical networking design, manufacturing and test
expertise, we have created a proven solution for OC-3 to OC-192 bandwidths.
Customers can come to Plexus to leverage our reference design, rather than
investing the time and money in reinventing what we have available today."

Plexus has additional optical reference design projects planned, including =
a
reference design incorporating AMCC's OC-768 products.

Plexus will be displaying its OC-192 reference design at Supercomm in booth
number 8416.
