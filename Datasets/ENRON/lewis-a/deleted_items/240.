OPTIONS COURSE WORTH UP TO $5,000 IS YOURS 
FREE FOR A LIMITED TIME
Dear Investor,
Investors tell me all the time they'd love to use options as 
an investment tool, but they just don't know enough about
them to get started. That's a terrible shame, because investors 
who don't use options - at least from time to time - are 
depriving themselves of an incredibly powerful tool.
Many people think only aggressive speculators and gamblers
use options, but nothing could be further from the truth. Options 
were originally intended as a hedging tool. They were designed
to give investors the ability to trade some upside profits in 
exchange for downside protection.
You see, most investors invest in stocks as if they were sure 
things. They buy a stock believing it's going straight up. The 
very act of buying a stock is a 100% bet that it's going to rise. 
When you're long the stock, you're betting that there is 
absolutely no chance that the stock is going to tank. You 
literally have no downside protection. In a market like the 
one we're in right now, this is like playing Russian roulette 
with 6 bullets in a 6 shooter!
This is why I often tell investors: If you're not using options 
to hedge your stock positions, you're playing with fire and 
depriving yourself of one of the most powerful investment 
tools you could ever harness.
Learning how to use options correctly to invest or speculate 
can be an exorbitantly expensive thing to do. In fact, one of 
this country's best-known option "experts" actually charges 
$5,000 for a simple "introductory" 3-day seminar. I think 
that kind of money for an introductory course is ridiculous.
Finally, an options course that's easy, fun, and completely
interactive. It's like having your own private options tutor!
We've recently completed construction on the most extensive
options trading course available anywhere in the world. It's 
now available - FREE - on the Internet.
This online course is perfect for the beginner. It's perfect for

describing and linking to the topics available on the Web site 
that week. You may not skip ahead to future weeks in the 
course but you may go back and review any of the material 
from the weeks you've completed. These lessons take just a
few hours to read and include a voluntary self-test to reinforce 
what you've learned. While you're not obligated to take any 
exam, students who complete the final will become Certified
