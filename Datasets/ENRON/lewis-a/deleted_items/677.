TOP STORY: Now that smaller competitors have fallen by the
wayside, ISPs like AOL have been boosting rates. That may be
good news for weary investors in the short term, but is a
rate hike a smart move for the long run?

Is greed good for AOL and other ISPs?

Catch of the Day: Listen and understand

Streaming video may be a bust from a business perspective,
but that doesn't stop companies from trying to innovate. For
example, this week I met with Tim Sibley, the founder of
StreamSage. His product listens to the words in audio or
video files, then compiles custom sets of clips in response
to search queries.

The product glues together speech-recognition technology
from SRI, Cycorp's syntactic and semantic processors, and
StreamSage's own code. In a demo, the system delivered good
responses to search queries against a video of a Qwest
shareholders meeting. The system matches concepts, not just
words, and it picks good times to start and end a clip,
unlike some systems that just target a word and pad a fixed
buffer of content on either side of it.

Tim has visions of a world in which consumers, perhaps on
some future TiVo, can compile completely custom programs.
Fortunately, reason prevails and his current plan is to sell
StreamSage to enterprises, like those with large libraries
of training videos.

StreamSage's technical advantages notwithstanding, it is
underfunded and up against established competitors,
including Virage, Convera, and MediaSite. In other words,
its 18 employees are acquisition bait. But who's buying?
