take profits +8 percent _XAU.X short as the stochastic lines have completed navigation from overbought to oversold.  given that _XAU has essentially vibrated more than it has surfed, flat seems the way to pump the board.

_XAU not out of the woods let by any stretch having taken out key support at 52.  52 figured as support in july, early aug, mid oct and gets breached here.  so, if _XAU traces back up to near 52 level it would be one of the best short opps on gold offered in many moons.

as far as potentials for tonights NBA matchups on sportsbook.com, what stands out is the under @196 boston/atlanta in a 2 Team parlay with the under @190 memphis/cleveland.  $100 pays $260.  one might also take boston and give 8 points on a straight wager given that atlanta has lost its last 21 road games in a row.  the pistons have been on a roll.  tempting are those 7 1/2 points being offered against philly.

recommended _XAU.X Short on Nov 2 2001 when it was trading at 54 1/2. Since then it's gone down 8.28% to 50 1/8.
