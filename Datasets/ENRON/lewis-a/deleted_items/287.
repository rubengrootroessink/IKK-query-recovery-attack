    Yo-Yo Weather Patterns     One unique feature of the United States is t=
hat it is the perfect distance across to have two extremes of weather in th=
e wintertime.   Advertisement  Click to learn more...      The United State=
s is roughly 3000 miles from coast to coast and by coincidence, the jet str=
eam has an average wavelength of about 3000 miles as well. (Wavelength is t=
he distance between the ridges and the troughs of a wave and the jet stream=
 is really just a series of waves in the flow of air around the earth.) Thi=
s means that many times during the year, the west coast will have a trough,=
 or cold pattern and the east coast will have a ridge, or warm pattern or v=
isa versa.    This winter has been no exception. In December, the jet strea=
m pattern had a large trough in the west. This spread cold air and heavy sn=
ows to the areas west of the Mississippi. Many ski areas are enjoying great=
 ski conditions and the Olympic venues in Utah are extremely happy. Back ea=
st, it was a different story. Many ski slopes in the Appalachians did not o=
pen before Christmas and did not see any snow or even make snow. In fact, s=
ome of the major cities in the east had the latest first freeze ever record=
ed.  As you read this, big shifts have occurred. Over the week of Christmas=
 the jet stream amplitude reversed and the east had the trough and the ridg=
e shifted west. This finally brought a real shot of winter to the east and =
happiness to the ski slope operators. Shifts like this are common and most =
winters have at least one such major shift in the jet stream each year. Thi=
s year was no exception. What is in our future? It is likely we will see an=
other shift or two to keep the temperatures across the country acting like =
a yo-yo.  The new WeatherBug 3.0 offers some great ways to follow the chang=
