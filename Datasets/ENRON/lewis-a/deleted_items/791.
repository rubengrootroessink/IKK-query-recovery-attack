 companies who help pay the cost of providing  this public service to milli=
ons of people across the country.  With the help of our sponsors, we now se=

  with TV and radio, advertising is what keeps WeatherBug  free.     But  w=

rs in an effort  to better understand their likes and dislikes. With your  =
responses, we can do a better job of finding advertisers  who have products=
 and services you might be interested  in. Thanks in advance for participat=
ing in these surveys.  It's all about keeping the WeatherBug free for every=
one,  and we hope it makes the advertising you see more relevant  to you.  =
