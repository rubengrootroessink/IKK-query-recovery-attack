Markets awaiting for some news to take a direction
Now that the markets have entered the confession season, traders and 
investors are hesitating to take any positions. It is important to note most 
of the analysts continue to express concern about the US economy and 
the quality of US corporate earnings. The cautious outlook and the 
uncertainty have led to range bound trading in the past few sessions. 
Monday all major indices finished the session slightly higher thanks to the 
strength in oil and energy stocks. Dow Jones added 71 points, Nasdaq 
Composite tacked on $6 1/2 points and the S&P 500 index finished the 
session higher by 6 points.
Over the past 5 months the Federal Reserve has been aggressively 
lowering interest rates to boost the sagging US economy. However, 
according to some analysts the effects of 2 1/2 points cut is still far from 
reflecting in the immediate economic reports. Now that the US economy 
may be nearing a bottom, some analysts are concerned about the possibility 
of other economies around the globe starting to slowdown. These concerns 
are driving technology stocks further lower.

markets bottomed in early April. In the past 2 months, this sector has gained 
over 30% and closed Monday's session at a 4-month high. Given that many

this sector include Affymetrix Inc (AFFX - gained almost 5 points on Monday 
and closed at a two month high), Genzyme General (GENZ - closed Monday's
