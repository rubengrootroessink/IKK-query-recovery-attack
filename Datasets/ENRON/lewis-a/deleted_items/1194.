uityAlert.com.     Semiconductor Sector Fails To Break Through Resistance -=
 Commentary Part 2     (RealTimeTraders.com) - Wednesday we alerted readers=
 the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector index was testing an important resis=
tance level. After being unable to break through this resistance level over=
 the past 4 sessions, the index steadily pulled back on Wednesday and close=
d at the worst level of the day. On the session the index lost 34 points or=
 7.4% and closed at 428.  Given that a slew of semiconductor related compan=
ies including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Texas Instruments (TXN) repo=
rted negative earnings after the close on Wednesday should further pressure=
 this index on Thursday. Another stock to watch on the downside within this=
 sector is Micron Technology (MU). According to a Dataquest, Inc. report, D=
RAM revenues are once again expected to decline in 2002. In 2001 DRAM reven=
ues are expected to drop by 67%, and in 2002 DRAM revenues are expected to =
drop another 19%. Since Micron Technology's main product line is in the DRA=
M arena, it could come under some pressure.  Copyright(c) 2001 RealTimeTrad=
