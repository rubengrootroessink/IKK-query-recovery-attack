 IPOs: Used To Abuse   Yesterday, Credit Suisse First Boston, one of the mo=
st respected firms on Wall Street said it will pay U.S. securities regulato=
rs $100 million to settle charges of using abusive practices to allocate sh=
ares in initial public offerings (IPOs).    In a statement issued by Stephe=
n Cutler, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, "CSFB improperly t=
ook advantage of its position as underwriter by allocating shares of hot IP=
Os to customers who agreed to share their IPO profits by paying excessive c=
ommissions."    CSFB made $718 million underwriting technology IPOs in 1999=
 and 2000.  The firm will pay a $30 million fine and hand over $70 million =
in profit to resolve charges of "abusive IPO allocation practices". The SEC=
 and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers alleged that CSFB illegally p=
rofited on hot IPOs by charging commissions of as much as $3.15 a share, co=
mpared with a typical rate of 6 cents.   The SEC also is probing whether fi=
rms such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Robertson Stephens and J.P. Morg=
an, received pledges from customers to purchase more stock after IPOs began=
 trading.    The large investment banks' pain will most certainly turn out =
to be a gain for some.  Our next profile is one of the beneficiaries of not=
 going through a traditional IPO.  We are extremely proud to have found thi=
s gem.  The company will be going public through an RTO, and it will open f=
or trading on the American Stock Exchange. Unfortunately we do not have an =
exact date on this new issue but it is safe to say that the first week of F=
ebruary will be the time frame for the stock to open for trading. You can l=
earn more about RTOs in our January 16th edition  of the SmallCap Digest.  =
 We cannot announce the name of the company at this time but we can tell yo=
u it is a medical device manufacturer already generating significant sales =
in the U.S. and abroad. The company expects to turn cash flow positive this=
 year and has a tremendous pipeline of products. This company is a "pick & =
shovel" entity that is helping to power the biotech revolution.    This com=
pany has already been featured on a special segment on Good Morning America=
.  In addition, their shareholders include some of the smartest money on th=
e planet. Because this company will not be going public through the traditi=
onal IPO, all open market investors will be on an equal playing field once =
the stock begins trading.    The even playing field provided by an RTO is a=
 breath of fresh air in an industry marred with improprieties.  The SmallCa=
p Digest will immediately send out our profile on the company once it is op=
ened for trading. For the most up to date alert on this new profile, we sug=
gest our subscribers visit our home page. There we will provide the name, s=
ymbol and current quote of the company the moment the stock begins trading.=
    Remember that although all the facts and figures will be provided to yo=
u so that you may make an informed investment decision, you should still ma=
ke an effort to confirm all information through independent third party sou=
rces, i.e. the SEC Edgar filings and the company's web site.     =09
