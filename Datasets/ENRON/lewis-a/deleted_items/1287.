1.	Introduction

This week, the Big Chart takes a holiday-focus with rise in
the ranking of Food/Meat-Poultry {.FMP}.  Also, oil prices
have been dropping, which is good news for holiday travelers,
but bad news for oil-related stocks - as is evidenced by the
steep decline in rank for Energy/Oil-Gas {.OIL} and
Energy/Oil-Gas/Refiner {.ORF}.

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Food/Meat-Poultry {.FMP} has been one of the hottest groups
as of late, with several stock exhibiting short-term upward
trends.  The largest of these is Tyson Foods {TSN}, which
has appreciated by 23 percent since October 26.  Three
separate trends are aiding the industry.  First, cattle
futures hit a 2-1/2 year last Monday, November 12, because
the slowing economy and the sharp drop in business travel
has hurt demand.  Meat processors have responded by
slaughtering fewer cattle and feedlot operators have cut
back on purchases of young herds.  Conversely, chicken
prices rose throughout the summer as supply dropped and
demand rose, partially because of the increased popularity
of buffalo wings.  Finally, a temporary ban on U.S. poultry
by Japan and Korea was expected to be lifted late last week
after no evidence of avian influenza virus was found on a
Connecticut chicken farm, according to Bloomberg News.
Beef and pork futures did begin to rebound late last week on
anticipation that Americans would tire of turkey in the
week's following the Thanksgiving holiday, thus causing
higher demand for steaks and pork chops.

Broadcasting {.BRO} has been making a sharp resurgence on the
Big Chart during the past four weeks with its rank jumping
from the 19th percentile to the 67th percentile.
Expectations that the economy will turnaround next year is
sparking buying interest in stocks such as Univision {UVN},
Fisher Communications {FSCI}, and Paxson Communications
{PAX}.  Also aiding these stocks is the travel slump, which
will result in more people staying home this holiday weekend
and therefore, watching television.  On a related note,
Ackerley Group {AK} rose after the FCC approved its pending
merger with Clear Channel Communications {CCU}.

Other groups with rising rankings include
Building/Homebuilding {.BHO},  Computer/Computer Services
{.DSE}, Electronics/Semiconductors {.ESE},
Finance/Securities {.SEC}, Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE},
Retail/Stores/Specialty {.RSP}, and Vehicles/Mobile-Modular
Homes {.MOB}.

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Just in time for the holiday travel season, oil prices hit a
2-1/2 year low on Thursday, helping to cheapen prices at the
pump.  An inability among OPEC and non-OPEC nations to agree
on production cuts caused oil prices to close on Thursday at
$17.45.  Oil prices did rise on Friday, however, over
speculation that an agreement would be reached before the
end of the year, but stocks in Energy/Oil-Gas {.OIL} and
Energy/Oil-Gas/Refiner {.ORF} are still down notably.
Evidence of this drop can be seen in the ranking of
Energy/Oil-Gas, which fell from the 80th percentile to the
28th percentile in a matter of one week.  Stocks affected
include Vintage Petroleum {VPI}, Pioneer Natural Resources
{PXD}, Noble Affiliates {NBL}, Apache {APA}, and Devon
Energy {DVN}.

Other groups with declining rankings include Banks/Savings &
Loan {.BSL}, Chemicals/Agricultural {.CAG}, Drugs/Ethical
{.DET}, Finance/Insurance/Life-Health {.ILH},
Food/Serving/Fast Foods {.FFF}, Machinery/Containers/Paper
{.CPA}, and Vehicles/Auto Rental-Service {.ARS}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

The holiday shopping season starts in earnest this weekend
with busiest days of the year for the retail industry.  The
two major questions that analysts will be looking for answers
on are how heavy will traffic be and how dependent will
stores be on promotional pricing to move merchandising.  Most
expected a heavier than average dependence on promotional
pricing (good news for shoppers), but better than expected
store traffic could send retailing stocks higher.  Investors
may to note that expectations over an economic turnaround
have already resulted in buying pressure among stocks in
Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE} and Retail/Stores/Specialty
{.RSP} during the past few weeks.
