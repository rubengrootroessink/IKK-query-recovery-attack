 When Hell Freezes Over   That was the overwhelming reply from experts when=
 asked when Amazon.com (AMZN ) will show a profit.  This past Wednesday the=
 company reported $1.12 billion in sales during the last three months of 20=
01, a 15 percent increase over the $972 million recorded in the same period=
 a year earlier. International sales grew an impressive 81 percent.   [IMAG=
E]The biggest surprise was that earnings came in at $5 million, or a penny =
per share.  Who said pennies were obsolete? That one penny of profit per sh=
are helped push the company up over 42% for the week.  Could this be the be=
ginning of the internet renaissance?  Has the time come for internet compan=
ies to show the world that they are real companies with business models tha=
t can make money? Well, we won't go that far.   The past two years has been=
 dismal for internet land. Thousands of internet companies sunk faster than=
 the Titanic.  Famous flameouts such as Pets.com, Webvan and eToys became t=
he butts of every dotcom joke.  When Jay Leno makes fun of internet compani=
es than you know things are really bad.  However, at some point the laws of=
 Darwin were bound to take over the internet sector.   A look at today's st=
ock market shows just a few dotcoms.  Some will inevitably burn through the=
 remaining cash that was raised during the happy go lucky IPO period.  Othe=
rs will be acquired or just perish.  What people maybe missing is that ther=
e will be survivors that make it.  Some will actually thrive and develop in=
to very strong companies.  Ultimately, the internet has made life more conv=
enient for the masses. The challenge is to make this convenience into somet=
hing people will pay for.   So who will be the survivors?  There are approx=
imately total 65 companies with a .com still in their names that are tradin=
g in the major indexes (NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ).  One of the most promising dot=
coms is once high flier Stamps.com (STMP ). [IMAGE]  If you don't know alre=
ady, the company allows people to print postage from their printer.  All yo=
u need is a PC, an internet connection and a free downloadable software pro=
gram.  Stamps.com makes money by charging a monthly recurring "convenience =
fee". The service launched in October of 1999 and currently they about 300,=
000 clients.   The company is currently trading near its 52-week high at $4=
.25 but far from the $90 per share it once traded at.  Stamps.com's market =
capitalization is at a very rich $215 million dollars but with over $194 mi=
llion in cash and cash equivalents the valuation is justified.    CEO Ken M=
cBride who was the former CFO, took over the top spot in August 2001.  He h=
as been with the company since its pre IPO days.  Once Ken became the new C=
EO, the first thing he did was to cut costs across the broad.  Capital pres=
ervation was the only way for the company to survive long term.  The monthl=
y burn rate was reduced from a loss of $11 million per month to a break eve=
n business by the end of 2001.   Going forward, Stamps.com has a product co=
de named Net-Stamps that is in beta trial with the U.S. Postal Service.  If=
 this product is approved then users can print generic sheets of stamps rig=
ht off of their printers. Net-Stamps should help the company boost the numb=
er of customers because the current Internet postage software is designed m=
ore for heavy users.  For some customers it is inconvenient to get online a=
nd purchase postage every time postage is needed if the volume is minimal. =
  The recent Anthrax scare has increased interest in the company by governm=
ent agencies. The Internet postage has a unique digital signature on each p=
iece of mail that is traceable to the sender.  A push by the USPS for Inter=
net postage would be an enormous catalyst for the company.   One of the big=
gest potential clients for Stamps.com could be the direct mail industry.  T=
he general public is much more reluctant to open any mail that is unsolicit=
ed.  However, if the Internet postage became a seal of quality or assurance=
 it could help the industry tremendously.   There are other players in the =
industry but over 80% of the market is dominated by Stamps.com.  The compan=
y has a boat load of cash and expects to achieve profitability the first qu=
arter of 2002.   The company has done an excellent in executing initiatives=
 that will guarantee its survival.  Although Wall Street no longer follows =
the company, people are beginning to take notice of Stamps.com.  If the com=
pany is able to achieve profitability this quarter then we can officially i=
nduct it into the dotcom Hall Of Fame. =09
