Can Audience-Based Buying and Selling Work?

Growing numbers of Web buyers and sellers are beginning to
think about implementing audience-based advertising online.

Sustainable Ad-Supported Content

with fewer strong players that can offer unique
opportunities to their advertisers.

Dancing to the Tune of State Regulations

Wine and song may naturally go together, but Geerlings
&
Wade has to do a complicated song-and-dance routine
to
avoid being tripped up by state liquor regulations. The
wine distributor is quick on its feet, though, and carries
off its email campaigns gracefully and efficiently.

I'm a Junkie

It started out innocently enough in a typical suburban
middle-class setting. Peter saw others doing it. He tried
it. And he was hooked. He made it part of his business. Now
it's a part of his life. It's too late to change now. Some
things, you just have to live with.

your site are women? Yep, many...
