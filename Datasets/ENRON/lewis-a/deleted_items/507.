1.  Introduction

Volatility may be higher than average in both the equity and
fixed income markets next week, because of the start of
earnings season and the release of key economic reports.  The
two key factors determining the direction of both markets
will be whether earnings growth will resume later this year
and whether the economy is beginning to rebound.  Equity
valuations and portfolio allocation will be on the mind of
traders in both markets.

2.	Earnings Releases

Earnings season starts next week with over 550 companies
scheduled to report results.  Many of these companies are
leaders in their respective industries and their
forward-looking comments will be closely monitored.  Better
than expect outlooks for 2002 will carry a lot of weight,
particularly since many traders are looking for evidence to
justify the prevailing valuations priced into many stocks.

Companies with market capitalizations in excess of $25
billion scheduled to report earnings next week are presented
in the table below.

3.	Economic Releases

The fixed income markets could show higher than average
volatility next week, particularly with the release of some
key economic reports.  Tuesday brings the December CPI
numbers; indications that inflation remains under control
will allow the Fed to cut interest rates further.
Conversely, an unexpected decrease in CPI will renew fears of
a deflation.  November business inventories should show a
further drop, helping to boost optimism of a forthcoming
recovery in the manufacturing sectors.  Finally, the
University of Michigan will release its preliminary December
consumer confidence survey results.  The consensus calls for
another monthly improvement in sentiment.

Economic releases scheduled for next week are listed in the
table below.
