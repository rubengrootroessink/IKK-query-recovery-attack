 the thrill of  gambling, you'll probably lose because, chances are, the mo=
ney does not  mean as much to you as the excitement. Just knowing this abou=
t yourself  may cause you to be more prudent, which could improve your trad=
ing  record. Have a business-like approach to the markets.  Anyone who  is =
inclined to speculate in futures should look at speculation as a  business,=
 and treat it as such. Do not regard it as a pure gamble, as so  many peopl=
e do. If speculation is a business, anyone in that business  should learn a=
