Dear Andrew:

For a limited time, when you buy a Salad Shaker at the
regular price, you'll get a FREE 21-oz. drink at McDonald's
with this coupon! Just click on the link below to print
your coupon. But hurry, this tasty offer expires on
June 30, 2001.

While you're there, try one of McDonald's newest meal
choices--the Bacon Double Cheeseburger or Mighty Wings(R)!

Or if you have children that still love their Happy Meal
toy but require more food, McDonald's introduces their new
Mighty Kids Meal.
