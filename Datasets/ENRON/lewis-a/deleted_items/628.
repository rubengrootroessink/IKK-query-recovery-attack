Morning Watch List
This section contains 6 stocks that are expected move in 1 to 5 days. 
Click here for this morning's Watch List Stocks: http://www.realtimetraders.com/marketinfo/watchlist.asp Beyond The Numbers
Nasdaq drops below support
Tuesday technology stocks continued to trend lower as investors received 
more evidence a recovery in the tech sector may not occur as quickly as 
some analysts had been predicting. On the session the Nasdaq Composite 
lost 75 points and closed below the 2200 level at 2175. Dow Industrial was 
able to post a modest gain and remain above the 11,000 support level. After 
the close Sun Microsystems Inc. lowered their estimates and said demand 
continues to be weak. This morning two of the leading brokerages are making 
a lot of negative comments about the semiconductor stocks and some cautious 
comments on Juniper Networks and downgraded the stock. Given all the 
negative news in the market this morning, we expect the Nasdaq to continue 
to come under pressure and the Dow to break below the 11,000 level. As of 
this writing the Dow futures are lower by 46 points, and the Nasdaq futures 
are lower by 30 points. 
Stocks to Watch
After the close Alcatel (ALA) and Lucent Technologies (LU) announced their 
discussions concerning a possible merger of equals have been terminated. 
As a result both stocks rebounded slightly in after-hours trading, but this 
morning Alcatel is lowering its guidance.
As mentioned above, after the close Sun Microsystems (SUNW) warned it will 
not meet its previous estimates for the fourth quarter and lowered its revenue 
estimates to be between $3.8 billion and $4 billion. This figure is significantly 
lower than the $5 billion in the sameperiod last year and $4.1 billion in the third 
quarter of this year. The company went on to say US demand is worse than 
expected, and more importantly the company is starting to see weakness in 
both Europe and Asia.
Sector Analysis
Semiconductors remains under pressure
Readers may recall that since last Tuesday we have been warning the 
semiconductor sector will come under pressure as a result of the negative 
book to bill number.  The sector has lost 71 points or 10.1% since the 
book to bill number came in at a 10 year low. Now after 5 days of trading 
and a 10% decline all the major brokers have woken up and are cutting 
estimates on some of the leading semiconductor stocks. We find it amazing 
these so called analysts always make their call after the stocks have moved 
so much. Tuesday morning Morgan Stanley is cutting their estimates on 
Texas Instruments (TXN) and National Semiconductor (NSM). Dan Niles of 
Lehman Brothers is lowering his estimates on Cypress Semiconductor (CY) 
and Micron Technology (MU). Mr. Niles has lowered his 2001 estimates on 
Micron by 50% to 0.25 from 0.50 cents. 
Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Tuesday the long bond traded in a range and finished the session virtually 
unchanged. There are no major economic reports due out on Wednesday.
