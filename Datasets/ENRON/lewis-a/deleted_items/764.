Veritas Communications Group Inc. is pleased to present an early notice of an exciting opportunity in the oil and gas sector as a service to our select group of investors interested in emerging growth companies.

Given the concerns (not to mention demand) over the ever-growing cost of producing fuel, not only in the retail but commercial sector, the need for increased exploration has never been so apparent as it is today. Even the world's most powerful nation is currently experiencing an energy shortage, which has forced many to seek alternative sources of energy. The solution is quite simple, either purchase oil & gas from other nations or produce additional supplies from within, which the Asdar Group is firmly positioned to do.

Currently the Asdar Group has a 50% working interest (Harvester Property scheduled to commence in early summer 2001) in a re-entry drill program located in the San Joaquin Basin in Bakersfield, California. Projected recoveries are 25-30% of approximately 6,000,000 barrels of oil and 60% of 90 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas. In addition, the Asdar Group has a 25% working interest in LAK Ranch, an enhanced oil recovery program using SAGD (steam assisted gravity drainage) technology in the Powder River Basin near Newcastle, Wyoming. To date, over $US6,800,000 has been spent on a SAGD commercial pilot plant currently in operation. With 100,000,000 plus barrels of oil in place and a 70% recovery potential (based on third party engineering reports) all oil produced has been and will be sold at full West Texas Intermediate prices.

It is important to note that the Asdar Group is firmly committed to producing high quality energy sources, which are so desperately needed in today's ever-changing environmental landscape.

An investment in XBET is particularly suited for investors with above-average risk tolerance, who are seeking a potential for capital appreciation and who have diversified investment portfolios.
