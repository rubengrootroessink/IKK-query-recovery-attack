Don't turn your back on the IPO market. It could get away from you.

Consider the following:
In 2001, only 92 IPOs made it to market. But it was a year to
remember for the serious investor. At the close on Dec. 31, 2001, the
average gain --- yes --- gain per IPO was 15.2 percent each. That's
compared with a sharp decline in the popular indexes. In the year
2001, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.1 percent, the S&P 500
slid 13.04 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.05 percent.

By the close on Dec. 31, nearly 62 percent of 2001's IPOs finished
above their offering prices.
