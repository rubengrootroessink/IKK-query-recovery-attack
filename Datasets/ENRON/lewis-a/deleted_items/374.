 DIEGO, Jan 17, 2002 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM=

M Wireless & Internet and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, which were create=
d as a result of certain changes in the Company's businesses and managerial=
 reporting as announced in July 2001. Effective in the first quarter of fis=
cal 2002, the Company's complete financial segment reporting includes:   --=
  QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) -- develops and supplies         industr=
y-leading CDMA chipset and system software solutions         used in networ=
k infrastructure equipment, phones and other         wireless devices. QCT =

s position location         technology facilitated by SnapTrack(TM), a whol=
ly owned         subsidiary of QUALCOMM.     --  QUALCOMM Technology Licens=
ing (QTL) -- licenses the Company's         essential CDMA patent portfolio=
 to telecom equipment and         consumer electronics manufacturers worldw=
ide. To date,         QUALCOMM has licensed over 100 companies to use its p=
ortfolio         of over 1,900 U.S. patents and patent applications applica=
ble         to CDMA and other technologies.     --  QUALCOMM Wireless & Int=
ernet (QWI) -- comprised of the         following businesses:         --  Q=
UALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) -- formed to accelerate             the dev=
elopment of applications for the wireless Internet,             building on=
 QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for             Wireless(TM) (BREW(T=
M)) applications platform. The BREW             platform enables hardware m=
anufacturers and software             developers to quickly create new prod=
ucts and             applications, and allows users to download and run tho=
se             applications on their wireless devices.         --  QUALCOMM=
 Digital Media (QDM) -- develops technologies to             support the pr=
ocessing, transmission and management of             content for a variety =
of media applications, including the             delivery of digitized moti=

ts for the U.S. government.         --  QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solution=
s (QWBS) -- develops             and provides satellite and terrestrial-bas=
ed fleet             management solutions to over 400,000 vehicles in 32   =
          countries. The QWBS Network Management Center processes          =
   more than seven million transactions per day, making it             one =
of the largest wireless data networks in the world.     --  QUALCOMM Strate=
gic Initiatives (QSI) -- formed to consolidate         and manage the Compa=
ny's strategic investment activities.         QUALCOMM invests in wireless =
carriers and manufacturers to         promote the worldwide adoption of CDM=
A products and services         for wireless voice and Internet data applic=
ations. Generally,         the Company will exit these investments at the e=
arliest         possible time, provided the individual circumstances of a  =
       particular investment permit an orderly exit without         undermi=
ning QUALCOMM's original strategic purpose. Earnings or         losses from=
 the QSI segment come from interest income,         increases or decreases =
in the value of investments (both         realized and unrealized) and QUAL=
COMM's share of income or         losses from consolidated subsidiaries and=
 investments         accounted under the equity method of accounting. From =
        time-to-time other income may result from strategic activities     =
    such as the sale of an FCC bidding credit in the fourth fiscal         =
quarter of 2001.  QUALCOMM is providing new information on the QSI segment =
to aid investors' understanding of the investments that the Company has mad=
e and the income or losses generated from those investments. QUALCOMM will =
separate the financial performance of QSI from its core operating businesse=
s because many of these investments are in development-stage companies incu=
rring planned accounting losses that are consolidated into QUALCOMM's repor=
ted earnings. The Company believes that the new financial segment reporting=
 will allow investors to more accurately value the different elements of QU=
ALCOMM's activities. Under the new financial segment reporting, net earning=
s of $0.10 per share for fiscal 2001 and $0.09 per share for fiscal 2000 ha=
ve been moved from core operations into the QSI segment.   Historical infor=
mation, including revenues and earnings before taxes by segment, is present=
