rnal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement- Update on Next Profile- Ex=
pected To Trade Between February 5th and 8th   We are very excited about ou=
r next profile, which will probably be coming next week. We can't say exact=
ly when because the company will be going public through an RTO, and it wil=
l open for trading on the American Stock Exchange at a yet to be determined=
 time. Sometime during the week beginning February 4th is the anticipated o=
pening. It could open at any time during the week. To learn more about RTOs=
, you can read our January 16th  edition, which describes in detail how the=
y work.   The company is a medical device manufacturer already generating s=
ignificant sales. The company expects to turn cash flow positive this year,=
 and last week attained its second FDA Approval, lending itself to even mor=
e preliminary interest in the stock. This company fits perfectly with the B=
io-Tech revolution, a group we believe will generate prolific profits for i=
nvestors who choose the right stocks during the first decade of the 21st ce=
ntury. Please read our January 19th  edition for our views on this matter. =
  One of this company's therapies has already been featured on a special se=
gment on Good Morning America, and their shareholders' list reads like of W=
ho's Who of major Wall Street names and International Financiers.   Because=
 this company will not be going public through the traditional IPO, all ope=
n market investors will be on an equal playing field once the stock begins =
trading.   When the stock opens for trading the OTC Journal will immediatel=
y send out our profile on the company. You will be provided with all the fa=
cts and figures you need to make an informed investment decision, but you s=
hould still make an effort to confirm all information through independent t=
hird party sources, i.e. the SEC Edgar filings and the company's web site. =
  We have come up with a solution to get you the profile as soon as the sto=
ck opens for trading. Simply visit our Home Page  frequently at www.otcjour=
nal.com  starting next week. At the top of our home page you will find a no=
tice informing you whether the stock has opened for trading. Once the stock=
 opens, our banner will be give you the name, symbol, and current quote. Af=
ter trading begins you will be able to simply click on the banner, and the =
full profile on the company will open up automatically. More information in=
 this weekend's edition.   There is already a tremendous "buzz" on this com=
pany in the small cap community, and we believe the stock could trade like =
a hot IPO. Start checking our home page at www.otcjournal.com  one week fro=
m Friday morning if you want the advantage of getting in on the ground floo=
r.     [IMAGE] Cross Media Marketing (AMEX: XMM)- News After the Close [IMA=
GE]  [IMAGE]  Cross Media issued a news release after the close today. The =
company disclosed a new product launch- Destinations Direct (http://www.des=
tinations-direct.com ), an international discount  travel club. This new pr=
oduct has been in development stage for over six months.   The company will=
 now "Cross Market" this new product through its current channels of distri=
bution which include their 30 million plus consumer database, the 20 millio=
n member database at Lifeminders, and the 62 million households who receive=
 Parade Magazine with their Sunday newspaper.   More importantly, the compa=
ny reiterated its 2002 projections of $200 million in sales and earnings in=
 excess of $1.25 per share.   The market is placing a mean PE Ratio of 17.5=
 x 2002 earnings on the Direct Marketing Services Group. Therefore, if Cros=
s Media can simply trade up to the average of the group, the stock could at=
tain a level of about $22 per share (17.5 x $1.25 in earnings).   Shares of=
 Cross Media have enjoyed significant institutional accumulation since the =
company completed a successful 1 for 5 reverse split at the end of October.=
 The company is now starting to garner more institutional interest, and it =
is only a matter of time before a major Wall Street firm jumps on the Cross=
 Media band wagon.   We believe the recent weakness in the share price in s=
ympathy to the pullback in the NASDAQ is a buying opportunity. Regardless o=
f the speed of the economic recovery, the market will still pay for solid e=
arnings.  $20 is our price target for 2002, up from the $15 price target we=
 had when prior to the acquisition of National Syndications, the publisher =
of Parade Magazine.   Charts Provided Courtesy Of TradePortal.com    The OT=
