Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/05)
--------------------------------------------------------

"What I learned in Islamorada this weekend"

This past weekend I took a trip to the beautiful Florida Keys.
After working hard to launch the new website, this was just what the doctor
ordered. The fishing, boating and diving were extraordinary and I took away
some interesting thoughts that I will share with you.

The fishing was productive, however, all my strikes occurred in two distinct
locations. The first area is called the hump and it is located 12.1 n.miles
SouthEast of our resort. Check this out....The hump is located in 550
feet of water and is the size of a football field. The bottom comes up
(hump)
to just 240 feet in many places. Because of the massive upwelling (current
created)
the food chain is alive and well. Baitfish feed on plankton and the pelagics
feed
on baitfish and fishermen like me prey on the pelagics. Thank God nothing is
higher on the food chain (atleast while you stay in the boat).

We caught one 20 lb dolphin on the hump and a couple of other smaller fish
is just two hours of trolling. The other location is called the "East Wall".
The East wall is located 23 n. Miles from shore and is in 1200 feet of
water.
They call it the wall, because the bottom drops another 1200 feet within a
couple
of miles.  We caught 9 dolphin highlighted by a 30lb bull dolphin at the
wall in
just a couple of hours.

So what lesson did I learn?

I caught all these fish by narrowing my focus. What I didn't tell you,
was that I spent about 12 total hours fishing non-productive water and
caught
no other fish. I think trading is often the same way; you need to put
yourself
in position(in the right market opportunities) to profit and then everything
else
comes easier. This is exactly the principle behind the CTS Futures Selector.
You
need to narrow your focus on the markets that have conditions conducive to
profit.
When fishing, focus on great conditions for the species you're targeting.
When trading, focus on trending markets. Next time I go to the Keys, I will
pull those GPS coordinates and focus my efforts at the Hump and the East
Wall.
Before you take your next trade, maybe you should check the market
opportunities
(Market GPS numbers) on the CTS Futures Selector?

Key Technical Developments (close of 06/04)
-------------------------------------------------------
The B. Pound could be on the verge of a major meltdown!
Next target is 140!

The grains continue to search for a bottom. Don't forget the seasonal
tendency for corn to rally into the July 4th holiday and then tank!

The Dow is flashing a short-term buy signal with a target of the
all time high!
