h New 0.13-Micron QuadSquad(TM) Gigabit Transceiver=1DIndustry-Standard RGM=
II With Broadcom's Unique Built-in Timing Adjustment Reduces System Layout =
Complexity by More Than 50-Percent   IRVINE, Calif., Oct 29, 2001 /PRNewswi=
re via COMTEX/ -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq: BRCM), the leading provider=
 of integrated circuits enabling broadband communications, today announced =
the latest member of its QuadSquad(TM) family of Gigabit Ethernet quad tran=
sceivers optimized for high-port density Gigabit Ethernet switches and rout=
ers. The Broadcom(R) BCM5424 quad transceiver features the Reduced Gigabit =
Media Independent Interface (RGMII), which reduces system design complexity=
 by over 50-percent as compared with the traditional GMII interface. The BC=
M5424 and other members of the QuadSquad family facilitate deployment of Gi=
gabit Ethernet bandwidth to the desktop by increasing port density and lowe=
ring system cost. Utilizing advanced 0.13-micron process technology, Broadc=
om's Gigabit transceivers also achieve the industry's lowest power consumpt=
ion of less than one watt per port.   "With the introduction of the BCM5424=
, we have reduced design complexity, lowered system cost and accelerated ti=
me-to-market for our customers," said Marty Colombatto, Vice President and =
General Manager of Broadcom's Networking Business Unit. "Our transceiver in=
cludes a unique built-in timing delay mode to eliminate the timing delay tr=
ace called for in the RGMII specification. By accommodating this timing del=
ay on-chip, the BCM5424 can save up to 96 square inches of layout space for=
 a 48-port blade, simplifying board design and reducing the number of layer=
s required."   RGMII is a reduced pin count interface that simplifies board=
 design by lowering the number of interface pins from 25 pins used in the G=
MII interface to 12. It also lowers system cost compared to the older GMII =
or Ten Bit Interface (TBI) interfaces by reducing the number of layers requ=
ired to route high-density networking solutions. Using RGMII, fewer pins ar=
e also required for the MAC/switch ASICs, lowering their cost.   To illustr=
ate, RGMII saves 1,248 pins in a 48-port switch blade. To achieve that, the=
 RGMII specification calls for a timing delay on the receive and transmit s=
ignals for each port. Each timing delay must be implemented in a board-leve=
l trace. These trace lengths are typically arranged in a spiral on the boar=
d that takes approximately one square inch of board space per trace. Broadc=
om's alternative timing solution provides a DLL-based delay for the receive=
 and transmit clocks, thus eliminating the need for the timing delay traces=
. Given the space requirement for each of the transmit and receive signal t=
iming delays on 48 ports, eliminating the timing delay traces can save 96 s=
quare inches of layout space.   In addition to the RGMII interface, the BCM=
5424 also supports the RTBI interface, which is a reduced pin count version=
 of the TBI interface.   The BCM5424 incorporates Broadcom's fourth-generat=
ion Gigabit Ethernet transceiver technology implemented in the advanced 0.1=
3-micron process already proven in production in Broadcom's quad-port BCM54=
04 and used in BCM5434 Gigabit Ethernet transceivers and the company's sing=
le port BCM5421 copper and BCM5421S copper-plus-fiber transceivers. Broadco=
m's Ethernet transceivers are the most widely deployed and field-proven in =
the industry, with over 3 million Gigabit Ethernet ports and over 300 milli=
on Fast Ethernet ports shipped to date. The BCM5424 is manufactured using t=
he advanced 0.13-micron process technology developed by Taiwan Semiconducto=
r Manufacturing Company (TSMC), one of Broadcom's foundry partners. Collabo=
ration between Broadcom and TSMC, drawing on Broadcom's advanced communicat=
ions IC expertise and TSMC's process technology knowledge, led to a broad f=
amily of mixed signal devices that achieve superior performance, lower cost=
 and slash power requirements by 50-percent.   The BCM5424 incorporates all=
 three Ethernet speeds -- 10, 100, and 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) -- w=
ith standards-based auto-negotiation, to ensure compatibility with all exis=
ting Ethernet network equipment operating over legacy Category 5 copper cab=
le plants. Unique Ethernet@Wirespeed(TM) technology enables equipment manuf=
actured using the BCM5424 to auto-negotiate to the maximum speed possible o=
ver an impaired cable plant, regardless of the maximum speed advertised by =
the end-equipment.   The BCM5424 incorporates the industry's most powerful =
transceiver DSP engine, delivering over one Teraop (one trillion operations=
 per second) performance, combined with high-speed, precision mixed-signal =
circuits. This processing power ensures robust operation at Gigabit speeds =
over the broadest range of existing cable plants. In addition, the BCM5424 =
is designed to exceed the IEEE specifications for noise cancellation and tr=
ansmission jitter, providing consistent and reliable operation even over ma=
rginal cable plants.   The BCM5424's cable diagnostic capability allows use=
rs, IT managers and networking equipment manufacturers to remotely analyze =
the quality and attributes of the cable, thereby avoiding unnecessary equip=
ment returns and service calls. Built-in diagnostics help pinpoint the caus=
e of network malfunctions without deploying field support personnel or brin=
ging down the network.   Pricing and Availability   The BCM5424 quad Gigabi=
t Ethernet transceiver is currently sampling to Broadcom's early access par=
tners and is priced at $90 in quantities of 1000 units.   About Broadcom   =
