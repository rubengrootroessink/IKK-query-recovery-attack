uityAlert.com.     Texas Instruments' New Programmable DSP Solution Offers =
Improved Performance For Digital Cameras=1D100 Percent Higher Performance a=
nd 25 Percent Lower Power Translates Into Clearer Photos, Faster Shots and =
Longer Battery Life   DALLAS, Oct 23, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Lever=
aging the latest in digital signal processor (DSP) technology, Texas Instru=
ments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) introduced the latest programmable DSP-=
based solution that enables faster operation with lower power consumption i=
n digital cameras. Offering features that provide greater speed and design =
flexibility, the new DSP solution achieves performance increases of up to 1=
00 percent and a reduction in power consumption of up to 25 percent over TI=
's previous-generation DSP solution. Digital cameras designed with the new =
platform will allow consumers to capture high-resolution still images and e=
njoy real-time PC video from the same device.   The new TMS320DSC25 program=
mable DSP solution extends the performance and functionality of TI's succes=
sful TMS320DSC21 platform, providing system designers with the means to imp=
rove and differentiate their digital camera products. The new device suppor=
ts the capture of still images at up to 3-megapixels in less than a second,=
 and it encodes and decodes CIF resolution (352x288) MPEG-4 I+P frame video=
 at 20 frames per second (fps). Additional power-down modes provide a reduc=
tion in overall system power consumption and prolonged battery life. The en=
hanced DSP subsystem enables higher imaging and video processing performanc=
e, while the preview engine, the addition of an external host interface and=
 SD, Multi-media Card (MMC) and Memory Stick interfaces all make the DSC25 =
a more flexible solution for digital cameras, dual-purpose PC cameras and o=
ther multimedia applications.   "The introduction of the DSC25 illustrates =
TI's commitment to the fast- growing digital imaging market," said Will Str=
auss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. "The price, perfo=
rmance and programmability are very attractive features, but the ability to=
 also handle Internet audio functions in addition to the flexible imaging c=
apability expands its utility and overall value to the camera manufacturer.=
"   The DSC25 is manufactured using a 0.15-micron (SIA) CMOS process that i=
mproves speed and lowers power consumption over the DSC21. Combining TI's l=
ow power TMS320C54x(TM) DSP with an ARM7TDMI(R) RISC processor on a single =
device provides programming flexibility that allows developers to offer uni=
que features in new systems, upgrade existing designs as standards evolve a=
nd create new products from existing hardware platforms by modifying softwa=
re. Additionally, DSP programmability enables system developers to leverage=
 their investment in hardware and software to get to market quickly and cos=
t- effectively with new products.   "TI has learned from the success of the=
 DSC21 what customers need most for next-generation digital cameras," said =
Dr. Raj Talluri, Imaging business manager at Texas Instruments. "The increa=
sed performance, programming flexibility and low power consumption of the D=
SC25 will enable manufacturers to offer consumers higher quality images and=
 a greater range of features in upcoming digital camera products."   Additi=
onal enhanced features of the DSC25 include a digital liquid crystal displa=
y (LCD) interface and S-video output. An enhanced on screen display (OSD) p=
rovides more flexible, simplified graphical user interface (GUI) developmen=
t for system designers with dedicated video, bitmap and cursor windows. An =
improved preview engine enhances preview quality with faster memory access =
and image resizing. Direct memory access (DMA) to external dynamic random a=
ccess memory (DRAM) and an external host interface enhance flexibility for =
PC-related applications.   TI's support features serve to make system devel=
opment easier and speed time to market. Software modules will be available =
for all major video- imaging compression standards, including JPEG, motion-=
JPEG, MPEG, MPEG-4, H.263, as well as audio standards such as MP3 and Advan=
ced Audio Coding (AAC), as well as data communication standards such as USB=
 and RS-232. In addition, the DSC25 is supported by TI's eXpressDSP(TM) Rea=
l-Time Software Technology, which includes the Code Composer Studio(TM) int=
egrated development environment (IDE), the DSP/BIOS(TM) real-time kernel, t=
he TMS320(TM) DSP Algorithm Standard for interoperability and reuse and the=
 industry's largest base of third-party software modules.   Pricing and Ava=
ilability   Samples of TI's DSC25 DSP solution are available now, with volu=
me production currently scheduled for Spring 2002. Evaluation modules (EVMs=
) are expected to be available in the first quarter of 2002 to help camera =
OEMs begin development on new systems. The DSC25 solution in quantities of =
100 thousand units or more is expected to be less than $20 each.   About TI=
