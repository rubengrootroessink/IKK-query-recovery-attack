The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were steady to lower overnight due to light
profit taking as investors used cautious comments from Hewlett-
Packard and J.P. Morgan as an excuse to take some money off the table
after a four-day run on Wednesday. Both the Nasdaq and Sept. S&P
remain range bound and will need to close above May's high or below
last week's lows to clear up near-term direction in the markets.
Meanwhile, the Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on
Wednesday as it consolidated some of its gains off last Friday's low.
However, momentum indicators have turned neutral to bullish signaling
that additional gains during June are possible. If there are no major
surprises in this morning's unemployment report, I am looking for the
Dow to trade steady to higher today.

European markets were mixed in overnight trading as German
unemployment for May was well above expectations that led to a modest
setback in the DAX-30. The UK FTSE-100 was up 17.00 points at 5918.50
while the German DAX-30 was down 12.06 points at 6180.38 as of 11:00
BST.

The Nikkei closed higher overnight as investors were encouraged by
better-than-expected April machinery orders data. Overnight gains led
to the posting of an upside reversal as the Nikkei consolidates above
the 50% retracement level crossing at 12,995. Additional gains on
Friday are needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern, which
would increase the odds that a short-term bottom may be in place.
Momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish
hinting that a short-term bottom might be in or near. The Nikkei
closed up 103 points to 13,278.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds were lower overnight and are working on a possible
inside day due to light profit taking. Trading was rather subdued as
most market participants stayed on the sidelines to wait for the
London session's open amidst a lack of fresh news. If the rebound off
last week's low continues, the 38% retracement level of this spring's
decline crossing at 101-15 then the 50% retracement level crossing at
102-16 are potential targets later this month. Momentum indicators
remain bullish signaling that additional short-term gains are
possible.

The German bond market or Bunds were lower overnight in thin trading
as they are due to expire on Friday. Trading was subdued as traders
await news from today's European Central Bank conference at 12:30
GMT. The June Bunds were last down 0.01 at 106.81. Sept. Bunds
started the day down 0.02 at 95.835, will be the front contract next
week.

Japanese government bonds closed slightly higher overnight in narrow
trading. The bond market took its cue from the Nikkei's movements and
was supported by Japan's unchanged bearish economic outlook. The lead
June 10-year JGB futures closed at 140.55 yen, up 0.05 as of 1510 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were lower in overnight trading following the
release of this week's DOE data report that showed that crude oil and
distillate supplies rose last week. In other news, OPEC Secretary
General, Ali Rodriguez indicated that he though a small increase in
output would be likely in the third quarter of this year.

July crude oil was lower overnight following this week's bearish
inventory data, which showed an increase in stocks compared with
expectations for a decline in stocks by the trade. Wednesday's key
reversal down fell short of testing this year's uptrend line, which
crosses near 27.10. However, overnight losses have set the stage for
a possible test of this support level by the end of the week.
Momentum indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold
zones warning traders to use caution as a short-term bottom might be
near.

July heating oil was lower overnight following Wednesday's key
reversal down. July gapped lower on the night session's open and
extended losses throughout the overnight. Closes below Wednesday's
low would set the stage for a test of May's reaction low crossing at
74.55. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices during the first half of June are possible.

July unleaded gas was lower overnight following Wednesday's trendline
breakout and close below the 50% retracement level of this year's
rally crossing at 88.93. Additional weakness during the day session
could lead to a test of the 62% retracement level crossing at 85.62
later this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices near-term are still possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight following this week's
bearish AGA inventory data report that showed U.S. natural gas
inventory rose by 117 billion cubic feet last week. This report eased
fears of rising energy demand due to warmer temps across the south.
Momentum indicators are turning bearish once again hinting that a
test of last week's low is possible. Closes below this support level
would renew this year's decline while opening the door for a possible
test of the 62% retracement level of the 1999/2001 rally crossing at
3.64 later this month.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro is working on a possible inside day but was
slightly lower overnight following Wednesday's key reversal down.
Closes below 84.16 would renew this spring's decline during June.
Momentum indicators are oversold but neutral to bearish thereby
leaving the door open for additional weakness.

The September British Pound plunged to a new 15-year low overnight
following Wednesday's trading range breakout. Overnight losses led to
a close below weekly chart support that crosses at 139.52. If the
decline continues, the February 1986 low at 136 is the Pound's next
target later this spring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling
sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.

The September Swiss Franc was lower overnight as it extended
Wednesday's key reversal down. A lower close during the day session
is needed to confirm yesterday's bearish chart pattern, as the Franc
is poised to renew this spring's decline. Closes into new lows would
set the stage for a possible test of weekly chart support crossing at
.5508 later this year. The ADX (a trend-following indicator) is
turning sideways to higher signaling that additional weakness is
still possible.

The September Canadian Dollar gapped up and traded higher overnight
as it extended this week's gains. Closes above Wednesday's high
crossing at .6558 would confirm Wednesday's trading range breakout
and confirm the resumption of this spring's rally. If September's
rally continues, the 62% retracement level of this year's decline
crossing at .6573 is September's next upside target. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
during the first half of June are possible.

The September Japanese Yen was higher overnight due to light short
covering. This week's decline, which filled the gap at .8425 thereby
increasing the odds that a short-term top has been posted.
Stochastics and RSI are turning bearish following a test of their
respective overbought zones warning trader's to use caution as
additional weakness is possible.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was lower in overnight trading as it continues to
consolidate around the 75% retracement level of the decline off May's
high, which crosses at 267.20. Closes above 269.60 are needed to
temper the near-term bearish outlook in August gold. If the decline
resumes, the reaction low crossing at 263.20 is August's next target.
Stochastics and RSI are bearish but becoming oversold warning bears
not to press their hand as a low may be near.

July silver was lower overnight and remains poised to test trading
range support crossing at 4.31 in the near future. Closes below this
support level crossing at 4.31 would open the door for a possible
test of weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term
is possible.

July copper was lower overnight due to spillover selling following
Wednesday's downside reversal. A lower close during the day session
would increase the odds that this week's bounce has come to an end.
Closes below Monday's low would open the door for additional weakness
and could lead to a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later
this spring. It will take closes above 77.20 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the market. Momentum indicators are neutral to
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into early-June
appears are still possible.

GRAINS

July corn was higher overnight due to hot/dry conditions in eastern
China's key crop producing region are gaining increased attention
from the market. Yield reductions of some crops have already taking
place. Rain is needed soon over the dry areas to avoid additional
crop losses. Producers in the US remained concern over the cool/wet
conditions across the Midwest, which have slowed early development of
this year's corn crop. However, traders have indicated that these
conditions are of little concern at this point in the growing season.
This morning's export sales report will provide near-term direction
for the market. Pre-report estimates range from 850,000 to 1 million
metric tonnes. Wednesday's upside reversal hinted that the pause
above broken trendline resistance might be coming to an end. A higher
close on Thursday would set the stage for a possible of May's high
crossing at 2.11 1/2 later this month. Early calls are for July corn
to open 1 to 1 1/4 cents higher this morning.

July wheat was higher in overnight trading due to hot/dry conditions
across China, which has lead to some yield reduction of their hard
red winter wheat crop. Overnight gains were limited as the wheat
harvest has moved into southern Oklahoma and is accelerating. Early
yield results are fair however, protein levels are coming in better
than expected. The trade will be closely watching this morning's
export sales report for near-term direction. Pre-report estimates
range from 300,000 to 500,000 metric tonnes. Early calls are for July
wheat to open steady to 1 cent higher this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were steady in overnight trading following Wednesday's
close into new highs for the month. Extended weather forecasts are
calling for warmer temps however, additional rain is also in the
forecast, which will continue to delay the last of this year's
soybean crop to be planted. Traders will also be watching this
morning's export sales report for near-term direction. Pre-report
estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000 metric tonnes. Export sales
continue to run at or just above the pace needed to reach the latest
USDA projection. Some traders believe that the USDA will actually
raise their export projection of soybeans for this year in the
upcoming June supply/demand report. Wednesday's new high close for
the month keeps the uptrend off April's low intact with March's high
at 4.77 1/2 marking a potential target later this year. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are
possible. Early calls for July soybeans to open steady this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight as it is challenging the 62%
retracement level of this winter's decline crossing at 169.40.
Multiple closes above this resistance level could lead to an eventual
test of the 75% retracement level crossing at 175.40 later this
month. Traders will be closely watching this morning's export sales
report for confirmation that foreign demand remains strong.
Pre-report estimates range from 100,000 to 175,000 metric tonnes.
Momentum indicators have renewed their bullish modes signaling that
sideways to higher prices near-term are possible. Early calls are for
July soybean meal to open 10 to 30-cents higher this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August hogs closed unchanged as a short covering bounce ahead of the
close erased early losses. If the rally resumes, April's high
crossing at 65.95 is August's next target. Closes below last week's
gap at 64.00 would strongly suggest that a short-term top has been
posted. Momentum indicators remain bullish but are entering their
respective overbought zones warning bulls to use caution as a
short-term top might be near.

August cattle closed lower on Wednesday and in doing so turned a
number of momentum indicators bearish from overbought levels
signaling that a broad double top with January's high might be in
place. Today's sell off was triggered by a growing sentiment that a
seasonal break is underway. Talk of sagging boxed beef and cash
markets also weighed on prices. Some traders suggested that packers
would either have to cut kills or hold off buying large numbers of
cattle in the cash market to make up for recent profit margin
reductions.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed lower on Wednesday due in large part
to a lack of short covering buying and forecasts calling for mild
weather in Brazil's coffee growing region this weekend. Momentum
indicators are oversold hinting that a short-term low is in place or
near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market.

July cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a lower close as it
consolidated some of this week's short covering gains. July remains
below broken trading range support crossing at 955 leaving the door
open for sideways to lower trading if Monday's low is exceeded.
However, momentum indicators are becoming oversold warning bears to
use caution when pressing the short side of the market.

July sugar posted a key reversal down on Wednesday hinting that the
short covering bounce off last week's double bottom might have come
to an end. Additional weakness on Thursday is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. Momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that a resumption of May's decline is possible. If the
decline resumes, fib support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.

July cotton closed higher on Wednesday keeping the short covering
bounce off last week's low alive for the time being. However, July
needs to close above this year's downtrend line crossing near 43.95
to confirm that a bottom and trend change has taken place. Momentum
indicators are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices near-term are possible.
