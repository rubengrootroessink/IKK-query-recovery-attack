            <p>Cyber-terrorism - A Very REAL Threat<br>
            Merilus is helping agencies and corporations protect themselves against the increasingly ominous threat of "cyber-terrorist attacks"
            - breaches in network security that allow criminals to steal files and documents via their computers and the Internet. Merilus' leading-edge products
            give the piece of mind necessary to operate safely in a dangerous world.

<p>The NEED for Security<br>
Now more than ever, companies need to ensure their security. The Computer Security Institute, in conjunction with the FBI,
recently released a report stating that attacks on corporate computer systems have been increasing steadily since 1998.
A report issued by the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) and PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that Fortune 1000 companies lost $45 billion to theft of proprietary information
last year alone, with fully 90% of this proprietary data being in digital form. Merilus provides hardware and software to effectively deal with the problems of network security, and delivers these solutions at a tremendously attractive cost
to its customers.

<p>Aggressive Marketing Strategy<br>
The Company has spent the past 4 years concentrating its efforts on intensive research and product development.
Merilus now has in production a number of fully tested and independently verified products. The Company will now be shifting its focus to an aggressive business development, marketing and sales expansion.
Early response to Merilus' worldwide business development activities has been very positive, and the Company is working towards establishing a worldwide presence.

<p>Leading Customers & Esteemed Awards<br>
Merilus is proud to have its products in place at some of the world's strongest companies and organizations. Lockheed Martin, NASA, and the State of Vermont
are just a few of the customers who are putting their trust in Merilus. InfoSecurity News Magazine
recently awarded Merilus its prestigious 5-Star rating, and The Tech Zone called its product "a truly powerful combination of hardware and software," giving the product a score of 9.5 out of 10.

<p>A Powerful Bottom Line<br>
Merilus currently shows a 60% gross margin in their Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) hardware business, and an astounding 95% gross margin in their software business.
The Company's unique 2:1 cost feature ratio ensures that competitors cannot defend existing market share without drastically affecting their bottom line.  The Company projects sales of approximately $7.9 million in 2002, and is projecting revenues of $93.7 million by 2004.
By that time, Merilus expects to be cash flow positive and projects earnings of approximately $0.19 per share.

<p>An Attractive Investment Opportunity<br>
Merilus Inc. (OTC/BB: MERH) is well positioned to expand its position in this lucrative niche market. The aggressive sales and marketing expansion
will represent a tremendous opportunity for the Company and its shareholders. At this critical juncture in Merilus' development, it is a perfect time to consider MERH as a part of your portfolio.
