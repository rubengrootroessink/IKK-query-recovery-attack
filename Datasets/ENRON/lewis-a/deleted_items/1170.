[IMAGE] [IMAGE] =09  As requested, your News Alert for TXN  follows from Eq=
uityAlert.com.     Earnings And Option Expiration Will Drive The Markets On=
 Friday - Commentary Part 1     (RealTimeTraders.com) - As we anticipated t=
he broad market was quite weak throughout Thursday's session. This was evid=
ent by the sharp disparity between the number of advancing issues and decli=
ning issues on both markets. However thanks to the strength in few technolo=
gy stocks, the Nasdaq Composite managed to hold its ground and finish in th=
e positive territory, up 6 points at 1652. The Dow Industrials lost almost =
70 points and closed at 9163 and the broader S?500 index lost 8.48 points a=
nd closed at 1068. Note that from a technical perspective both the Dow and =
the S?500 indices have now broken their recent uptrend.  Thursday after the=
 close a slew of companies reported their quarterly reports that once again=
 painted a mixed picture about future earnings. Dow Component Microsoft Cor=
p. (MSFT) reported better than expected revenues, but lower net profits and=
 also warned second quarter and full year earnings would be below street es=
timates. On this news the stock traded slightly lower in after hours. On th=
e other hand, PeopleSoft, Inc. (PSFT) reported better than expected results=
 on increased revenues and earnings. From all the earnings reports released=
 thus far, it seems some of the sectors may be starting to see signs of sta=
bilization, but almost none seem to be able to predict when an upturn could=
 occur in their respective industries. Following are some of the companies =
worth watching that reported their results after the close: CA, KLAC, EMLX,=
 NT, GLW, SUNW, GTW, SFA, AMCC, TQNT, IDTI, XLNX and EBAY.  Given the mixed=
 earnings picture, it is difficult to anticipate how the markets will react=
 on Friday morning. However, the momentum is certainly on the downside due =
to option expirations and the fact traders are still unwilling to hold posi=
tions over the weekend due to continued concerns about America's new war on=
 Terrorism. We will continue to monitor the markets throughout the session =
and alert investors and traders to the overall market conditions and to the=
 best and worst performing sectors. Copyright(c) 2001 RealTimeTraders.com, =
