1.  Introduction

The financial calendars are fairly light for next week,
because earnings season has ended and no IPOs are being
brought to market.  Retail sales and mall traffic could have
a strong effect on trading early in the week, with military
and other news events potentially playing a significant role
later in the week.  Some tax selling may also occur, while
certain Nasdaq stocks will show above average volatility on
speculation that they may be added to or dropped from the
Nasdaq 100 {QQQ}.

3.	Economic Releases

Monday's weekly Instinet Redbook Retail Sales will get a
closer than normal look on Monday, as investors try to gauge
how strong retail sales were over the weekend.  Perhaps even
more important than the total sales, however, will be mall
traffic since economists will be looking for signs that
consumers are responding to promotional pricing.

Two other numbers may also affect the equity markets next
week, the Conference Board's consumer confidence and Q3 Gross
Domestic Product.  Most traders expect a weak GDP number,
but a better than expected consumer confidence could help to
boost retail stocks.

Economic releases scheduled for next week are listed in the
table below.

Report                          Estimate     DATE
------------------------------------------------------------
Conf. Bd. Consumer Confidence   86.4         11/27/01

New Home Sales                  850K         11/29/01
