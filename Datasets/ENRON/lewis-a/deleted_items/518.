This Week's Speculative Buy Recommendations:

* VirtGame Corp. (OTCBB: VGTI) - VirtGame is the
premier provider of Next Generation Software to the Gaming
Industry. As such, VirtGame utilizes Virtgame SP?, its
proprietary Server Platform, as a launching point for new
technologies that will maximize information flow and profit
for its customers.  VirtGame derives revenues through
software license fees, monthly maintenance fees, profit
sharing models, reseller commissions and transaction fees.

VirtGame Corp. was founded in October of 1995 and went
public in June of 1996.  The Company has unique expertise
regarding the needs of the Gaming and Lottery Industries and
has leveraged this expertise to become a pioneer in providing
technology solutions to these industries.  Headquartered in
San Diego, California with a Business Development Office
in Las Vegas, Nevada, VirtGame was a major factor in
assisting legislators in Nevada to pass the Interactive Gaming
Bill in June 2001.

The traditional Gaming Industry sees change being brought
about by new technology and they recognize the need for a
transformation to compete.  Changing regulations and market
factors are causing operators to look for expedient
technology solutions that can be integrated with their existing
systems.  VirtGame Technologies has the first on-line
gaming solution that has been approved by the Nevada
Gaming Control Board and is currently developing the most
robust next generation Gaming Server Platform for the
Industry.

A convergence is underway regarding the technological
needs of Brick and Mortar and Computer Based Gaming
Industries.  This paradigm shift in such huge industry sectors
provides VirtGame Technologies with an incredible
opportunity.  VirtGame is entering this market at the right
time, with the right team and the right products.

Target prices:

- $2.39 for FY2002
- $12.25 for FY2003
- $19.99 for FY2004

* Cycle Country Accessories Corp. - Last week we told you
that Cycle Country Accessories Corp. would begin public
trading this week.  CCAC is working with the SEC to
complete the final registration of the stock and we will
release our report on the Company after it begins publicly
trading.  We wish there was no delay, as we believe this is an
excellent opportunity, worth waiting for if necessary.   As we
mentioned last week, Cycle Country will be trading on the
OTCBB under the symbol CCAC.  Go here to review Cycle
Country's recently filed annual report
(http://www.edgar-online.com/bin/cobrand/?doc=A-1157758

Updated Report:

Scientific Energy Inc. (OTCBB: SEYI) - Recommended
11/27/01 - Scientific Energy Inc. is a designer and developer
of portable electricity generation devices.  The Company's
devices are proposed to be used as long-life batteries that
will be used in portable electronic devices including portable
laptop computers, handheld devices, cellular phones, and a
variety of other electronic devices.  Additionally, the
Company is developing technology that will assist both
industrial concerns and consumers in a variety of
applications to significantly reduce energy consumption.

Portable power technology has finally caught up with
computer evolution.  Of course, while a huge market in and
of itself, the laptop computer market is merely the tip of the
iceberg as far as portable device power is concerned.  Mobile
phones, DVD players and a host of other technology has
been somewhat limited in its portability due to that tether to
an AC outlet.  Scientific Energy's products are the answer to
that, and more.  You know what first to market and first to
develop has meant in other technologies, can you begin to
envision what this will mean to investors in Scientific Energy
Inc.?  Take note of the size of the public float; 600,000
shares out of 27-million.  In reality the number is probably
less because those knowledgeable enough to have bought
this company are very reluctant to part with shares.  We
believe that SEYI is a speculative play with tremendous
upside potential, potential that could begin paying off in the
near future.
