Dear Investor:

My name is Ken Fisher. I write the "Portfolio Strategy"
Column for Forbes magazine and serve as Chairman
and Chief Investment Officer of Fisher Investments, Inc.
My firm manages over $9 billion for institutions and
high-net-worth individuals.

I recognize you may not be considering doing anything
differently with your investments right now. Regardless,
I'd like to send you a kit of useful insights you can't get
anywhere else free and without obligation.

As soon as you fill out the online-request form, I'll
email you the latest version of my Quarterly Report.
It's designed to be interesting to investors whether they
are interested in the full service we specialize in or
not. The report, which I update with my latest
thinking, highlights my viewpoint on:

- Which stocks to select for investment now

- The right balance between equities, fixed income
securities and cash in this volatile market

- The role mutual funds play in the portfolios
of high-net-worth individuals

- The impact of the Federal Reserve's actions
on your investment strategy

Fisher Investments' latest private Quarterly
Report normally is given, along with their
investment results, only to our clients. Each
one has at least $500,000 in our care.
After you have requested the Report, you will
have the chance to review my Seminar on Money
Management. I strongly encourage you to visit
the Seminar. It reveals the strengths and weaknesses
of management options available to people like yourself.

The reason I'm offering you this extensive intellectual
capital at my expense: I've found educating
high-net-worth investors is good for our investment
management business, whether any individual becomes
a client or not.

Some, for whom our outstanding client service and
strong results are attractive, become clients. Others
simply listen, learn and use our advice to inform their
own management. But they tell their friends, some of
whom prefer to have the details taken care of for them.

Whichever group you fall into, please allow me to
give you the benefit of my firm's original research
and my thinking. I'm certain you'll find it interesting
and useful. And, of course, FREE and without obligation.

Thanks for your attention. I look forward to hearing
from you.

Sincerely,

Kenneth L. Fisher
Chairman and Chief Investment Officer
