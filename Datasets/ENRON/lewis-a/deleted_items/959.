Does anyone have any email lists that they still use from Lotus Notes - (apart from the main team lists and Michael Kass's Team lists?).

Let me know the addresses and I can get a new mailing list set up in Outlook for you.

many thanks from Tara

Reminder!!!

Please circulate this message to team members/department heads where you feel it is appropriate. Thanks

A mailing group is a collect of people that you email under one common name e.g. Enron London Assistances. In Outlook these are called distribution lists.

We need to migrate all Lotus Notes mailing groups to Outlook. 

If you are responsible for a mailing group, or you have a mailing group for your team, can you please send me the name of it.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

Thanks and regards
Alison
