PLEASE READ FULL MESSAGE TO LEARN HOW TO GET 1,000 FREE CHANCES AT THE
$92,000,000.00 POWERBALL for Saturday, January 26, 2002!

Nobody won PowerBall on Wednesday BUT twelve lucky FreeLotto Players did win $21,000,000.00 in Jackpots! That's really no surprise when you consider that the odds of winning Classic FreeLotto's  $1,000,000.00 Grand Prize are far better than winning PowerBall. In fact, all but their SuperBucks game have better odds than PowerBall.
