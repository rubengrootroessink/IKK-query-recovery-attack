 One Lucky Kid to the 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade(TM) R=

SS WIRE) -- Macy's, in association with Yahoo!(R) Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), today=
 announces the three finalists of Macy's "Go To The Head of The Parade" nat=
ional campaign -- Kevin Connors, of Holmdel, N.J., Brent Paucke of Williams=
port, Pa. and Savannah Stewart of Warden, Ill. -- and invites the American =
public to vote on http://macysparade.yahoo.com for the student they feel ha=
s best made a contribution to their community or school. From over 3,000 en=
tries received, these three finalists reflect the best of American youth. V=
oting will begin on Tuesday, October 23rd and run through Wednesday, Octobe=
r 31st.   The Go to The Head of The Parade national campaign was introduced=
 in celebration of this year's historic 75th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgivin=
g Day Parade(TM) to recognize the contributions of America's youth. The cam=
paign, begun September 2, 2001, asked Americans across the country to submi=
t nominations of students, in essay form, via mail or online via Yahoo!, hi=
ghlighting their good deed for the community or school. This first-of-its-k=
ind program had teachers as well as civic, community and religious leaders =
submit a 150-word essay nominating a student they felt had made a real diff=
erence in their school or community; something significant enough to allow =
them to "Go To The Head Of The Parade." The campaign was open to middle or =
high school students within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The=
 finalists are:   Savannah Stewart, 12 years old, of Worden, Ill., nominate=
d by Deanna Regnier for her selflessness in making a difference for familie=
s in her community that are less fortunate. For the past five years, Savann=
ah has been supplying local pantries with food for Thanksgiving, as well as=
 helping clothe neighborhood children with warm coats and shoes during the =
winter. As if her caring and community service were not enough, Savannah th=
rows herself a birthday party and donates all the presents to needy childre=
n.   Kevin Connors, 17 years old, of Holmdel, N.J., nominated by March of D=
imes coordinator Joanne Procopio, for his fundraising efforts for the March=
 of Dimes and for actively raising awareness on the importance of healthy l=
ifestyles. Kevin has raised over $40,000 for the March of Dimes to help sav=
e babies lives in 2001. At the age of five, Kevin experienced the death of =
his cousin due to a heart defect, and since then, has shared his experience=
 with others and has been committed to saving babies. Recognized as the Num=
ber One March of Dimes Youth Fundraiser, Kevin has raised over $88,000 in t=
he past five years.   Brent Paucke, 15 years old, of Williamsport, Pa., nom=
inated by Joseph Hurley, a friend of the family, because of the courage tha=
t Brent demonstrated in a time of crisis. One day at Bishop Neuman High Sch=
ool, Brent and his classmates had finished attending a service for the vict=
ims of the San Diego High School shooting. After the priest had said that n=
othing like that would ever happen in their school in Williamsport, Pa., it=
 did. An eighth grade girl pulled a loaded pistol out of her backpack and s=
tarted yelling. Her gun went off and hit a girl in the shoulder. While ever=
yone was trying to find cover, Brent calmly talked the girl into dropping t=
he gun, then kicked it away, averting further catastrophe. For his heroic a=
ctions, Brent has garnered media attention, but most important of all, the =
safety of his classmates and himself.   At the culmination of this campaign=
, one special child will have the once-in-a-lifetime thrill of participatin=
g in the traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Par=
ade, officially starting the 75th annual trek down Broadway -- live on nati=
onal TV! In addition to the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the child and his or h=
er family will receive airfare and hotel accommodations for four, as well a=
s VIP viewing of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Broadcast live on NBC on N=
ovember 22nd, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will get the holiday season st=
arted in grand style!   Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade marks its 75th Anniv=
ersary this year, making it the longest running show on Broadway. Started i=
n 1924 as Macy's Christmas Parade, the Parade has grown in size and scope t=
hrough its remarkable 75-year history, becoming an American holiday traditi=
on, which has touched millions of lives around the world. With its high-fly=
ing fun, Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which has been broadcast live for =
