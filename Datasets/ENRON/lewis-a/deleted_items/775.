   AMCC Develops Zambezi, Offering STS Cross-Connect Solution for Line Card=
 Operations Up to 40Gb/s=1DDesigned to Interface Seamlessly With the Mekong=
 and S2509, Zambezi Completes AMCC's Comprehensive, Digital Cross-Connect S=
olution   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits =
Corp. (AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Monday announced Zambezi (S8710), an STS-1 cross=
-connect grooming fabric designed for line card use.   Targeted for add/dro=
p MUX systems, digital cross-connects and multi-service switches, this devi=
ce is optimized to enable 10Gb/s, 20Gb/s, and 40Gb/s line cards to be built=
 with an integrated first and last, or Nth, stage grooming fabric. This sol=
ution is capable of switching from the STS-1 level up to and including STS-=
768c traffic, including arbitrarily concatenated traffic. Zambezi's single-=
stage, non-blocking, switch architecture, easily enables broadcast and mult=
icast configurations. In addition, the device offers an industry-leading lo=
w power dissipation of 8W (typical).   Dual 768x768 (40Gb/s) logical-partit=
ioning of the internal switch fabric and dual-casted IO interfaces allow a =
single element to be used as the 1st and Nth stages of a larger, multi-stag=
e, CLOS switch. Zambezi is unique in offering dual-casted I/Os, allowing fo=
r seamless switching between the redundant core-stage switch elements. Sixt=
een I/O ports can be dual-casted allowing this device to directly drive and=
 monitor redundant, core-stage switch elements. Zambezi can also be used st=
and-alone or as the core stage element in a multi-stage fabric as a 1536 x =
1536 (80Gb/S) fully non-blocking switch.   "Zambezi is an extension of our =
STS-1 switching capability previously demonstrated in our devices such as D=
anube and Missouri," said Neal Neslusan, director of marketing at AMCC. "Th=
is is the first device which can be coupled with our next generation pointe=
r processors for capability of supporting traffic up to OC-768c."   The cro=
ss-connect offers the capability to configure all of the I/Os to either 622=
Mb/s or 2.5Gb/s on a per I/O basis. Many of the pointer processors availabl=
e today that may interface to a device such as Zambezi, do not offer 2.5Gb/=
s I/Os. Zambezi's dual-rate IO capabilities support a direct interface to t=
hese pointer processor chips. This capability includes support of a direct =
interface to AMCC's recently announced Mekong device. Customers may choose =
to use Zambezi in conjunction with Mekong and S2509 for complete port densi=
ty utilization of the Zambezi.   Pricing and Availability  Zambezi (S8710) =
is offered in a 624-pin PBGA package and priced at $590.00 in volume quanti=
ties. It is scheduled for sampling in October 2001 and volume production Q1=
 of 2002.   About AMCC  AMCC designs, develops, manufactures, and markets h=
