   Broadcom Introduces High-Performance Single-Chip All-CMOS Bluetooth Radi=
o   MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bluetooth Congress =
2001   Blutonium(TM) Chip Combines Radio and Baseband Functions on         =
  Monolithic High-Performance Single-Chip Transceiver  Broadcom Corporation=
 (Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadb=
and communications, today introduced the Broadcom(R) BCM2033 single-chip tr=
ansceiver for Bluetooth(TM) wireless applications. Integrating previously d=
eveloped, Bluetooth-compliant radio and baseband components onto a single h=
igh-performance integrated circuit, the chip minimizes component counts and=
 board space requirements while providing a high-performance solution to th=
e Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment=
 manufacturers.   The Blutonium(TM) BCM2033 achieves the highest performanc=
e of any single-chip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry, combining Bluet=
ooth-qualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip. O=
n-board Fractional-N synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with pr=
actically any reference frequency available. This is especially useful in c=
urrent and third generation (3G) cellular phones in which a wide variety of=
 crystal oscillators are available. Featuring high levels of integration an=
d minimal off-chip filters or other active components, the BCM2033 provides=
 excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally =
suited for harsh radio frequency (RF) environments, such as inside mobile p=
hones and laptop computers. In addition, the chip's unique design allows it=
 to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature rang=
e of between -40 and +105 degrees centigrade, an accomplishment unparallele=
d in the industry.   "With our previously announced Blutonium products, we =
demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance de=
signing chips in a standard digital CMOS process," said K.C. Murphy, Vice P=
resident and General Manager of Broadcom's RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Bus=
iness Unit. "We've now applied Broadcom's well-known integration expertise =
by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintain=
ing unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers. As a result, we're =
unveiling the single-chip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiti=
ng for, with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution, =
regardless of the process technology."   The BCM2033 is based upon Broadcom=
's previous all-CMOS stand-alone radios and basebands that have already ach=
ieved Bluetooth Version 1.1 qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth sp=
ecification in most areas. This means that devices such as mobile phones an=
d PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest =
version of the Bluetooth specification, easing the process by which these d=
evices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products. The BCM2033 benefits=
 from this previous development, achieving strong performance in key areas =
such as linearity and receiver sensitivity, attaining a sensitivity figure =
of better than -82 dBm.   Integration of the previously developed circuits =
onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line, lik=
e all Broadcom chip products, was developed in a standard digital CMOS (or =
Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) manufacturing process. No other pr=
ocess allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transce=
iver.   "By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with=
 standalone products, we've chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetoot=
h component development program," said Scott Bibaud, Director of Marketing =
for Broadcom's Bluetooth Products. "With these multiple Blutonium elements =
integrated onto a single cost-effective chip, we can now leverage Broadcom'=
s proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components=
 in production quantities to our customers around the world."   Key Feature=
s  The BCM2033 has been designed to provide very high performance in Blueto=
oth applications with a single transceiver. Notable features include:   -- =
 Strong spurious emissions performance -- the BCM2033 minimizes     interfe=
rence from transmissions taking place in the bands used by     mobile phone=
s, providing robust connections between Bluetooth     devices.  --  Excepti=
onal blocking performance -- the highly linear design     eliminates the ne=
ed for costly off-chip RF filtering to receive     reliable signals from ot=
her Bluetooth devices.  --  Fractional-N Synthesizer -- this synthesizer en=
ables the 2033 to     use any existing frequency reference, including those=
 commonly     available in mobile phones such as CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, an=
d     UMTS, eliminating the need for an off-chip crystal.  --  Extensive so=
ftware support -- the BCM2033 is software-compatible     with protocol stac=
ks developed by leading third party stack     vendors, as well as with Broa=
dcom's internal stack.  --  Cost-effective memory architecture -- on-chip m=
emory eliminates     the need for off-chip flash while allowing the use of =
additional     memory when appropriate.  --  Requires minimal off-chip comp=
onents -- by eliminating all     external active components, the BCM2033 re=
quires just a few     passive components, providing very limited bill of ma=
terials (BOM)     and board space impact on OEM equipment designs.     Avai=
lability  The version of the BCM2033 with no external memory bus is package=
d in a 64-pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array (fpBGA) and the version with exter=
nal flash interfaces is packaged in a 100-pin fpBGA. The transceiver is sam=
pling now to early access customers.   About Broadcom  Broadcom Corporation=
