<1> Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Cautionary words from Alan Greenspan cooled Equities and
boosted Treasuries, while the Dollar held steady despite
Argentina uncertainties.  The Dow dropped below 10,000.
Gold rallied but Silver retreated, although not much, as
lease rates eased, and Copper closed firm.  Grains
rebounded strongly on bullish government reports, with
Wheat and Soybeans advancing to new highs.  Most
commodities ended lower, however.  Energy markets sagged
on renewed concern about OPEC compliance, high inventories
and lagging demand.  Cattle declined as rolling and
spreading influenced trading, while Coffee suffered a late
tumble and lost half the week's gains.  Cocoa, Sugar and
Cotton all finished lower, though Bellies and Hogs enjoyed
gains on positive cash talk.

- Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator
