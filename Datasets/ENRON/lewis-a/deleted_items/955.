reater Flexibility and Streamlined Operations   SAN DIEGO, Oct 29, 2001 (BU=
SINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), the leader in mobile =
communications for the transportation industry, today announced the availab=
ility of QTRACS(R)/Web, a new Web-based interface to the OmniTRACS(R) and O=
mniExpress(R) mobile communications systems. QTRACS/Web helps trucking comp=
anies manage two-way data communication with their fleet. This secure, easy=
-to-use, Web-based product allows companies to access their fleet data thro=
ugh a Web browser and view current and historical vehicle locations, and di=
splay them on a scalable, street-level map.   "QTRACS/Web provides trucking=
 companies with flexibility, as it lets dispatchers and managers access fle=
et information from outside the office, such as from home," said Chris Wolf=
e, president of QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions. "QUALCOMM's Web-based=
 service also helps trucking companies with multiple facilities to streamli=
ne their operations and improve their productivity, since all terminals, re=
gardless of their location, have access to the same information."   QTRACS/=
Web is available in two versions: Customer-Hosted and QUALCOMM-Hosted. QTRA=
CS/Web Customer-Hosted is for companies who prefer to host and maintain the=
ir own Web server, and who have multiple offices connected via a network. T=
his version provides advanced functions such as security, maintenance and i=
ntegration at the central office, and user functions such as access to key =
operational data from remote offices. QTRACS/Web QUALCOMM-Hosted is for cus=
tomers who prefer access to fleet data via the Internet. For customers elec=
ting to use QTRACS/Web QUALCOMM-Hosted, QUALCOMM hosts and maintains all se=
rvers, software and customer data.   QUALCOMM has helped the transportation=
 industry become more efficient since 1988 when the introduction of the Omn=
iTRACS mobile communications system provided transportation companies with =
an innovative and effective way of managing logistics. Its fleet management=
 solutions continue to set the standard by offering products and services t=
hat meet the demands of a constantly changing marketplace. With the introdu=
ction of OmniExpress, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based digital =
wireless communications and tracking system, along with asset tracking and =
other industry-leading technologies, QUALCOMM continues to expand into new =
mobile markets. With a Network Management Center that processes more than s=
even million transactions each day and over 400,000 QUALCOMM mobile systems=
 shipped to businesses in more than 32 countries on four continents, QUALCO=
MM continues to lead the industry in providing wireless data solutions.   Q=
