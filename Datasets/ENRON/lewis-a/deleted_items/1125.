Dear Investor,

If you don't own the companies we own at my BLUE CHIP
GROWTH advisory--companies with great earnings--you're
missing out:

*Enterprise software-maker PeopleSoft reported on
October 18, smashing expectations.  The stock POPPED
9% the next day.  Better yet, it's UP 50% since
October 1st.

*Bike icon Harley Davidson beat the Street on October
9th.  The stock ROSE 12% the next day--and as I write,
it's UP 39% in 5 weeks' time.

*Tech-titan Emulex posted Street-beating numbers on
October 18.  The stock SOARED 23% the next day.  And
it's UP 166% since the beginning of the month!!!

We own all these stocks--and some 20 more like them--
at BLUE CHIP GROWTH.  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the
EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Frankly, most investors are missing out--and will
continue to miss out, too.  Half of them are sitting
on the sidelines, because they're scared and worried
there's no safe way to make money.  The other half are
jumping in, because "things are cheap," but they're
buying the WRONG STOCKS--companies with lousy earnings
and little hope of recovery anytime soon.

IF YOU WANT to make money now, you've got to own the
only stocks that traders want to buy today.  And
those, my friend, are our EARNINGS MONSTERS.  Profits
at our companies are consistently rising 30%-to-80% or
more--and Wall Street is rewarding their stellar
performance.  Three more examples:

*Dynegy beat the Street again in the 3rd quarter--it's
up 39% in the last 16 trading days.

*Thanks to top-flight earnings growth, United Health
Group is bucking the bear market trend--now up 35%
from its 52-week lows.

*And on Thursday September 20th--after the market
reopened and the Dow dropped nearly 400 points--one of
my favorites, Tenet Healthcare, rose about 3%.  Why?
Because they announced they would beat analysts'
expectations yet again.  That's the only kind of stock
you want to own now--it's up 61% since mid-January!

And that's in a HORRIBLE environment for stocks
overall.  Imagine how well our EARNINGS MONSTER
strategy works in better times. Since I started my
BLUE CHIP GROWTH advisory in late 1997, our portfolio
has beaten the S&P better than 2-to-1, thanks to our
commitment to earnings quality.  And the advisory I
started 16 years ago, MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in
that time, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We
SOLD Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209%
gains overall from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart.  All
stocks we SOLD last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS--and sold them before they fell.  That's why
I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS--in any kind of market.

Today, consensus opinion states that 9 rate cuts...tax
rebates...one round of tax cuts with more to follow...and
a stimulus package that could reach $100 billion, will
combine to KICK-START the economy again.  Problem is,
with everything that has happened, no one knows
exactly when.

But if you own today's EARNINGS MONSTERS, you don't
have to worry.  You can make money now--and bank even
BIGGER GAINS once a shred of optimism returns to the
overall market.  Quick 30%, 40%, 50% pops that lead to
profits like we banked previously from Dell Computer
(+320.%), Vodafone AirTouch (+196.0%) and Nokia
(+316.%)...back when these companies were EARNING
MONSTERS, too.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. Profits at most companies have fallen off a
cliff.  But not at the companies we own at BLUE CHIP
GROWTH.  Over the past two quarters our EARNINGS
MONSTERS met or BEAT expectations about 95% of the
time.  So far in the 3rd quarter, we're 18-for-19--and
we're seeing nice gains, even in this difficult time.

PROFITS yet to come.  Click here now:
