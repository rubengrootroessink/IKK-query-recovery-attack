            <P><I>It is a pleasure to bring you up to date on the outstanding
            performance of our last 3 Featured Companies. Since introducing you
            to Energy Power Systems (OTC/BB: EYPSF), Pacific Magtron
            International Corp. (NASDAQ: PMIC), and Cetalon Corporation (OTC/BB:
            CETA), all three companies have enjoyed tremendous upside moves.
            Better yet, all of these companies continue to trade at much higher
            levels than when we first brought them to our readers!</I></P>

            announced that it would be <B>adapting its systems to test for

            <P>LOS ANGELES, Oct. 15 /PRNewswire/ -- Pollution Research and
            Control Corporation (Nasdaq: <A
            href="http://stockscape.stockpoint.com/stockscape/quote.asp?Dmode=YES&amp;Symbol=PRCC">PRCC</A>
            - news) a developer and marketer of air pollution measurement
            instruments for the past thirty years announces today that it has
            commenced initial adaptation of the products of Dasibi Environmental
            Corporation, the Company's subsidiary, to be able to test for
            chemical and biological agents including Anthrax and others in the
            ambient air. Pursuant to the previously announced planned spin off
            of a majority stake in Dasibi, PRCC has exclusively licensed back
            the use and commercialization of the Dasibi ambient air monitoring
            instruments for such purposes on a worldwide basis.
            <P>The specific system being adapted is the 7001, a ``suspended''
            particle analyzer, which collects all material in the ambient air
            from .1 micron to 2.5 micron and deposits it in a defined area on a
            moving tape. After analysis for weight by beta-ray attenuation, the
            material is available on the tape for further analysis. A sharp
            pointed pencil dot is approximately in the 30-micron size range.
            Above 10 micron size will settle to the earth in a reasonable period
            of time (weeks and months). Below 2.5 micron, the particles tend to
            remain suspended in the ambient air. A particle of Anthrax is
            approximately 1 micron in size.
            <P>The application for investigation is that moving, defined groups
            of particles may be rapidly analyzed for biological and/or chemical
            make up for automatically telemetered alarm purposes in the existing
            United States country-wide network used currently for air pollutant
            and meteorological mapping and forecasting.
            <P>Dasibi's measurement instruments have been sold for the past
            thirty years and are in place in many countries throughout the
            world. Customers include domestic and foreign governments and
            municipalities as well as private corporations.
