On Oct. 1 we recommended 13 Telecosm stocks that were being given away at "firesale"
prices.

Most of these stocks were up between 30% and 50% in 10 days, and we suggested
exiting these stocks as the $NDX pushed into Fibonacci Cluster Resistance.

Another buying opportunity will likely present itself in mid November.

You will want to know where to get back into these stocks.

SUBSCRIBE TO THE NOV. ISSUE OF OUR TELECOSM "WATCH LIST"
AT A 50% DICOUNT FROM OUR REGULAR RATE OF $49.

PAY ONLY $24 FOR NOV ISSUE or $49 FOR NOV. & DEC.
