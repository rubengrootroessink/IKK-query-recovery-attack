quityAlert.com.     New Report Analyzes How to Succeed in the Integrated Op=
tics Business With Bookham Technology and Lightwave Microsystems as Example=
s   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct 23, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Communica=
tions Industry Researchers, Inc. (CIR), a leading market research and indus=
try analyst firm, announces a new report that analyzes key success factors =
in the market for integrated optical components and shows how two relativel=
y small companies -- Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology -- have =
been able to emerge as leaders in this business along with giants Agere, Al=
catel, JDS Uniphase and Nortel. This new report considers the managerial, t=
echnological, marketing and financial aspects of these two companies' penet=
ration of the optical integration marketplace.   Why Integrated Optics is a=
 Big Boy's Business   CIR believes that, for the time being at least, becau=
se manufacturing know-how is so much a part of the secret sauce of integrat=
ed optical components companies, these companies must typically own their o=
wn plants. Factories cost "big bucks" -- and CIR believes that it takes $10=
0 million in resources to be a player in the optical integration game. As a=
 result, the market for integrated optics is going to be dominated by the l=
argest component manufacturers, especially Agere, Alcatel, JDS Uniphase and=
 Nortel.   Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham Technology are two smaller co=
mpanies that are focused on optical integration and both have crossed the $=
100 million funding barrier by a substantial margin. The new CIR report sta=
tes that Lightwave Microsystems' initial success has been largely due to ch=
arismatic leadership while Bookham's can be traced to its close initial rel=
ationship with Nortel. However, the current photonic "nuclear winter" means=
 that the stability of both companies' customer bases is uncertain. Orders =
from the largest equipment companies have declined rapidly and many equipme=
nt start-ups seem likely to disappear in a massive shakeout in the next yea=
r. The good news for Bookham investors is that Bookham currently gets most =
of its business from Lucent, Nortel, Fujitsu and Marconi and despite their =
current woes, these companies are most likely to survive the downturn. Alth=
ough it does not reveal customer information, Lightwave Microsystems also a=
ppears to be focusing its efforts on making inroads with the largest equipm=
ent companies and CIR research indicates that it has already achieved a sig=
nificant mindshare with these customers.   More Ambition Needed?   CIR beli=
eves that if Lightwave Microsystems and Bookham are to continue to be succe=
ssful, they will have to be "more ambitious" in seeking competitive advanta=
ge in their core technologies and integrated product strategies.   Lightwav=
e Microsystems is using a version of silica-on-silicon integration technolo=
gy. However, the new CIR report notes that this approach is being used by m=
any other companies and so offers no long-term competitive advantage to thi=
s company. Indeed, the new CIR report provides evidence that the silica-on-=
silicon processes may have significant technical limitations, which may act=
ually restrict Lightwave Microsystems opportunities in the future. And, whi=
le acknowledging that Bookham's all-silicon approach may have more long-ter=
m potential, the report also says that both companies' product road maps fo=
r integrated optical products have been somewhat timid -- they both appear =
to be focused on offering combinations of a MUX/DEMUX and Variable Optical =
Attenuator. The report points out that the market for such products is quit=
e limited. It says that if the integrated optics market is ever going to ta=
ke off, all companies operating in this space are going to have to make goo=
d on their currently vague promises of more exciting integrated optics prod=
ucts with additional functionality and cost/performance improvements.   The=
 report concludes with an analysis of Bookham's and Lightwave Microsystems'=
 future prospects and strategic options, including the possibility that the=
y may be acquired.   The report is available starting at $895.00 (U.S.) and=
