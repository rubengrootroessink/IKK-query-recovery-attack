unications Board of Directors=1DFormer Broadcom Executive Brings Extensive =
Experience in Semiconductor and Networking Industries   FREMONT, Calif., No=
v 26, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ikanos Communications, Inc., a developer of s=
mart silicon for profitable broadband, today announced that G. `Ven' Venkat=
esh has joined the company's board of directors. Venkatesh brings extensive=
 entrepreneurial and sales experience in the semiconductor and communicatio=
ns industries to Ikanos. The company recently introduced a family of progra=
mmable chipsets that enable equipment vendors to develop products that deli=
ver speeds scalable from 64 Kbps to 100 Mbps at a distance of up to 5,000 f=
eet over existing copper infrastructure. The chipsets support multiple high=
-speed technologies and international standards, including Long Range Fast =
Ethernet(TM) (LRFE), Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM), and Very High Bit Ra=
te Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL-DMT).   Venkatesh is an entrepreneur, exec=
utive, and investor who serves on the boards of several technology companie=
s. Most recently, he was vice president of switching products at Broadcom C=
orp. Venkatesh previously was president and CEO of Maverick Networks, which=
 he founded in 1998 and which Broadcom acquired in 1999. A resident entrepr=
eneur at Mayfield Fund in 1995, Venkatesh was recruited by Mayfield to be p=
resident and CEO of Silicon Light Machines, acquired by Cypress Semiconduct=
ors in 2000. Earlier, he spent ten years at Adaptec, Inc., as general manag=
er and a senior executive officer.   "I joined Ikanos' board because the co=
mpany has great technology, excellent products, and really smart people, se=
veral of whom I've worked with before, including Ikanos CEO Rajesh Vashist,=
" said Venkatesh. "Now Ikanos is at a significant junction in its growth, a=
nd I can support the company by helping it to grow to the next phase of cus=
tomer acquisition."   "Because its chipsets are standards based, Ikanos has=
 the potential to dominate the market for broadband-over-copper solutions,"=
 said Venkatesh. "The company will thus play an important role in bringing =
high-speed access to small and medium-sized businesses and homes. I expect =
that the markets Ikanos targets -- Multi-Tenant/Multi-Dwelling Units, Metro=
 Fiber Extension, and Long Range Ethernet -- will be as big or bigger than =
the enterprise networking market."   "Ikanos is thrilled to have Ven join t=
he board. He has the kind of experience that Ikanos can benefit from at thi=
s point in its development," said Rajesh Vashist, president and CEO of Ikan=
os. "Ven is an industry veteran who's launched and scaled up several techno=
logy startups. With his vast experience in management and technology, Ven w=
ill strengthen Ikanos' future in the telecom industry."   About Ikanos Comm=
unications  Founded in 1999 and based in Silicon Valley, Ikanos Communicati=
ons, Inc., has created a new class of silicon that serves the entire range =
of worldwide broadband markets and applications with a single programmable =
