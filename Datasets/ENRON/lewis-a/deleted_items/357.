* Business Description

Single Source Financial Services Corporation is a New York
corporation formed on September 19, 1994.
Our Company was incorporated under the name Ream
Printing Paper Corporation (Ream). In October 1994, the
Company issued its shares to its shareholders in exchange for
assets in another company. Ream was then spun off. The
exchange was accomplished under Rule 504 of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and a Form D
was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In November 2000, the Company changed its name to Single
Source Financial Services Corporation. The current control
group of shareholders, which includes the officers, directors,
and their spouses, took control of the Company on July 24,
2000 in a private transaction

The Company is currently offering, or is in negotiations to
offer, the following products and or services:

* Electronic Transaction Processing Equipment
Single Source Financial Services Corporation sells electronic
transaction processing equipment to merchants who wish to
offer credit card and debit card payment options to their
customers.  The Company utilizes an outside leasing company
to provide those merchants who elect not to purchase the
equipment with the option of a lease.  Leasing accounts for
the majority of the Company's income from these activities.

The Company is actively pursuing either the acquisition or
formation of a leasing company. By cutting out the
"middle-man" and carrying its own leases, the Company
expects to dramatically increase revenues.

* Credit Card Processing Service
Single Source Financial Services Corporation currently
markets and sells the credit card processing services of
CardReady International, Inc.

The Company has secured an option to acquire CardReady
International, Inc.  If the acquisition is completed, the
Company will be able to provide processing services directly
to its own customers.  The Company will then also be able to
act as a third-party processor to independent sales
organizations around the country.

The Company's websites are located at
www.mysinglesource.com and  www.cardready.com.

* Analyst Summary

The credit card processing market has reached explosive levels
in the last few years.  In 1999 and 2000, industry-wide,
card-based payments increased by 16% and 14% respectively,
with debit card usage leading the way in growth.  In the year
2000, card-based payments represented 29% of all domestic
payment transactions.  By the year 2010, it is estimated that
card-based payments will represent almost 50% of all
domestic payment transactions.
With the acquisition of a processor (CardReady International,
Inc.), the Company will be able to dramatically increase its
processing revenues as well as its market share.  CardReady
International's sales and marketing operations are currently
adding more than 100 to 200 new accounts per month, each
worth from $500 to $1,000 in annual income.  Further, the
Company is in negotiations with independent sales
organizations to add more that 1,000 new accounts per
month.

Single Source Financial Services Corporation plans to expand
its operations to include various other financial products and
services. Once this is accomplished, the Company will be able
to effectively cross-sell to its ever-expanding client base.    As
credit cards have become the main method of payment for
goods and services , the credit card processing market has
realized explosive growth.  Single Source Financial Services
Corporation has positioned itself to capitalize on new market
opportunities by targeting a growing market sector largely left
untapped by bigger providers: Small to mid-sized businesses.
