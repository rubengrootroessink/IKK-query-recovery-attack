Stock Gains Cut In Half

May 31, 2001 - Jittery investors cut a strong rally in half on Thursday,
as earnings and economic worries continued to weigh on the market.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ rose 7 to 252, and the Nasdaq
climbed 25 to 2110. The S&P 500 added 7 to 1255, and the Dow rose 39 to
10,911. Volume dropped to 1.15 billion shares on the NYSE, and 1.81
billion on the Nasdaq. Advancers led 18 to 12 on the NYSE, and 22 to 15 on
the Nasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at

and news, visit our after hours trading site at

After the close, Novellus (NASDAQ:NVLS) rose after saying its quarter is
on target, but Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) warned.

Traders awaited Friday morning's unemployment and purchasing management
reports. A speech by Dallas Fed President Robert McTeer raised concern
that a recovery may still be some time off.

Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) rose .73 to 15.24 on rumors that a big contract win
could help the company make its quarter, which ended today. But analysts
expect the company to warn as soon as tomorrow or Monday.

Worldcom (NASDAQ:WCOM), up .37 to 17.91, was rumored to be a takeover
candidate of BellSouth (NYSE:BLS). Didn't we tell you the Baby Bells were
going to win the telecom war?

i2 (NASDAQ:ITWO) managed to gain .01 to 20.15 on news that Manugistics
(NASDAQ:MANU), up 1.20 to 35.85, may win large supply chain contracts from
Ford and Nissan. But i2 held its uptrend line at today's low of 19.40 (see
chart below and today's Morning Report).

StarMedia (NASDAQ:STRM) surged .81 to 2.82 on investments from BellSouth,
Primedia and JPMorgan Partners.

Optical stocks were mixed, as negative comments from analysts continued to
roll in. Nortel (NYSE:NT) slipped .02 to 13.33, and JDS Uniphase
(NASDAQ:JDSU) lost .07 to 16.87. But Sycamore (NASDAQ:SCMR) surged 1.15 to
10.14, and Tellabs (NASDAQ:TLAB) added .45 to 34.38.

Not much of a rally today, which could be a hint of more downside ahead.
Given the technical breakdowns yesterday, that wouldn't be too surprising.
Tomorrow morning's employment and NAPM reports should dictate short-term
direction, although earnings warnings may play a role too. As long as the
S&P 500 holds 1200 support and the Nasdaq holds 2000, the market looks
okay; below those levels, a retest of the lows becomes likely. The Dow
(first chart) turned back below the important 11,000 level. The index has
support about every 100 points below that level, and would trade with a
negative bias below 10,600. The S&P 500 (second chart) turned back below
the important 1265 level, the neckline of a potential inverted
head-and-shoulders bottom. The index could find support in the 1218-1242
range. One positive is that the Nasdaq (third chart) appears to be back
above its September downtrend line, which is now around 2080-2100.
2052-2060 is the next support below 2080-2100. The Nasdaq 100 (fourth
chart) is sitting right above important support at 1740-1760.
