ityAlert.com.     TI's TurboDOX(TM) Technology Solution Increases DOCSIS(TM=
) Upstream Capacity; New Technology Provides Faster Consumer Broadband Cabl=
e Internet Surfing   DALLAS, Nov 26, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- A new =
software solution from Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) dram=
atically increases the network capacity for cable operators and enhances th=
e consumer's cable broadband experience. The solution is designed to improv=
e the performance of TI's data over cable service interface specification (=
DOCSIS) 1.1 software solution. TI's TurboDOX solution enables cable operato=
rs to expand up to three times the number of modems serviced over a single =
channel, while simultaneously improving the user experience by speeding ups=
tream data flow. (See http://www.ti.com/sc/cablemodem .)   "The TurboDOX so=
lution gives cable operators a tremendous opportunity to deliver improved u=
pstream capacity and application performance, while fully benefiting from T=
I's leading DOCSIS 1.1 technology," said Brett Butler, General Manager of T=
I's Broadband Cable and Wireless Communications. "TI is well equipped to pr=
ovide manufacturers the complete design support resources, technology and t=
ools they need to deliver the optimum solution for their systems."   The ne=
w TurboDOX software extends TI's DOCSIS 1.1 solution, by including Internet=
 Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group standards compatibility, witho=
ut requiring any additional infrastructure investments. In addition, TurboD=
OX technology uses sophisticated algorithms to improve efficiency and reduc=
e latency in broadband networks. The resulting increase in reverse-path cap=
acity enables cable operators to provide subscribers with data and a full s=
uite of interactive digital services over Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) networks.=
   Cable operators nationwide are fully embracing network upgrades for the =
technology since Cable Labs' recent wave of DOCSIS 1.1 certification. With =
two TI-based cable modems having achieved the critical CableLabs certificat=
ion, TI recently became the only supplier able to provide manufacturers wit=
h a complete certified DOCSIS 1.1 solution, including hardware and software=
.   "DOCSIS 1.1 technology is critical for maximizing the value of broadban=
d cable IP networks, and TI's TurboDOX works within these existing standard=
s, requiring no proprietary silicon," said Michael Harris, president of res=
earch firm Kinetic Strategies Inc. "TI's solution enables Multiple Service =
Operators (MSOs) the ability to develop clearly differentiated delivery pla=
tforms for the optimal transmission of data and broadband services, fully l=
everaging their investments in DOCSIS 1.1."   About TI Broadband   For OEM'=
s developing broadband communications solutions, TI's advanced signal proce=
ssing-based silicon and software platforms deliver the optimal performance,=
 lower power consumption, and system level integration required to rapidly =
