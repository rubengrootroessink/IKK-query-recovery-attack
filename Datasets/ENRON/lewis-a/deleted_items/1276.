 for Interoperable Voice Over Broadband Services   RICHARDSON, Texas, Nov 1=
9, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OpenVoB(tm), the industry consortium dedicated t=
o accelerating the deployment of Voice-over-Broadband (www.openvob.org), to=
day announced the success of the group's third and fourth CallFests(tm), mu=
lti-vendor interoperability test events held Oct. 7-15 and Nov. 12-16, 2001=
, at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability Laboratory in Durham,=
 N.H.   These CallFests focused on interoperability between multiple voice =
gateway and integrated access devices (IADs) based on the ATM Forum's Loop =
Emulation Services (LES) voice over AAL2 specification. The testing was don=
e to address provisioning and management of the IADs based on the ATM Forum=
's recently released LES EOC/MIB specification.   CallFests form a critical=
 step in the mass deployment of voice over broadband services. Testing of t=
he LES EOC/MIB specification will ultimately enable service providers to su=
pport flow through provisioning of new services.   In a network able to sup=
port flow-through provisioning, an order is entered by a customer service r=
epresentative on the top-most system, and it "flows through" all other inte=
rmediate systems, finally affecting the configuration of the network to set=
 up an end-to-end circuit. Provisioning is automated, reducing costs and er=
rors. Flow-through provisioning ensures that the cost of provisioning a der=
ived voice line will not be higher than the costs of a POTS circuit nor as =
error prone as manual provisioning.   "CallFest III and IV were largely suc=
cessful because of the dedication and commitment shown by the members and e=
quipment vendors that were present," stated Paul Drew, OpenVoB Technical Ed=
itor and Interoperability manager. "We are enthusiastic about the progress =
that we have made and look forward to future CallFests and assisting the st=
andards bodies in advancing the roll-out of voice over broadband technology=
."   OpenVoB is working with the University of New Hampshire's InterOperabi=
lity Laboratory to establish an on-going interoperability testing network w=
ithin their labs which has been made possible through the generous support =
of leading access network and testing vendors including Cisco Systems (Ligh=
tStream 1010 ATM Switch), Avail Networks (Frontera 2200 SHDSL Access Switch=
), Sage Instruments (935AT Voice Quality Tester), Malden Electronics (DSLA =
Speech Performance Measurement System), RADCOM (ATM Protocol Analyzer) and =
Spirent Communications (Abacus Class 5 Switch Simulator).   The end product=
 of the OpenVoB CallFest series is a set of validated implementation models=
 and corresponding test plans that will be submitted to the appropriate sta=
ndards bodies to help accelerate the adoption and deployment of voice over =
broadband technology and services.   If you are interested in participating=
 in upcoming CallFests or becoming a member of OpenVoB, please send an e-ma=
il to info@openvob.org.   About OpenVoB  OpenVoB (or Open Voice over Broadb=
and) was formed to meet the expressed needs of service providers planning t=
o deploy voice over broadband services by facilitating multi-vendor, system=
-level interoperability of packetized voice services based on existing and =
emerging industry specifications. The group leverages a cooperative enginee=
ring approach to create deployment models and test plans that enable and pr=
omote the development of interoperable gateways, IADs, softswitches and oth=
er VoB products from multiple vendors.   Current broadband-enabling member =
companies of the OpenVoB include 2Wire, Accelerated Networks (Nasdaq:ACCL),=
 Accordion Networks, ADTRAN (Nasdaq:ADTN), Atlantic Telecom, Avail Networks=
, Broadcom Corporation (Nasdaq:BRCM), Brecis Communications, Convergent Net=
works, Efficient Networks, General Bandwidth, GlobeSpan (Nasdaq:GSPN), Inte=

, Sphere Communications, Texas Instruments' Telogy Networks (Nasdaq:TXN), V=
INA Technologies (Nasdaq:VINA) and Xavi.   Members of OpenVoB have drafted =
a white paper that outlines the pressing need for this organization and pre=
sents a road map detailing the steps the group is taking to reach its prima=
ry objectives. The white paper can be found on the OpenVoB Web site (http:/=
