 =09 [IMAGE]  INVESTOR ALERT:   SEC Eases Buyback Restrictions - Creates Hu=
ge Buying Opportunity!    Despite a down market dominated by news of the te=
rrorist attacks, poor earnings estimates and increasing corporate layoffs, =
a bright spot has emerged that has created a potentially  huge buying oppor=
tunity for investors who act immediately.   In an attempt to improve market=
 conditions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has temporarily r=
elaxed regulatory restrictions governing company stock buybacks. This move =
has created a fervor on Wall Street, resulting in 150 new buyback announcem=
ents over the past week alone, with additional companies announcing stock b=
uybacks every day.    "This announcement gives investors who focus on stock=
 buybacks a serious advantage in the current market," says David Fried, edi=
tor of the highly-successful advisory The Buyback Letter . "Investors shoul=
d be careful, however, since not every company announcing a stock buyback i=
s necessarily a good company to invest in. Investors will  want to separate=
 the good investment candidates from the  bad before purchasing the stock."=
   The move temporarily lifts a ban on companies repurchasing their stock i=
n the first or last half hour of trading. Additionally, a company which was=
 normally restricted to purchasing only 25% of its average daily trading vo=
lume in a given day can now purchase an amount of stock equal to 100% of th=
e average daily trading volume in its stock for the prior month.   "Compani=
es can now buy back their stocks while share prices are at their weakest," =
Fried says. "As these companies reduce their shares outstanding, the earnin=
gs per share increase, making each share more valuable. This is ultimately =
reflected in share prices."  In the current issue of The Buyback Letter (av=
ailable FREE for 30 days from INVESTools ), Fried uncovers eight undervalue=
d "Best Buy" stocks that represent your best value right now. Insiders in t=
hese eight companies are bullish about their firms, and management are buyi=

ck Buyback Index has gained 137.69%, vs. a mere 52.67% for the S&P 500. His=
 5-stock Buyback Dogs portfolio is up 113% since inception vs. +29% for the=
 S&P and Dow over the same time frame. 19 of Fried's last 22 trades have be=

back Letter     Why The Average Buyback Value Stock  Outperforms The Market=
 By 45.3%:  The New York Times  reports that a study of all U.S. stocks fro=
m 1980-1990 found  that the stock of an average company announcing a repurc=
hase plan will  beat the  market decisively (12.1% for the average company,=
 45.3% for a value stock) in  the four years following the repurchase annou=
ncement.  This makes sense. After all, when a company buys back their own s=
tock, it's  an  enormous vote of confidence  by those who know it best - se=
nior executives. No  one else knows the firm's financial situation, market =
share, business plans,  competitive advantages and new product strategies b=
etter than those with  hands-on, day-to-day experience.  But, these executi=
ves aren't talking. They keep their plans, tactics, and  research behind cl=
osed doors.  The only indicator of their well-founded optimism  is a stock =
buyback. It's a powerful indicator that no serious investor should  ignore.=
   Just how powerful are buyback stocks? In the last 10 years if you had in=
vested  $10,000 in a typical S&P 500 portfolio, you investment would have g=
rown to  $67,917 - an excellent return. But that same $10,000 invested excl=
usively in  value buyback stocks would have grown to $130,254 - nearly $70,=
000 more in profits!   The Buyback Letter is available FREE for 30 days fro=
