The STOCK INDEXES & MARKETS

The NASDAQ and S&P 500 were modestly higher overnight due to light
short covering as both markets consolidated some of this week's
losses. I would not be surprised to see the Nasdaq try and test if
not fill Wednesday's gap at 2170.58 on Thursday. Nevertheless, this
week's trendline breakout along with the downturn by momentum
indicators strongly suggests that additional weakness into early-June
appears likely. May's reaction low crossing at 2057.99 is the
Nasdaq's next target. The Sept. S&P was also higher overnight due to
short covering following Wednesday's gap down and lower close.
Wednesday's low fell short of testing May's reaction low at 1256. If
this support is broken, it would open the door for a larger-degree
decline during the first half of June. Momentum indicators are
bearish, which suggest that additional weakness is possible.
Meanwhile, the Dow closed sharply lower on Wednesday confirming the
recent breakout below this spring's uptrend line that crosses near
11,100. If the decline off last week's high continues, May's reaction
low crossing at 10,774.10 is the Dow's next target.

European markets were mixed in overnight trading as overnight gains
on Wall Street tempered some of this week's losses. The UK FTSE- 100
was down 14.20 points at 5782.70 while the German DAX-30 was up 33.83
points at 6075.05 as of 10:01 BST.

The Nikkei gapped down and closed sharply lower overnight as it broke
out below the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally crossing
at 13,363. If the decline continues, the 50% retracement level
crossing at 12,995 is the Nikkei's next target. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness near- term is
possible. The overnight sell off was due to continued selling
pressure of high-tech stocks. The Nikkei closed down 1.7% or 231.21
points to 13,262.14.

INTEREST RATES

September bonds opened higher overnight as they continue to drift
sideways ahead of Friday's employment report. Trade volume remains
thin as Sept. bonds found light support on expectations for
additional weakness in the equity markets on Thursday. Momentum
indicators are turning neutral warning traders to use caution as a
short-term low may be in or near. If the decline off last week's high
resumes, May's reaction low crossing at 98-06 is Sept.'s next target.

The German bond market or Bunds continue to suffer from the euro's
fall to its lowest level against the US Dollar in six months. The
June Bunds were last down 0.24 at 105.83.

Japanese government bond markets were higher overnight due to
weakness in the Nikkei. The lead June 10-year JGB futures closed at
140.59 yen, up 0.40 while the yield on the benchmark No. 231 June
10-year cash bond stood at 1.240%, down 0.040 as of 1515 JT.

The ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower in overnight trading as worries
about refiner's ability to meet summer driving demand continue to
abate. This week's API inventory data review is as follows. Crude oil
stocks fell sharply last week by 3.976 million barrels while unleaded
gasoline stocks rose by 1.611 million barrels last week. Distillate
stocks including heating oil rose by 1.919 million barrels. Refinery
capacity was up 1.00 percentage point of capacity at 95.3%.

July crude oil was lower overnight as it extended Wednesday's decline
due to spillover weakness from unleaded gas. Closes below last week's
low at 28.10 would confirm the recent breakout below this spring's
uptrend line. If the breakout is confirmed, the late-April reaction
low crossing at 27.25 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible.

July heating oil was lower overnight and is below this spring's
uptrend line crossing near 77.60. Multiple closes below this uptrend
line are needed to confirm a top and trend change has taken place.
Spillover selling from unleaded gas continues to pull the rest of the
complex lower. If a trendline breakout is confirmed, May's reaction
low crossing at 74.55 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.

July unleaded gas was sharply lower for the fifth day in a row in
overnight trading as spread unwinding continues and concerns over
summer gasoline supplies ease. Overnight losses led to a breakout
below the March/May uptrend line crossing near 93.25. Multiple closes
below this support level would open the door for a test of May's
reaction low crossing at 91.20 later this spring. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling that additional weakness into early-June is
possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas was lower overnight despite Wednesday's
upside reversal, which was due to short covering following this
week's spike below last October's low crossing at 3.86. Multiple
closes below this support level would opened the door for a possible
test of fib support crossing at 3.64 later this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) remains in a bearish modes signaling
that additional weakness near-term is possible. However, momentum
indicators have become extremely oversold warning bears to use
caution as a corrective bounce is possible.

CURRENCIES

The September Euro posted a new low for the year overnight and has
broken out below last November's low crossing at 85.00. If the
decline continues, a test of last October's lows crossing at 83.77 is
possible later this spring. The daily ADX (a trend-following
indicator) is bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible into early-June are possible.

The September British Pound opened sharply lower overnight due to
light profit taking as it consolidated some of its gains off last
week's low. Nevertheless, momentum indicators are turning neutral to
bullish, which suggests that a short-term low might be in place. I am
looking for sideways trading to continue into the early-part of June.

The September Swiss Franc opened to new contract lows in overnight
trading signaling that this year's decline is resuming. A lower close
during the day session would confirm the recent breakout below last
October's low crossing at .5643 while opening the door for a possible
test of weekly support crossing at .5488 later this year. The ADX (a
trend-following indicator) has entered a bearish trend mode signaling
that sideways to lower prices into June are possible.

The September Canadian Dollar was lower overnight following
Wednesday's key reversal down. The stage is set for a test of this
spring's uptrend line crossing near .6440. Multiple closes below this
support level would confirm a trend change has taken place while
opening the door for sideways to lower prices during the first half
of June. Momentum indicators are bearish warning traders that
additional weakness is possible.

The September Japanese Yen was lower in narrow trading overnight as
it continues to consolidate below trading range resistance that
crosses at .8425. Stochastics and RSI remain bullish but are nearing
their respective overbought zones signaling that time might be
running out for bulls. Closes above.8483 are needed to confirm an
upside breakout of this spring's trading range.

PRECIOUS METALS

August comex gold was lower overnight but is working on a possible
inside day following Wednesday's sharp loss and spike below April's
uptrend line crossing near 267.50. Multiple closes below the uptrend
line would confirm a breakout while opening the door for a test of
this spring's low crossing at 257.30 later this year. Stochastics and
RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness into June is
likely.

July silver was steady overnight as it is working on a possible
inside day to consolidate some of Wednesday's sharp losses. However,
Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that additional
weakness near-term is possible. If the decline off last week's high
continues, a test of trading range support crossing at 4.31 is July's
next target later this year.

July copper was lower overnight as it continues this week's sharp
decline. July's inability to post a short covering bounce on
Wednesday underscores the weak tone of the market as the door is open
for additional weakness and a possible test of May's low at 74.75
later this spring. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices into early-June appears likely.

GRAINS

July corn was fractionally higher overnight as traders await this
morning's export sales report. Pre-report estimates range from
700,000 to 950,000 metric tonnes. While this week's export inspection
report on Tuesday was higher than the previous week, it was still
well below the pace needed to meet the latest USDA export projection.
Traders are expecting to see the USDA to lower their export
projection for this year in the upcoming June supply/demand report.
Any further cuts in export demand will only add to the bearish
carryout level, which is currently projected at 1.989 billion bushels
by this fall. Cool/wet weather across the western Corn Belt continues
to slow early crop development however, the latest planting progress
report shows that 95% of the crop has been planted making this a
non-issue. The recent breakout below weekly support crossing at 1.91
1/2 has opened the door for a possible test of last summer's low
crossing at 1.74 1/2 later this year. Early calls are for July corn
to open steady to a 1/4 cent higher this morning.

July wheat was fractionally higher in overnight trading following
Wednesday's downside reversal. Light support came from light position
squaring ahead of the release of this morning's export sales report
and news that Japan bought 100,000 metric tonnes of July wheat.
Pre-report sales estimates range from 200,000 to 400,000 metric
tonnes. It will take multiple closes above broken support crossing at
2.65 to temper the near term bearish outlook in July wheat. Until
then, the door remains open for a test of weekly gap support crossing
at 2.56 then the long-term pivot level at 2.50 later this spring.
Early calls are for July wheat to open steady to 3/4 of a cent higher
this morning.

SOYBEAN COMPEX

July soybeans were fractionally higher in overnight trading due to
short covering as it consolidated some of this week's losses. This
week's trendline breakout confirmed that a double top was posted with
last Friday's high. The latest planting progress report came in above
the five-year average, which eased planting concerns. Demand remains
strong, which should force the USDA to raise this years export
projection in the June supply/demand report. However,
increased-planted acreage in the US along with a lack of threatening
weather continues to offset the strong demand outlook. Pre-report
sales estimates range from 150,000 to 250,000 metric tonnes. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices into
early-June appear likely. Early calls are for July soybeans to open
steady to a 1/2 cent higher this morning.

July soybean meal was higher overnight due to short covering
following this week's trendline breakout. While domestic and foreign
demand remain strong, this week's break in soybeans brought some
reality back to the market that there are still plenty of soybeans
around. A short covering bounce on Thursday is possible if today's
export sales report comes in at or above expectations. Pre-report
estimates range from 75,000 to 150,000 metric tonnes. Momentum
indicators are turning bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices into early-June appear likely. Early calls are for July
soybean meal to open 20 to 30-cents higher this morning.

LIVESTOCK

August lean hogs closed up $1.65 at $63.35. Prices closed near the
session high. The strong rebound continued, after limit-up gains seen
Tuesday. The market just got too extended on the downside, especially
in the wake Friday's bullish USDA Hogs & Pigs report. Fund buying was
featured Wednesday, sources said. Prices broke out above and negated
a steep five-week-old downtrend. The bulls now have the near-term
edge. However, I would not be surprised to see some sideways
consolidation in the coming sessions. Next resistance lies at $64.00.
First support is located at the 62.00 level.

August live cattle closed off $0.45 at $73.70. Speculative traders
took profits after the recent big runup had pushed the market into
oversold territory. I would not be surprised to see more of a
downside correction soon. Prices pushed to a fresh four-month high
Tuesday. Resistance lies at the $74.50 level. First support lies at
the $73.40 level.

SOFTS

July N.Y. sugar closed 15 points lower at 8.59 cents today. Prices
today dropped to another fresh four-week low as the recent higher
volatility at higher price levels has proven bearish. Also, the rare
and usually bearish broadening formation continues to play out on the
daily bar chart. Bears have the technical edge at present. However,
the market is overdone on the downside at present, on a technical
basis. Next support comes in at 8.40 cents. First resistance is now
seen at 7.72 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 65 points lower at 59.15 cents. Prices came
within 10 points of the contract low set in April. Bears rule. Bulls
can only hope for a strong rebound from the present price level,
which would signal a big double-bottom reversal. Still, given the
upcoming frost season in South America, I suspect the downside from
present levels will be limited in the coffee market. Speculative
short-players won't want to get too brave at this time of year. First
support comes in at the contract low of 58.80 cents. First resistance
is now seen at 63.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $39 lower today, at $964. More technical
damage was inflicted by the bears as prices hit another fresh
three-week low, as there was follow-through selling from Friday's
gap-lower trade. The bears are in control, but the market is
short-term overdone on the downside at present. Next support comes in
at $955. First resistance is now seen at $1,009.

July cotton closed 32 points lower at 40.72 cents. Prices hit a fresh
contract low just yesterday, in the wake of a bearish USDA cotton
consumption report last Friday. Cotton is in a strong bear market and
any rebounds will be selling opportunities for the bears--for now.
Next support lies at 39.95 cents--the contract low. First resistance
is seen around 42.00 cents.
