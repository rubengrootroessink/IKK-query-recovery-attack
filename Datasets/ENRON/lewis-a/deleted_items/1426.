1.	Introduction

Retailers had been showing strength on the Big Chart heading
into Thanksgiving and this week, the sector is analyzed to
see whether or not the momentum was justified.  Conversely,
fast food restaurants continued to fall in the rank as
investors seek out companies with higher rates of expected
growth.

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Retail/Stores/Discount {.RDI} and Retail/Stores/Mail
Order-Catalogs {.RMC} were both showing upward momentum
heading into the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and early signs
suggest that this trend was warranted.  Preliminary reports
out of retailers and TeleCheck Services show that business
was stronger than expected.  Wal-Mart {WMT} generated over
$1.25 billion in revenues on Friday, a record for the
company, while TeleCheck is suggesting that same-store sales
for U.S. retailers increased 2.4 percent over the same day a
year ago.  Internet retailers also saw strong sales volume;
the Wall Street Journal reported this morning that revenues
on Saturday were over 50 percent higher than on the past
several Saturdays.  Should the holiday shopping season
continue to be stronger than expected, stock such as Tuesday
Morning {TUES}, K-Mart {KM}, Williams-Sonoma {WSM}, Dollar
Tree Stores {DLTR} and Lands End {LE} could add onto their
recent price gains.

The resurgence of Computer/Computer Services {.DSE}, a group
that has increased in rank for seven consecutive weeks, has
attracted investors back to foreign-owned tech firms such as
Wipro Ltd. {WIT}, Satyam Computer Services {SAY}, and Terra
Networks {TRLY} - the owner of web portal Lycos.  WIT and
SAY have been rising on optimism that their entry into
Singapore will help to offset declining profits caused by
the weak U.S. economy.  Both companies have better cost
structures than their Singapore rivals and therefore are
using price cuts to win business.  TRLY rose on news that it
is instituting mandatory time off for most of its Lycos
employees between Christmas and New Year's as a cost-saving
measure.  Employees will be required to either use vacation
time or take unpaid leave for that period.

Other groups with rising rankings include
Broadcasting/Programming {.BPE}, Computer/Peripherals {.DPE},
Electronics/Office Equipment {.OFF}, Finance/Leasing {.FLE},
Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE}, and Transport/Cargo-Charter
{.ACC}.

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Food/Serving/Fast Foods {.FFF} extended its streak of
declining rank to six consecutive weeks.  Notably, Pappa
Johns {PZZA}, Tricon Global {YUM}, and McDonald's {MCD} all
charted notable losses on November 19, despite a lack of
news.  The general malaise that is affecting the group most
likely stems from a shift in posture among investors from
lower valuation/defensive stocks to higher valuation/high
growth stocks.

Other groups with declining rankings include Basic/Uranium
{.MUR}, Building/Brick-Cement {.BBC}, Home/Furnishings
{.HOM}, and Machinery/Specialties {.MSP}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

Retail/Stores/Department {.RDE} should be interesting to
watch this week.  The group's rank has increased for four
consecutive weeks, but may be at risk of reversing back
downward.  The reason for this is that early data about
weekend shopping indicates that traffic at department stores
in general was weak and that same store sales fell.  Such a
decline is not surprising, however, given consumers'
preference for bargains and lingering fears about a
potential terrorist strikes aimed at one or more shopping
malls.
