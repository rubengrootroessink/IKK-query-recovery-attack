   Nassda Releases Version 1.3 of HSIM with Billion Transistor Capacity; Na=
nometer Full-Chip Circuit Simulator Provides New Analysis and Device Suppor=
t   SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nassda Corp. today =
announced version 1.3 of HSIM(TM), the latest release of the electronic des=
ign automation industry's first hierarchical full-chip circuit simulator. T=
argeted to designers of analog, mixed-signal, memory and system-on-chip (SO=
C) integrated circuits, HSIM provides detailed circuit-level analysis of ti=
ming and power behavior, and signal integrity effects. This release deliver=
s new analysis and device support along with enhanced interoperability with=
 other design tools.   "I want to commend Nassda for producing such a produ=
ct for the memory and mixed signal industry," said Puck Wong of Broadcom Co=
rp. "This is truly a significant and substantial development for mixed-sign=
al circuit designers. Nassda's support for Broadcom also has been outstandi=
ng. We are extremely happy with HSIM."   "HSIM version 1.3 further enhances=
 the accuracy, performance, device model support and nanometer analysis we =
offer to designers," said Sang Wang, CEO of Nassda. "Over 80 customers are =
using our technology in their design flows. This commercial success has con=
firmed our hierarchical approach to circuit analysis for analog, mixed-sign=
al, memory and SOC designs. This technology will become even more widely ad=
opted by the design community as they move into geometries at 180nm and bel=
ow."   HSIM Solves Critical Customer Issue  HSIM solves the critical issue =
of analyzing circuit behavior while taking into account the electrical and =
parasitic effects of nanometer scale silicon. Before the availability of HS=
IM, design teams were unable to analyze these effects with a tool that had =
the speed, accuracy, and capacity that was needed. In a recent benchmark, H=
SIM verified a 50 million transistor network processor in just over 13 hour=
s on a 32-bit workstation with 512Meg of RAM. HSIM's ability to address cri=
tical verification issues is reflected in HSIM's dramatic rate of adoption =
by design teams throughout the world.   HSIM Technology  Nassda created HSI=
M to perform full-chip circuit simulation and analysis with accuracy within=
 1-2% of SPICE but at speeds three to four orders of magnitude faster than =
SPICE. HSIM uses a patent-pending hierarchical technology to deliver a capa=
city of over one billion transistors, and is targeted to both pre- and post=
-layout analysis of circuits.   "HSIM version 1.3 further strengthens our l=
eadership in full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis with unpre=
cedented performance and capacity," stated Dr. An-Chang Deng, President of =
Nassda. "HSIM's capability of annotating both layout parasitic and device g=
eometry information to a pre-layout netlist is essential for efficient veri=
fication and optimization of design implementations. HSIM enables first sil=
icon success."   New Device Models  HSIM now supports simulation of JFETs, =
found in communication designs, using the same model found in SPICE simulat=
ors. Another development for designers of high-speed systems is the ability=
 to analyze signal integrity effects with a lossy transmission line model. =
As well, the latest MOS device model from U.C. Berkeley for nanometer-scale=
 devices, BSIM4, is now supported. The existing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) =
device model has been improved in accuracy by working closely with Nassda's=
 customers. With each new release, HSIM continues to incorporate the latest=
 developments from industry and academic research.   Enhanced Netlist Back-=
Annotation  HSIM version 1.3 provides enhanced support for the back-annotat=
ion of parasitic RC data in DSPF format, and MOS device geometry informatio=
n including device size, parasitics and resistivity. Since they account for=
 post-layout effects, back-annotation of DSPF and MOS device data is necess=
ary for accurate analysis of signal integrity, and timing and power behavio=
r.   New Spectral Analysis  With version 1.3, HSIM now provides spectral an=
alysis by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Performed interactivel=
y or after transient simulation, HSIM enables frequency analysis of communi=
cation circuits. This new capability provides industry-standard windowing f=
unctions for conditioning the analysis data as needed by designers.   Inter=
operability  HSIM version 1.3 delivers improved interoperability with other=
 design tools by providing an application programming interface (API) for w=
orking with customers' internal waveform viewers. The new release also prov=
ides a user modeling interface (UMI) to integrate customer-proprietary devi=
ce models.   Pricing and Availability  HSIM Version 1.3 is now available, a=
nd is supported on workstations running Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Microsoft Windo=
ws NT/2000, and Linux operating systems. U.S. prices start at $85,000.   Ab=
out Nassda  Nassda Corporation (Santa Clara, California) develops and marke=
ts full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis solutions for advanc=
