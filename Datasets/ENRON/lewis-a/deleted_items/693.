CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES
By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 3, Number 108___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/01)
--------------------------------------------------------

"Power Trading Tips for utilizing Net Trader Positions"

1. Filter new trend-following, signals if the commercials are at or
near a 4-year extreme net position against the trend.

2. Look to trade with the trend, if the commercials are at or near a
4-year extreme in the direction of the trend. Some of the best trades
each year occur following this set-up. The stock market decline unfolding
in March of 2000 is a good example.

3. Refer to the accuracy summary below and only follow the commercials
in markets that have an accuracy of 65% or higher.

10-Year Analysis of commercial extremes
"Accuracy Table"
A signal was generated when the commercial positions reached a
new 4-year extreme. A new 4-year extreme net long position would generate a
hypothetical buy signal.
Conversely, a new 4-year extreme in net short positions would create a
hypothetical sell signal. An event is a signal. Going back 10 years in
the copper market, there were a total of 13 events (signals) that occurred.
The research is provided to give you a better feel of how to use the
Commitment of
Trader information.  The analysis gives you a better understanding of
how the indicator works in different markets.  From this information,
you might fit it into your personal trading method. Some traders base
their entire trading decisions on the Commitment of Traders data.  Others
use the data to identify key turning points in the marketplace. It is a
great
tool for the active trader.

10-year study of 4-year commercial extremes

Gold     -85% accurate - 8 events - 3.6 week average lag time turn
S+P 500  -66% accurate - 8 events - 4 weeks lag time before turn
Soybeans - 100% accurate-6 events - 5 weeks lag
Cattle   - 100% accurate-7 events - 5.7 week lag
Copper  - 85% accurate - 13 events - 4 week lag

certain inherent limitations and is subject to human discretion. CTS has

Key Technical Developments (close of 05/31)
-------------------------------------------------------

The grains appear to be losing downside momentum! Perhaps all the
bearish news has been discounted. Any signs of trouble with
the crop could be very bullish! Bean meal and beans are my favorites
based on the intra-market spreads.

The energies appear to have topped out! If July gas closed below
91.40, then the bull run is likely over. The bear spreading in crude
oil between June and July told the true story!

The Pound is knocking on the door once again at a meaningful downside
breakout! A close below 141.40 does it for me! Next target would be
140.
