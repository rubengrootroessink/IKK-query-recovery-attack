   QUALCOMM Prevails in Three Stock Option Cases   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (=
BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), today announced fav=
orable decisions in three cases that had been brought by former employees c=
laiming rights to unearned QUALCOMM stock options. In the Hanig v. QUALCOMM=
 case, the California Superior Court granted summary judgment in QUALCOMM's=
 favor on all of plaintiffs' claims on the grounds that the releases and ag=
reements not to sue executed by each of the plaintiffs barred their lawsuit=
. The plaintiffs had signed the releases in exchange for the right to parti=
cipate in a bonus retention plan under which QUALCOMM paid millions of doll=
ars to its former workers who became employees of Ericsson when QUALCOMM so=
ld its infrastructure equipment business. The case was filed by 69 of those=
 former employees.   In addition, QUALCOMM announced that the plaintiffs in=
 the May v. QUALCOMM case have agreed to dismiss with prejudice their purpo=
rted class action lawsuit against QUALCOMM and QUALCOMM Personal Electronic=
s, in which several claims seeking compensation for stock options and bonus=
 payments had been alleged by a separate group of former employees. The pla=
intiffs agreed to dismiss their claims after the court granted QUALCOMM's m=
otion dismiss their second amended complaint.   Finally, QUALCOMM announced=
 that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Califor=
nia had granted summary judgment on seventeen of eighteen causes of action =
in a purported class action lawsuit arising out of the reduction in force w=
hich occurred at the Company in February of 1999. In that case, the purport=
ed class representatives had each sought vesting of stock options after the=
 termination of their employment, even though each had executed releases of=
 claims in exchange for generous severance payments offered as part of the =
separation package. In granting judgment in QUALCOMM's favor on those claim=
s, the Court upheld the validity of those releases.   "We are pleased that =
the Company has been completely vindicated in the Hanig and May cases and t=
hat virtually all of the claims in the third case have been summarily dismi=
ssed," said Louis M. Lupin, senior vice president and general counsel for Q=
UALCOMM. "QUALCOMM works very hard to ensure that our employees are treated=
 not only lawfully, but fairly, and has consistently gone far beyond what t=
he Company was legally required to do in providing for our employees and ou=
r former employees. Consequently, it is very disappointing when frivolous c=
laims such as the ones raised in these cases are made but gratifying when t=
heir lack of merit is recognized. We will continue to vigorously defend aga=
inst meritless claims such as these."   QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm=

communications products and services based on the Company's CDMA digital te=
