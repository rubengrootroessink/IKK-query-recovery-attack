I guess I'll coordinate, since I'm the one on redeployment...  : )

And, I don't have email addresses for Anna or Trang, but Michael and Huy can
relay the message respectively.

Dinner at 7:00pm
We could go to Churrasco's or McCormick & Schmick's.  Any preference or
other suggestions?  I should make reservations, since it's Sat. nite.

After Dinner
We could go to the movies or hang out at a lounge or coffee bar or
whatever...

Let me know what you think.

Also, Michael, what are your phone numbers?
And, Huy, let me know if you need me to take you Thurs. am.

Talk to you later,
Amy  : )
