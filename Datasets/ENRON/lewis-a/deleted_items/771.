   AMCC'S Mekong IC Enables End-to-End OC-192 System Solutions for Next-Gen=
eration Intelligent Optical Network Equipment=1DMekong Represents AMCC's La=
test Generation of Oc-192 Framer Technology With Integrated Features Target=
ed Specifically for the Optical Networking and DWDM Equipment Markets   SAN=
 DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) =
(Nasdaq:AMCC) today announced the availability of the Mekong (S19204), the =
industry's first highly integrated OC-192 SONET/SDH framing and pointer pro=
cessor device with on-chip features critical for next generation optical ne=
tworking equipment.   Mekong is a multi-feature integrated circuit enabling=
 customers to collapse multiple functions down to one chip, including aggre=
gation, pointer processing and grooming functions. Mekong is complemented b=
y AMCC's best-in-class CMOS Serializers/Deserializers (SERDES), Forward Err=
or Correction (FEC) devices and switch fabric devices, to provide an end-to=
-end chip set solution (See figure 1) that meets the power, cost and space =
requirements of new intelligent optical networking equipment.   "Mekong's a=
bility to re-map section and line overhead or transparently pass-thru all T=
OH (Transport Overhead) bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes), with pointer p=
rocessing enabled, on incoming SONET/SDH signals enables intelligent optica=
l networking equipment to provide performance monitoring and support switch=
ing/routing decisions on incoming fibers. This can all be done while provid=
ing full transparent processing of client interfaces over private DWDM netw=
orks and public networks," said Mark Donovan, AMCC's Mekong senior product =
marketing manager. "By designing the device to interface seamlessly with AM=
CC's popular OC-48 transceiver and OC-192 SERDES and 10G digital wrapper/FE=
C solutions, we're further contributing to the company's overall system sol=
ution approach and reducing our customer's time-to-market."   Mekong also s=
upports a variety of line interfaces for reducing system and board design r=
equirements. For OC-48 interfaces Mekong supports 4-bit wide 622 Mbits/s in=
terfaces, to enable seamless connections to AMCC's S3455 SERDES device. For=
 OC-192 applications, Mekong provides 16-bit 622 Mbits/s interfaces for sea=
mless connections to AMCC's 16-bit S3097/98 SERDES devices. Mekong's OC-192=
 interfaces are also designed for direct connection to AMCC's 10G digital w=
rapper/FEC Hudson device.   Mekong is AMCC's next generation framer/pointer=
 processor device that enables the aggregation of four OC-48s into a larger=
 OC-192 signal, or if used in conjunction with AMCC's Danube framer/pointer=
 processor device, the aggregation of up to sixty-four OC-3s, sixteen OC-12=
s or logical combinations of OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48 asynchronous interfaces =
into a larger OC-192 signal (See figures 2 and 3). Mekong provides standard=
 SONET/SDH pointer processing, and in addition, can transparently re-map th=
e incoming OC-48 and OC-192 signals TOH across time domains and into the ou=
tgoing higher rate signal. Mekong also supports a pass-thru mode, where all=
 TOH bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes) can be passed through Mekong, with=
 pointer processing enabled, to enable full transparency across time domain=
s. As a result, when AMCC's Danube is used in conjunction with Mekong, opti=
cal networking equipment vendors can offer service providers full transpare=
ncy from OC-3 to OC-192 rates. Mekong can also perform the same functions i=
n an OC-192-to-OC-192 mode.   Enabled by the device's two APS ports, Mekong=
 provides protection switching and redundancy in both the multiplex and dem=
ultiplex directions and incorporates non-intrusive TOH monitoring for all i=
nputs. The single-chip device features two built-in hitless Time Slot Inter=
change switches (TSIs), to provide STS-1 level traffic grooming, cross-conn=
ection, and add/drop applications. When used in conjunctions with AMCC's re=
cently announced Zambezi, an 80G STS-1 level switch fabric device, the Meko=
ng/Zambezi solution can serve as the first and Nth stage switch elements in=
 a N-stage Clos switch fabric architecture (See figure 4). Mekong also offe=
rs a provisional pointer processor bypass mode for STS-192-to-STS-192 opera=
tion (through-timing); both a full framer bypass (no frame regeneration) as=
 well as a pointer processor bypass (frame regeneration enabled) are also p=
rovided. Mekong also supports large deksew buffers in the multiplex directi=
on for STS-192c inverse multiplexing applications. A high-speed microproces=
sor interface is provided for configuration and monitoring. Mekong also sup=
ports POH (B3/J1/G1/C2) monitoring, Full TOH drop and insert ports and robu=
st alarm monitoring functions to provide the highest in OC-192 SONET/SDH in=
tegration and functionality for optical and DWDM equipment.   "Mekong's fea=
ture-rich architecture and flexibility allows for multiple use in DWDM, Met=
ro DWDM, digital cross-connects, multi-service access switches and core swi=
tch platforms," said Neal Neslusan, AMCC's marketing director of transport =
products. "It is well suited for Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO) switching=
 applications where grooming wavelengths from the optical network and suppo=
rting electrical SONET/SDH signal switching is required."   Pricing and Ava=
ilability  The Mekong (S19204) is scheduled for sampling to development par=
tners in August, with volume production scheduled for Q4 2001. Packaged in =
a 624 CBGA, the device is priced at $775.00 in volume quantities.   About A=
