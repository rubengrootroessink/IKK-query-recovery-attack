london location has connectivity.  see a cord, plug it in.

take profits short GDW.  breach of the low end of the trading range at 52 suggests a possible move to 44 (distance of the width of the busted range from low end of the busted range).

see chart for details.  lines are drawn in.

take profits here.  good place to re-enter short is on a test of chart resistance in 52-54 range.

recommended GDW Short on Oct 1 2001 when it was trading at 58. Since then it's gone down 16.02% to 48.
