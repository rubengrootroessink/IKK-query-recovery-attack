quityAlert.com.     MonsterMail Takes On AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! in Battle to =
Protect Children, Parents, and Others From 'Spam,' Pornography, and Viruses=
   BOSTON, Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- MonsterMail, Inc. (www.monsterma=
il.com) launches the world's first e-mail filtering and forwarding service =
today - designed to protect you and your children from junk e-mail ("spam")=
 and viruses - while never losing contact when you change jobs, move, or sw=
itch ISPs. Best of all, its not another e-mail account you have to check!  =
 "Enter almost any chat room and your screen name or e-mail address will be=
 harvested within minutes - with pornography flowing freely into your e-mai=
l in-box. Imagine what kids that spend hours in these chat rooms receive in=
 their in-box on a daily basis - often through no fault of their own," says=
 MonsterMail CEO, Mike Hren.   MonsterMail enables you to literally turn yo=
ur e-mail in-box "upside down" by only forwarding e-mail on your approved c=
ontact list - maintained on the MonsterMail servers. Unlike Hotmail, Monste=
rMail is not another in-box to check. Its a "monster" e-mail filter - ridin=
g above all the "spammers" trying to reach you, all the friends, family and=
 contacts you want to hear from, and all your existing e-mail accounts.   J=
an Gill, a working mother of two, says, "The only way I could protect mysel=
f or my kids on e-mail was to get free accounts from Hotmail or Yahoo! - an=
d then let the accounts expire. Unfortunately, this is like throwing out th=
e baby with the bath water. I would lose touch with the stuff I did want - =
and who has time to check extra e-mail accounts from work?"   "The average =
person has 2 or 3 e-mail accounts - they don't need another one," says busi=
ness executive Jim Zahka. "What they need is ONE filtering and forwarding a=
ddress to give to everyone - stopping the bad guys before they even enter y=
our house, allowing the good guys to reach you even when your underlying e-=
mail addresses change, and easily controlling both from any existing e-mail=
 account or web browser."   With no hardware or software to install or down=
load, a 30-day free trial, and a $5 referral credit when friends and family=
 sign-up, MonsterMail (www.monstermail.com) is the best way to protect your=
self and your kids on e-mail - in a crazy on-line world.   CONTACT:        =
