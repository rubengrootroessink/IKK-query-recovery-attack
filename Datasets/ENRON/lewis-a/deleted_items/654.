Earnings worries drive indices below important support  levels
Wednesday was another bad day for the bulls. Just a couple of weeks ago 
the major averages managed to climb above their important resistance 
levels. In fact the Dow Jones index came very close to challenging its all 
time high. However, since then all the indices have lost considerable ground 
and now trading below their resistances. Wednesday the Dow lost 166  
points to close at 10,872 and the counterpart Nasdaq Composite lost 91 
points to close at 2,084.
Why the change of heart?
Tuesday we pointed out that Goldman Sachs was turning cautious and made 
some negative comments on two major technology names, Microsystems 
(SUNW) and EMC Corp. (EMC). Following Tuesday's closing bell Sun 
Microsystems said its earnings for the current quarter will be substantially 
below street estimates. Wednesday morning other major brokers either 
downgraded or cut estimates on some of the leading semiconductors stocks 
and said weaker demand and rise in inventory may lead to more weakness in 
stocks. Given these comments and the fact we are heading into the negative 
pre-announcement season, we expect the markets to turn defensive and 
investors may sell some of their stocks ahead of any negative news.
Sector Analysis
What can investors expect in the next few weeks?
We believe the markets will continue be very volatile with technology stocks 
contributing to the downside. It is our opinion that the worst in terms of earnings 
warning may be behind us. However, there will be selective stocks from the PC 
related and seasonal sectors that may warn about their earnings. 
RealTimeTraders analysts expect the markets to trade in a range till the end 
of the quarter, mainly due to the uncertainty of the second quarter results. We 
encourage readers to closely watch the markets as a whole and the technology 
sector in particular for any signs of weakness. We will monitor the action in 
individual stocks and alert readers to any important developments.

Going into the last day of the month, traders will get to preview what the
