Natural Gas Futures Higher on Colder Weather

Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.058 yesterday=
 to $$2.138 per MMBtu, propped up by cold weather in the Midwest and Northe=
ast. The April contract climbed $0.043 to $2.19 per MMBtu. The market opene=

0 briefly in the early afternoon before short-covering boosted prices befor=
e the close, holding in a $0.055 range. Funds were buying early with the co=
ld weather keeping the sellers at bay. Look for the cold weather to drive t=
he market to test $2.15 resistance today, with a good chance of testing the=
 $2.21 level. The market is still bottom building, moving quietly in a side=
ways range, causing any short-covering rally to be met with selling into re=
sistance. With winter ending soon and a Tcf in excess storage, the gravitat=

production in the market. The estimated volume was 69,100 contracts, with 3=

FERC Drops Complaint Against BPA and Others

The FERC has dismissed a complaint by Californians for Renewable Energy, a =
citizens group that claimed BPA and 3 other firms withheld badly needed ele=
ctricity during the state's power crisis. The group filed a complaint last =
April, during the height of the crisis, when wholesale power prices had gal=
loped 10 times higher and customers were hit with a series of rolling black=
outs. The group accused BPA, Canada's BC Hydro, Powerex and Mirant of withh=
olding wholesale power supplies to boost prices during the crisis. The BPA,=
 which supplies about half of the Pacific Northwest's power through huge hy=
dropower dams, is owned by the federal government. BC Hydro is owned by the=
 provincial government of British Columbia. The FERC dismissed the complain=
t because the group's allegations are vague and similar issues were decided=
 by the commission in other cases.=20

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline=20

Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron after i=
nvesting $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take over the pipelines tr=
ading and marketing today. The system, valued at $2.7 billion, runs 16,600 =
miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had contested the takeover after=
 Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron for $23 billion in November. Ea=
rlier this month, Enron gave up the pipeline, but is proceeding with a $10 =
billion lawsuit against Dynegy for terminating their deal. Northern Natural=
 has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf of natural gas per day and has valuable connecti=
on points with other pipelines. Although Dynegy operates many pipelines, No=
rthern Natural is their first foray into pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $2=
3 million to complete the purchase and named Daniel Dienstbier as the syste=
ms president, a position he held before becoming president of Enron's Gas P=
ipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy also assumed $900 million of Northern Natural=
s debt. En! ron employees will run and maintain Northern Natural until Enro=
n's option to buy it back expires June 30th. But most think that is unlikel=
y to happen, given Enrons current state of affairs.=20

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion

$60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would almost double the capacity in=
 the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf per day. The expanded pipeline =
capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW plant near Wadsworth, Nevada and M=

FERC to Probe Enrons Role in California Power Crisis

At the urging of Democrats representing Western states, the FERC has launch=
ed a probe into allegations that Enron illegally manipulated wholesale powe=
r prices during California's power crisis last year. One California senator=
 also demanded that the FERC provide a list of meetings and telephone calls=
 between the commission and Enron executives from August 2000 through June =
2001. Enron has denied any wrongdoing. The Democratic senator pointed to ne=
ws reports that former Enron chairman Ken Lay met with Vice President Chene=
y in April, 2001 and discussed the California power crisis. The next day, C=
heney said he opposed price caps, the senator said. The senator is question=
ing whether Enron used influence in secret meetings with the vice president=
 or the FERC to persuade them to do nothing about the state's soaring power=
 prices. However, the administration has always opposed price caps. But the=
 FERC chairman said that his staff has already started to look into! the al=
legations. The probe will involve FERC's office of general counsel and offi=
ce of market tariffs and rates. The chairman declined to elaborate on the s=
cope of the probe. The legislators cited a study by an independent consulta=
nt showing that California prices fell by 30% soon after Enron declared ban=
kruptcy in December. The Democrats say that a key factor in higher power pr=
ices was Enron's dealings in unregulated financial derivatives in the natur=
al gas market while controlling a large share of the market.=20

wned power lines and snapped trees around Oklahoma, leaving more than 230,0=
00 customers without electricity with temperatures in the low 20s. Oklahoma=
 Gas & Electric said it was the worst storm in the 100-year history of the =

oute power around the downed transmission lines. Kansas City was ! also hit=
 by the worst ice storm in 16 years, with more than 100,000 customers witho=
ut power. Repair crews from other areas were being brought in to clear down=
ed trees and restore electricity. Kansas City Power & Light had 90 line cre=
ws and 100 tree crews working around the clock. KCP?said as many as 285,000=
 customers were without power overnight. In the upper Midwest, the storm kn=
ocked out power to almost 100,000 customers in southern Michigan, but did n=
ot damage the high-voltage transmission grid in Michigan.=20

FERC Drops California Natural Gas Price Reports

After reviewing what data it needed to monitor all US energy markets, the F=
ERC plans to stop requiring companies to report monthly California natural =
gas prices. The FERC began requiring monthly California price data from nat=
ural gas sellers and pipelines last July during the state's power crisis. L=
ast summer, natural gas prices oared above $18 per MMBtu in the state's spo=
t market while other US prices remained much lower. However, the commission=
 indicated that it might require other kinds of energy pricing data to be r=
eported on a regular basis. The decision to drop the reporting was supporte=
d by energy companies which said the requirement was costly and burdensome.=

California PUC Reaches Agreement on Bonds=20

The California PUC has agreed on a plan to let the state sell up to $12.5 b=
illion of bonds, the largest municipal bond sale in US history. The governo=
r and PUC argued over options for repaying the bonds after the regulator re=
jected an initial proposal in October. Bond proceeds would be used to cover=
 the state's cost of buying electricity for utilities that ran up billions =
of dollars in debt under the state's deregulation law. The PUC has issued a=
 proposed plan that would let the state Department of Water Resources sell =
the bonds.  The state has spent $11.8 billion buying electricity. Comments =
on the plan are due by February 5th and the FERC expects to vote on the agr=
eement at a February 21st meeting. But it may be very difficult to sell the=
 bonds by June 30th, even if a plan is approved soon.=20
