Commenting on the guidance Mel Morris, CEO and Founder of uDate.com, inc. s=
aid: "We have made significant progress this year. Our acquisition of Kiss.=
com has been very successful adding significant critical mass and helping u=
s become the 2nd largest business in the sector. Our growth this year has m=
ade us a formidable contender for the number one slot during 2002. As our b=
usiness model becomes more established it is our belief that the business w=
ill reach an EBITDA to Revenue margin of around 50%."
"Today we have around 175,000 paying subscribers, the market leader Match.c=
om owned by Ticketmaster had approximately 250,000 subscribers at the end o=
f September 2001. This year it is our understanding that uDate, Match and m=
any of the other top 10 businesses in this sector have experienced good to =
strong growth in subscribers. The absence of any significant competitive pr=
essures and the perception that the growth is accelerating in absolute term=
s leads us to conclude that the market sector as a whole is growing at a si=
gnificant rate. Our guidance figures indicate that our subscriber base will=
 be around 215,000 by December 31, 2001, 420,000 by December 2002 and 700,0=
00 by December 2003."
"This is a sector where the size of subscriber base has significant impact =
on a company's ability to grow the business and achieve profitability. Many=
 companies who have entered this space have failed to achieve critical mass=
 and/or profitability. Examples include well financed start-ups like Social=
Net who raised around $20M. Recently, Yahoo.com launched a subscription bas=
ed personals service. However, in preparation for this Yahoo rejected adver=
tising orders from competitive Online Personals services including uDate fr=
om the early in July 2001. This has had little tangible impact on the growt=
h of our business as advertising contracts were easily replaced with equal =
or better performing channels. The market should also recognize that Yahoo =
had been operating in this market sector for a long time offering a free se=
rvice. Their move to a subscription based model was therefore welcomed."
"There are a number of key factors driving growth in this sector including =
greater awareness of Online Personals and better understanding of what it i=
s and is not; repeat users returning to Online Personals when a relationshi=
p ends; greater critical mass of the top services leading to a more success=
ful and compelling experience; greater acceptance of online subscription se=
rvices; and improved use and availability of PC and digital camera technolo=
gy. We believe the market has very significant potential for growth." Morri=
s concluded.
