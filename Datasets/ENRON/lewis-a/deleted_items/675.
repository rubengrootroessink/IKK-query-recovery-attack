Was Thursday's rebound a dead cat bounce?
Thursday morning all the major indices managed to start out on a positive 
note, and finished the session slightly higher. Dow Jones gained 39 points, 
Nasdaq Composite for its part finished the session higher by 26 points, and 
the broader S&P 500 index finished the session higher by 7.74 points.
However, traders were quick to point out that Thursday's modest gains can 
be attributed to some intermediate support in the major indices and short 
covering. Some veteran traders call this type of bounce as a "dead cat bounce". 
Traders said the market as a whole is waiting on earnings pre-announcement 
to determine where the markets will be heading in the short-term. Thus far the 
overall earnings picture does not seem to be improving due to the negative 
comments by Goldman Sachs, USB Warburg and the downward earnings 
revisions by Sun Microsystems and Altera Corporation. 
Some Clarification on Thursday's sector analysis
Thursday we received several emails regarding some confusion about 
Thursday's sector analysis. Thursday's sector analysis contained a sentenced 
that read "It is our opinion the worst in terms of earnings warning may be behind 
us". By this statement we were merely trying to suggest the magnitude of the 
earnings warnings in the second quarter might not be as severe as the first 
quarter. We were not trying to suggest most of the pre-announcements for the 
second quarter are done. 
Our readers may recall that some of the better known companies did not offer 
any guidance for the second quarter because of the economic uncertainty. In 
our opinion the companies had expected the earnings picture to remain cloudy. 
We sincerely apologize for any confusion we may have caused by Thursday's 
sector analysis. As always we appreciate your feedback, and request that you 
send us an email with suggestions on what type of new information you would 
like to see added to our site. Please also include on the email the type of 
information that is currently available on our site that may not be important to 
you as an investor or trader.
Sector Analysis
Technology may not be the only sector that might face problems
It is not a great surprise to hear that consumers are starting to feel the pain 
from the recent technology meltdown. However, it is somewhat surprising to 
see restaurants express concerns about the weak economy. Thursday shares 
of restaurant chains came under pressure due to rising concern the economic 
slowdown is likely to negatively impact the restaurant industry. Names such as 
Wendy's International (WEN - which lost $0.75 to close at $24.65), Brinker 
International (EAT - which lost  $2.10) and Rare Hospitality (RARE - finished 
the session lower by $3.78) came under considerable pressure on above 
average volume. Readers may want to watch this sector for the next few 
sessions. Should this industry's earnings fall short of estimates, it is clearly an 
indication that the consumer has become weary of the economic slowdown 
and cut back on discretionary spending. 
Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Thursday the long bond gained almost a point and closed above the 100 mark. 
Friday morning the average hourly earnings, average work week, and this 
week's most important economic report, the monthly unemployment rate are 
scheduled to be released at 8:30AM. We will report the actual numbers along 
with the market reaction to the numbers as soon as the reports become 
available in our breaking news section.
