LazyTraders,

This speaks for itself, doesn't it?

If you have an hour a day or more to spare you may want to look into
learning how to DayTrade.

You can learn with the Lazy DayTrader System at:

http://www.lazytrader.com

and can then join Michael Crowder's Chatroom.



""Frank,
We had a huge day today! We made our first call at 9:32AM OVER- it was at
$22.40 and it is now at $26.60- it has run strong the entire day 19% so far,
not bad huh? It gets better! At 9:45AM we called AVNT we called it at $10
share- it is now at $11.75. Thats another 17.5% Everyone in the chatroom
made
money, lots of new people made a lot of money too! This has been another
great week! Up over 80% in the week, our picks are up over 300% for the
month
uncompounded! What can I say- tell people that if they don't believe what I
am saying, get a membership for a month and find out how real what we are
saying is! Come in the room and ask ANYONE who has been in for a week or
more
and you will here the same awesome stuff from them too! Have a glorious
weekend!

Michael aka ChatMaster

PS- Most people are happy with 12% a year, our 2 picks today went up almost
3
times that amount, IN ONE DAY! Think about it and come join us!""


Have a nice day

*620% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 7 weeks if you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would
have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in
the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
