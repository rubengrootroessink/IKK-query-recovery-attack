Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!!  
 
It is now time to sell Eurodollars (not the Euro  Currency). Sell June 2002, September 2002, December 2002, March 2003 or June  2003. We DO NOT think Mr. Greenspan is going to lower  interest rates any more. Morgan Stanley announced today that they believe the  employment situation is not going to be as bad as once thought. Consumer  confidence is coming back. Our predictions are that companies became "lean and  mean" and will show profits in the first quarter of 2002.  Check out the  chart and see if you come up with the same conclusion. You make the  call!
