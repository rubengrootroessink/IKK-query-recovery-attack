PRSE:  Precise Software Solutions was in the process of making a large
double top on the daily, right at $25 resistance.  The 200-day MA also
provided a wall of resistance at this precise level.  Huge volume on 5/21
- 5/23 was also unable to break through.  It fell hard for three days
before finding support at the convergence of it s50- and 100-day MAs.  It
rallied two days with the broader markets, and closed with a bearish
piercing pattern (gapped up and closed more than 50% below the mid-point
of prior day's real body).  This lower high also corresponded with the
declining 10- and 20-day MA and the sideways 200-period MA on the above
60-min chart.  MACD Histrogram, OBV, and RSI are turning down.  Consider
SHORTING PRSE once it trades at 22.29.  Suggested target is 19.10.
Suggested stop is 22.67.
