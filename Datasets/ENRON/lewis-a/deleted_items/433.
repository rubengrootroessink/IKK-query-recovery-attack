Dear Investor,

I know you're frustrated by the lousy market over the past
18 months.  But I warn you...

...now is not the time to start taking big risks in hope of
making up for lost time.  You'll just end up in a bigger
hole. And frankly, it just isn't necessary to take chances
to achieve great profits.  There is a much better, time-
tested way.

YOU CAN become an "Armadillo Investor."

The armadillo is nature's perfect survivor.  A thick plate
of armor.  Sharp claws.  And a clear focus on the hunt.
Armadillo Investors build profits aggressively -- but we
also use proven techniques to protect against the losses
most investors inevitably suffer.  Our mantra: "Win at
investing by never losing."

I don't take big risks when hunting for oversized profits.
I simply follow the armadillo strategy that has made me
wealthy -- and made thousands of investors who've followed
my advice quite wealthy, as well.  Here's just one example
of an Armadillo stock we're recommending today -- I think
you'll see why it's the kind of investment EVERY investor
should own.

This company has achieved 31 consecutive years of revenue
growth!  It's gained 72% for us so far this year.  That
sounds like heaven, compared to the hell most investors
have been sliding through.

I came upon this story in an afternoon of serendipity.
Debbie and I were out riding our Harleys on a beautiful
fall day when we passed an impressive-sized store in South
Deerfield, Massachusetts.  While that's not exactly the
middle-of-nowhere, it's close.  And the huge parking lot
was JAMMED with hundreds of cars.

At first, I thought it must be a mall.  Curiosity got the
best of us, so we stopped for a peek.  No mall.  Just a
single store, selling just one product line, with folks
lined up at the registers ten-deep!  Okay, this was
something worth checking out, so I put my research team on
it.

It turns out that this store is the second most-visited
tourist destination in Massachusetts.  And it's the front
for one of the most-amazing little companies I've ever run
across -- devoted followers, fat profit margins and some
heavy hitters behind the scenes.  Directors include
Hollywood deal man Michael Ovitz, the president of Staples
and the chairman of J. Crew.  This is just a neat story
that can make you a lot of money.

I outline the best ways to profit from this Armadillo and 4
more in my new FREE report: ARMADILLO STOCKS: 5 INVESTMENTS
THAT WIN BY NEVER LOSING. This new report is yours
absolutely FREE for the asking.  Nothing to buy.  Nothing

Why am I giving this report away FREE?  Because it's the
