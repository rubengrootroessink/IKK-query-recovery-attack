 October  Newsletter  Gold for Portfolio Diversification  =09[IMAGE]=09


The CBOE Gold Index is up almost 25% this year!  =09


Over the past 18 months, being 100 percent invested in the falling tech  se=
ctor has led many to look at portfolio diversification. In this volatile  m=
arket, diversification does not necessarily mean capital appreciation  but =
capital preservation.=20
A diversified portfolio can increase your total return while decreasing  yo=
ur total risk.
Get a system and follow it!
Gold stocks can be used effectively to diversify your portfolio since  they=
 tend to move in opposite directions than most other investments.  Gold sto=
cks are traditionally considered a safe haven.
Buying Gold stocks has proven a tried and true strategy  in times of crisis=
! =09


When armed conflict erupts, when inflation looms, when the stock  market pl=
unges, investors often turn to gold for capital preservation.
Gold stocks tend to have a beta of one to two, which means they are  one to=
 two times as volatile as gold itself. The attraction of a high  beta stock=
 is that in a rising gold bullion market gold stocks out perform  bullion. =
Gold also has a mystique, a psychological allure that keeps  the stocks at =
often-high multiples.
So far gold has not become an integral part of U.S. institutional portfolio=
s  while in Europe, institutions have held 3 percent to 15 percent of their=
  portfolios in gold for many decades.=20
U.S. Institutional interest in Gold conferences in recent months and  the i=
ncrease in the Gold and Metal indexes allows us speculate that  the demand =
for Gold stocks is starting to rise and demand is greater  than the supply =
of Gold stocks for sale.

World Investor October 2001 Profile:  Silverado Gold Mines=20
 Silverado Traded for 20 years on NASDAQ  Silverado  became a fully  regist=
ered SEC corporation in 1978; and traded on Nasdaq from  1978 until 1998.  =
In 1998, due to declining gold prices and the advent of the $US  1.00 rule =
the company moved from NASDAQ to the OTC BB. =09[IMAGE]=09


Investors should be watching the new NASD ruling pertaining to: "the  suspe=
nsion of the "Dollar Rule" until January 2, 2002" and possible  removal of =
the "Dollar Rule", in which case previously NASDAQ listed  companies like S=
ilverado may be able to regain their full listing status  if the dollar rul=
e is waved altogether. Recently over 13 percent of  the companies on NASDAQ=
 trade below $1 or about 574 issues. Under the  temporary relief provided b=
y the new rules, companies will not be citied  for bid-price or market-valu=
e-of-public-float deficiencies.=20
NASDAQ rules dictate that a company whose stock price falls below the  mini=
mum bid price for 30 consecutive trading days is given 90 days to  reach co=
mpliance. If a company fails to meet those requirements once  that period e=
xpires, it is notified by NASDAQ and delisted and generally  is eligible fo=
r trading on the over-the-counter bulletin board.
If the "dollar rule" is waved altogether perhaps Silverado can apply  for F=
ULL NASDAQ listing status once again!
Consolidation within the Gold Industry
This year there has been some consolidation in the Gold Industry among  the=
 big players. In June Barrick Gold of Canada said it would pay $2.2  billio=
n for Homestake Mining of the U.S. Recently, South Africa's AngloGold  bid =
$1.66 billion for Australia's Normandy Mining Ltd. Also, South Africa's  Ha=
rmony Gold Mining has been on an acquisition trail buying up small  mines a=
nd companies.
With consolidation in the Gold Industry taking place, the  number of public=
ly traded Gold stocks with 100 PERCENT working interest  in properties with=
 RESERVES is becoming RARE!=09


The main asset of a gold mining company are its gold reserves. Companies  l=
ike Silverado have already outlined a deposit and are looking to develop  i=
t. The value of proven gold reserve depends on whether a property is  an ec=
onomic ore body, which means that the cost of production is low  enough and=
 that the price of gold is high enough so that a profitable  mine can be bu=
ilt.
The main question for the junior gold companies is: How will  the company r=
aise the money to proceed to production?=20
There are basically three ways in which to raise money:
? The company can issue new shares.
? A joint venture partner can fund the cost of the entire project for  a ri=
ght to earn a certain interest in the property, which is anti-delusive  to =
current shareholders.
? The company may be able to arrange debt financing.
In Silverado's case, they have expended US $20,000,000 on their Nolan  gold=
 property alone, have taken $10,000,000 in gold during development  work an=
d are working on closing $2,500,000 needed to complete development  to beco=
me a year round, profitable producer on it's 100% owned, 6 mile  by 6 mile =
property North of Faribanks, Alaska.
Past speculation in Silverado shares has spawned two Silverado  share ralli=
es in recent months, with the share price shooting up to  90 cents in April=
 2000 and up to 60 cents in April 2001. The chart tells  us the stock shoul=
d be accumulated during periods of lower volume and  low volatility.=20

Silverado's Gold Properties (Taken  from Silverado's press release dated Oc=
tober 9th):=20
Despite the past years of volatile gold prices, the company still owns  100=
 percent of two major gold properties. They contain proven reserves  of 111=
,298 ounces, probable reserves of 329,616 ounces and inferred  reserves of =
463,885 ounces for a combined total of 904,799 ounces of  gold.
THE NOLAN GOLD PROPERTY is located in the Koyukuk Mining District,  200 mil=
es north of Fairbanks and is a large tract of land six square  miles in siz=
e. During the last 16 years, over U.S. $20 million has been  spent on the a=
cquisition, exploration, construction and development  of the mine, which w=
ould cost up to $100 million to build at today's  prices. A 35 person camp =
is in place as well as all support facilities  including fuel dump, machine=
 shop, engineering offices, bunk houses,  kitchen, gold finishing room, 3 m=
illion gallon holding pond, settling  ponds, pumps, pipelines, roads, heavy=
 equipment, generators, laboratory,  production permits, and over 600 compl=
eted drill holes all built and  conducted by the Company.=20
The source of the gold has been discovered in various locations and  the co=
mpany has 66 lode claims over these areas and therefore owns the  lode righ=
ts (source of the placer nugget gold) as well as the placer  rights. Only a=
 small part of the property has been explored and accounts  for proven gold=
 placer reserves of 11,802 ounces, probable reserves  of 48,262 ounces, and=
 inferred reserves of 83,585 ounces, for a combined  total of 143,649 ounce=
s of gold. There are over a million ounces of  gold indicated on the rest o=
f the property by historical mining data,  drill and trench data, and other=
 studies conducted by the company. $2.5  million U.S. remain to be spent on=
 development which will bring the  first phase of the Nolan deep channel in=
to year round production. Cost  of production during five years is estimate=
d at $7 million with returns  projected at $27 million. The company can app=
ly a $47 million tax loss  carry forward towards future revenue. The compan=
y is interested in partners  willing to finance production for a percentage=
 of gold profits.=20
THE ESTER DOME GOLD PROPERTY is located ten miles northwest  of Fairbanks, =
Alaska, and is 2.5 square miles in size. It contains the  Grant Mine proper=
ty -- O'Dea gold deposit and associated mineralized  structures containing =
proven reserves of 99,496 ounces, probable reserves  of 286,354 ounces, and=
 inferred reserves of 375,300 ounces for a combined  total of 761,150 ounce=
s of gold. Built on the property is a 300-ton  per day Gravity / Carbon in =
Pulp Mill that produced U.S. $10,000,000  in high grade gold bars during it=
s test phase by the Company.
The President of Silverado, Gary Anselmo, gave his views on  the current go=
ld market:
"The last Fed interest rate drop of 50 basis points to 2.5%, locks  the cou=
ntry firmly into negative real interest rates, which in the medium  and lon=
g term should extrapolate into higher gold prices as the opportunity  cost =
of holding gold relative to interest bearing notes decreases. It  appears t=
his trend has already begun. We also find it noteworthy that  when the Bank=
 of England auctions gold, it is always oversubscribed;  up to 4 times. Thi=
s tells us there is considerable excess physical demand  that should begin =
to push spot prices higher."
