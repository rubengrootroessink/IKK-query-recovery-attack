Lazy Traders,

Did you know that you can trade from 7.30 AM EST until 8 PM EST?
The old 9.30 to 4 routine has fallen by the wayside, and it sometimes is much
more profitable to trade early in the morning and after 4 PM because more news
comes out before 9.30 and after 4 PM than during the day.

What do you think happens if Microsoft announces that it is buying a small
company at 4.10 PM?

Exactly.

The small company's shares will go through the roof at 4.10 and will  continue
to go up until 8 PM.

But they will probably fall at 9.30 AM the next morning because people are
taking profit.

This is the scenario Michael Crowder's Chatroom uses to rack up profits of over

800% in the last eight weeks and you can become part of that as well when you
learn to DayTrade with the Lazy DayTrader System.

Check it out at:

How much time do you have to spend in front of your computer?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you have as little as one hour a day you can trade successfully.

The new Nasdaq trading rules.
-----------------------------

On September 23 Nasdaq came out with new rules which in effect prevents people
with less than $25,000 to cash their trades more than once every 3 days.

So what you do is divide your money in 3 and trade that amount every day;
problem solved.

You can still open an account for as little as $500 with http://www.datek.com
and for as little as $2000 with http://www.interactivebrokers.com, both
reputable and reliable on-line brokers.

How to minimize your risk and maximize your profits?
----------------------------------------------------

1. Learn to DayTrade with the Lazy Daytrader System.
2. Papertrade until you are 95% successful.
3. Join Michael's Chatroom and learn how and when he calls his picks.
4. Start trading with VERY small amounts of real money.
5. Build up confidence and take your time.(How long did you go to school?)

If you follow these rules you minimize your risk and maximize your profits.

And remember that stocks will ALWAYS go up even in bad and uncertain economic
times when any of these circumstances happen:

-Large company buys small company; small company's shares will always go up.
-Company comes out with cure for cancer; shares will always go up.
-Company gets exclusive, such as rights to sell telephones in China;shares will

always go up.
-Company has mind blowing earnings, such as 3 times last quarter; shares will
always go up.

Have a nice day and email me with questions.

*800% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 8 weeks if you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
