With the award date getting closer, it's not too early to start thinking about what that winning day could be like. For our new winner, things will get pretty exciting -- fast. First, there'd be a knock at the door, the winner would open it and find the Publishers Clearing House Prize Patrol there with flowers, balloons, and that "big check" just like on TV! Then there'd probably be screams of delight, congratulatory hugs and maybe even some tears of joy.
