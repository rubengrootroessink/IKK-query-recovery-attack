INVESTNEWSWIRE WEEK IN REVIEW -
Week Ending June 1, 2001

IN THIS ISSUE:
* Company Highlight : DXStorm.com (CDNX - DXS)
* News Links : This Week's Small-Cap Highlights

COMPANY SPOTLIGHT : DXStorm.com (CDNX - DXS)

In October and November of 2000, InvestNewswire sent you
information on DXStorm.com, an up-and-coming  e-commerce
Application Service Provider (ASP). This week, DXStorm's
president, Mr. Gregory Lowes, included a special message
with their third quarter results. We have attached it for
your benefit.

I am pleased to report that the company's third quarter
has yielded positive results.

Operating revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
decreased approximately 10% over the prior quarter to
$178,000 as compared to $198,000 for the quarter ended
December 31, 2000. Operating revenues are all revenues
for e-commerce service packages and related revenues, and
other revenues from custom development, collocation,
hosting and other service fees.

In the second quarterly report, I stated that management
expected a reduction in monthly operating expenses of 50%
to be achieved by the end of the quarter ended March 31,
2001. I am pleased to report that the monthly target has
been achieved, and further that expenditures for the entire
quarter decreased to $647,000, a reduction of 48% from the
previous quarter. The loss for the quarter of $464,000, or
$0.02 per share, reflects a 54% reduction of the loss over
the previous quarter.

The company has taken extensive measures to manage costs
and expenditures without compromising its ability to
operate or fulfill its obligations to its clients and
partners. DXStorm remains capable of attracting, and is
prepared to take on, further major Brand Partners. As
reported previously, DXStorm remains focused on its
partners, past and upcoming, as the most predominant
source of new subscribers and revenues.

The management of DXStorm was introduced to the management
of Peachtree Network Inc. in early April of this year.
Through the course of many discussions and meetings, both
management teams recognized what we believe to be strong
synergies and opportunities between the companies.

On April 23, 2001, Peachtree Network Inc. announced that
it had entered into an agreement to acquire all the
outstanding shares of DXStorm. Further, through a secured,
convertible debenture, Peachtree would provide $750,000 in
funds to DXStorm in installments until June 30, 2001. The
transaction to acquire the shares of DXStorm is subject to
the completion of due diligence by both companies, final
board approvals, and approval by regulatory authorities.

Peachtree is an e-commerce ASP similar in many ways to
DXStorm. Peachtree has focused on the grocery sector, and
specifically on the larger businesses out of reach of
DXStorm (Sobeys, and Intermarche as examples). Peachtree is
now migrating their solutions to address the other 'large
surface' retail sectors. By combining the strengths of both
companies, management believes the opportunities for growth
far exceeds those of the two companies standing alone.
Specifically, management has identified several driving
factors for the proposed acquisition of DXStorm by
Peachtree:

** Wider product / services base (all retailers from very
small through DXStorm's Partners, to very large
multinational retailers with thousands of stores - the
products / services, personnel, and strategy of each of
DXStorm and Peachtree are expected to remain as the
companies join their operations).

** Collectively reduced costs in the short and long terms.

** Increased global market access for DXStorm products
through Peachtree's global network and relationships.

** Increased collective marketing and sales capabilities.

** More rapid deployment and development of services
through technology and expertise exchange.

** Stronger management to further increase sales and
business development activities.

** Synergies and opportunities through a number of
mutual relationships.

The recent 'dot-com melt down' has confirmed to management
that the focus on serving 'bricks and mortar' businesses is
correct and is, in fact, critical to growth. While the
state of the public markets has contributed to removing many
competitors from our sector, the embrace of e-commerce and
ASP delivered Information Technology services continues to
expand rapidly. The management of both companies believes
that our growth opportunities are far greater as a joint
force with merged strategy and execution in this growing
market.

Our joint business plan anticipates profitability in less
than 18 months based on a conservative three-year deployment
of existing contracts only (Sympatico-Lycos, Sobeys,
Intermarche, and others). However, continued sales and
business development efforts, driving factors in the union
of the two companies, are expected to shorten that path to
profitability while dramatically increasing value for
shareholders of both companies.
