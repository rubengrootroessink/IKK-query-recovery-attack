Texas Instruments' High-Performance 4-20mA Transmitter Targets
Temperature And Bridge Sensors=1D'Smart' Programmable Device Reduces Manufa=
cturing
Costs By Offering Digitally-Controlled Adjustments

TUCSON, Ariz., Jun 1, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Texas Instruments
Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) today announced a "smart" programmable 4-20mA
current-loop transmitter from the company's Burr-Brown product line designe=
d for
temperature and bridge sensor applications, as well as remote data acquisit=
ion,
weighing systems, and industrial process control. See
http://www.ti.com/sc/aap6372u.

The high-performance XTR108 allows for digital calibration of sensor and
transmitter errors via a standard digital serial interface, eliminating
expensive potentiometers or circuit value changes. Calibration settings can=
 be
stored in an inexpensive external EEPROM for easy retrieval during routine
operation.

Digitally-controlled adjustments dramatically reduce manufacturing costs an=
d
allow companies to build a single sensor design to serve a wide range of ne=
eds.
Individual units can be stocked and later programmed and reprogrammed for a=
ny of
hundreds of possible end-customer specifications (special temperature range=
s,
etc.). Sensors can also be reprogrammed in the field, if necessary.

"By allowing the user to digitally adjust the gain, offset and linearity of=
 the
analog output, the XTR108 eliminates the need for manual trimming of
potentiometers and the costs associated with this process," said John Brown=
,
strategic marketing engineer for TI's High-Performance Linear products.
"Furthermore, among the very few similar ICs on the market, the XTR108 prov=
ides
more versatile multi-channel input and excitation multiplexing."

The XTR108's wide programmable gain amplifier (PGA) range allows full- scal=
e
inputs from 5 to 320mV. The all-analog signal path contains a built-in
sub-regulator, voltage reference, input multiplexer, autozeroed PGA, dual
programmable current-sources, linearization circuit, internal oscillator,
control logic, and an output current amplifier.

Current sources directed through the multiplexer can be used to excite RTD
temperature sensors, pressure bridges, or other types of transducers. The
XTR108's uncommitted op amp can be used to convert current into a voltage, =
or
for four-wire RTD circuits.

Functionally, a 4-20mA transmitter provides accurate transmission of analog
signals from sensors (used to monitor physical parameters in industrial
processes such as temperature and pressure) to remotely located measurement
equipment. The sensor signal is amplified, linearized, and transmitted in t=
he
form of current with no power supply required at the transmitter site. 4-20=
mA
current loops are not affected by line resistance and are much more immune =
to
electrical interference.

Available Today

The XTR108 is available now and is packaged in an SSOP-24. Suggested resale
pricing is $3.45 in 1,000 piece quantities. The device is specified for -40
degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius temperature range.

Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=
sing
and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The
company's businesses also include sensors and controls, and educational and
productivity solutions. TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has
manufacturing or sales operations in more than 25 countries.

Texas Instruments is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol=
 TXN.
