FEATURED SELECTION: 
THE OLD ECONOMY IS BACK by Peter Dag & Associates, Inc. 
(May 28, 2001) The old economy is back. The more things change, the more they  
stay the same. There was a big hype in the late 1990's, with the blessing of  
the Fed, that the economy had entered a new stage of development, supported  
by above average productivity gains driven by technological innovations...

PARTIAL OUTLINE OF FEATURED ARTICLES IN CURRENT ISSUE OF CONSENSUS FUTURES  
AND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:  
GANN ANGLES by Phyllis Kahn 
(June, 2001) May was a very bullish month for all the stock indices, but the  
divergence between the individual indices was stronger than ever. The Dow was  
the undisputed leader except for the NYSE index which managed to make new  
all-time highs. Of course, the NYSE is still trading at the 600+ level,  
having missed most of the 18-year surge that took place in the other major  
averages... 
EURO/YEN: EURO UNDERVALUED BY 30% LONG-DATED FORWARDS PREDICT FURTHER EURO  
SLIDE by Deutsche Bank AG Foreign Exchange Research Department 
(June 1, 2001) The recent decline in the Euro's value has once again pushed  
the new single European currency into significantly undervalued territory  
versus the U.S. Dollar. According to our purchasing power parity (PPP)  
estimates, the Euro is presently undervalued by nearly 30% versus the dollar.  
Historically, PPP undervaluations of this magnitude are not often  
sustainable. As Figure 1 shows, when the Euro has moved more than +/-20% out  
of line with its long-run PPP valuation, it has eventually set forces in  
motion to reverse the currency misalignment... 
THE NEXT GLOBAL GROWTH DERBY HAS BEGUN by Merrill Lynch & Co. Global  
Securities Research & Economics Group 
(May 31, 2001) The stage is set for the next global growth derby. That stage,  
of course, was built on the aggressive reduction in short-term interest rates  
around the globe. All major central banks have recently cut interest rates in  
response to the surprisingly rapid deterioration of the global economy since  
the fourth quarter of last year... 
WILD MARKETS AHEAD by Richard A. Brock & Associates, Inc. 
(May 25, 2001) Actually, there have been some wild markets behind as well.  
These have not been easy markets and we don't expect the trends to get any  
easier in the weeks ahead. Current weakness in the grain markets has  
certainly turned attitudes negative among most producers. But before everyone  
throws in the towel, remember a couple of things:... 
GLOBAL STRATEGY AND INVESTMENT TRENDS by David Fuller 
(May 25, 2001) Ronnie Biggs Saga A Metaphor For New Labour--A moment of  
welcome public relations for the UK's tourism industry, recently trampled by  
foot-and-mouth disease--Ronnie Biggs of 1960's Great Train Robbery fame gave  
up Brazil's sunshine and Lambada dancers because he missed England's green  
and rolling hills, pubs, national health service and presumably the rain...
