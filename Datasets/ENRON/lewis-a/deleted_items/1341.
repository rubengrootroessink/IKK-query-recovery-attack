CTXS as a speculative swing trade long.  CTXS definitive support at 18 3/4.  this line is drawn in.  probing for it here.  stop loss at 18.

sure the Mavs have been stinking it up bigtime having lost last night to the Sonics at home.  but taking the Mavs to beat charlotte on the road and giving up only 3 1/2 points is a lay-up as both Wesley and Mashburn are out.  the only scoring threats charlotte is gonna have is baron davis.
