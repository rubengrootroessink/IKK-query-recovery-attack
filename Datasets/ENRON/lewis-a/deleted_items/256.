Jenna Myers Scouting Report
January 2002
Sponsored by TechnoScout,
Where technology hits home.

Imagine this. You lean back in your seat as the symphony begins. The overture begins by the string section, with a soothing melody. In comes the brass, with high, piercing treble, followed by percussion, with teeth-rattling bass. Your eyes closed, you sink into your chair and let the rich sound fill your head. Suddenly, the phone on your desk rings. You realize you are not at Carnegie Hall, you're at your office? and that's not a symphony orchestra, it's the new Aiwa Digital Audio System.

Can you experience surround sound using just two speakers? Q-Surround proves it's possible. Using unique signal processing algorithms based on advanced psychoacoustics, Q-surround circuitry creates a "phantom" center channel, expands the front left and right soundfield and places "virtual" surround speakers around you to simulate the effect of a multi-channel system. Aiwa portable stereos with Q-Surround are capable of delivering a rich, all-encompassing soundfield that recreates the "you are there" experience as no conventional compact two-speaker system can.

Superior design, surprising sound. The Aiwa Digital Audio System

synthesizes the latest acoustic technology with practical features and attractive design. The wood cabinet blends with nearly any d?cor, and its robust construction results in enhanced sound reproduction. Independent, tuned bass reflex speaker enclosures provide tighter bass response, and the 3/4-inch baffle board helps eliminate any resonance within the speaker enclosure. It features 10 Watts per Channel (20 total), and the Super T-Bass delivers deep and powerful bass sound without the "boominess" that characterizes systems with less sophisticated low-frequency enhancement circuits. That's because Super T-Bass was specifically engineered to improve the low-end performance of small speakers, taking into account their particular resonance characteristics.


Cutting-edge commitment. Since being founded in 1951, Aiwa has been a leader in the field of consumer electronics and acoustic technology. This explains the company's record of "firsts," including making Japan's first cassette tape recorder, Japan's first stereo cassette deck, the first company to manufacture digital audio tape (DAT) products, the first to market a recording headphone stereo and a leader in mini-systems. This same commitment to cutting edge technology has enabled Aiwa to create the gold standard in portable CD stereos.

Great sound is only the beginning. The Aiwa Digital Audio System http://offer.technoscout.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eN8y0DlbdP0GZt0eGW0AC
also incorporates the latest features for functionality and convenience. The Full Logic Mechanism with Auto-Reverse provides for smoother, less clumsy operation.  Unlike many comparable units made by other manufacturers, this one is compatible with CDs made with a recorder or computer, like CD-R/RW. The CD player has Repeat, Random and Programmed play, and the AM/FM Stereo has 30-station preset memory and Digitally Synthesized tuning for locking in stations. There is even a preset equalizer with selectable modes for Pop, Rock and Jazz.

Try it factory-direct, risk-free. Thanks to our special relationship with the manufacturer, we can offer it with a special payment plan and our exclusive risk-free trial. Order today, and if you are not completely satisfied for any reason, simply return it within 30 days for a full refund of the purchase price.
