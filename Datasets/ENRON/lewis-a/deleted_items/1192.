[IMAGE]=09 Mega-Wide Mega-Muscle   [IMAGE]  Heard about our newest PowerBoo=
k G4 computers?   You?ll recognize them when you see them. The Titanium Pow=
erBook G4 still features the stunning 15.2-inch (diagonal) TFT screen and r=
emains the world?s thinnest and lightest professional notebook.  We?ve just=
 made it even more powerful, featuring:     ? Faster processors?550 MHz and=
 667 MHz, to be precise   ? High speed graphics?thanks to the new ATI Mobil=
ity Radeon AGP 4X graphics processing unit with 16MB of DDR video memory   =
? Gigabit Ethernet?a first for portable computers   ? Larger hard drives?of=
fering up to 48GB of storage capacity   We now preinstall an AirPort Card w=
hen you order a model with a 667-MHz PowerPC G4 processor, and you can orde=
r any PowerBook G4  with a CD-RW optical drive.  One final tidbit to call t=
o your attention. If you purchase a qualifying 550-MHz or 667-MHz PowerBook=
 G4 between now and December 31, 2001, we?ll double the RAM  at no addition=
al charge.  [IMAGE] [IMAGE][IMAGE] Meet Our New 600-MHz iBook   [IMAGE]  It=
?s our best-selling portable ever, and now iBook offers even more power in =
its 4.9-pound, 1.3-inch package.  Take, for example, more speed. You can no=
w order iBook with either a 500-MHz or our new 600-MHz PowerPC G3 processor=
. In fact, the latter features a new system bus running at 100 MHz for even=
 better performance.  Like more memory? All iBook models now come standard =
with 128MB and support up to 640MB.  And let?s not forget those bigger hard=
 drives. Whether you?re creating Desktop Movies or building an impressive m=
usic collection, iBook  offers more storage capacity to accommodate your ne=
eds, featuring hard drives up to 30GB.  [IMAGE] [IMAGE][IMAGE] One for the =
Road   One for the Road...and the Office  Not too long ago, many creative p=
rofessionals had two systems. One that sat on the desk in the office, and o=
ne they took on the road. The one offered muscle; the other, mobility. It m=
ay not have been a perfect solution, but it was tolerable.  Thank goodness =
we don?t have to tolerate it any longer. The PowerBook G4 eradicated that p=
articular paradigm, offering a mobile solution that not only has no comprom=
ises but that allows creative professionals to produce high-quality work on=
 the road as easily as they can in the studio.   And though we?ve sung its =
praises a few times ourselves, now Pfeiffer Consulting?an independent and h=
ighly respected technology research institute?has issued an in-depth report=
 on the ?Portable Creative Workstation. ?  We think you?ll find the results=
 illuminating.  [IMAGE] [IMAGE][IMAGE] Built for Mac OS X: QuicKeys   Built=
 for Mac OS X: QuicKeys  How many times a day do you type your name? Visit =
a particular web page? Open a set of related applications or documents? Ins=
ert the identical paragraph or two of copy in a document? Check your calend=
ar?  Mount a server? Update an expense report?  Call what?s-his-name? Check=
 email?  Wouldn?t it be great if you had a simple yet effective way of doin=
g any or all of the above just by hitting one or two keys on your keyboard?=
  You can. With QuicKeys. In fact, QuicKeys X ?the most recent version of t=
he venerable Macintosh macro utility program?lets you easily create all sor=
ts of shortcuts that can save you time and make you more productive. Best o=
f all, it takes full advantage of Mac OS X.  [IMAGE] [IMAGE][IMAGE] Mac Gam=
es Come Giant Size   [IMAGE]  He?s big. He?s bad. And he?s got a thing for =
Mac OS X.  His name?s Kabuto, and he?s the oversized star of MacPlay?s late=
st game, Giants: Citizen Kabuto . He lives on a faraway planet called The I=
sland, where he battles the seductive Sea Reapers and the goofy-but-tough M=
eccaryns. The action is fast and furious, and the fluid, 3D graphics are ou=
t of this world.  In fact, Mark Dochtermann, technical director for publish=
er MacPlay, calls it ?the most visually vibrant game on the Mac.? The first=
 to take advantage of symmetric multiprocessing, it is also the first Mac g=
ame that runs exclusively on Mac OS X. Like to take Kabuto on? Then visit t=
he Apple Store, where you?ll find both Giants: Citizen Kabuto  and Mac OS X=

t has  Mac OS X preinstalled or you purchased Mac OS X as a separate produc=
t, there are two ways you can upgrade to Mac OS X version 10.1.  Visit an A=
pple retail store or a participating authorized Apple dealer before the end=
 of the month to participate in our Instant Up-To-Date program. (Available =
through 10/31/01 or while supplies last.)  Or participate in our standard u=
pgrade program. You?ll pay just $19.95 (for shipping and handling), and you=
?ll receive a:     ? Mac OS X version 10.1 CD (upgrade install)   ? Mac OS =
9.2.1 CD (full install)   ? Developer Tools CD   ? User guide and electroni=
c documentation Either way, don?t miss this opportunity to turbocharge your=
 Mac with Mac OS X v10.1. Questions?  [IMAGE][IMAGE][IMAGE] Technically Spe=
aking   [IMAGE]  If you?ve installed Mac OS X version 10.1 on your Power Ma=
c or Power  Book, make sure you take a few minutes to download the iMovie P=
lug-in  Pack 2.1.1 before you get started making Desktop Movies in iMovie 2=
.  Inside this simple-to-install file, you?ll find a number of effects (e.g=
., ghost trails and mirror), transitions (e.g., circle opening and wash out=
), and titles (e.g., subtitle and zoom) that will add polish to your latest=
 moviemaking ventures.  You?ll find ?iMovie Plug-in Pack 2.1.1 for Mac OS X=

s just as easy to use as ever. In fact, editing your site is even easier an=
d more streamlined. But now you can personalize your pages and add more pro=
fessional touches than you ever could before.  For example, you can now cre=
ate multiple websites, tailoring the look and feel of each to target partic=
ular audiences. Like to limit access to one or more of those sites? You can=
 do that, too ? thanks to the new password protection capabilities in HomeP=
age. You can also generate site directories automatically. And that?s not a=
