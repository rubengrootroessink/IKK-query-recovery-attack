  NEWS [IMAGE]   A/P Press  Release 9/01  NEW  PRODUCT ALERTS MOTORISTS OF TIRE PRESSURE DANGER  Ft.  Lauderdale, Florida --- Underinflated tires are the number one cause  of premature tire wear.  Underinflated  tires on motor vehicles cause crashes due to tire blow-outs, immobilized  vehicles, poor handling as well as hydroplaning. ACCU-PRESSURE  SAFETY CAPS are a new tire pressure monitor product which  will help drivers know when their tire pressure is too low. Ft.  Lauderdale ACCU-PRESSURE SAFETY CAPS, INC.  is the exclusive distributor for the product. The chrome caps simply  go over the tire's valve stem and will display green when the tire  pressure is adequate, yellow if approximately four pounds underinflated,  and red when approximately ten pounds underinflated.   The  NHTSA, the Transportation Deptartment agency responsible for vehicle  safety, estimates that monitoring tire pressure could prevent over  10,000 injuries and countless deaths.  [IMAGE]
