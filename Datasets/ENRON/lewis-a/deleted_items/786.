The Week's Agenda: Look Around

Giving ad buyers the metrics they want may mean looking
elsewhere for key technology. Europe has some of it. Sites
there can tell you things about their users that sites in
the United States can only guess at.

Increasing Your Conversion Rates

If you're going to survive, you have to focus on
bottom-line results. Spending a fortune to drive traffic to
your site -- when most of it never does anything while it's
there -- drives up the cost of customer acquisition so
much, you'll never reach profitability.

Measuring for Dollars: Monetizing Your Site

Janet will be sharing ideas about readers' specific
situations. This week, a content-site developer says the
editorial folks want to track page and subject-matter
usage -- so how do you relate measuring to monetizing? Good
question. Everyone is asking it these days.
