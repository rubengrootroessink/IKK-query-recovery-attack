uityAlert.com.     SpotLife Announces Agreement with Yahoo! Mail; Create, S=
end and View Video E-mail through Yahoo! Mail   SAN MATEO, Calif., Nov 26, =
2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- SpotLife, the leading provider of integrated person=
al video solutions, and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading global communi=
cations, commerce and media company, today announced an agreement to offer =
users video e-mail services through Yahoo!(R) Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).=
 The addition of video e-mail services will enable users of Yahoo! Mail to =
easily create and send personalized video e-mail messages to friends, famil=
y and colleagues virtually anywhere in the world.   "SpotLife's technology =
provides a significant value-add to the Yahoo! Mail service," said John Wal=
sh, CEO of SpotLife. "Video e-mail offers Yahoo! the ability to provide the=
ir users with easy and reliable video e-mail capabilities, while ensuring t=
hat Yahoo! Mail maintains a superior service offering, and the best Interne=
t video technology available on the market."   Under the agreement, SpotLif=
e will provide video e-mail technology and service for Yahoo! Mail. The ser=
vice enables Yahoo! Mail users to easily record video with a PC video camer=
a, or upload video already existing on their PC. SpotLife's technology auto=
matically compresses and uploads video messages to SpotLife's servers, elim=
inating the need to store large digital video/audio files on the end-users'=
 PC. Recipients of a video e-mail receive a notification message containing=
 a link to a Web page on Yahoo! Mail where the customer can readily view th=
e video through the SpotLife Player. The videos are composed and sent direc=
tly from a Yahoo Mail user's existing account, and managed and stored by Sp=
otLife. Whether consumers are using broadband or dial-up connections, the v=
ideo e-mail service works with any Internet connection speed. All that is r=
equired to create and send video e-mail is a PC with the Windows operating =
system, an Internet connection, a PC video camera (or other video source) a=
nd a Yahoo! Mail account. Recipients of Yahoo! Mail video e-mails need only=
 a Windows media player to watch video e-mails sent from Yahoo! Mail.   "We=
 believe this new feature will provide Yahoo! Mail users with a unique new =
way to communicate with family, friends and business associates," said Lisa=
 Pollock, director of Messaging Products for Yahoo!. "Our agreement with Sp=
otLife further supports Yahoo! Mail's strategy to continue to develop and i=
ntegrate innovative, new features that add real value to people's lives. We=
 are also pleased to provide even more effective marketing services by offe=
ring rich media ads through this new feature."   The demand for Internet vi=
deo technology continues to increase dramatically. Based on IDC Forecasts, =
approximately 60 million PC video cameras will be sold by the year 2005. Th=
is represents a significant market for the adoption of video e-mail service=
s.   "Video e-mail is a great way for friends and family to keep in touch i=
n an uncertain world," said Chris Chute, analyst, Worldwide Imaging Group, =
IDC. "The continuing popularity of PC cameras and adoption of new technolog=
ies will make it easier for this to happen."   About SpotLife  SpotLife is =
