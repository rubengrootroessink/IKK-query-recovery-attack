Catch of the Day: Ticket turbulence

The FAA has been working for years on a new air traffic
system called "Free Flight," in which pilots, using modern
technology, would have direct control of their flight plans.
Advantages include flexibility, direct (cheaper) routing,
and a reduced load on the air traffic control system.

Yet most passengers still aren't trusted to handle their own
itineraries like grownups. They cannot transfer or resell
tickets if plans change. This is partly because the airlines
historically believe that transferable tickets would
encourage speculation.

FairAir is trying to counter that with a plan right out of
1999: the company is building a market for transferable
airline tickets. FairAir wants to sell this service to
airlines, which will then be able to market a class of
tickets that are potentially refundable (if there are
buyers). The for-sale tickets might show up on the airlines'
sites, as well as auction and travel sites. CEO Frank Levy
is convinced an aftermarket will drive up ticket prices on
some routes. He also reminds me that most airlines lose
money, so some experimentation wouldn't hurt.

Northwest Airlines is running a trial with FairAir tickets
on some of its routes. Real success will depend on much
broader adoption, however.
