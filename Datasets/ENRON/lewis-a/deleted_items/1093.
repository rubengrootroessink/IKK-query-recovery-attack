y Two-Thirds of Airline Travelers ``Already Comfortable'' With Flying Again=
   WESTPORT, Conn., Oct 23, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Five weeks after Septem=
ber 11, a day that involved the worst air catastrophes in the history of th=
e United States, J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) re=
port today that nearly two-thirds of airline passengers are "already comfor=
table" with flying again. Only 3 percent of flyers feel that they will "nev=
er" be at ease with the air travel experience.   The study was designed by =
J.D. Power and Associates and was conducted with Yahoo! Inc., a leading glo=
bal Internet communications, commerce and media company. More than 2,200 ad=
ults were surveyed about recent air travel experiences and future air trave=
l intent.   "Nearly one in five air travelers are still 'undecided' about w=
hether or not they will feel safe traveling on a commercial jet," said Mich=
ael Taylor, director of travel services at J.D. Power and Associates. "But =
these are positive numbers considering that this survey was conducted less =
than five weeks after the September 11 disasters. This report illustrates t=
he faith consumers have that air travel will once again be considered safe.=
"   However, 72 percent of flyers feel that air travel "has changed forever=
." The survey went on to ask respondents their perceptions about current sa=
fety procedures on aircraft and in airports as well as possible security me=
asures that could be implemented.   An overwhelming 83 percent of flyers in=
dicated that they did not mind a longer check-in process at airports, as lo=
ng as it increased the safety and security of the traveler. More than one-h=
alf of airline passengers are willing to pay "a security tax" on each ticke=
t to provide increased security.   "A lingering fear of air travel was the =
most often cited reason for the public's reduced travel habits," said Taylo=
r. "However, business travelers cited a slowing economy as another leading =
reason for a slowdown in business travel. Leisure travelers listed 'wanting=
 to stay closer to home' as another important factor."   Among current in-f=
light security measures, respondents rated in-flight armed air marshals and=
 armor-reinforced cockpit doors as equally important. Arming cockpit crews =
and a ban on silverware in the cabin were reported as much less helpful in =
re-establishing consumer confidence in air travel.   At the airport, a sear=
ch of all carry-on luggage would inspire the most confidence in travelers i=
n addition to existing security measures at airports. The presence of armed=
 law enforcement officers at the airport ranked a close second. The ban on =
cutlery at airport restaurants is not perceived to be very helpful, accordi=
ng to survey respondents.   "To increase public confidence in safety at the=
 airport, travelers believe that new technologies could be applied quite ef=
fectively," said Taylor. "High-technology X-ray and scanning, along with el=
ectronic bomb-sniffing equipment, were cited most by respondents. These ite=
ms were considered even more effective than Federal control of the airport =
security process."   This public opinion poll was conducted among random vi=
sitors to Yahoo's Web site during the week of October 10. More than 1,300 r=
espondents reported having air travel experiences within the past three mon=
