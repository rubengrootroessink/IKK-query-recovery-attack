LazyTraders,

Although the Markets were down this week we made 70% profit in the
ChatRoom.

Every day there was between 10 to 25% profit to be made for the Members.

The nice thing is that profits are not being chewed up by commissions
because we only pay $1 to trade 100 shares.

Here is an email we got from one of Michael's fans:

Hey Michael,
I just wanted to drop a quick line about the results of your chatroom. It
is by far, hands down the absolute best 125 dollars I have EVER spent!
I've been in the room for only two days, and have profited more than I
have the last two months. Even my wife (a complete skeptic) is completely
amazed!! I gotta tell you that Im very excited about the room, and Im
looking forward to a long and profitable relationship!
         Thanks again!!
                              Craig

This is what makes the Chatroom so much fun.

So if you have a couple of hours a week to spend between 7.45 AM and 8 PM
EST join us, it might be very profitable and will be fun.

You can start with as little as $500.

Become a Lazy DayTrader at:

http://www.lazytrader.com and then join Michael's Room for a small monthly
fee.

Have a nice day.

*1200% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 13 weeks if
you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would
have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in
the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
