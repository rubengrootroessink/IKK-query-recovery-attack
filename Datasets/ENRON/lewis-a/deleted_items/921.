RBAK:  Redback Networks has been consolidating for four days after its gap
up from an upgrade on 6/1.  However, its relative weakness is shown by its
inability advance significantly with the broader markets.  It has a
convergence of overhead resistance at the declining 10-, 20- and 50-day
MAs.  It closed with a bearish piercing pattern (.02 away from being
bearish "engulfing").  OBV and price volume trend are bearish.  Consider
SHORTING RBAK once it trades at 15.92.  Suggested target is 13.77.
Suggested stop is 16.33.
