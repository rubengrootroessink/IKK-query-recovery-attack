uityAlert.com.     TI Introduces World's First 1.8V Logic Family for Portab=
le Consumer Electronics, Telecommunications and Computing=1DFamily Extends =
Battery Life, Simplifies Design Process, and Increases Data Throughput   DA=
LLAS, Oct 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN)=
 (TI) today introduced a new logic family, Advanced Ultra-Low Voltage CMOS =
(AUC) which are optimized at 1.8-V but are operational to sub 1-V levels. T=
he AUC family provides significant benefits to portable consumer electronic=
s, computing and telecom applications by operating at low power and high sp=
eed while maintaining overall system signal integrity. (See www.ti.com/sc/a=
uc )   The family consists of Little Logic (single/dual/triple gates), octa=
ls and WideBus(tm) devices. All devices are optimized at 1.8-V, and have an=
 operating voltage range of 0.8-V to 2.5-V. With a voltage tolerance of 3.6=
V, AUC extends the life of systems by allowing legacy devices to remain fun=
ctional. In addition, the sub-1-V feature allows AUC to be operated by a si=
ngle cell battery. AUC also includes Ioff, which protects the device by sup=
porting partial power down applications.   TI has been working closely with=
 Philips and IDT to develop the specifications for the new AUC family. Init=
ially, TI will release Little Logic and Philips will offer an alternate sou=
rce. Subsequently, in 2002, IDT, Philips, and TI will release Octals and Wi=
deBus devices. Based on this collaboration, alternate source agreements are=
 in place.   "TI continues to take the logic market into new areas by devel=
oping leading technologies and innovative products. The introduction of the=
 new AUC family enables customers to gain higher performance as they move t=
o the lower voltage node DSPs and high-performance analog ICs," said David =
Hoover, worldwide product marketing manager for TI's Standard Linear and Lo=
gic Products. "In addition, optimizing the family at 1.8-V extends battery =
life while also speeding up data throughput in the system."   Little Logic =
AUC   The AUC family is available in single/dual/triple gate devices for po=
rtable consumer electronics. Consistent with the family, the Little Logic A=
UC devices are optimized at 1.8-V, while maintaining high speed and low noi=
se. Essential to the success of portable consumer applications, the devices=
 extend battery life while maintaining very good signal integrity. The Litt=
le Logic devices will be available in various packaging options, including =
NanoStar(tm) packaging, the world's smallest logic package.   "Philips' foc=
us on providing leading Pico Gate solutions for the consumer, networking, a=
nd communications markets makes the alternate source agreement for AUC tech=
nology a perfect match," said Bruce Potvin, director of marketing logic pro=
ducts. "Working with TI, we are able to deliver a true alternate source for=
 AUC Little Logic devices that offer high-performance, industry leading sol=
utions."   Widebus/Octal AUC   For telecommunications and computing applica=
tions, the AUC family of devices offer high speed data throughput and enhan=
ced signal integrity that is critical to performance. Speed for the Widebus=
 devices is a very fast, 1.5ns- 2.0ns (typical). The 1.8-V provides a logic=
 migration for lower operating voltages, and simplifies the system design l=
earning curve.   "The AUC family enhances IDT's high-performance low voltag=
e logic portfolio by enabling us to keep pace with the industry, as custome=
rs migrate to lower operating nodes," said Kevin Walsh, director of strateg=
ic marketing for IDT's Timing and Logic Division. "As a company strongly fo=
cused on communications, we believe it is important to use our digital desi=
gn expertise to be a leader in product innovation. By collaborating with TI=
 and others, we ensure that these next-generation devices will provide the =
necessary performance, nodes of operation, and feature set for our networki=
ng and communications customer base."   Availability, Packaging and Pricing=
   The first Little Logic devices in the AUC family are sampling now with v=
olume production scheduled for the first quarter of 2002. Estimated resale =
pricing for the Little Logic devices begins at $0.18 for quantities greater=
 than 1,000. Devices in Little Logic are available in NanoStar packaging, S=
C-70 (DCK), and SOT23 (DBV). AUC NanoStar will be available in 1H 2002. Wid=
eBus and Octal devices are available in 2Q02. The AUC family is fully suppo=
rted with technical documentation.   Texas Instruments Incorporated is the =
world leader in digital signal processing and analog technologies, the semi=
conductor engines of the Internet age. The company's businesses also includ=
e sensors and controls, and educational and productivity solutions. TI is h=
eadquartered in Dallas, Texas, and has manufacturing or sales operations in=
 more than 25 countries.   Texas Instruments is traded on the New York Stoc=
