quityAlert.com.     Radlan Expands Its Solutions for Metro Access With AMCC=
 Network Processor Partnership   SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 23, 2001 (BUSINESS W=
IRE) --   Radlan and AMCC Demonstrate Fully Integrated Routing System Solut=
ions              for Network Processor-Based Platforms at NPC  Radlan Inc.=
 (www.radlan.com), the leading provider of embedded networking system solut=
ions, and Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (Nasdaq:AMCC), a leader in high-band=
width silicon connectivity solutions for the world's optical networks, toda=
y announced their joint demonstration at the Network Processor Conference o=
f a fully integrated metro access and service provider system solution for =
network processor-based platforms.   With this partnership, Radlan announce=
s immediate support for AMCC's nP3400 network processor (NPU) and follow-on=
 support for members of AMCC's nP7000 family of high-speed NPUs including t=
he nP7250 OC-48c Network Processor and the recently announced nP7510 10 Gbp=
s Network Processor for OC-192c Packet Over SONET (POS), ATM and 10 Gigabit=
 Ethernet applications.   Radlan, which already delivers its long-establish=
ed OpENS(TM) embedded networking solution for the merchant ASIC market, now=
 extends its technology and professional services to vendors seeking the br=
oader systems design advantages of network processors.   A demonstration of=
 the initial joint solution -- including Radlan's OpENS(TM) routing and gra=
phical user interface (GUI) management software running on an AMCC nP Workb=
ench-3400 reference and development system -- will be on display in AMCC's =
booth at this week's Network Processor Conference in San Jose.   Radlan's p=
re-integrated embedded networking system (OpENS(TM)) provides a portfolio o=
f fabless-system solutions for multiservice switches, offering features suc=
h as edge routing, bandwidth provisioning and QoS, content switching, secur=
ity and access control.   Additionally, Radlan offers a complete developmen=
t and testing environment specifically designed for software integration wi=
th AMCC's NPU family. Radlan will also offer a selection of reference desig=
ns integrating OpENS with AMCC's network processors, traffic managers and s=
witch fabrics. These reference designs will enable OEMs to significantly sp=
eed the development and release of multiservice switches and metro edge rou=
ters.   Radlan's professional services, based on decades of systems integra=
tion experience, will assist customers with complex system design and integ=
ration and in meeting mission-critical time-to-market demands.   "Radlan is=
 responding to the great increase in demand for feature-rich switches in th=
e metro access market," said Yoram Valent, president of Radlan Inc.   "OpEN=
S effectively merges together a collection of hardware and software compone=
nts to create high-end network systems. Vendors using the pre-integrated Ra=
dlan/AMCC system solution will be able to assemble a multiservice access sw=
itch in as little as six to nine months."   "By meshing their proven OpENS =
networking and management software code base with AMCC's nPsoft(TM) Develop=
ment Environment, Radlan enables our network equipment vendor customers to =
get to market even faster with fewer resources, allowing each OEM to focus =
on its own unique value-adds," said Robin Melnick, director of software pro=
duct management for AMCC's Switching and Network Processing Group.   "The R=
adlan/AMCC partnership exemplifies our continuing commitment to offer our c=
ustomers complete, effective time-to-market solutions."   Radlan's target m=
arkets include Enterprise LAN, Broadband and Metro Access, as well as emerg=
ing Storage and Server Switches markets, which can benefit greatly from Rad=
lan's packet switching know-how and expertise.   Core Technologies  The OpE=
NS platform is composed of four highly integrated components:   1.  Op-ROS =
-- The Routing Operating System is a generic             software package t=
hat allows for quick integration with a             variety of communicatio=
n chips, network processors, CPUs             and RTOSes         2.  Op-IDS=
 -- The Integrated Development and Simulation             environment combi=
ned with enhanced testing tools makes it             easy for vendors to in=
tegrate with custom designs and             applications         3.  Op-RTG=
 -- The Regression Testing Generator offers more             than 2,500 pre=
