Catch of the Day: Trade you

In an economy in which the superstars let us down, who are
the heroes? I submit it's the guys out there buying stuff.
Consumer confidence is surprisingly high. It's as if real
people are ignoring the soggy market, the dot-com washout,
and the recessionary mutterings from Gray Davis and Alan
Greenspan.

But aside from a tax cut, how are we going to recognize the
troops? As it happens, a San Francisco company, PeopleCards,
is reacting to our culture's superstar obsession by making a
series of trading cards with real people on them. People can
even submit themselves as candidates on the PeopleCards
site.

Now, if this takes off, it'll be a fad. Yet it's worth
noting that the major sports card manufacturers (like Topps)
are considering, if not already producing, non-sports cards.

In talking to PeopleCards president Brant Herman, it
occurred to me that making limited runs of cards for private
use (as promotional items, for example) could be a nice
business. But there are already companies doing this.

While it's unlikely that the public will want to mint its
own celebrities, if it does, an exit for this experiment
could be an acquisition by one of the major card companies.
