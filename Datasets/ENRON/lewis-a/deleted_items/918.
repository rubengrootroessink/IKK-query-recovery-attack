  Texas Instruments Announces Enhanced Brightness, Color Saturation For DLP=
 Technology; `Sequential Color Recapture' Technology Described At SID 2001 =
Conference=1DIllustrative images for this story may be found at http://www.=
dlp.com/dlp/resources/resources.asp   DALLAS, Jun 7, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -=
- At the annual conference of the Society for Information Display (SID) - h=
eld at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California - Tex=
as Instruments (TI) (NYSE:TXN) today announced an exciting innovation which=
 will allow projectors featuring DLP(TM) technology to deliver images which=
 can be up to 40% brighter than is currently possible or which feature grea=
ter color saturation - or a combination of increased brightness and increas=
ed color saturation.   In a paper entitled "Sequential Color Recapture and =
Dynamic Filtering: A Method of Scrolling Color" authored by D. Scott Dewald=
, Steven M. Penn and Michael Davis of Texas Instruments, an innovative appr=
oach to increasing the efficiency of a single modulator display is describe=
d.   "The current DLP single-panel technology has only one color present on=
 the surface of the DMD, meaning that, at any one time, one third of the li=
ght is used while two thirds of the light is wasted," said Scott Dewald of =
TI's DLP(TM) Products division, who delivered the paper at the conference. =
"Sequential Color Recapture - SCR - is a technology that allows all three c=
olors to be present simultaneously, such that a single panel DLP system can=
 now be as efficient as - potentially more efficient than - a three panel s=
ystem, but without the additional parts, size, weight and expense of three =
panel systems."   "Although many solutions have been proposed to the challe=
nge of maximizing the efficiency of single modulator displays," he continue=
d, "all have exhibited a high degree of mechanical complexity which would m=
ake manufacturability a real issue. One of the key virtues of SCR is its si=
mplicity: it is no more complex than what we have today, requiring no addit=
ional moving parts."   The implementation of SCR technology requires a chan=
ge to the color wheel and light integrating element currently employed in s=
ingle-DMD DLP(TM) subsystems, together with changes in the DMD and the driv=
e electronics. The optical capability of SCR has been made possible by adva=
nces in dichroic and metal thin-film technologies, the most important of th=
ese being the photolithographic patterning of dichroic coatings. The SCR co=
lor wheel is created from RGB dichroic coatings arranged in a "spiral of Ar=
chimedes" pattern.   "This is a tremendously exciting development for DLP t=
echnology," said Dennis Fritsche, Manager for Business Products at TI's DLP=
(TM) Products Division. "It has been a continuing goal to not only increase=
 brightness, but also to increase color saturation - and SCR allows us to d=
o both. On a panel-to-panel basis, DLP technology has always out-performed =
competing technologies. With this invention, we can now, in all respects, m=
atch three-panel modulators with a single DMD, but in the small, lightweigh=
t projectors that DLP(TM) technology uniquely enables because of its high s=
peed and digitally consistent mirror technology. We are now investigating i=
mplementation plans and schedules to bring this revolutionary advancement t=
o the market place."   Today, TI supplies DLP(TM) subsystems to more than t=
hirty of the world's top projector manufacturers, who then design, manufact=
ure and market projectors based on DLP(TM) technology. There are now over f=
ifty products based on DLP(TM) technology in the market. Since early 1996, =
over 750,000 DLP(TM) subsystems have been shipped. Over the past four years=
, DLP(TM) technology-based projectors have consistently won some of the aud=
io-visual industry's most prestigious awards, including, in June 1998, an E=
mmy Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.   At the heart of=
 TI's Digital Light Processing(TM) technology is the Digital Micromirror De=
vice optical semiconductor chip. The DMD switch has an array of up to 1,310=
,000 hinged, microscopic mirrors which operate as optical switches to creat=
e a high resolution, full color image.   Texas Instruments Incorporated is =
the world leader in digital signal processing and analog technologies, the =
semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The company's businesses also in=
clude sensors and controls, and educational and productivity solutions. TI =
is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and has manufacturing or sales operations=
 in more than 25 countries.   Texas Instruments is traded on the New York S=
