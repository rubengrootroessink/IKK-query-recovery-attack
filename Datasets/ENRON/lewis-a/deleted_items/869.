Press Release

eLEC Communications Brings DSL-P Network Online in
Northeast, Adding Over 200 Addressable Central Offices to
Its DSL-P Network

Expects to Begin Marketing UNE-P/DSL-P Bundles Across
Its Territory This Week

eLEC Communications Corp announced that it has
successfully added more than 200 additional central offices
to its digital subscriber line platform (DSL-P) network. The
new central offices are located throughout Verizon's
northeast territory. This new territory adds to eLEC's
existing DSL-P network in BellSouth and SNET territories.

eLEC CEO Paul Riss stated, ``We now have the
multi-regional capabilities in DSL that we have had in local
and long distance voice services. Through the combination
of UNE-P for voice and DSL-P for broadband, we can now
bundle voice and broadband services throughout a large
portion of our territory. This unique capability gives eLEC
the ability to provide a truly complete communications
solution to our customers.''

eLEC will begin selling communications bundles this week
consisting of local services at a 10% discount to the
respective incumbent local exchange carrier's (ILEC) retail
prices, 5.9 cent state-to-state long distance and DSL services
as low as $59 per month.

``With our expanded DSL-P footprint, we can now begin
focusing more resources on the marketing of UNE-P/DSL-P
bundles'', continued Mr. Riss. ``We believe that we can
improve the efficiency of our marketing operation,
significantly increase revenue per customer, and more
completely bond our customer to us through this powerful
combination.''

DSL-P is a way to deliver and control DSL services with
neither the expense of purchasing and collocating equipment
in central offices nor the additional staffing cost for
maintenance. Similar to UNE-P, DSL-P gives eLEC
national presence and quick time to market, without any
additional financial burden. eLEC's DSL-P offering gives
small business broadband capacity, messaging, and web
presence needed for their entire office.

eLEC Communications Corp. is a publicly-traded integrated
communications provider that is taking advantage of the
convergence of the current and future competitive
technological and regulatory developments in the Internet
and telecommunications markets. eLEC provides an
integrated suite of communications services to small and
medium-sized business customers, including voice, data and
broadband services.

This release contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. eLEC's actual results may differ
materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference
include, among others, availability of management;
availability, terms, and deployment of capital; eLEC's ability
to successfully market its services to current and new
customers, generate customer demand for its product and
services in the geographical areas in which eLEC can
operate, access new markets, negotiate and maintain suitable
interconnection agreements with the incumbent local
exchange carriers, and negotiate and maintain suitable
vendor relationships, all in a timely manner, at reasonable
cost and on satisfactory terms and conditions, as well as
regulatory, legislative and judicial developments that could
cause actual results to vary in such forward-looking
statements.
