This Weekend
 
We will start friday night at 7pm, for  seating and the tournament will take place saturday night for the glory at the  same time. You need to have a team by friday in order to play in the tournament.  You can sign up on the sheet on the front door or either email me or drop a  note in my box with you and your partners name on it. If you do not sign up by  friday then you will not be allowed to play on saturday. You can either bring  your own booze or chip in some cash for booze here at the house. Pledges and  alumni are highly encourged to play.
