In the last few weeks alone, over 1,000 people have taken advantage
of an unprecedented opportunity exclusive to Insert Company Name
Here Elite members.  We wanted to give the  Insert Company Name Here
Elite members one more chance to get involved before Mr. Hansson went
public and made this offer available to anyone.  It took some begging,
but thankfully he agreed to put off the public release for one more week.

If you're unfamiliar with what this is about, read on, it's incredible.

A very prominent and successful businessman out of Seattle, Washington
by the name of Theodore Hansson has decided to split the profits with
you 50-50 on very lucrative deals using a very simple technique that
big business is trying to keep secret.  Not only is it realistic to
make up to $5,000 per deal, Mr. Hansson takes ALL the risk away from
you by providing ALL the money needed for YOU to complete highly
profitable deals.
