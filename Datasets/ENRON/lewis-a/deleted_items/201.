Natural Gas Futures Dip Slightly Lower=20

Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.024 yesterday =

he market began the day higher on early short-covering, but fell off sharpl=
y in the afternoon after an extended forecast called for mild weather acros=
s much of the nation. Last week the AGA reported 124 Bcf of natural gas was=
 withdrawn from storage, leaving about a Tcf more still in the ground than =
a year ago. Look for the market to take-out the $2.00 support level soon. N=
atural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally fla=
t to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry=
 hub gained $0.01 to $2.12 per MMBtu. Look for cash prices to weaken ahead =
of the weekend, likely leading futures prices lower as well. With some cold=
 in the Northeast and Midwest, but mild temperatures forecast for the next =
two weeks, traders expect to see spot prices at a discount to futures by th=
e weekend.! Turn-back volumes could also weaken prices. By the end of Janua=

Enron Creditors Want Andersen Investigation

Enrons creditors committee has asked the bankruptcy judge for permission to=
 investigate Andersen to help it prepare possible legal action against the =
accounting firm. The committee wants to force Andersen officials to testify=
 and turn over documents. It was appointed last month by the US Trustee's o=
ffice, an arm of the Justice Department. Creditors, which are owed $40 bill=
ion, are concerned that Enron may be worth less than they thought. Andersen=
s CEO sent an auditing expert in his place to testify yesterday before Cong=
ress on the destruction of documents related to Enron. Another witness, Dav=
id Duncan, a fired Andersen executive, invoked his 5th Amendment rights aga=
inst self-incrimination and refused to testify at the hearing.=20

Enrons Top Management Departs

As Enron struggles to survive, its top executives have been bailing out. Of=
 the 14 executives named in the company's annual 10-K filing with the SEC l=
ast April, about half are gone. Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said that he lef=
t the company at the end of December and seems uncertain whether he quit or=
 was fired. Greg Whalley, president and COO, will join Swiss bank UBS which=
 has acquired Enron's trading unit. Former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former =
Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter left the company last year and Chairman Kenne=
th Lay resigned 2 days ago, in what some see as an attempt to stave off the=
 appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. A trustee would supersede Enron's top=
 management and its board of directors and would likely name a new law firm=
 to replace Enron's current bankruptcy attorneys. A coalition of creditors =
has petitioned a bankruptcy judge to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run En=
ron. To have a trustee appointed, creditors must prove managements actions =
have been ! inept or fraudulent. Document shredding and a suspected cover u=
p of the companys true financial liabilities could be adequate grounds to n=
ame a trustee. Lays departure leaves CFO Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chai=
rman and CEO of Enron Global Services in charge of the company for now. Enr=
on plans to hire a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permane=
nt replacement is chosen. Three consulting firms that specialize in turning=
 around failing businesses have been mentioned as possible front-runners. T=
hey are Alvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper.=20

Judge Halts Andersen Shredding

A federal judge has approved a plan from Enron shareholders to prevent Ande=
rsen from shredding any more documents related to Enrons audits. The judge =
ruled that plaintiffs lawyers can start taking depositions in 20 days from =
Andersen employees who were fired or suspended for the document shredding. =
Andersen must also file a report with the judge explaining the shredding at=
 that time. But Andersen argues that it has not completed its own investiga=
tion into the shredding, and depositions related to the lawsuit should take=
 a back seat to investigations by Congress, the SEC, the Justice Department=
 and others. The judge also ruled Andersen can shred no more documents and =
that the firm must preserve all Enron-related documents going back to 1994 =
and that plaintiffs' lawyers can inspect them. Andersen attorneys assured t=
he judge that the records are under guard and shredding has ceased. Anderse=
n has admitted that its Houston staff shredded a significant but undetermin=
ed number ! of documents related to Enron audits last fall as federal regul=
ators launched probes into possible accounting improprieties. The company l=
ater fired the head of the Houston office for his role in the shredding and=
 placed several others on administrative leave. Attorneys for the plaintiff=
s' want to depose the former partner and five others. Shareholders have fil=
ed a lawsuit against 29 current and former Enron executives and board membe=
rs for more than $1 billion they gained by selling company stock during a 3=
-year period prior its bankruptcy filing. Allegations have emerged that Enr=
on employees shredded accounting and finance documents as recently as last =
week. A hearing on Enron shredding is scheduled for February 5th before fed=
eral bankruptcy judge.=20

FERC to Hold Closed Meeting to Consider Investigation

The FERC plans to hold a rare, closed-door meeting next week to discuss a s=

y scheduled bi-monthly meeting that is open to the public. The FERC issued =
a list of agency officials who will attend the closed-door discussion of th=
e possible investigation, including Chairman Wood and the three commissione=
rs, the office of general counsel, staff with FERC's office of market tarif=
fs, and staff with the office of the executive director. Other items to be =
discussed at the closed meeting include: 1) A demand by a group of natural =
gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico that Williams cut its new gathering rat=
es and other fees for transporting volumes to shore. The producers claim th=
at Williams has boosted its rate for interruptible gathering by more than 2=
30% since December 1st; 2) A July complaint by New Power Holdings that PJM =
Interconn! ection's capacity requirements and deficiency charges are unjust=
, discriminatory and preferential. New Power wants PJM to change its existi=
ng capacity deficiency rate of $177 per MW day; 3) A case involving a FERC =

PSEG to Upgrade Coal Fired Plants in New Jersey

PSEG has agreed to spend $300 million over 10 years to install equipment to=
 limit air pollution at its New Jersey coal fired power plants to bring the=
m into compliance with new source review rules that require the installatio=
n of air pollution equipment when a plant undergoes major modifications. Th=
e agreement settles a complaint brought by the Justice Department, the EPA =
and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. The complaint al=
leged that PSEG failed to install necessary pollution controls at two plant=
s. The federal air pollution rule is currently under review by the White Ho=
use. Utilities with aging coal-fired plants contend that the rule requires =
expensive upgrades which reduces their ability to produce more energy. PSEG=
 said it would rather resolve the issue than face protracted and costly lit=
igation. PSEG Power has about 17,000 MW of generation capacity. In 2004, th=
e company will start to phase-in equipment to reduce emissions of nitrogen =
oxides, su! lfur dioxide and mercury at 3 New Jersey coal-fired plants with=
 a total capacity of about 1,250 MW, with all work scheduled to be complete=
 by 2012. PSEG will install selective catalytic reduction and dry scrubber =
devices, which remove particulates from exhaust before it is released into =
the air. The new technologies will cost about $150 million each.=20

Cargill Halts Saltville Natural Gas Storage Expansion

An planned expansion of a Virginia natural gas storage facility planned by =
Duke Energy and NUI has failed to obtain FERC approval because Cargill file=
d a complaint. Cargill asked the FERC to issue an order halting the constru=
ction of an expanded salt cavern storage facility planned for Saltville, Vi=
rginia. Duke and NUI formed a joint venture called Saltville LLC to expand =
the salt cavern storage to hold 12 Bcf of working natural gas capacity over=
 the next 3 years. The site currently stores only 1.1 Bcf. Cargill says tha=
t the companies are attempting to circumvent the jurisdiction of FERC by se=
eking approval only from Virginia state regulators even though the gas may =
be used in interstate commerce. The expanded Saltville storage site would h=
ave a deliverability of up to 550 MMcf per day. The Virginia State Corporat=
ion Commission has scheduled a February 20th hearing on the project.=20
