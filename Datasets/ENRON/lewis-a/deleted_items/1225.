<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Traders needed to be nimble and quick this week to take
advantage of sudden, sharp moves in the commodity markets
highlighted by gains in Cattle, Cocoa, Coffee and Wheat and
declines in Crude Oil, Gold and Hogs.  Meanwhile, the Dollar
stood strong and Stocks put in another solid performance
helped by progress in the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan,
although another sharp drop in U.S. industrial production
tempered enthusiasm.  Export rumors fired up Wheat as well
as Soybeans which racked up five-week highs.  While
confusion over OPEC's output intentions dominated the
headlines, the soft global economy was the underlying factor
weighing on Crude, while Natural Gas came under pressure
from unusually warm weather conditions.  Copper was firm,
but tentative, Gold was weak, and a rally in Orange Juice
fizzled out.

Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator

_____________________________________________________________________

Andrew - On Tuesday, November 13th, members of 'extreme SIGNALS'
were advised by trader and Iowa farmer Ken Seehusen:

FOR WEDNESDAY, SELL 1 DEC. MID-AM T-BOND AT 109-28 STOP.
PLACE A PROTECTIVE STOP AT 110-15

Wednesday's market opened at 109-14. Today, the Mini Bond
Closed at 104-30.  Are you short Bonds?

'Extreme Signals is extremely accurate. For what I trade ?
wheat, corn, soybeans - they've all made money. Of all the
trades I've taken since I started the service, I've never
lost a dime. He's right on the ticker! My broker even asked
me where I was getting my information!'
