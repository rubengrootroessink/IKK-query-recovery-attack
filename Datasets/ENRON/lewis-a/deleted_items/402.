=09Dear Red Herring Subscriber:   Are you interested in a new breed of mark=
et analysis, covering both public and private technology companies - one th=
at analyzes markets from the ground up and filters through the hype?    Lig=
ht Reading's Optical Oracle (www.opticaloracle.com ), a leading independent=
 technology research service, has been doing exactly that - tracking the ne=
xt wave of developments in optical networking technology and services.    T=
argeted at investors and technology leaders in both the private and public =
markets, Optical Oracle was launched last spring and has already published =
nine groundbreaking monthly reports, including examinations of telecom carr=
iers, communications chip players, optical switching, optical components, a=
nd IP networking gear. With a unique blend of financial and technological a=
nalysis, the Oracle has already garnered a reputation for spotting trends a=
nd making gutsy calls.    Now that evidence is building that the communicat=
ions industry is bouncing along the bottom, what's next?    Though startups=
 and public companies have been hit hard, optical technology is still layin=
g the foundation for the next wave of growth. In short, it's opportunity ti=
me; and  some of the bigger players are stepping up their involvement in op=
tical technology.    Consider that:    [IMAGE]   [IMAGE][IMAGE]Intel Corp. =
has purchased a portfolio of optical and next-generation communications chi=
p startups - including Cognet, LightLogic, nSerial, and Templex - for a tot=
al of about a half billion dollars. It has also invested in a portfolio of =
more than 30 startups. Much of this activity has taken place over the last =
year, fitting with Intel's reputation for investing during a downturn.   [I=
MAGE]   [IMAGE][IMAGE]Spending among a handful of the top telecom carriers,=
 though in decline over the last two years, still amounts to well over $50 =
billion and is expected to become increasingly focused on efficient next-ge=
neration technologies that lower costs.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE][IMAGE]Leading t=
echnologists frequently refer to optical networking technology as in the "v=
acuum tube" stage of its development life cycle.   [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE] =
How has the Optical Oracle covered these trends? Our reports provide a deta=
iled, opinionated analysis of the product and financial positioning of comp=
anies attacking the various markets.     Optical Oracle also continues to d=
eliver, in electronic form, news alerts about developing Light Reading stor=
ies, ahead of publication on the free Light Reading Website (www.lightreadi=
ng.com ).  For example, in November, Optical Oracle alerted readers, in adv=
ance of the news, to major layoffs at Nortel, management shifts at Cisco, a=
nd the acquisition of Pacific Broadband by Juniper Networks. Subscribers to=
 our service receive these alerts in addition to the monthly electronic new=
sletter.    The current Optical Oracle reports on the networking "Big Shots=
," including a competitive analysis of the leading public telecom equipment=
 market players: Alcatel (NYSE: ALA), Cisco (Nasdaq: CSCO), Lucent (NYSE: L=
U), Nortel (NYSE: NT), and Tellabs (Nasdaq: TLAB).     [IMAGE]   [IMAGE][IM=
