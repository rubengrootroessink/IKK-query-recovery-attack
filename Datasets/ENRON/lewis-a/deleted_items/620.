FEATURED SELECTION: 
EQUITY MARKET TRENDS by AIC Investment Advisors, Inc. 
(May 21, 2001) With industrial production retrenching, capital spending  
dropping rapidly and layoffs by major corporations accelerating, the Fed went  
to the pump once again and opened the spigot wider in the hopes of reflating  
the economy as well as the stock market. Equity markets initially responded  
in a lackadaisical manner (indicating that the decrease was factored into the  
market) before surging higher the following day on higher volume...

PARTIAL OUTLINE OF FEATURED ARTICLES IN CURRENT ISSUE OF CONSENSUS FUTURES  
AND FINANCIAL WEEKLY:  
THE WALL STREET DIGEST by Donald H. Rowe 
(June 2001) The NASDAQ is up 35% since the April 4th bottom. The  
advance/decline line has been moving up relentlessly ever since the market  
bottomed. The stock market has never failed to move up aggressively after a  
third interest rate cut by the Fed. We have had four rate cuts and number  
five is already factored into the market. Analysts say a sixth rate cut on  
June 27th is possible... 
DB'S NEW U.S. MONETARY & CREDIT CONDITIONS AND THE DOLLAR by Deutsche Bank AG  
Foreign Exchange Research Department 
(May 25, 2001) The yen gained substantial ground on both the Euro and the  
dollar this past week despite widespread evidence of deteriorating Japanese  
economic data. Evidence of weakening fundamentals can be found on several  
fronts. For example, Japan's trade surplus narrowed a whopping 41.6% in  
April, the seventh straight month of double-digit declines in the trade  
surplus... 
U.S. SILVER SUMMARY--2000 by Silver Users Association 
(May 23, 2001) For the second consecutive year, the difference between the  
high and low prices for silver (H&H NY) was less than one dollar per ounce.  
The high for the year was set in February at $5.53 per ounce. The average  
monthly price also reached its highest level for the year at $5.30 in that  
month. For the remainder of the year there was a steady downward trend  
resulting in an average of $5.00 for the year, closing the Millennium on  
December 29 at $4.595 per ounce, the lowest daily price in 2000... 
FARMERS CAUGHT IN ENERGY SQUEEZE by Richard A. Brock & Associates, Inc. 
(May 18, 2001) The long-term energy package unveiled this week by the Bush  
administration contained numerous strategies to address what the White House  
calls an "energy shortage." The report from an energy task force says, "A  
fundamental imbalance between supply and demand defines our nation's energy  
crisis. This imbalance, if allowed to continue, will inevitably undermine our  
economy, our standard of living and our national security"... 
MONEY MATTERS by Peter Dag & Associates, Inc. 
(May 14, 2001) Money matters. There is a strong effort on the part of many  
economists to downplay the importance of monetary aggregates. Even the Fed  
has convinced Congress not to hold them responsible for targeting monetary  
aggregates. The reason? It is difficult to define money because of the  
globalization (this is a word used to confuse people when one does not know  
what is going on) of the financial markets and continued financial  
innovation... 
SOYBEAN COMPLEX by Salomon Smith Barney 
(May 2001) We estimate the U.S. planted soybean area in 2001 at 77.0 million  
acres, about 350,000 acres above the March indications. Based on normal  
abandonment, we forecast the 2001 soybean harvested area to be 75.8 million  
acres, 3.1 million higher than last year. Predicated on our yield estimate of  
38.8 bushels per acre, we would then project the U.S. 2001 soybean crop at  
2.94 billion bushels, 170 million bushels higher than last year and slightly  
below the USDA's February estimate of 2.945 billion bushels...
