1.  Introduction

Financial headlines will again be dominated by earnings news,
though the impact of quarterly results is likely to be
lessened.  Instead, traders may start to shift their
attention towards the forthcoming FOMC meeting and the
possibility of another rate cut.  Halloween-related sales at
retailers may also draw attention as a proxy for how strong
or weak the holiday shopping season will be.  Lastly, news
items related to the war against terrorism will be a major
wildcard.

3.	Economic Releases

The primary focus of next week's economic releases will be
whether or not inflation is continuing to be kept in check.
Economists and traders are expecting further rationale to
justify another rate cut from the FOMC, which will be
meeting in three weeks.  Providing insight will be the
employment cost index, which measures salary and benefit
costs, and home sales.  Numbers from both reports that match
expectations are likely to be as viewed as an indication
that the threat of inflation continues to pale in comparison
to threat of a decelerating economy.

Economic releases scheduled for next week are listed in the
table below.

Report                          Estimate     DATE
------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Leading Indicators         (0.5%)       10/22/01
Employment Cost Index           0.9%         10/25/01
Durable Goods Orders            (1.0%)       10/25/01
Existing Home Sales             5.15M        10/25/01
New Home Sales                  850K         10/26/01
U. of Mich. Consumer Confidence 82.7         10/26/01

4.	Stock Splits

The number of stock splits remains limited, primarily because
of the downturn in equity prices.  Stocks that will begin
trading on ex-dividend basis are listed in the table below.

Company			 Ticker   Split   Ex-Dividend Date
-----------------------------------------------------------
Global Acquisition       GACI     20-1    10/15/01

5.	Initial Public Offerings

The Principal Financial Group {proposed ticker "PFG"} is
expected to price next, the first of two large insurance
companies to expected to complete their public offerings this
quarter.  Both PFG and Prudential {proposed ticker "PRU"} had
been expected to both be public by now, but instead were
forced to push back their IPOs following the September 11
attacks.

Though known primarily as an insurance company, PFG is the
largest provider of services to 401(k) plans in the United
States.  The company generated $8.9 billion in revenues last
year, but reported a one percent decline in revenues for the
first six months of 2001.  Opening day volatility should be
light given the mammoth size of the deal - 100 million shares
offered at a proposed price range of $17-$20 per share.

Company                    Ticker     Shares     Price Range
------------------------------------------------------------
Cross Country              CCRN       7.8M       $15 - $17
Principal Financial Group  PFG        100.0M     $17 - $20
