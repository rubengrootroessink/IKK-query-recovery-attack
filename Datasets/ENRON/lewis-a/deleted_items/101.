Investors Wary of Earnings Restatements

The collapse of Enron and worries about Tyco Internationals accounting for =
its numerous acquisitions have made investors wary. During the 1990s, Wall =
Street would overlook complex or difficult to understand financial statemen=
ts, but no longer. Restating earnings can lead a stock sell-off. Anadarkos =
shares dipped over 7% yesterday after it restated 3rd quarter earnings to i=
nclude $1.7 billion in charges to reflect lower values for its oil and natu=
ral gas assets. Its shares eventually recovered and closed the day down abo=
ut 1%. Investors are also scrutinizing companies with high debt levels beca=
use they are too dependent on borrowing to support growth. Cendant, which o=
wns Avis, has a number off-balance-sheet entities and over $6 billion in de=
bt. It also has been subject to an investigation of its accounting practice=
s in the past. Cendant has seen its shares fall by over 18% in less than a =
month. And Tyco shares fell about 18% to $27.50 in the morning, before rall=
ying to tr! ade up 4.5% at $35.15 at sessions close.

FERCs Brownell Wants Enron Investigated on California Power

FERC commissioner Nora Brownell says that the commission should investigate=
 whether Enron manipulated wholesale electricity prices in California. Enro=
n has been accused by Western states politicians of raising prices in long-=
term supply contracts following California's power crisis. Brownell made he=
r comments after Chairman Pat Wood testified before the Senate Energy Commi=
ttee about Enron's impact on the nations energy markets. The electricity cr=
isis was linked to California's failed deregulation scheme that did not enc=
ourage new plant construction and barred the state's utilities from passing=
 through higher wholesale prices to consumers. Still pending before a FERC =
administrative law judge is California's demand for $9 billion in alleged o=
vercharges by wholesale suppliers, including Enron. That case is likely to =
be determined this spring. However, Brownell was very noncommittal on what =
action FERC should take if any market manipulation was found to have occurr=
ed. So far! , there is no price data to show Enron did anything wrong, she =
said. The FERC has not officially opened an investigation yet but is expect=
ing a formal request from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of Californi=
a and Maria Cantwell of Washington.=20

Williams Seeks to Avoid Credit Downgrade

Executives from Williams will meet with credit rating agencies today in a b=
id to retain an investment grade debt rating. Shares of Williams have falle=
n  25% since it postponed its 4th quarter report on Tuesday. The delay was =
caused by a review of up to $2.4 billion in costs from Williams Communicati=
on Group, which was spun off in April. In its preliminary 2001 report, Will=
iams per share profit rose to $2.35 from $2.33 in 2000. Williams expects to=
 earn $2.65 to $2.75 per share in 2002. With the downfall of Enron, energy =
traders have been subjected to increased scrutiny by credit rating agencies=
. Calpine, Dynegy, and Mirant all saw their debt downgraded last month. Wil=
liams says it expects its credit rating to be upheld and that it has proper=
ly accounted for the communication group spin-off. If Williams debt falls b=
elow investment grade, almost $1.4 billion in debt of Williams Communicatio=
ns Group could be accelerated. It could also owe $750 million for fiber opt=
ic network! leases and $250 million for other expenses related to the commu=
nications unit. A class-action lawsuit has been filed against Williams and =
Williams Communications, claiming the companies mislead investors on the sp=
in-off. Moody's rates Williams long-term credit as Baa2 and S?rates it BBB+=

Anadarko Admits Accounting Mistake

Anadarko Petroleum has admitted that it also has an accounting problem. Its=
 accountants evidently used the wrong figures to calculate the worth of som=
e of the its properties. Anadarko will have to restate its 3rd quarter resu=
lts by writing off more than $1 billion after tax. Its stock, however, fell=
 less than 2% yesterday, the day after the accounting error was disclosed. =
After Enron, any amount of trouble with a company's books can send its stoc=
k tumbling. Shares of Tyco International lost nearly 20% yesterday after ir=
regularities and accounting problems arose. PNC Financial Services Group an=
d Williams have also been hard hit by concerns about their accounting this =
week. So Anadarkos stock may yet pay the price. Anadarko claims to be embar=
rassed by the mistake, but there has been no good explanation of why it hap=
pened. The problem centers on properties acquired when it bought UPR in Jul=
y 2000. Because prices have recently dropped, the company had to write-down=
 the valu! e of properties on its books. But in determining the write-down =
of the UPR properties, it somehow used the wrong tax basis.=20

Democrats Claim Deregulation Bill Has Loopholes

Deregulation of the nation's $200 billion power industry may have hit a sna=
g after a couple Democratic senators claimed it could contain regulatory lo=
opholes. The Democrats say that the provision would allow any affiliate of =
a utility holding company that held investment securities of companies with=
 an indirect interest in the electric or natural gas utility business to av=
oid registering with the SEC. In a letter to the SEC the senators argued th=
at such an unregistered company would not be subject to the same regulation=
s as other investment companies. They allege that it creates potentially da=
ngerous loopholes in the system of investor protection that has enabled the=
 mutual fund industry to grow successfully over the last 60 years. A House =
energy subcommittee is expected to hold a bill writing session next month t=
o formulate a federal power deregulation plan. The SEC was also asked to re=
think its support for repeal of the 1930s Public Utility Holding Act. The a=
ct was cre! ated to protect consumers from some utilities which issued stoc=
ks and bonds based on shaky assets, evaded state regulations, and quickly e=
xpanded their holdings through questionable financial deals. House Republic=
ans contend the law is outdated and inhibits the creation of bigger, more e=
fficient power markets. Before Enrons collapse, some Democrats also support=
ed repealing the law. The power industry also has lobbied for years for the=
 law to be struck down. The Senators claim that Enron followed in the foots=
teps of utility holding companies in the Depression years by creating a hig=
hly complex corporate structure for the apparent purpose of obscuring signi=
ficant information from investors and engaging in self-dealing transactions=
 with affiliated entities. In 1995, a SEC report contended that the public =
utilities holding act could be eliminated because utilities must disclose o=
ther detailed financial information to the agency.=20
