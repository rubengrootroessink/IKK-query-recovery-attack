iaNett/Data Fortress Corporate Update

Vancouver, British Columbia,January 28, 2002

Further to the Company's Press Release of December 19th, 2001, the Company
is pleased to announce they have scheduled their annual general meeting for
March 28, 2002 to seek shareholder approval on iaNett's proposed reverse
merger with the Data Fortress Group.

Data Fortress Technologies is a collocation and managed server-hosting
company that provides customers with a secure environment and access to
fiber optic network bandwidth.

Data Fortress's managed services products have been well accepted into the
marketplace. During the course of the last 30 business days Data Fortress
has signed on 5 new managed services clients with a total contract value in
excess of $400,000. Managed services consist of internal managed servers
and outsourced Information Technology (IT).

Internal Managed Services contains dedicated servers that are rented to the
customer and equipped with extended support hosted in their tier one data
center.   The extended support comes in the form of professional set up and
configuration of the hardware along with professional installation of
server level software such as web, email, ftp and database software. This
solution is particularly valuable for a company when its focus is on sales
and marketing of its products and the organization does not have the
capacity labour wise or physically to build and maintain a dedicated server
solution. By implementing an outsourced solution a company can maintain
their focus on sales and marketing of their existing products or if in
development bring their product to market faster and achieve a greater
return on investment (ROI).

With Outsourced IT Services capabilities Data Fortress can take over a
building and managing their internal networks by providing companies with
computers, bandwidth, networking gear and IT expertise, as well as fire
walling, data backup, and equipment upgrades all for one monthly fee.
Outsource IT allows companies to extend their IT without the capital cost
associated with it particularly in labour.

Outsourced IT customers in the downtown core of Vancouver can take
advantage of Data Fortress's high-speed fiber loop. Data Fortress through
Terra Span has installed its own redundant 3.2-kilometer fiber optic cable
ring, connecting their data center to the Internet backbone. The fiber loop
can be expanded through a local area network (LAN) extension. A LAN
extension can connect multiple buildings near the fiber ring creating a
secure, cohesive, and continuous, private network. This removes the
geographic boundaries for Data Fortress making it possible to operate from
multiple locations with no loss of performance or duplication of resources.
By implementing an outsourced IT solution from Data-Fortress a company can
maintain their focus on sales and marketing of their existing products and
achieve a greater ROI through better labor management.
