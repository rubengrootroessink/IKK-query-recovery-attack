Dear Investor:

We at the Law Firm of Schulman, O'Connell, and Wood, one of the most successful plaintiff class action law firms have, together with our affiliates, won billions of dollars in settlements and judgments from companies for fraudulent and misleading statements made by them to shareholders and/or investors.  We have recently brought an action against Corning for allegedly failing to disclose material information as it relates to their November 2nd, 2000 secondary offering. If you have purchased shares in the secondary offering or thereafter, please respond to the link below.

We are also bringing an action against Prize Energy, who is in the process of being acquired in a friendly transaction, which we, as well as other independent analysts, feel does not represent true value to Prize shareholders, and we believe that, should the company be shopped around, a much better deal will result for shareholders/investors.  If you currently hold any shares in Prize Energy, please respond to the link below so that your rights will be protected.

Additionally, another service we offer is that, once you are on our list, we will inform you of any shareholder litigation that we are aware of and forward you the necessary forms for you to fill out and sign, so you may participate and receive monies due you.
