quityAlert.com.     AMCC's 10 Gbps Network Processor to Complete Industry's=
 First Scalable, Software-Compatible 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps NPU Family=1DFourt=
h-Generation nP7510 Network Processor Joins AMCC's nPX5700 and nPX5800 to C=
omplete 10 Gbps Network Processor, Traffic Manager, and Switch Fabric Platf=
orm   SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 22, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circu=
its Corp.'s Switching and Network Processing Group (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) tod=
ay announced the nP7510 10 Gbps Network Processor, which is expected to com=
plete the industry's first software-compatible network processor (NPU) fami=
ly that scales from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps, from Fast Ethernet and OC-3 to 10 =
Gbps Ethernet and OC-192 Packet over SONET (PoS) and ATM applications.   Th=
e nP7510 represents the fourth generation in the company's nP7000 family of=
 fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors, and with t=
he nPsoft(TM) Development Environment, customers can easily preserve their =
investments in software from previous generations. The nP7510 complements A=
MCC's previously announced 10 Gbps traffic managers, framers, PHYs, and swi=
tch fabrics to form the industry's first complete integrated solutions for =
10 Gbps rate metropolitan area (MAN) edge, access, core router, and other a=
pplications. Designed with the company's core, patented Network-optimized I=
nstruction Set Computing (NISC) technology, the nP7510 achieves 10 Gbps rat=
es using just six of AMCC's own highly efficient nPcores(TM) and readily av=
ailable .18-micron CMOS technology, reserving smaller process geometries fo=
r future enhancements and multi-component integration. The maximum efficien=
cy of AMCC's core NPU technology allows for even greater potential future s=
caling to 40 Gbps OC-768 rates.   "AMCC is a market and technology leader i=
n the network processor industry," said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst o=
f The Linley Group. "The nP7510 gives the company a significant lead over i=
ts major competitors in delivering a 10 Gbps product. In addition, AMCC's c=
ombination of compatible 10 Gbps network processor, traffic manager, framer=
, PHY, and switch fabric components lets designers reduce time-to-market an=
d risk."   The nP7510 represents the fourth-generation of AMCC's nP7000 fam=
ily of fully software-programmable, policy-enabled network processors and i=
s capable of wire-speed processing at 10 Gbps rates. The network processor =
offers enhanced debugging capabilities and minimized intrusiveness over pre=
vious generations with its On-Chip Debug Engine, allowing programmers incre=
ased visibility and flexibility when debugging code. The nP7510 features a =
new optimized memory interface for the six patented, highly efficient nPcor=
es(TM), enabling new savings in internal memory space. The device also supp=
orts a greater number of simultaneous tasks, or threads, than prior network=
 processor generations. The nP7510 is complemented by AMCC's nPsoft(TM) Dev=
elopment Environment, including C/C++ compiler, assembler, performance prof=
iling utilities, graphical symbolic debugger, the nPsoft Services framework=
 and API, and the core nPkernel layer that ensures developers can easily pr=
eserve software investments from prior generations. Ready-to-use switching,=
 IP routing, MPLS, and ATM application libraries from AMCC and its software=
 partners provide even greater options for fully integrated turnkey solutio=
ns.   "Our field-proven, now fourth generation core technology not only let=
s us produce a wire-speed OC-192 NPU, but enables a complete scalable famil=
y, from OC-3 to potential future OC-768 line rates, without a major archite=
ctural overhaul," said Andy Gottlieb, vice president of marketing for AMCC'=
s Switching and Network Processing Group. "AMCC's scalable core technology =
and complementary software architecture make possible new highly scalable c=
omplete network equipment systems products with a wide range of interface a=
nd uplink speeds, and our existing customers can leverage their prior softw=
are investments to further reduce both risk and time-to-market."   While th=
e nP7510 can be used in a variety of configurations, including easy combina=
tion with other vendors or customers' own silicon, the nP7510 further demon=
strates AMCC's leadership in providing complete high-bandwidth silicon solu=
tions for intelligent optical networks by combining seamlessly with AMCC's =
complete family of 10 Gbps solutions. These include Khatanga, AMCC's recent=
ly announced OC-192 framer, the nPX5700 feature-rich traffic management chi=
pset, and AMCC's nPX5800 and nPX8000 families of multi-technology IP/ATM sw=
itch fabric solutions that scale from 20 Gbps to terabit ranges.   Pricing =
and Availability  The nP7510 is packaged in a 1428-pin Flip Chip BGA and is=
 expected to begin sampling in January. It is priced at $700.00 in volume q=
uantities of 10K.   About AMCC  AMCC designs, develops, manufactures, and m=
arkets high-performance, high-bandwidth silicon solutions empowering intell=
igent optical networks. AMCC utilizes a combination of high-frequency analo=
g, mixed-signal and digital design expertise coupled with system-level know=
ledge and multiple silicon process technologies to offer integrated circuit=
 products that enable the transport of voice and data over fiber optic netw=
orks. The company's system solution portfolio includes switch fabric, traff=
ic management, network processor, framer/mapper, PHY and PMD devices that a=
ddress the high-performance needs of the evolving intelligent optical netwo=
rk. AMCC's corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facilities are loca=
ted in San Diego. Sales and engineering offices are located throughout the =
world.   Forward Looking Statements  The statements contained in this press=
