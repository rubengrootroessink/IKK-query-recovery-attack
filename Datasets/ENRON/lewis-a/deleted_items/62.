<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

With Gold and Silver shining, commodity futures finished
the week on a high note.  Profittaking snapped two winning
stock market sessions, while Treasuries rose and the
Dollar declined on signs the economic economic recovery
will be slow going.  Meanwhile, sparks flew in the Energy
markets as a huge oil facility fire in Kuwait touched off
sharp advances that pushed Crude Oil to new highs for the
week.  Hogs and Bellies advanced, Cotton sizzled to its
best levels in two weeks, and Coffee staged a late rebound
from new lows.  Elsewhere, Cocoa ended quietly higher and
the Grains & Oilseeds complex was dull and boring, with
no fresh news to stir the markets into action.

Dear Andrew:

Now you can learn the most powerful, valuable and profitable
trading method EVER!

. . . Now Revealed In NEW Trading Course
For Just A Small, No-Risk Investment

World Famous "Turtle" Commodity Trading Method
. . . Now Available To You

On Video And In Clear Trading Lessons

. . . At A VERY Affordable Low, Low Price!!

Fifteen years ago, one futures trader stunned the entire trading
world as he methodically turned $400 into over $200,000,000
trading futures. In 1983, he personally taught his trading
strategies and systems to 14 people he nicknamed "The Turtles."

In the next five years, the Turtles earned some $35,000,000 as
their percent of profits from the $175 million profit they made
for their teacher (who bankrolled their trading)!

Yes, those zeroes are correct.

As a group, the "Turtles" have been trading now for over 14 years
and currently manage $2,000,000,000 (2 BILLION dollars) given to
them from people and institutions all over the world. Estimated
profits for the 16 months ending this past April are over
$300,000,000 (that's 300 million dollars actual, documented
profits!)

Even now - 14 years later - five of the world's top 10 futures
money managers are Turtle traders!
