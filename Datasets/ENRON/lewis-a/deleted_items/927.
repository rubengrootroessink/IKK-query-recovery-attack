[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you took apart his antique watch just to see how it worked?   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you gave away his 8-track player to Goodwill?    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you broke his favorite whatchamacallit playing James Bond?   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you used his briefcase to store your ant farm?   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you substituted a peanut butter sandwich for a floppy disk?   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]you fixed his new stereo with duct tape and a hammer?
