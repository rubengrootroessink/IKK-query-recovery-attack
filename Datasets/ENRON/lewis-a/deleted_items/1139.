re License Agreement; QUALCOMM Ventures Makes Multi-Million Dollar Investme=
nt in Airvana   SAN DIEGO, Oct 22, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorpo=
rated (Nasdaq: QCOM), pioneer and world leader of Code Division Multiple Ac=
cess (CDMA) digital wireless technology, and Airvana Inc., a provider of th=
ird-generation (3G) wireless network infrastructure for the mobile Internet=
, today announced they have signed a multi-million dollar CDMA2000 1X Evolu=
tion Data Optimized (1xEV-DO) infrastructure license agreement. Under the t=
erms of the royalty-bearing license agreement, QUALCOMM has granted Airvana=
 a license under certain QUALCOMM CDMA patents to develop, manufacture and =
sell 3G CDMA2000 1xEV-DO infrastructure equipment. Airvana has also signed =
a design transfer agreement for the development and design of CDMA2000 1xEV=
-DO infrastructure modem card equipment, which will enable high-speed wirel=
ess Internet access.   As part of QUALCOMM's ongoing strategic initiatives,=
 QUALCOMM Ventures has made an equity investment in Airvana to help drive t=
he rapid adoption of the wireless Internet based on 3G CDMA.   "We are very=
 pleased to license Airvana for the development of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO advance=
d commercial network equipment," said Marvin Blecker, senior vice president=
 of technology transfer for QUALCOMM. "The demand for the wireless Internet=
 is rapidly growing and it is important for companies to begin providing in=
frastructure to enable next-generation voice and data mobile services."   C=
DMA2000 1xEV-DO enables "always on" data to be sent over PCS and cellular w=
ireless networks at speeds comparable to DSL or cable modems, at a lower co=
st per byte than any other 3G technology in development today. CDMA2000 1xE=
V-DO provides peak data rates up to 2.4 Megabits per second (Mbps), fast en=
ough to support demanding applications such as streaming video and large fi=
le downloads.   "The broadband speed of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, combined with our=
 innovative all-IP architecture unleashes the economics of wireless data," =
said Randy Battat, president and CEO of Airvana. "Airvana's CDMA2000 1xEV-D=
O network is fast enough to support web-based phones, personal digital assi=
stants (PDAs) and laptop PCs. Our all-IP architecture allows for more rapid=
 deployment, lower operational costs, and new services and revenue streams,=
 which are not possible to achieve with conventional, voice-centric designs=
