Catch of the Day: Wake me when it's over

I like Microsoft Office. That's fortunate, as I am also a
slave to it. I write on Word, I plan on Excel, and I mumble
speeches with PowerPoint as my crutch. So last week I went
to the San Francisco sitting of the Office XP launch, not
just so I could write about it, but because I have a
workingman's interest in the tools. And I have never been so
bored in my life.

I wasn't alone. A guy behind me actually snored. (I myself
briefly napped, but quietly.) It's just tough to get fired
up about Office's changes. Except that the dancing paper
clip is gone. People were excited about that.

The biggest improvements in Office are in the area of
collaboration. Document-reviewing features are improved, and
there's integration with an online groupware service,
SharePoint. Also, Office now protects data against its --
and Windows' -- crashes. I pity the marketing person who had
to pitch that feature.

It's a good update, but it'll be a yawner to companies that
don't use the sharing features. This is not just a snipe; it
represents a real problem for Microsoft, which gets a huge
chunk of its revenue from Office upgrades.
