lubs are not open to the public but controlled by founders of the clubs who=
 are also Yahoo! users. Membership requires that child pornography be poste=

lowing child pornography clubs to be formed on its site. The Yahoo! "Young =
Girl and Boy" club was founded September 14, 2001 and has 600 members. "At =
