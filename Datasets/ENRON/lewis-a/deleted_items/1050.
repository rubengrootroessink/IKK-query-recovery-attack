___| XM SATELLITE RADIO IS HERE ______________

Imagine getting CD-quality sound from your radio tuner, with no
static or interference, and no signal fading.  Tune in to any
one of 100 channels (many of them commercial-free), from
anywhere in the continental U.S., and get crystal-clear music,
entertainment, and news, twenty-four hours a day.  This is XM
satellite radio!

With service to the entire southern half of the U.S. already in
place, XM has scheduled its nationwide rollout for November
15th.  Crutchfield is ready with the information and products
you'll need to add the excitement of XM Satellite Radio to any
car audio system, and even your home!

What do you get when you sign up?
For starters, 69 music channels that cover just about every
music genre on the planet.  They're programmed by innovative DJs
drawing on an all-digital library of more than one million
pieces of music.  You'll hear artists and music that you just
won't find over the traditional airwaves.  You'll also get 31
channels of news and information, talk, comedy and kids'
programming.  In all, that's 100 channels of fresh, new
programming, for just $9.99 a month.

What about the gear?
Along with your XM Radio subscription, you'll need an XM tuner
and XM-compatible antenna.  Here are a few suggestions to get
you up and running.

* Connect Pioneer's GEX-P900XM tuner to any current Pioneer CD
receiver with XM tuner controls.  The tuner is also compatible
with many earlier Pioneer head units.

* If it's time to upgrade your stereo, Pioneer offers a
convenient package that pairs the XM tuner with the
full-featured DEH-P3370XM in-dash CD receiver.

* Add XM capability to any FM radio with the FM-modulated add-on
GEX-FM903XM tuner package.

Terk offers the XM-compatible roof- and window-mount antennas
you'll need to complete these Pioneer systems.

Sony offers a pair of XM tuner packages to upgrade virtually any
factory or aftermarket receiver:

*The FM-modulated DRN-XM01R bundle is compatible with any FM
stereo.

*The DRN-XM01C package lets you connect the XM tuner to any
cassette receiver, or to any receiver that features an auxiliary
input.	Both packages include an antenna, wireless remote, and
an easily-mounted docking station for the tuner.

Using Sony's optional XM home and car kits, you can transfer
your Sony plug-and-play tuner to enjoy XM Radio at home or in
another vehicle.  These kits include everything you'll
need--docking station, antenna, and cables--for connection to
your home stereo system or to a second in-dash receiver.  Since
you're using the same XM tuner in multiple locations, you pay
for only one subscription!

(These Sony XM packages and kits have been so popular that
they're currently out of stock. If you order now, we'll place
you on the list to receive one as soon as it arrives. You'll
find this is the best way to get yours as soon as possible. Of
course, we won't bill your credit card until your order ships
out to you.)

___| HOME RECEIVERS ARE READY TO TAKE CHARGE _____________

When a new technology like XM Satellite Radio comes along, many
of us are excited about adding this capability to our existing
systems.  And when the ability to expand and upgrade is a
priority, building a home entertainment system with separate
components rather than an all-in-one set-up makes a lot of
sense.	You also get more exacting control over the features
that matter most to you.  And whether your dominant interest is
movies or music, the right receiver remains the cornerstone of a
great component system.

Receivers function as the brains and brawn of your system,
providing clean, dynamic power to your speakers, surround sound
processing (in home theater receivers), and the connections and
switching for your other components.  With the right inputs and
outputs, you pick up the flexibility to add the components you
want from a wealth of audio and video sources, including the
latest technologies like XM Radio!

Our stereo and Dolby Digital receivers offer a broad range of
features, power ratings, and prices to match an equally wide
range of user preferences, system needs and budgets.  Here are a
couple of great choices:

If you're looking for a top-of-the-line home theater receiver,
check out Denon's AVR-4802.  THX Ultra-certified, it delivers
superbly cinematic home theater performance with on-board
decoding for all your surround sound sources.  High-current
power reserves -- 125 full-bandwidth-rated watts x 7-ensure
maximum impact and clarity for music and movies.  A wide array
of analog and digital inputs/outputs accommodate your current
gear with plenty of room for expansion.  Other high-end features
include multi-zone output for enjoying 3 different sources in 3
different rooms, simultaneously.

Sony's STR-DE135 stereo receiver is the perfect solution for
music fans who don't need home theater.  It's also great as the
power source for an additional room with a multi-zone receiver
like the AVR-4802 above.  You get 100 watts x 2 for smooth,
low-distortion sound, plus 4 audio inputs for your music sources
-- all for just $149.95.

__| WHY SHOULD YOU SPEAK WITH A PRODUCT ADVISOR?  _____________

If you've been watching our website recently, you may have
noticed that we've been focusing on our Product Advisors more
closely than ever.  Why are we doing this?  A one-on-one
consultation with a Crutchfield Product Advisor may be the best
service available to anyone interested in car audio, home
theater, or the growing universe of music and video for your PC.

What's so special about our folks?  Over the past 28 years, our
team of over 100 Advisors has designed thousands of systems,
often from the ground up.  We start with your needs and your
questions, and we build from there.  When you call us, you'll
discover that a Crutchfield Product Advisor has a remarkable
capacity to listen.  We're interested in hearing about the
equipment you own now, what you like or dislike about it and
exactly what you hope to gain from the components you plan to
add.

Each Advisor has 8-12 weeks of classroom training and access to
the industry's most comprehensive product and installation
database.  That's another part of what helps them make the right
recommendations.

And time and time again, Crutchfield Product Advisors have saved
customers money by preventing them from unnecessary overbuying.
Our Advisors recommend products with features you'll need and
use -- and they steer you away from costly mistakes or gear
that's simply more than you want or need.

Today, each of us is flooded with more and more choices.  Not
only can new technologies be hard to understand, sometimes the
explanations themselves can be equally baffling.  You may start
your research with our catalog or website, but sooner or later,
it's nice to have someone who can simplify the process and help
you make a choice that makes sense.  Call us and see for yourself
how much easier we can make things and how quickly you can get
the enjoyment that our products are designed to provide.

Call a Crutchfield Product Advisor toll-free at 1-888-955-6000,
8 AM-Midnight, Eastern Time.  Or e-mail
Advisors@Crutchfield.com.
