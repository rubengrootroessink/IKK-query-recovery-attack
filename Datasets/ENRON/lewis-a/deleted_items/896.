eGoose Market Call for members... Click below link to view today's chart:

KG:  King Pharmaceuticals was on our short watch list today, as many bios
are reaching overbought levels (particularly KG).  KG closed with a
Japanese "hanging man," a short-term reversal signal after an extended
run.  As you can see, it has had two gaps recently, with a high likelihood
of at least the second one being filled.  Volume was climatic over the
past three days, and RSI, CCI, and OBV are overbought and rolling over.
With anticipate morning strength, we will look to sell into intra-day
resistance.  Consider SHORTING KG with a LIMIT of 55.49.  Suggested target
is 50.55.  Suggested stop is 55.70.
