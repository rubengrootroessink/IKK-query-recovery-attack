uityAlert.com.     Texas Instruments Unveils Industry's Highest Performance=
 Audio Volume Control IC for Professional Audio Systems   TUCSON, Ariz., Oc=
t 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Designed for a wide variety of profes=
sional recording and playback applications, Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN) (=
TI) introduced the industry's highest performance audio volume control IC (=
Integrated Circuit) from the company's Burr-Brown products division. Featur=
ing 120dB dynamic range, 0.0004 percent distortion (THD+N), -126dB intercha=
nnel crosstalk, and +/-15V analog power supplies, the PGA2310 improves syst=
em performance in professional audio applications such as digital mixing co=
nsoles, multi-track recorders, broadcast studio equipment, high-end A/V rec=
eivers, effects processors, musical instruments, and high-end car audio sys=
tems. See http://www.ti.com/sc/aap6908u .   "Building on Burr-Brown's audio=
 expertise and history of high-performance components, the new PGA2310 stan=
ds as the highest-performance audio volume control device on the market," s=
aid Mike Centorino, professional audio marketing manager at TI's Burr-Brown=
 division.   The PGA2310 is a high-performance digitally-controlled analog =
audio volume control which offers independent control over two audio channe=
ls via a serial control interface. Other features include a wide gain and a=
ttenuation range of +31.5dB to -95.5dB with 0.5dB steps, zero crossing dete=
ction, and a mute function. The PGA2310 operates from +/-15V analog power s=
upplies enabling the device to process large signals (input/output voltage =
range of 27Vp-p), thereby preserving the dynamic range available in the ove=
rall signal path.   Incorporating internal high-performance operational amp=
lifiers, the PGA2310 yields low noise and distortion while providing the ca=
pability to drive large loads (600-ohm) directly without buffering. A three=
-wire serial control interface allows for connection to a variety of host c=
ontrollers and also supports daisy chaining of multiple PGA2310 devices.   =
Available Today   The PGA2310 is available now in SOL-16 and DIP-16 package=
s. Suggested resale pricing starts at $6.95 in 1,000 piece quantities.   Te=
