Nineteen IP Phone Manufacturers Select TI DSP-Based Technologies To Speed
IP Phone Deployment=1DTI's Integrated Silicon and Software Powers 80% of th=
e IP
Phone Market

DALLAS, May 30, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Leveraging the processing
performance and low power of Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI=
)
technologies to rapidly deploy enterprise Internet Protocol (IP) telephone
solutions, 19 new customers have selected TI as their vendor. The integrati=
on of
TI's programmable digital signal processors (DSPs) and Telogy Software(TM)
products provides the required performance, ultra-low power efficiency and
flexibility to execute voice encoding and compression, while saving system =
costs
and reducing overall power consumption. (see: http://www.ti.com/sc/ipphone =
)

The new customers include ACT, ADTech, AltiGen Communications, BONA Technol=
ogy,
Cetacean Networks, Telefonica, Global Internet Telephone AG(GITel). TI now =
has
more than 50 enterprise IP phone customers including 3Com Corporation, Asco=
m,
CIDCO, Circa Communications/Polycom, Cisco Systems, congruency, Ericsson, N=
ortel
Networks and TelStrat.

"One of the reasons we chose TI's enterprise IP phone solution is because o=
f the
complete integration of TI's programmable DSP technology with TI's Telogy
Software products," said Richard De Soto, Chief Marketing Officer of AltiGe=
n
Communications Inc. "The software enables the delivery of better-
than-toll-quality voice and the complete solution delivers the programmabil=
ity
into new evolving standards. It is just what we were looking for as we made=
 our
investment in the underlying technology for our AltiServ IP PBX and IP phon=
es."

Enterprise IP phones are one of the most rapidly growing forms of Internet
telephony. In fact, Allied Business Intelligence research predicts that the=
 IP
phone market will reach 51.4 million 2005. And according to a recent study =
by
Phillips InfoTech, IP Local Area Network (LAN) telephony represents the nex=
t
generation of phone systems. For most enterprises the decision to implement=
 IP
LAN telephony is really a question of 'when' not a question of 'if.' "

The potential obstacles most often cited by decision-makers in both large a=
nd
small enterprises regarding the timeframe for deciding to implement IP LAN
telephony are: reliability, voice quality, price and scalability, according=
 to
the Phillips InfoTech study.

"With TI, Cetacean Networks has solved the problems surrounding the deploym=
ent
of new revenue generating, real-time applications and services to meet the
capacity and scalability of new telephony and real-time networks," said Ste=
ven
Rogers, President and CEO, Cetacean Networks.

Texas Instruments Incorporated is the world leader in digital signal proces=
sing
and analog technologies, the semiconductor engines of the Internet age. The
company's businesses also include materials and controls, and educational a=
nd
productivity solutions. TI is headquartered in Dallas, Texas and has
manufacturing or sales operations in more than 25 countries.

Texas Instruments is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol=
 TXN.
