greement Announced at PT/Wireless & Networks Comm Beijing 2001, Leading Kor=
ean Carrier is First in the World to Launch BREW Service   BEIJING, Oct 24,=
 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), pioneer and =
world leader of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital wireless techn=
ology, and KTFreeTel, a leading Korean wireless carrier, today announced at=
 the PT/Wireless & Networks Comm Beijing 2001 conference that the companies=
 have reached an agreement for the commercial launch of KTFreeTel's applica=
tions service based on QUALCOMM's Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless(T=
M) (BREW(TM)) platform. KTFreeTel expects to roll out its BREW-enabled magi=
c n multipack(TM) service to subscribers on their third-generation (3G) CDM=
A2000 1X network beginning November 1, 2001. KTFreeTel will be the first ca=
rrier in the world to launch BREW platform services and provide customers w=
ith the ability to download wireless applications over the air -- anytime, =
anywhere.   "KTFreeTel's commitment to QUALCOMM's BREW platform represents =
a bold advancement toward the future of useful wireless data services," sai=
d Peggy Johnson, president of QUALCOMM Internet Services, the division of Q=
UALCOMM responsible for the complete BREW solution. "KTFreeTel's customer f=
ocus, combined with QUALCOMM's technology leadership, takes full advantage =
of the improved capabilities of today's mobile devices to bring truly relev=
ant, useful solutions to market. For the first time, people will be able to=
 choose the applications and features they want, and the BREW platform's ab=
ility to download applications over the air is the breakthrough that enable=
s this."   The agreement was announced at a ceremony featuring Dr. Joo Youn=
g Song, senior vice president, KTFreeTel Multimedia Business Division and P=
eggy Johnson.   "This agreement with QUALCOMM further enhances KTFreeTel's =
technology leadership and market strategy," said Dr. Song. "We've created a=
 much-needed solution that will put the power to personalize cell phone ser=
vices, over the air, directly in the hands of consumers."   KTFreeTel condu=
cted a successful public user trial of the BREW-enabled magic n multipack s=
ervice with 5,000 users in September and October 2001. The BREW-enabled ser=
vice allows KTFreeTel subscribers to easily download and install a variety =
of applications in a matter of seconds. For KTFreeTel's customers, this mea=
ns that the same BREW-enabled handset hardware can provide very different c=
apabilities tailored to individual interests as subscribers download the ap=
plications they want from various categories, such as games and entertainme=
nt, business applications, messaging and navigation services. More than 160=
 applications are currently available from more than 20 companies, includin=
g Anicom, Gaeasoft, GeoTel and Lycos-Javagame.   KTFreeTel's BREW services =
will launch on two new CDMA2000 1X BREW-enabled handsets:   --  LG Electron=

nd dual LCD screen.     --  Samsung's SPH-X2500 phone has a color display, =
a clamshell         design and features Samsung's melody maker that uses a =
        16-chord progression.  Details of the business agreement between QU=
ALCOMM and KTFreeTel were not disclosed.   QUALCOMM's BREW platform is a th=
in, standardized execution environment that resides in handsets. Native BRE=
W applications are written in C/C++. While the BREW platform supports progr=
amming in other languages, such as Java, C/C++ is used as a primary languag=
e by significantly more developers worldwide than any other language, accor=
ding to International Data Corp. QUALCOMM's BREW initiative is the only app=
roach that offers developers, OEMs and carriers a complete, end-to-end solu=
tion for wireless applications development, device configuration, applicati=
on distribution, and billing and payment. The complete BREW solution includ=
es the BREW Software Development Kit(TM) (SDK) for developers, the BREW app=
lication platform and porting tools for device manufacturers, and the BREW =
Distribution System (BDS) that enables developers and their carrier custome=
rs to get applications to market and coordinates the billing and payment pr=
ocesses for them. Carriers' BREW services will enable consumers to customiz=
e their handsets by downloading applications over the air from a carrier's =
application download server.   QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is =
