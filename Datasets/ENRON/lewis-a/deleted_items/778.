   AMCC Delivers 10 GBPS Digital Wrapper Backplane Serializer/Deserializer =
For SONET/SDH Transport and Very Short Reach OC-192 Applications   SAN DIEG=
O, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Verrazano Offers Industry-Leading Jit=
ter Generation and Provides a 25 Percent Savings in System Bandwidth, Exten=
ding the Life of Existing   Backplane Designs  Applied Micro Circuits Corp.=
 (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) today announced the Verrazano (S2509), the industry's=
 first 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper serializer/deserializer (SERDES) supporting =
SONET/SDH transport and Very Short Reach (VSR) OC-192 and OC-48 transponder=
 applications utilizing four 2.488-2.67 Gbps links.   The Verrazano facilit=
ates the development of SONET/SDH compliant serial backplanes, saving syste=
m developers up to 25 percent of a system's total bandwidth that would othe=
rwise be lost with 8B/10B encoding schemes. Running 27-1 PRBS data on all c=
hannels, the device features an ultra-low transmit jitter generation of 36 =
picoseconds peak-to-peak (typical) and provides outstanding eye diagram cha=
racteristics with a 91 percent eye opening allowing for increased reach con=
nections at ultra low error rates. (See figure 1).   System developers bene=
fit from the Verrazano's SONET/SDH compliance and compatibility with AMCC's=
 industry-leading Mekong and Zambezi framing and switching devices. By inte=
rfacing with AMCC's Hudson Digital Wrapper device, the Verrazano provides t=
he only complete solution for a mid-plane based Digital Wrapper design. (Se=
e figure 2). Very Short Reach OC-192 applications utilize the Verrazano's c=
ompatibility with AMCC's S7022 and S7025 parallel fiber components. This ma=
kes the company's VSR solution ideal for system developers needing plug-n-p=
lay VSR links up to 300 meters for rack-to-rack and chassis-to-chassis inte=
rconnections as well as board-to-board optical backplane connectivity found=
 in large terabit systems.   "The Verrazano is the industry's first 10 Gbps=
 Digital Wrapper SERDES supporting the ITU G.709 standard while combining e=
xcellent jitter generation specifications with improved bandwidth efficienc=
y," said Jon Siann, director of marketing at AMCC. "By delivering complete =
and intelligent connectivity devices to our customers, AMCC demonstrates it=
s commitment to providing total system solutions for the next generation of=
 optical networks and the terabit connectivity market."   Manufactured in l=
ow cost CMOS technology, the device features a power consumption of 5.2 W t=
ypical and runs from 1.8 V and 2.5 V power supplies. The Verrazano supports=
 FEC encoded and non-FEC encoded Digital Wrapper frames and provides Optica=
l Channel Overhead insert and drop and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring for=
 improved signal integrity. Performance monitoring features including SONET=
/SDH B1 and Digital Wrapper BIP-8 monitoring, Out Of Frame (OOF), Lock Dete=
ct and FIFO Over/Underflow provide link integrity monitoring in conjunction=
 with signal integrity enhancement features, which include differential CML=
 high-speed I/O, on-chip terminations, programmable output swing, redundant=
 output drivers with individual squelch control and passive equalization; a=
ll of which extend the life of existing low-cost backplane designs.   TDM t=
ransport systems can upgrade existing backplanes from OC-12 rates to OC-48 =
rates across the backplane by utilizing the signal integrity and link monit=
oring. The device also supports OC-192c inverse muxing with full transparen=
cy allowing DWDM network operators to maintain proprietary in-band messagin=
g.   Pricing and Availability  The Verrazano (S2509) is currently sampling =
to development partners with volume production scheduled for Q3 2001. Packa=
ged in a 483-pin FCPBGA, the device is priced at $360 in volume quantities.=
