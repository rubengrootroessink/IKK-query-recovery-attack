Natural Gas Futures End Friday Flat

Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended another boring s=
ession flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per MMBtu. The April contract=
 gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but was soon b=
oosted by short-term cold and short-covering from speculators and locals pu=
shing as high as $2.165 per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to be above $2.1=
7 per MMBtu, and will still likely be there today. Estimated volume Friday =
was only about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those spreads. There just w=
as not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the market hovered mostly betw=
een $2.14  $2.15. With the market unable to breach $2.17, speculators were =
forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be breached today, the market could r=
ise to the next resistance level at $2.22, and then possibly as high as $2.=
48 before reality once again sinks in. However, if the cash market opens lo=
wer this morning, the market may not get a chance to test the resistance. W=
ith still ! more than 1 Tcf in excess storage over last year and a relative=

 Natural gas for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally fl=

Enron Power Trading Falls in 4th Quarter

Enrons 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower than the prev=
ious quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt for a third of the =
quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the period. Enron Power Market=
ing sold almost 221 million MW from October through December, down from abo=
ut 300 million MW sold during the 3rd quarter. Last week, the FERC began in=
vestigating allegations that Enron unfairly raised wholesale power prices d=
uring California's power crisis last year. After Enron took a $1.2 billion =
write-down in shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transacti=
ons, other energy firms limited their trading with Enron out of concern cre=
dit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of 2001, Enron had about 15% of th=
e nations wholesale power market and AEP was next in line with about an 8% =
share. The table below shows Enron's biggest customers, the total MW sold a=

Mirant Moving to Allay Investor Fears

In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to sell assets =
and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of Mirant have fallen by =
50% in the last 2 months, following the downfall of Enron and the downgrade=
 of about $4.9 billion of its debt to junk status by Moodys. Last week, Mir=
ant said that 4th quarter earnings had dropped by 55%, due to lower energy =
prices and a charge of $66 million from exposure to Enron. It also cut its =
capital budget by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in 2002 to $1.60 to=
 $1.70 per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to $2.00, because of=
 lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits of $0.30 per shar=
e, lower than last years $0.52 per share. Profit for the 4th quarter dipped=
 to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million, or $0.20 per share a=
 year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion from $7.96 billion. Mirant =
was spun off from Southern Company in September 2000 and the deal was compl=
eted last ! April, when Southern distributed 272 million shares, or 80% of =
Mirant for $9.44 billion. In efforts to distance itself from Enron, Mirant =
points out that assets, such as power plants, contributed 90% to its profit=
ability, unlike Enron, whose trading unit was responsible for 90% of its 20=
00 revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend $3 billion on tripling its 15=
,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will limit capital spending to the c=
ompletion of power plants that will produce 5,700 MW. Mirant will also cut =
about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag, which it wants to sell.

Midwest ISO Begins Selling Regional Transmission Service =20

The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has implemented its ta=
riff and will now provide regional transmission service for bulk power in t=
he Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission customers are now able to request tr=
ansmission service from Midwest ISO without going to individual transmissio=
n owners. The Midwest ISO, which serves 21 transmission owners in 15 states=
, is responsible for evaluating and coordinating requests for access to the=
 regional power grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The Midwest ISO says th=
at transmission customers in the Midwest will now benefit from standardized=
 rates, terms and conditions for service over its 86,000 miles of transmiss=
ion lines. Transmission customers are now able to request transmission serv=
ice from the MISO's OASIS website, giving them the ability to view transmis=
sion availability data at the same time and request transmission service in=
 the same manner. It also provides for streamlined electronic scheduling wh=
ich allows! customers to easily schedule approved transactions for service =
across multiple control areas in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers=
 will now have access to an independent, regional analysis of bulk power fl=
ows utilizing a standard methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill t=

Wisconsin Energy Power Plant Plan=20

Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity generators ov=
er the next nine years to meet growing energy demands. Forecasts indicate W=
isconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new units will generate by 20=
11. The projects include 2 natural gas fired generators and 3 coal burning =
units at existing power plants. Other power producers including Calpine and=
 Mirant have delayed new construction in the state because of lower electri=
city demand and prices. The first natural gas fired should be under constru=
ction by early next year to be in service before the summer of 2005. Wiscon=
sin Energy has created a subsidiary that would build and own the generators=
 and lease them back to the utility for up to 25 years. Calpine, Enron and =
PG?had opposed the proposal, saying it would delay deregulation in the stat=
e by more than a decade.=20
