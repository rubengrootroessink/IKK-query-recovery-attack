Catch of the Day: What planet are you from?

It was like another world. The party that VC firm Draper
Fisher Jurvetson was putting on was in the blimp hangar at
Moffett Field. There are few stranger buildings. And then
Tim Draper showed up. In a space suit.

But the portfolio companies for which DFJ threw the party
were, mostly, down to earth. There were only a few "viral"
concepts (like Hotmail, DFJ's most famous hit). The rest
were infrastructure, wireless, semiconductor, photonics, and
CRM companies.

And then there was Achex, which makes not an aspirin
substitute, but rather a system that lets consumers pay for
online purchases through a checking account, instead of with
a credit card. Personally, I use plastic for almost
everything, but outside of rich cities, a sizable portion of
the U.S. population doesn't buy this way.

Achex is targeting retailers that, at their physical
locations, do substantial cash and check transactions;
Kmart's BlueLight.com is a customer. Achex transaction fees
are also lower than credit card fees.

My first take on Achex was that online credit card
transactions work well enough, so why build a parallel debit
system? However, not everybody on this planet buys things
the way we do in the big city.
