<font size="2" color="#0922A0"><strong>The Company</strong></font><br>
During the past two decades, there has been an increasing realization that we must find innovative ways of enjoying a high quality of life yet minimize our impact on the environment. Nowhere is this need greater than in controlling the pests that can contaminate our indoor environments and endanger our health. Many control methods have been utilized that extract an unacceptable price for the benefits they offer.<br><br>
<strong>BBJ's Mission:</strong> <em>"To enhance public health and safety through the control of microbial contamination in indoor environments". </em>

<p align="justify"> <font face="verdana" size="2" color="#000000">
<font size="2" color="#0922A0"><strong>Patented Technology</strong></font><br>
BBJ Environmental Solutions, Inc. ("BBJ" or the "Company") has developed BBJ MicroBiocideTM, plus complementary products that represent a highly effective and revolutionary method of controlling the growth of bacterial and fungal contamination in air conditioning systems. By integrating scientific, engineering and industrial hygiene technologies, BBJ's has developed products that lead to more favorable indoor living and working conditions without posing a threat to humans, animals or the overall environment.<br>
<br>
The Company's environmentally friendly products employ patented technology specifically registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for safely and effectively controlling and inhibiting the growth of bacteria, fungi and other noxious and harmful organisms in HVAC Systems. These products, when incorporated into a preventative maintenance program, will reduce health risks by limiting biological contamination, resulting in improved indoor air quality (IAQ).<br>
<br>
<strong>BBJ takes a responsible position regarding heightened IAQ awareness and bio-terrorism.</strong> Can customers protect themselves from bio-terrorism by applying BBJ products to their HVAC system? If BBJ MicroBiocide and its other products are used as part of a well planned and consistently executed preventative maintenance program, risk can be reduced and may make a critical difference.  <a href="http://www.bbjenviro.com/news_releases_101801.asp" target="_blank"><font color="#0922A0">Click here to read more</font></a>.

<p align="justify"> <font face="verdana" size="2" color="#000000">
<font size="2" color="#0922A0"><strong>Addressing a Need</strong></font><br>
"Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home." (The Inside Story - A Guide to Indoor Air Quality published April 1995 by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency).

<br>
HVAC/R systems are the single largest user of energy in residential buildings, and studies show that considerable energy is wasted by HVAC/R systems that are not regularly cleaned and maintained. Equipment with dirty coils may use as much as 37% more energy than with clean coils. Furthermore, the average life of non-maintained HVAC/R equipment is 8 years whereas well-maintained equipment has a lifespan 20 years. Yet less that 5% of homeowners have service contractors for their HVAC systems.

<p align="justify"> <font face="verdana" size="2" color="#000000">
<font size="2" color="#0922A0"><strong>Expanding Market</strong></font><br>
There are more than 79 million U.S. households with centralized heating systems. Of these, approximately, 48 million have centralized air conditioning systems. According to the Air-Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) there are 40,000 to 45,000 HVAC contracting firms serving residential, commercial and industrial markets. The HVAC market for service, replacement and renovation is estimated at <strong>$46 to $48 billion dollars</strong>.

<p align="justify"> <font face="verdana" size="2" color="#000000">
