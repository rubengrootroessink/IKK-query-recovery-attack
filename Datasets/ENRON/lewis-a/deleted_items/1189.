uityAlert.com.     Bear Stearns Diminished Enthusiasm For Texas Instruments=
 Near Term - Analyst Comments     (RealTimeTraders.com) - Texas Instruments=
 reported better than expected results for third quarter with revenue of $1=
.85 billion down 9% sequentially, and EPS of ($0.03) vs. Bear Stearns' esti=
mate of ($0.06). However, Charles F. Boucher semiconductors analyst at Bear=
 Stearns feels TXN's near-term outlook is somewhat weaker than expected.  T=
he analyst highlights the fact that gross margins were slightly below the a=
nalyst's estimate at 25%, and operating expenses were also lower than the a=
nalyst's model. According to the analyst total sales are expected to declin=
e 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a normal seasonal decline, =
and chip sales are expected to decline by about 5% sequentially.  Boucher i=
s reducing his 2001 EPS estimate for the company from $0.10 to $0.09, and 2=
002 EPS from $0.08 to ($0.04), as well as 2003 EPS from $0.80 to $0.70.  De=
spite the analyst's disappointment Boucher made the following comment,  "Ou=
r disappointment with deeper near term losses is tempered by solidifying ev=
idence of a fundamental turn in semiconductor bookings? Given the weak fund=
amental outlook through Q102, we would be valuation sensitive and would not=
 be aggressive buyers unless the stock drops to $25 or below". Copyright(c)=
