1/15/2002 9:00:00 AM

LOS ANGELES, Jan 15, 2002 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- iNetEvents, Inc. (IEVT)
today announced that it has seen a strong resurgence in business among its
existing clientele since the decline in activity and bookings of corporate
events caused by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

iNetEvents is currently negotiating contracts with several previous customers,
including a major West Coast university. In addition, other important clients
including one of the country's largest banking institutions, the law enforcement
division of a leading technology company, and others have begun to rebook
previously cancelled events as well as book new events for 2002.

iNetEvents is also preparing to launch a series of new Online services that will
complement its existing service offerings and broaden its prospective customer
base.

Brandon Stauber, iNetEvents' CEO said, "While circumstances at the end of last
year were bad, we always knew that the overall corporate events market was
strong. We are now seeing this market return and we are ready to serve it with
our superior technology and service."
