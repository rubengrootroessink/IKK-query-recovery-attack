remove GDW as short from recommend list.

posted stop at 60 exceeded so close short -5 percent.  currently long GDW stock as the move above 60 took out significant resistance as represented by the reaction highs during the october period.  in addition the gap down in august was covered.  the skinny?  looks like GDW is all set to challenge resistance at 66.  sure its a blown short but being there lead to clarion call to be long now.  of course there is a possibility of a second whipsaw but going with it nonetheless.  and not to 'get even' but because the chart says it makes sense.

from the land of hoop-lah and just plain lah-lah,

kensey
