What is the true status of the economy?
Latest economic reports have been somewhat mixed and confusing.  
However, it is very clear the markets have very little tolerance to any 
negative news. Friday morning markets declined in the early going after 
the markets received news that the manufacturing sector may be heading 
towards a recession. But, later in the session good old General Motors 
rescued the markets with its latest sales data. GM said sales are ahead 
of expectations and the company expects to deliver earnings in line with 
previously stated expectations of $4.25 for the full year 2001 and $1.05 for 
the second quarter.
While the Dow component's sales data is favorable for the markets, 
RealTimeTraders analysts point out the sales for the month May is 
misleading because GM' truck sales were up 10%, but car sales were 
down 9%. Analysts believe the sharp jump in the truck sales could be 
due to problems surrounding Ford Motors. According to Ford Motor 
Company, sales for both truck and car sales have declined sharply.
On a positive note, analysts pointed out the fact employment data showed 
some improvement is a positive for the overall market. Which suggests the 
Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate the economy may be starting to take 
effect. As we stated in last Thursday's market analysis, we expect this 
quarter's earnings warnings and job cut announcements to be below last 
quarter. One other important fact that is worth noting is that the Federal 
Reserve seems to still indicate there will be more rates cuts ahead to 
further stimulate the economy.
Stocks to watch 
Shares of Cisco have been steadily declining in the past few sessions, and 
accelerated to the downside going into theclose Friday after the company's 
recent 10Q filing said it does not see any improvement in capital spending in 
the foreseeable future due to the continued economic slowdown. Cisco 
Systems finished Friday's session lower by 41 cents and closed at $18.85, 
which puts the week's net loss at 14.5%.
Sector Analysis
Semiconductor sector may stay rangebound
In the last two sessions we have seem the semiconductor index and 
semiconductor related stocks rebound after finding some support. However, 
we like to caution our readers that we do not expect this sector to move 
higher until we start to see some signs of sequential growth. Despite all the 
upgrades and positive comments from some of the leading brokerage firms, 
we continue to believe its is more prudent to focus on the company 
fundamentals than the so-called analysts ratings. Those who have been 
following the semiconductor sector may recall that most of the companies in 
this sector have continue to make negative comments about their near-term 
earnings outlook. Given that the semiconductor index has some support 
around the current level, it can be expected the sector may trade in a range 
until we receive further news from some of the bellwether stocks. Note that 
Intel is expected to give its mid quarter update during this week. We believe 
Intel's update would definitely impact the sector as a whole. We will continue 
to monitor the markets and alert our readers to any significant news that may 
impact the markets in our breaking news section.  
Economic Reports & Bond Markets
Friday the bond market almost gained another full point and closed near the 
highs of the day. Given that this week markets will have very little in terms of 
economic data and the fact the bonds gained almost 2 points in the past two 
session might lead to some range bound trading or a pull back. Monday the 
Challenger Layoff figures will be released at 10AM.
