h quarter ended Dec. 31, 2000. Pro forma net income for the fourth quarter =

ro forma net income of $80.2 million or $0.13 per share diluted for the fou=
rth quarter of 2000(1). On a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles=
) basis, the net loss for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2001, which inc=
ludes restructuring costs of $16.8 million, was $8.7 million or $0.02 loss =

are diluted. This compares to GAAP net income of $70.8 million or $0.12 per=
 share diluted for fiscal year 2000, which includes $22.8 million of acquis=
ition-related costs.   "While 2001 was a year of challenges and transition,=
 Yahoo! adapted and executed to end the year on a high note, with fourth qu=
arter revenues and income exceeding the business outlook we previously prov=
ided. As we reorganized the business and reduced costs throughout the year,=
 Yahoo! managed through the difficult environment. We continue to focus on =
long-term growth as we execute our strategy of building a diversified globa=
l business," said Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive officer, Yahoo!=
.   Leading Global Audience  During the fourth quarter, Yahoo!'s strong con=
sumer metrics underscored the company's leadership position among online co=
nsumers. Yahoo!'s global network continues to be the worldwide leader in te=
rms of unique users, reach, and total time spent (Nielsen//NetRatings, Nove=
mber 2001). Yahoo!'s global audience grew to 219 million unique users, comp=
ared to 180 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. In addition, a record 86=
 million active registered members logged onto Yahoo! during December 2001.=
 The company's traffic increased to a record 1.32 billion page views per da=
y on average during December 2001, compared to 900 million in December 2000=
.   Global Business Strategy  In November 2001, Yahoo! outlined the company=
's strategy and key priorities in order to achieve sustainable, profitable =
growth over the long term. As part of the overall strategy, Yahoo! realigne=
d the organization around six key businesses in order to become more focuse=
d and efficient: listings, access, commerce, communications, media and info=
rmation and enterprise solutions.   "We remain steadfast in our strategy to=
 build a diversified global business by focusing our efforts and leveraging=
 our core strengths to provide deeper, more valuable solutions for our cons=
umers and business partners. In the fourth quarter we executed on a number =
of initiatives to support our new business strategy and our goal is to main=
tain that momentum as we enter 2002," said Semel.   "Yahoo!'s organizationa=
l strategy for 2002 and beyond is to ensure that we are in the right busine=
sses, with the structure and people to achieve maximum potential from the o=
pportunities we see," said Jeff Mallett, president and chief operating offi=
cer, Yahoo!. "We have made significant progress on our goals during a parti=
cularly challenging economic period and we will continue to leverage the st=
rength of our six business areas in order to position ourselves for growth.=
"   Business Outlook  "We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter p=
erformance and we remain committed to operating in a financially discipline=
d manner as we manage through the ongoing challenging economic environment,=
" said Susan Decker, chief financial officer, Yahoo!. "To support our state=
d financial objective of maximizing long term free cash flow, we are focuse=
d in the near term on balancing short term profitability with the investmen=
t required to drive sustainable growth and, in the longer term, increasing =
revenue per user. We are extremely excited about the future, as we have cre=
ated a strong foundation that will serve as a platform to permit us to driv=
e profitable growth in the years ahead."   Based on information as of Janua=
ry 16, 2002, and excluding the effects of the pending acquisition of HotJob=
s and of any other potential acquisitions, the company expects revenues for=
 the first quarter 2002 to be between $160 and $180 million, and between $7=
50 and $800 million for the full year 2002.   On that same basis, in the fi=
rst quarter 2002, Yahoo! expects pro forma earnings before interest, deprec=
iation and amortization (EBITDA) to range from $5 to $15 million and pro fo=
rma earnings per share (EPS) to be $0.01 or $0.02. For the full year 2002, =
pro forma EBITDA is expected to be between $70 and $100 million and pro for=
ma EPS to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.10.   The Business Outlook for the=
 company as of today will be available on the company's Investor Relations =
Web site throughout the current quarter. It is currently expected the full =
Business Outlook will not be updated until the release of Yahoo!'s next qua=
rterly earnings announcement; however, Yahoo! reserves the right to update =
the full Business Outlook or any portion thereof at any time for any reason=
.   Quarterly Conference Call  Yahoo! will host a conference call today to =
discuss fourth quarter and year end results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. A li=
ve Webcast of the conference call can be accessed at http://webevents.broad=
cast.com/yahoo/011602. In addition, a replay of the call will be available =
