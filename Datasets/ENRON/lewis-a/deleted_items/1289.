Dear Wall Street City User,

I want to take this opportunity to share some exciting news about Wall
Street City.

Beginning today you'll see a new logo on the site: "Individual
Investor.com @ Wall Street City."  We are merging Individual
Investor.com into Wall Street City. As a current user, you will continue
to have full access to all of the features that you can't live without,
including Stock Search, powerful charting tools, advanced portfolio
analytics, and historical stock, option, and mutual fund quotes.

We're excited about the change and we think you will be too. Come visit
us on the web at http//www.wallstreetcity.com.

Sincerely,
Charles Rotblut, CFA
Director of Financial Content
