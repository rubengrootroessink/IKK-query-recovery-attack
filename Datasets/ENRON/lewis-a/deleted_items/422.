Andy,

Could you please print this 1 pg out for me whenever you get a chance?
Thanks very much!  : )

Also, maybe we can go jogging after work if time, etc. is working out
alright...

Then, I probably need to go home to hunt for kelly's stuff sometime today or
later tonight.  You are welcome to come with me, but if you have stuff to
research, rest, etc., it's fine that you stay at home.

Gots to continue filling out my personal survey which is estimated to take
btwn 5-8 hours...

Love,
MM
