 Reaching The Breaking Point   Is anyone else sick and tired of the financi=
al "scandals" being harked by the media?  Companies are blaming auditors wh=
ile auditors are blaming Wall Street and Wall Street is blaming everybody. =
 Members of Congress are jumping on the bandwagon denouncing the companies.=
  These are the same companies that helped finance their campaigns.  This d=
rama is starting to resemble the Jerry Springer show and it is doing harm t=
o investors' faith in the market.  Publicly traded companies are expected t=
o conduct themselves in a respectable manner.  This means no shredding of d=
ocuments and no actions of management that undermine the integrity of the c=
ompany.  Is it too much to ask for?   In just the past few weeks we have ha=
d some high profile cases.    [IMAGE]ImClone Systems (IMCL ) is being inves=
tigated by the SEC and the Justice Department.  The company is accused of m=
isleading investors of a highly touted colon cancer drug called Erbitux. CE=
O Samuel Waksal told investors on a conference call that he was "stunned'' =
at the FDA's decision to refuse the cancer drug application for Erbitux. Ho=
wever a copy of the FDA's rejection letter was obtained by The Cancer Lette=
r. It suggests Waksal and his brother Harlan knew, or should have known, th=
at the FDA had serious concerns about the way the company conducted a key c=
linical trial.  To add fuel to the fire, Harlan Waksal filed a Form 144 wit=
h the SEC on Dec. 6 to sell 700,000 shares of ImClone stock.  At the time o=
f the filing the stock was at its 52-week high of $75.  Call it coincidence=
 if you will but investors feel cheated.   [IMAGE]              Global Cros=
sing (GX ) filed for bankruptcy this Monday.  Company Chairman Gary Winnick=
 was a former Drexel Burnham Lambert sales executive that joined the junk b=
ond business in 1972 and left in 1985 which was five years prior to the fir=
ms collapse.  It is somewhat ironic that Global Crossing's inability to pay=
 off its debt caused the company to fall.  Unfortunately for GX, Drexel isn=
't around anymore.  There is a winner in all this and that is the Winnick. =
 He started the company with a little over $20 million investment and over =
the last three years he has managed to sell over $600 million worth of stoc=
k.    [IMAGE]     Tyco (TYC ) has always had bears scrutinizing over the co=
mpany's accounting.  The Enron collapse prompted the company to announce a =
breakup into four units which would "maximize shareholder value".  It seeme=
d like a defensive move and the market responded by selling the stock.  The=
n some troubles hit when it was revealed the company paid $10 million to ou=
tside director Frank Walsh and an additional $10 million to a charity of wh=
ich he is a trustee.  This prompted another sell off. In this environment, =
anything that even hints at impropriety will cause investors to jump ship. =
 [IMAGE]                 Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC ) fell as much as 7.=
4 percent on Wednesday after the largest U.S. independent oil and gas produ=
cer said it restated third-quarter earnings to include an additional $1.7 b=
illion in charges to reflect lower values for its U.S. oil and gas assets. =
 The problem was that the accountants had used the wrong figures to calcula=
te the worth of some of the company's U.S. energy properties.  Brownie poin=
ts go to Anadarko for correcting the error but you have to wonder if manage=
ment would've been so swift if it not for Enron.   It may be painful now bu=
t good will come out of all this. Companies will face intense scrutiny when=
 they report their earnings.  Stocks may be hurt in the near term but overa=
ll there will be a shift to a higher quality of reporting.    The companies=
 listed above are predominantly large corporations and cover four different=
 industries.  The problems are in no way relegated to a certain industry.  =
 The bottom line is huge consulting fees are paid by big companies.  This i=
n turn creates a greater incentive for the accounting side to make sure the=
ir clients make their numbers.  It is equivalent to an investment bank havi=
ng their "analysts" issue a buy rating on a company that does banking deals=
 with them.   With all the turmoil right now many investors are pulling the=
ir money out of the markets.  A poll by Investors Business Daily showed tha=
t 40 out of 50 executives polled believe there are other companies with acc=
ounting irregularities. This is frightening but it most certainly does not =
mean investors should not buy stocks.  On the contrary, there are some very=
 exciting things happening in the world being made possible by companies th=
at are publicly traded.  The challenge is finding these companies.  Whereas=
 in the past, investors put their money in the stock market and expected si=
gnificant returns, now we are in a market of stocks where it days some seri=
ous work to find the winners.   Innovation is not going to stop.  Can peopl=
e afford not to be invested in the future?   The SmallCap Digest has always=
 advocated diversification.  This means a well balanced portfolio consistin=
g of companies in different sectors with varying market caps.  All the trou=
bles currently in the market have been mostly isolated to large companies. =
   Small cap companies are always in a "prove it" mode because they have no=
 institutional coverage and must win over investors with their performance.=
   They face more scrutiny, thus making for a less likely chance of "Enroni=
tis".   In about one week we will be profiling a biotech company that has p=
assed our due diligence test.  This company is already generating very impr=
essive sales and looks to be profitable this year.  Coupled with strong ins=
titutional backers, a rarity for a company of it's size, this medical devic=
e maker is poised to make a big splash when it debuts. The company will be =
going public through an RTO, and it will open for trading on the American S=
tock Exchange.    (Subscribers are encouraged to read our expose on Enron )=
