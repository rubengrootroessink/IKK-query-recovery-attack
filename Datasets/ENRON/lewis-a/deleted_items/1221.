David and I were talking about Serendipity today, and it'll be a lot of fun
if we all went to see it together.  Me and Andy & Peter and CM & David and
Jessie.

Do you guys want to go see Serendipity Friday night?  It's starring John
Cusack and Kate Beckinsale.  It's a couples' kind of movie...  : )

We could go catch a 9 ish showing and hook up together for dinner beforehand
if everyone wants to.  Maybe that "man jin yuan"...  you know my chinese is
terrible...  something like Chino Express or something like that...

Let me know what you guys think.  Miss you guys lots...

Amy  : )

-- Thanks for taking me to lunch David.  : )  And, you'll relay the msg to
your gf then, since I don't have her email address...
