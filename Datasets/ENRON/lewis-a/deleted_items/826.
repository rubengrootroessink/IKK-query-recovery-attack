    308 Systems to Feature the Globalstar GSP-1600 Phone in TAC-PAK(TM)   H=
ERMOSA BEACH, Calif., Jun 5, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- 308 Systems, I=
nc., supplier of state-of-the-art remote communications packages, today ann=
ounced the addition of the Globalstar GSP-1600 phone by QUALCOMM to the 308=
 Systems TAC-PAK(TM), a battery powered, portable communication system inte=
grated into one small, briefcase-sized package. The Globalstar phone provid=
es a new way for people in remote locations to enjoy full office functional=
ity.   The TAC-PAK(TM) includes all of the equipment necessary for customer=
s to set up comprehensive worldwide command and communication operations wi=
thin 3 minutes of arrival at an incident. Options available in the modular =
TAC-PAK(TM) system include a Pentium laptop computer, cellular voice/data s=
ystem, color printer, copy machine, digital still/video camera, document sc=
anner, Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping and directions, videoconfere=
ncing, and much more. Now with the addition of the Globalstar GSP-1600 phon=
e, data cable and modem drivers (provided on a CD ROM), the user can establ=
ish two-way satellite communications for both voice and data.   The TAC-PAK=
(TM)'s compact size and portability enables customers to take full office o=
perations to the top of a building, the middle of a lake, or to streets blo=
cked by debris from tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural dis=
asters. Typical applications for the TAC-PAK(TM) with the Globalstar phone =
include remote office operations, major incident management, insurance clai=
ms adjusting, petroleum exploration, natural disaster recovery, search and =
rescue operations, Remote Structure Inspections, and related remote communi=
cation situations.   "Putting the Globalstar phone in the TAC-PAK(TM) repre=
sents a paradigm shift in remote communications," said Mark Lueker, directo=
r of advanced projects at 308 Systems. "Prior to our relationship with Glob=
alstar USA, what we were seeing in the field was a hodgepodge of communicat=
ion technologies which were impossible, expensive, or inconvenient for the =
typical user to integrate and operate in the field. Our company's original =
goal was to integrate the traditional office operations and communication c=
apabilities into a lightweight and fully functional communication system ca=
pable of being carried by a single person to a remote location such as a sa=
les meeting, construction site, brush fire, oil exploration site, or disast=
er situation. The GSP-1600 phone is a perfect addition to our product lineu=
p."   "The TAC-PAK(TM) gives our customers more flexibility and range in ma=
king important decisions on the ground and it puts the Globalstar phone int=
o the hands of people in the industries with the greatest need for remote c=
ommunications," said Dennis McSweeney, vice president and general manager o=
f Globalstar USA. "The ingenuity of communications solutions by companies l=
ike 308 Systems is very impressive and we are proud to be part of these kin=
ds of creative applications for the Globalstar network."   Globalstar Inter=
net Access, which was launched in December 2000, makes it possible to use t=
he Globalstar phone like a wireless external modem when away from a traditi=
onal landline or out of cellular range. The data transfer runs at 9.6 Kbps,=
 which allows for the efficient transmission of email, images, and files. G=
