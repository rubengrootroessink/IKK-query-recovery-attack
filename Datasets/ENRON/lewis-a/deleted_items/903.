   AMCC Demonstrates Framer-to-Fiber Very Short Reach OC-192 CWDM Link At S=
uperComm=1DDemonstration Provides a Lower Cost and Lower Power Alternative =
to Serial 10 Gbps Long-Reach OC-192 Solutions for Distances Less Than 300 M=
eters   SAN DIEGO, Jun 6, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Co=
rp. (AMCC) (NASDAQ:AMCC) Wednesday announced the demonstration of a complet=
e very short reach (VSR) OC-192 Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CW=
DM) link exhibited in booth No. 8460 at SuperComm 2001 in Atlanta.   The co=
mplete VSR OC-192 link is based on the utilization of AMCC's Ganges (S19202=
) OC-192 framer/mapper, Verrazano (S2509) Digital Wrapper/FEC transceiver d=
evice, and Blaze Network Products' Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM transceive=
r optical module, which incorporates AMCC's S7022 and S7025 PMD devices. Th=
e S2509 and Afterburner module are implemented on a reference design with a=
n OC-192 300-pin MSA compliant I/O interface for backwards compatibility wi=
th existing 10 Gbps long-reach OC-192 solutions. This single-fiber VCSEL-ba=
sed module technology is ideally suited for inter-box short-reach OC-192 co=
nnectivity in Central Offices and Data Centers.   "This complete OC-192 lin=
k is a very compelling low cost alternative to longer-reach solutions that =
are less economical for distances less than 300 meters," said Paul Duran, A=
MCC's product marketing manager. "This demonstration exemplifies AMCC's com=
mitment to provide the most cost effective, pre-engineered solutions for ou=
r OEM customers."   "Our customers do not have the time to work out the sys=
tem issues related to performance and interfaces between components in the =
link," said Bill Wiedemann, Blaze Network Product's vice president of sales=
 and marketing. "We choose AMCC's S7022 VCSEL Driver and S7025 TIA/Post-Amp=
 for our CWDM module because they were designed to work in concert with oth=
er AMCC components for a complete framer-to-fiber VSR OC-192 link."   The B=
laze Afterburner-XGSX 10 Gbps CWDM module is currently in production. For m=
