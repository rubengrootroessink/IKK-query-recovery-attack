AGE]    INVESTMENT  SUMMARY    HYPD is a premier provider of comprehensive =
integrated technology services (ITSP) and solutions for   a client base in =
the rapidly growing ITSP marketplace for small-to-medium sized businesses. =
  HYPD is capable of handling a wide range of its clients' unique ITSP need=
s, with services ranging from conventional IT services to enterprise migrat=
ion and comprehensive IT HyperSource solutions (outsourcing all of a client=
's e-business needs).  HYPD has positioned its future business strategy aro=
und the development of uniquely designed Integrated Technology Centers (ITC=
s), which will offer client companies comprehensive bundled ITSP services a=
nd solutions integrated with its state of the art facilities.  The first Ho=
uston based ITC has recently begun operations, and is offering its clients =
a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and back-office services. HYPD'=
s first ITC is designed around an AT?Dedicated Entrance Facility with on-ne=
t redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an OC-48 a=
nd beyond.  This comprehensive Ti! er-1 hosting center enables HYPD to offe=
r clients complete end-to-end IT services in a fully redundant and seamless=
 environment.  Through recently developed Hyperserve connection products, H=
YPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by offering =
clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC.  Bolstered by str=
ategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players in tec=
hnology and telecommunications, including Microsoft, Intel, AT&T, and Great=
 Plains, HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the unique ne=
eds and limitations of small-to-medium sized businesses, effectively creati=
ng a business model that partners HYPDS' success with that of its clients. =
 Utilizing this innovative approach, HYPD should be able to grow its busine=
ss in conjunction with client business growth, and position itself as the I=
TSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mid sized compan=
ies.  Within t! he Houston region, and with this small and mid sized target=
 market, HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially over th=
e near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance within an ap=
preciable time period.    HYPD has recently aimed its full-service IT hosti=
ng business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of small t=
o medium-sized businesses, a rapidly growing market that is relatively unde=
served by major IT service providers such as Level 3, UUNet, and Sprint.   =
HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative, long-term re=
venue streams afforded through association with growing companies.  For exa=
mple, HYPD has recently initiated long-term Hypersource IT hosting arrangem=
ents with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group.  Eagle Wir=
eless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipment and s=
ervices for a variety of markets, including the Internet, digital set-top b=
oxes, and wireless convergence products, and is anticipated to reach nation=
al market penetration within the next several years.  As the client company=
 grows its business over the next several years, the highly scalable nature=
 of the Hyperdynamics' IT hosting model will enable the Company to offer ad=
ditional needed services readily while retaining high margins.  By being ab=
le to refine and scale up c! lient IT services in a quick time period, and =
for minimal additional expenses, HYPD has opened up access to significant a=
nd recurring long-term revenue streams from smaller and mid-sized business =
clients.  Moreover, HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented degree of=
 personalized attention and customization, when compared to major national =
ITSP providers.    The infrastructure of HYPD'S first ITC, designed to supp=
ort end-to-end ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and smart diver=
sification. With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer Systems, Inc. (S=
CS), HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data management marke=
t. Thus, in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP services,=
 new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities offering div=
ersified revenue streams are coming to HYPD.   For example, SCS is a seismi=
c data management company that has developed a unique and cost saving metho=
d for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas companies on 8=
mm and 9mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD (optical) storage.  The c=
urrent methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes are time cons=
uming, prohibitively expensive, outdated (the technology is over 40 years o=
ld), and inefficient.  SCS will enable clients in the expanding oil and gas=
 industry to migrate the estimated 3 billion magnetic tapes that degrade in=
 8-20 years to DVD storage, with an expected lifespan of over 50 years, at =
a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility.  The SCS acquisition, mo=
reover, provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center business of=
 HYPD, and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue streams.  SCS =
will derive revenue! s from three principal sources: (1) conversion of exis=
ting tapes to superior DVD storage technologies; (2) accessing DVD data thr=
ough HYPD's ITC facility; and (3) a vertical ASP approach to remote seismic=
 interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using technical =
and hardware support from Intel.  In addition to opening up an innovative a=
nd new business through the SCS acquisition, HYPD believes that it will be =
able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other target indus=
tries, such as insurance services, either through additional acquisitions o=
r joint ventures.    HYPD's projected revenue and business growth will be l=
argely driven by several principal catalysts, including: (1) continuing to =
implement its full service IT hosting solution, Hypersource, through the Ho=
uston-based, state-of-the-art Integrated Technology Center and future plann=
ed ITC's in regional markets; (2) orienting its ITSP solutions and services=
 towards the unique needs of expanding small-and-medium sized businesses; (=
3) entering into long-term, recurring revenue contracts by growing with its=
 clients, and providing additional services at higher margins as these clie=
nt businesses expand; (4) opening up new and lucrative revenu! e streams th=
rough its subsidiary SCS, and integrating this business opportunity through=
 internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services business; and (5)=
 positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketplace for ITSP=
 services and products for small and mid-sized business clients.     VALUAT=
ION   Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consistent theme wi=
thin the past several years.  Major ITSP hosting players have been acquired=
 in a series of recognizable transactions.  Notable among these has been th=
e acquisition of Verio by NTT, and the acquisition of Digex by WorldCom.  W=
ithin the remaining players in the IT hosting industry, remaining players h=
ave been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded, based on consist=
ently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of services provided.=
  In addition, these players have suffered due to aggressive acquisition st=
rategies undertaken during the previous two years that have not proven out =
as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures.  By contrast=
, HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limited acquisitions=
 carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit aggregate revenue=
s and earnings.  Relative to comparative companies within the ITSP industry=
, HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings over the near=
-to-intermediate term period.  A grouping of comparable companies within th=
is sector currently trades at an average price to sales multiple of 2.70 X.=
  On a forward looking basis, using FY 2003 revenue and earnings estimates =
for the Company (fiscal year 2003 starts July 1,2002), this represents roug=
hly a 8-fold premium to current trading levels.  Thus, when applying the co=
mparative grouping's average price to earnings and price to revenue multipl=
es to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of $4.30 per share over th=
e next 12 months.     SUMMARY   Aggressive investors looking for above-aver=
age return potential on a portion of their investment capital should give H=
YPD a serious look.  Management of the Company, headed by CEO Kent Watts, a=
re highly talented and educated in their technical areas.  We believe HYPD =
has assembled an astute, goal oriented, sophisticated team committed to HYP=
D becoming very, very successful.  Investors at current levels may be rewar=
ded in the short term, and beyond, as HYPD'S business plan is executed.  HY=
PD may very well be one of the stock market's best secrets!   [IMAGE]    Di=
