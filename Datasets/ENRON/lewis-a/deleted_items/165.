Former Enron Vice Chairman Apparently Commits Suicide

Former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who had opposed the accoun=
ting practices that led to the downfall of the energy trading giant, appare=
ntly took his own life early Friday morning. Police said that Baxter was de=
ad at the scene and the only occupant of the car. A suicide note and a revo=
lver were found at the scene. Baxter was chairman and CEO of Enron North Am=
erica before being named chief strategy officer. In October of 2000, he was=
 promoted to vice chairman. Baxter resigned last May after ten years with E=
nron, during which time he helped build its wholesale energy business. Baxt=
er had disagreed with then CEO Jeffrey Skilling over the inappropriateness =
of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships that ultimately br=
ought the company down. Baxter was one of the Enron directors targeted in a=
bout 40 investor lawsuits which allege that the company concealed losses by=
 the use of the partnerships. Baxter engineered the $3.21 billion purchase =
of Portlan! d General Electric in 1997. Enron has agreed to sell the utilit=
y to Northwest Natural Gas for $2.98 billion in cash, stock and debt. Baxte=
r resigned after losing a battle with Skilling for control of the direction=
 the company would take. He favored the acquisition of energy producing ass=
ets to build the company, while Skilling preferred to expand the commoditie=
s trading unit, in Enrons asset light theory. Baxter reportedly told friend=
s that he planned to earn a Ph.D. in history, spend time with his family an=
d look for a position as chief executive at another company.

Dabhol Sale Process Begins This Week

The bidding process for Enrons $2.9 billion Dabhol Power project in India i=
s set to begin this week. The Industrial Development Bank of India said adv=
ertisements will be placed in newspapers. Interested foreign companies are =
Royal Dutch/Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential Indian buyers =
are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India. Reportedly Rothschild,=
 DSP Merrill Lynch and Smifs Securities have been appointed to search for b=
idders. The vast 2,184 MW natural gas fired power plant and nearby LNG faci=
lity, the largest foreign private investment ever in India, has been idle s=
ince Enron pulled out last June in a dispute over the cost of the power pro=
vided to its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The 74=
0 MW first phase of Dabhol began operating in May 1999. A 1,444 MW 2nd phas=
e was almost complete when construction was halted after the state electric=
ity board fell $240 million behind in payments for power provided. Those in=
terested i! n acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in =
earnest money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders=
 may bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data roo=
m will be established for the commercial and financial agreements, operatin=
g and historical data, projections and information on the status of Phase I=
I. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a possible dea=
dline of the middle of March for submitting offers. The US governments Over=
seas Private Investment Corporation, a lender and guarantor of  loans to th=
e project, and IDBI have led the talks among the parties involved, includin=
g 5 Indian financial institutions, 20 foreign banks, 3 foreign government l=

California PUC Rejects Sempra Settlement

The California PUC has rejected a settlement proposed by Sempra Energy that=
 seeks to split profits from power sales between customers of San Diego Gas=
 and Electric and shareholders. The decision will likely lead to a lawsuit =
between Sempra and the PUC. At stake is $363 million the PUC argues could b=
e used to the benefit of customers by paying down a special balancing accou=

Alberta Energy and PanCanadian Consider Merger

PanCanadian Energy Will buy Alberta Energy in a $16.8 billion share exchang=
e deal which will create North America's largest oil exploration and produc=
tion company, replacing Anadarko. The deal will allow the companies to comp=
ete effectively on a global basis. The new company, which is to be headquar=
tered in Calgary, will be named EnCana Corp. The exchange ratio is a market=
-to-market ratio based on the average of the closing price for the 10 tradi=
ng days ended January 23rd. PanCanadian shareholders will own about 54% and=
 AEC shareholders will own about 46% of EnCana. Combined, the stocks of the=
 two companies make up 44% of the TSEs oil and gas sub-index. Some say that=
 Canadian companies have realized the need to bulk up in order to be compet=
itive with larger companies in the US, like Anadarko, Burlington Resources =
and Devon Energy, and to attract investors. The deal could also be a self-p=
rotection measure in response to last year's rash of takeovers of Canadian =
oil firms ! by US companies, like those that took over Gulf Canada, Anderso=
n Exploration and Canadian Hunter. Alberta Energy and PanCanadian may have =
seen themselves as vulnerable to possible takeovers. PanCanadian had been c=
onsidered a possible takeover target when it was spun off from Canadian Pac=
ific in October. A new AEC-PanCanadian company would produce 255,000 bpd of=
 oil and natural gas liquids and 2.5 Bcf of natural gas per day. PanCanadia=
n has natural gas and oil production facilities in Western Canada and offsh=
ore operations in Nova Scotia, the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, where it r=
ecently discovered the areas largest oil field in 10 years, named Buzzard. =
AEC also produces oil and natural gas in Western Canada, owns about 14% of =
the Syncrude Canada oil sands project and has exploration, production, pipe=
line and natural gas storage units in the Rocky Mountains, Ecuador and the =
Arctic.=20
