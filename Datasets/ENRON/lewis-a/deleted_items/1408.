Hi Andy --

Thanks for helping us understand the tranportation and storage problem
today. We appreciate your patience. I know it's like teaching a baby how to
walk!

Anyway, just wanted to get you the updated numbers for the transportation
scenario, based on the changes you made at teh meeting today.  Can you also
double check with Philip regarding the issue with hedging Basis with
regards to transportation?

Have a great weekend!

Thanks!
Ann
