ityAlert.com.     TI Expands Cable Modem Offerings With an Integrated IEEE =
802.11 Residential Gateway Platform=1DNew Design Leverages Technical Expert=
ise in Wireless LAN and DOCSIS 1.1   DALLAS, Nov 27, 2001 /PRNewswire via C=
OMTEX/ -- A new cable modem reference platform for broadband-enabled wirele=
ss home networking is being introduced today by Texas Instruments Incorpora=
ted (NYSE: TXN) (TI). The TNETC408 reference design incorporates TI's leadi=
ng data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) 1.1 cable modem=
 technology with TI's 802.11b single-chip MAC/baseband processor to enable =
the distribution of broadband content throughout the home. (See http://www.=
ti/sc/cablemodem .)   "Our certification success with DOCSIS 1.1 and techni=
cal expertise in 802.11 made the development of a cable-enabled residential=
 gateway (RG) design a natural progression, allowing us to deliver cable mo=
dem solutions that continue to extend our penetration in the market," said =
Brett Butler, general manager of Cable Broadband Communications at TI. "Con=
sumers' desire for wireless home networking continues to grow, and this sol=
ution allows us to help original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) bring more =
affordable consumer products to market quickly."   About the TNETC408 Resid=
ential Gateway Solution   The TNETC408 RG solution offers a foundation for =
cable providers to expand service offerings to and enhance management of ne=
twork devices within the home through implementation of the CableLabs' Cabl=
eHome(tm) initiative. TI is engaged with multiple third party software deve=
lopers for support of the RG functionality that includes:   --  Firewall   =
  --  Network Address Translation (NAT)     --  Dynamic Host Configuration =
Protocol (DHCP) Client Server     --  Web based management  This RG referen=
ce design builds upon TI's DOCSIS 1.1 silicon and software, and incorporate=
s TI's TurboDOX(tm) software, which increases the upstream capacity and per=
formance of the cable modem.   The TNETC408 incorporates TI's ACX100 802.11=
 single-chip MAC and baseband processor for wireless local area networks (W=
LANs). The chip supports the 802.11b standard, commonly referred to as Wi-F=
i, and offers a technology extension to increase the range of operation by =
up to 70 percent. Additionally, the ACX100 offers 22Mbps extended data rate=
 capabilities today that are forward-compatible with elements of the new IE=
EE 802.11g draft standard since the chip supports PBCC-22, for high-rate wi=
reless networking in the 2.4GHz band. Combined with TI's robust cable modem=
 solution, TI's TNETC408 design will allow multimedia applications to be wi=
relessly networked throughout the home.   About TI Broadband   For OEM's de=
veloping broadband communications solutions, TI's advanced signal processin=
g-based silicon and software platforms deliver the optimal performance, low=
er power consumption, and system level integration required to rapidly depl=
oy differentiated next generation products for cable modems, digital subscr=
