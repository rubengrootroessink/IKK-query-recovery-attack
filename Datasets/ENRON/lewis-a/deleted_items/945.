Do you trade the QQQ, NASDAQ, OEX 100 or Stocks?Are you getting the returns you are use to? Would you like to see what other markets are available?
You can now trade the e-mini S&P 500 & NASDAQ futures markets completely electronically in seconds right from your computer
You can control over $500,000 in index stock value for approx $25,000.00 in day margin.
E-mini ES market specs: ES (emini S&P 500) =  each point=  $50.00  per contract< /FONT  > Day Margin = Approx  $2,200.00< /FONT >    E-mini NQ market specs:NQ (emini NASDAQ 100) = each point = $20.00 per contract Day Margin = Approx $3,400.00 Possible Trade Scenario:   Buy 10 NQ Contacts at 1333.00Day Margin: $35,000Each point = $200 (10 contracts time $20 per point)Sell 10 NQ Contracts at 1350.00Profit / Loss = 17 points times $200 = $3400
Remember, the exact opposite can happen too. In other words, if you bought 10 contracts and sold them for a 17 point loss, your account would incur a loss of $3400. Fees have not been deducted from these totals. 
This can happen in one hour, or one day. Email me more information
