I just wanted to pass a note to you because I wanted to clear up the skepticism about my trading system.     
     Psychology is 90% of the markets.  Just look at how the markets react all the time to news or consumer confidence.  Trading that psychology is key, and this is why my profits are so consistent. 
     
     Every month my gap trading system makes money in an up or down market.  What I am teaching uses psychology to its highest degree.  I teach you the most optimal time to take advantage of bargain-hunting and profit-taking, the most psychologically influenced aspects of the market.  This really keeps you out of losing gap trades because you need a way to filter them out.  You don't have to put your opinion in which trade to take.
 
          I'm sure it is not what I am charging for my system that makes you skeptical.  After all, you already know you can get a refund.  It is probably the doubt that it can continue, so why waste your time, right?  I have given you profitable updates frequently, but you may still find it difficult to believe it will continue.   So, here is my thought... 
    
     Just take the step to "watch".  You really don't need the time commitment because I will show you everything.  You just have to read the 60 page manual, and I will take care of the rest.  I will spend the time to show you.  Log onto your computer in the mornings and look for my emails.  I'll give you the trades and so forth.  Watching these trades to see how they react is the proof to everything that I am telling you.  I have no problem spending as much time as you need to make this work for you too.

Best Regards,
