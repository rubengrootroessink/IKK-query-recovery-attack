. Report: Travelers Strongly Prefer Federal Involvement in Airport Security=
 Screening Process   AGOURA HILLS, Calif., Nov 19, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- =
As the busiest holiday travel period approaches, consumers are still planni=
ng to increase air travel. Last week's crash of Flight 587 did not dramatic=
ally reduce confidence in air travel, however, travelers want more federal =
involvement in security measures, according to the J.D. Power and Associate=
s and Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO) report released today.   Among those who ha=
ve traveled within the last three months, 62 percent of air travelers say t=
hey are "already comfortable" with air travel. This same group reports the =
level of travelers reporting they will "never" be comfortable rose from 3 p=
ercent to 5 percent.   The report shows being "afraid to fly" is still the =
most often-cited reason for curtailing air travel plans, with nearly 50 per=
cent of leisure travelers mentioning it as their number one reason. One-thi=
rd of business travelers cited either economic conditions or company restri=
ctions on air travel as their top reasons for not flying.   Travelers have =
a strong preference for federal involvement in the airport security screeni=
ng process, according to the report.   "The highly publicized recent storie=
s of security lapses have greatly reduced the public's opinion of private a=
irport security companies," said Michael Taylor, director of travel service=
s at J.D. Power and Associates. "The public also feels stronger that a sear=
ch of checked baggage is necessary for airport security."   One thing that =
hasn't changed in the past month is the public's faith in technology to pro=
vide greater security. High-tech scanners and bomb "sniffers" top the list =
of items travelers would like to see in airports. A ban on restaurant cutle=
ry and national ID cards have the least impact on how safe consumers feel. =
  "As for what can be done to increase in-flight security, armored cockpit =
doors would inspire as much confidence as sky marshals posted on random fli=
ghts," said Taylor.   The percentage of people that feel air travel has "ch=
anged forever" is slowly dropping, while the percentage of people perceivin=
g "no difference" increased from 8 percent to 12 percent. The Flight 587 tr=
agedy did not affect the percentage of travelers who are still undecided ab=
out their comfort level in flying, which remained steady at one in five tra=
velers.   The survey was conducted two months after the worst air catastrop=
hes in the history of the United States, September 11, and one day after th=
e crash of Flight 587. J.D. Power and Associates and Yahoo! collected data =
from more than 2,600 adult respondents. The public opinion poll was conduct=
ed among random visitors to Yahoo's Web site the week of November 12. More =
than 1,200 of the respondents reported having air travel experiences within=
 the past three months.   Headquartered in Agoura Hills, Calif., J.D. Power=
