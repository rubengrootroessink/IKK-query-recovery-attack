EquityAlert.com.     Globalstar Extends Data Services to Telit Phone Units;=
 Internet Connectivity Now Available On GSM-Compatible Satellite Phones   R=
OME & SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Globalstar L.P. and=
 Telit Mobile Terminals S.p.A. of Italy today announced the commercial intr=
oduction of data communications software for Telit Globalstar phones, givin=
g users access to the Internet or other data networks, even when they are f=
ar outside the range of cellular or other telephone services.   Telit Globa=
lstar phones allow users to make calls either over the Globalstar satellite=
 telephone network or through regular GSM-based cellular networks, GSM bein=
g the cellular standard commonly used throughout Europe, the Middle East, A=
sia, Africa, Australia and other parts of the world. Telit Globalstar phone=
s have been available with voice-call capability in most of these markets f=
or nearly two years, but until now they provided data capability only over =
GSM terrestrial networks. With the new software introduced today, Telit pho=
nes now can provide GSM-like data connectivity over the Globalstar satellit=
e network as well.   Globalstar data services, which offer the highest data=
 speed of any mobile satellite phone service, were originally introduced in=
 North America in December 2000, using Qualcomm Globalstar phone units whic=
h are compatible with CDMA cellular networks common in the U.S. and Canada.=
 Telit now makes this popular data service available for the first time on =
a GSM/satellite phone.   The new Telit data software can be used with eithe=
r Telit Model Sat 550 or Sat 600 Globalstar phones. Using a simple adapter =
cable, the phone connects to a regular PC serial port and provides asynchro=
nous dial-up data capability, generally through a regular Internet service =
provider (ISP) or over a private corporate network. Additional dialer and d=
river software for PC installation is also provided, with documentation in =
eight languages.   When used on the newer-model Telit Sat 600 phone, the ne=
w software also provides greatly extended battery life -- up to 24 hours (i=
n Globalstar Satellite mode) or more without recharging -- through a new "s=
lotted paging" function. Previously, Telit Globalstar phones in stand-by mo=
de continuously scanned for incoming call signals, rapidly draining battery=
 power. Slotted paging, which is also used on current generation cellular p=
hones, instructs the phone to scan for incoming signals only for a very bri=
ef instant every few seconds, resulting in far less battery usage per hour =
while in stand-by mode.   Telit is Italy's largest producer of cellular and=
 satellite phones. Based in Trieste and Rome, Telit products are giving a v=
oice to the Mobile Generation, developing products through its network of l=
aboratories and cooperative work with universities in Italy and elsewhere i=
n Europe. For more information, please visit our website at www.telital.com=

ervice providers and equipment manufacturers, including co-founders Loral S=
