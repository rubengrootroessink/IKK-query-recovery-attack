rnal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement- Next Profile Could Open Fo=
r Trading First Week of February   We could not be more excited about our n=
ext profile, which will be coming soon. We can't say exactly when because t=
he company will be going public through an RTO, and it will open for tradin=
g on the American Stock Exchange at a yet to be determined time. The first =
week of February is the anticipated time frame for the stock to open for tr=
ading. It could open at any time during the week. To learn more about RTOs,=
 you can read our January 16th  edition, which describes in detail how they=
 work.   The company is a medical device manufacturer already generating si=
gnificant world wide sales. The company expects to turn cash flow positive =
this year, and an very significant FDA approval is imminent. This company f=
its perfectly with the Bio-Tech revolution, a group we believe will generat=
e prolific profits for investors who choose the right stocks during the fir=
st decade of the 21st century. Please read our January 19th  edition for ou=
r views on this matter.   One of this company's therapies has already been =
featured on a special segment on Good Morning America, and their shareholde=
rs' list reads like of Who's Who of major Wall Street names and Internation=
al Financiers.   Because this company will not be going public through the =
traditional IPO, all open market investors will be on an equal playing fiel=
d once the stock begins trading.   When the stock opens for trading the OTC=
 Journal will immediately send out our profile on the company. You will be =
provided with all the facts and figures you need to make an informed invest=
ment decision, but you should still make an effort to confirm all informati=
on through independent third party sources, i.e. the SEC Edgar filings and =
the company's web site.   Consequently, we have come up with a solution to =
get you the profile as soon as the stock opens for trading. Simply visit ou=
r Home Page  frequently at www.otcjournal.com.  At the top of our home page=
 you will find a notice informing you whether the stock has opened for trad=
ing. Once the stock opens, our banner will be give you the name, symbol, an=
d current quote. After trading begins you will be able to simply click on t=
he banner, and the full profile on the company will open up automatically. =
  There is already a tremendous "buzz" on this company in the small cap com=
munity, and we believe the stock could trade like a hot IPO. Start checking=
 our home page at www.otcjournal.com  the first week of February morning if=
 you want the advantage of getting in on the ground floor.     [IMAGE] Ener=
gy Power (OTC BB: EYPSF); Volume and Price Surge Alert- Higher Levels Could=
 be Imminent [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  Energy Power was our best profile of 2001, a=
nd the trend seems to be continuing in 2002. In our year end wrap up of the=
 company, we predicted the stock had the potential to trade into the $8 to =
$10 range. Based on today's closing price of $5.50, the stock has already a=
ppreciated 86.55% from our February 10th introduction in 2001 at $2.95.   O=
ur $8 to $10 target price is based on the company making a prolific find at=
 the new drilling site in the Ladyfern region on the Alberta/British Columb=
ia border.   Test well drilling was announced by the company on January 15t=
h, and it took the market a few days to wake up to this development. Since =
the market has begun to recognize the potential magnitude of this test dril=
ling, the stock has been trading extremely well as revealed in the current =
chart.   An article published in the July 9, 2001 edition of Toronto's Glob=
e and Mail, contains the following paragraph which helps explain the recent=
 surge in price and volume: "Ladyfern, discovered just 18 months ago by U.S=
. Independent producer Murphy Oil Corp., began production this year and is =
already generating more than 500 million cubic feet a day of natural gas, a=
 number that is still growing. The field, by itself, has accounted for 75 p=
er cent of Western Canada's production growth in the first half of the year=
. While the size of Ladyfern's reserves still aren't clear, analysts estima=
te it could contain as much as one trillion cubic feet of gas, which would =
make it the biggest gas find in Western Canada in the past 15 years."   Dav=
id Parkinson, the author of the article, also observes: "It's hard to have =
a conversation with a natural gas analyst without Ladyfern coming up, often=
 accompied by near-giddy enthusiasm. The mere mention of the name makes som=
e of them drool more than Pavlov's dog at a bell-ringing festival."   Apach=
e Energy, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, and Alberta Energy Corp have all =
partnered with Murphy Oil and launched an ambitious new drilling program. 4=
5 new wells had been drilled in the first half of 2001 alone.   In spite of=
 the current weak pricing environment for Natural Gas, we expect Energy Pow=
er Systems to post good comparative results in the first two calendar quart=
ers of 2002 as a result of new drilling programs implemented last year.   E=
nergy Power is elephant hunting in the Ladyfern region right now. The marke=
t is speculating on a prolific find. If the company is lucky enough to be i=
n the right place at the right time our $8 to $10 price target could be att=
ainable. If the stock were to break above $6 it would set a new high, a ver=
y bullish sign. In the meantime, the market seems to like the company's Lad=
yfern drilling program.   Click Here  to read the full text of the January =
