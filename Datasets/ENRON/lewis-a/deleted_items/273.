d Wednesday's edition of the OTC Journal did not arrive in your inbox until=
 Thursday or Friday. There seems to be delivery challenges on the Internet =

 Decade of the 21st Century   [IMAGE]  Vast fortunes were accumulated in th=
e 80's and 90's as the computer evolved into an integral part of our daily =
lives. Companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, Intel, Sun Microsystems, an=
d Dell Computer yielded massive profits for shareholders during the twenty =
five year meteoric growth phase of this industry.   The BioTech industry is=
 poised to provide those same kind of returns in the first decade of the 21=
st Century. The fruits of innovative research will propel more new drugs to=
 market than ever before. The paradigm has shifted from technology/internet=
 companies to BioTech.   Serving as evidence of this paradigm shift is the =
recent "rebalancing" of the NASDAQ 100. Thirteen companies were booted off;=
 all of them technology. Of the thirteen newly added; eight of them are Bio=
Tech.   During the 10 year period between 1976 and 1985 the FDA approved ju=
st 198 new drugs. Last year alone, the number of new drug approvals skyrock=
eted to 160. That figure is expected to climb even higher in 2002. At prese=
nt, an astonishing 643 new pharmaceuticals are nearing the final stages of =
the FDA's testing and approval process according to a recent report prepare=
d for the US Government. Enormous returns are likely for investors in the r=
ight companies as some of these 643 new therapies come to market.     [IMAG=
E] Factors Fueling the BioTech Revolution [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  The chart of th=
e biotech index reveals a 53% climb to the upside from the September low to=
 the early December high. Stocks have given back ground recently as company=
 guidance for the immediate future is sobering. This "reality" correction o=
f the last three weeks has yielded a 50% retrenchment in the biotech index,=
 suggesting entry levels are becoming attractive again.   The BioTech revol=
ution is being fueled by many factors. Expedited FDA Approval procedures we=
re implemented during the Clinton Administration, reducing the average clin=
ical testing period from 15 years down to 5 years.   In addition, the recen=
t breakthroughs in Human Genome Mapping have provided bio-scientists with r=
evolutionary new tools to aid in identifying the underlying causes of disea=
se and help accelerate the pace of the development of potential cures. Comp=
anies like Human Genome Sciences (NASDAQ: HGSI) are providing bio-scientist=
s with exciting new tools to help speed the development of revolutionary tr=
eatments.   While it is estimated the FDA approval process requires an inve=
stment north of $150 million, the return on investment associated with a su=
ccessful new drug introduction is staggering. 40% to 50% of new drugs makin=
g it to Stage III clinical trials never get approved, but successful approv=
als can generate billions in profits for drug companies.   In other parts o=
f the world, barriers to entry are more relaxed for new drugs, causing incr=
eased competition, lower margins, and lower profits. Patent protection and =
stringent FDA requirements still keep the US pharmaceutical market position=
ed as the most coveted in the world.     [IMAGE] Potential Major Breakthrou=
ghs [IMAGE]  The following is a list of potential major breakthroughs for 2=
002:   ViroPharma (NASDAQ: VPHM): The Common Cold. ViroPharma is developing=
 Picovir, purported to be the magic cure for the common cold. The company s=
pecializes in novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases caused by RN=
A viruses. Such viruses are responsible for a host of common disorders, inc=
luding certain types of meningitis, hepatitis, and the common cold. Many an=
alysts feel an approval could be coming late this year for Picovir. Maxim P=
harmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MAXM): Cancer Therapy. The Company's lead drug cand=
idate, Ceplene?, is currently being tested in Phase 3 cancer clinical trial=
s in 12 countries for malignant melanoma and acute myelogenous leukemia, an=
d in Phase 2 trials for the treatment of hepatitis C and renal cell carcino=
ma. Medarex (NASDAQ: MEDX): Arthritis. Phase III trials were recently start=
ed on MDX-CD4, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. MDX-010 is currently u=
ndergoing several multi center Phase Phase I/II trials in prostate cancer, =
melanoma and other malignancies. Axcan Pharma (NASDAQ: AXCA): Ulcers and Ot=
her Stomach Problems. Axcan is a leading specialty pharmaceutical company w=
ithin the field of gastroenterology in North America and Europe. This compa=
ny posted fiscal year revenues of $104.5 million dollars and earnings of $1=
1.5 million. Helicide, Axcan's patented, oral, single capsule, triple thera=
py treatment for H. Pylori infection (the leading cause of peptic ulcers an=
d a potential cause of gastric cancer) should be FDA approved later this ye=
ar. DUSA Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: DUSA): Cancer Detection. The company's ma=
in product Levulan
 PDT/PD is a platform used for the detection and treatment of a variety of =
superficial conditions, such as early cancers, pre cancers and skin conditi=
ons. Levulan apparently has wider applications and may add to the bottom li=
ne in the not too distant future. DUSA initiated three Phase I/II Levulan P=
DT clinical trials.  As mentioned earlier, 160 new drugs were approved by t=
he FDA last year. There are currently 643 new drugs with a realistic chance=
 of success in the FDA pipeline. Companies will make staggering profits as =
many of these new therapies come to market, and investors in the right stoc=
ks will enjoy the ride.     [IMAGE] Upcoming OTC Journal Profile [IMAGE]  T=
he OTC Journal plans to focus a great deal of energy in the BioTech sector.=
 This sector is high risk/high reward, and therefore fits with our theme. B=
ioTech could replace computer technology as the boom group of the next deca=
de, and we intend to participate with ideas for our members.   In the near =
future the OTC Journal will release a profile on an exciting medical device=
 manufacturer that is benefiting from new drug therapies. The stock will op=
en for trading on the American Stock Exchange. It is going public through a=
n RTO, as described in our last edition . Therefore, all investors will be =
on equal ground once the stock begins trading. There will be no IPO stock a=
llocated to preferred institutional investors at a substantial discount pri=
or to the opening of trading.   The company is already generating significa=
nt revenues through one FDA approval, and another is imminent. Currently, t=
here are nearly thirty new drugs in the FDA pipeline that could potentially=
 benefit this company.   The company does not invest vast sums of capital i=
n the FDA approval process. Their pharmaceutical partners do it for them, w=
hich mitigates a great deal of the risk associated with this type of invest=
ment.   Early stage investors include some of the most high profile names o=
n Wall Street, seasoned industry experts, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.=
   Sound interesting? Stand by for Tuesday's edition for more details. The =
opportunity may come as soon as next Friday, January 25th, and you need to =
