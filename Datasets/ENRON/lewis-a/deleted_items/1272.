follows from EquityAlert.com.     Texas Instruments Introduces Inductor-les=
s Step-Down Charge Pumps for High Efficiency, Ease of Use in Battery-Operat=
ed Systems=1DDevices Offer Industry Leading Output Current Drive of 250mA  =
 DALLAS, Nov 19, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- A new family of step-down =
charge pumps from Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN) (TI) brings power efficienc=
y and ease of use to battery-operated systems and PC peripherals. With its =
high output drive and built-in protection features, the new charge pumps of=
fer savings in board space and system cost. Being the first step-down, or "=
buck", charge pumps introduced by TI, the new family of devices extends TI'=
s comprehensive portfolio of power-supply solutions for low-voltage applica=
tions including personal digital assistants and Internet audio players. (Se=
e power.ti.com/aap7037u ).   The new TPS6050x step-down charge pumps offer =
regulated output voltages ranging from 0.8 to 3.3 volts (V) in order to pow=
er low-voltage components in portable and bus-powered systems. The charge p=
umps take an input voltage range from 1.8V to 6.5V, enabling use with a var=
iety of battery types. Additionally, a low quiescent current of only 40 mic=
roamps (uA) allows for longer standby times. At 250 mA, the family provides=
 the highest output current in the industry and is capable of supporting mu=
ltiple components within a system. Finally, with the TPS6050x, only four sm=
all ceramic capacitors are required to build a complete high-efficiency cha=
rge pump power converter, thereby saving board space and cost.   "With the =
introduction of step-down charge pumps, TI expands its existing line of lin=
ear regulators and inductive step-down converters offering a more complete =
selection of voltage regulator solutions," said Guenter Sporer, systems eng=
ineering manager for Low Power DC-DC Converter Products at TI. "With low-vo=
ltage applications becoming more specialized, customers know that they can =
rely on TI for power supply solutions that meet their system requirements."=
   Efficiency and Ease of Use   The TPS6050x step-down charge pumps offer o=
perating efficiencies comparable to inductive buck converters, yet with the=
 ease of use that is customary with linear regulators. Peak efficiencies of=
 90 percent are achieved by utilizing a fractional conversion topology resu=
lting in lower power dissipation and eliminating the need for heat sinking.=
 Supporting system flexibility, the devices can be powered by three or four=
 nickel-cadmium (NiCad), nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) or alkaline batteries,=
 or by a single lithium-ion (Li-ion) cell.   Requiring few external capacit=
ors and no inductors, TPS6050x charge pumps simplify design and allow for a=
 complete converter to be built in only 0.155 square inches (in2). To preve=
nt current leakage and prolong battery life, the load is isolated from the =
battery during shutdown. Added protection features include a soft start to =
limit in-rush current, a Power Good output voltage supervisor, over-tempera=
ture and over-current protection.   Available Today   The TPS6050x step-dow=
n charge pumps are now available in a 10-pin MSOP package from TI and TI au=
thorized distributors. Suggested resale pricing is $1.35 each in quantities=
 of 1,000. An evaluation module (EVM) is available today to help simplify s=
ystem design and speed time to market. Regulated output voltages for the TP=
S6050x devices are as follows:   TPS60500   Adjustable 0.8V to 3.3 V      T=
PS60501   Fixed 3.3 V      TPS60502   Fixed 1.8 V      TPS60503   Fixed 1.5=
