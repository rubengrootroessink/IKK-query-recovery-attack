   Consumer Reports and Yahoo! Sign Premium Content Distribution Agreement=
=1DYahoo! Shopping Unveils Pay-Per-View Product Ratings and Free Buying Gui=
des from Consumer Reports(R) Consumer Reports Auto Buying Guides Available =
for Free at Yahoo! Autos   SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -=
- Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading enabler of Web transactions, and Con=
sumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports(R) magazine and ConsumerReports=
.org, today announced a premium content distribution agreement to distribut=
e Consumer Reports(R) unbiased and objective product ratings and buying gui=
des on the Yahoo! network. As part of the agreement, Yahoo! has integrated =
free buying guides and premium pay-per-view product ratings from Consumer R=
eports into Yahoo!(R) Shopping (http://shopping.yahoo.com). Additionally, Y=
ahoo! has integrated free Consumer Reports auto buying guides into Yahoo! A=
utos (http://autos.yahoo.com), marking the first time this content is avail=
able outside ConsumerReports.org. Yahoo! also will work with Consumer Repor=
ts (www.ConsumerReports.org) to integrate buying guides into other relevant=
 areas of the Yahoo! network. Under the terms of the agreement, Yahoo! will=
 receive an undisclosed share of revenue from sales of pay-per-view content=
 on its site.   "Our research shows that consumers demand trusted informati=
on and resources to help them make well-informed buying decisions," said Ro=
b Solomon, vice president and general manager of Yahoo! Shopping. "Consumer=
 Reports has established itself as one of the most popular and trusted fee-=
based sites on the Web, and we are happy to offer their content to our larg=
e audience of shoppers."   Available today, shoppers can view free Consumer=
 Reports buying guides on both Yahoo! Shopping and Yahoo! Autos. The free g=
uides contain general summaries of product categories, buying advice and in=
formation including product trends. Consumers also have the option to buy p=
ay-per-view product reports for only $2.95 per report, which includes acces=
s to the report for 30 days on Yahoo! Shopping. Each pay-per-view report pr=
ovides in-depth buying advice, performance ratings and information about ke=
y features and brand reliability on all the rated products in a category, s=
imilar to the information in Consumer Reports magazine. During the 30-day p=
eriod, users will have access to dynamic information as it is updated by Co=
nsumer Reports. Consumers can conveniently purchase these premium reports u=
sing Yahoo! Wallet, the most widely accepted wallet on the Web.   "This bus=
iness relationship with Yahoo! enables Consumer Reports to reach one of the=
 largest purchasing audiences on the Web," said John Sateja, vice president=
 of New Media at Consumers Union. "This relationship also gives Consumer Re=
ports the ability to extend our brand online, and develop new relationships=
 with consumers in addition to the more than 560,000 online subscribers we =
currently serve at our Web site -- ConsumerReports.org."   Making Better Bu=
ying Decisions  Consumer Reports has the most comprehensive auto-test progr=
am of any consumer publication in the United States. Unlike other publicati=
ons and Web sites, the magazine buys all the cars, trucks, and SUVs that it=
 tests in the retail market and typically evaluates the vehicles for severa=
l months. Experienced auto engineers conduct 46 individual tests, ranging f=
rom emergency handling, acceleration, and braking, to fuel economy and bump=
er-impact tests. Yahoo! Autos users can access Consumer Reports content on =
the best new and used cars of 2001, as well as reports on which used cars a=
re the safest, how to inspect a used car and warranty comparison informatio=
n. Yahoo! Autos will continue to expand current offerings to include Consum=
er Reports pay-per-view content in the near future.   Yahoo! Shopping has i=
ntegrated links to Consumer Reports content within relevant areas of the si=
te, so consumers can easily access guides and reports on products as they s=
hop. In addition, Yahoo! has created a centralized location where shoppers =
can peruse buying guides and premium product reports by category (http://sh=
opping.yahoo.com/consumerreports). The addition of Consumer Reports content=
 complements Yahoo! Shopping's existing features and programs designed to h=
elp consumers make better-informed purchases online.   About Consumer Repor=
