WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership=20

Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skillin=
g, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall Street =
Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO Andrew =
Fastow and several board members including external director Herbert Winoku=
r Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's partnership Chewco, na=
med for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco, which was supposed to be=
 completely independent, but was run and partly owned by Enron executive Mi=
chael Kopper, who also attended the meeting. Federal investigators and priv=
ate litigants are trying to find out who knew what about Chewco and when. A=

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued

Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and dece=
ive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of dolla=
rs, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School=
 in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was also fai=
lures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there was a funda=
mental default of leadership and management, starting with former CEO Ken L=
ay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As Congress begins a week=
 of hearings, the House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee als=
o heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers joined the Enron board to inv=
estigate events leading up to the company filing for bankruptcy on December=
 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report that found Enron fattened its profits=
 by almost $1 billion through a web of financial partnerships used to hide =
losses, while top managers made millions of dollars they should never have =
received. ! He laid some of the blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. P=
owers said former ex-Enron CFO Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, whi=
le former senior executive Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through=
 their involvement in off-the-books partnerships. Enrons board of directors=
 failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the=
 tragedy could and should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report =
was released, Lay canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and b=
efore the capital markets subcommittee.=20

AEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets=20

American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million power and=

nd away from household power supply. Like Reliant and Mirant, AEP is sellin=
g foreign assets to protect its credit ratings. Enrons bankruptcy has cause=
d many energy companies to slash capital spending and sell assets to lower =
debt. AEP has $2.6 billion in debt maturing in the next 2 years. Seeboard i=
s valued at about $2.1 billion and CitiPower at as much as $760 million. AE=
P, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout of C&SW, said will consi=
der all potential options for Seeboard. AEPs 4th quarter earnings fell 41% =
due to mild weather. It is selling common stock and convertible preferred s=
hares to raise cash and shore up its balance sheet. Last year, AEP sold Yor=
kshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power stations. AEP has also been ex=
panding it! s energy trading business after Enrons collapse. It bought Enro=
n's Scandinavian businesses and hired 22 coal traders from Enron. Seeboard =
is likely to fetch a good price since it is the only supply business for sa=
le in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de France and Scottish & Southern Energy ha=
ve been named as likely bidders for Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably=

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline

Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and storage =
depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray costs from=
 possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications. Last week,=
 Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review costs asso=
ciated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in April. Wil=
liams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter earnings re=
port. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams has been ment=
ioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold securities and =
cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid heavier scrutiny by=
 credit rating agencies following Enrons bankruptcy. Williams 7.5% coupon b=
onds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879 per $1,000 face value fro=
m $923 last week, with the spread above US Treasuries climbing to 330 basis=
 points from 285. None of the rating agencies has downgraded Williams debt =
yet, but S! ?has says it may lower Williams ratings because of concern abou=
t the company's finances. S?rates Williams BBB+, Moody's rates it Baa2 and =
Fitch rates it as BBB, all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete th=
e Midwest pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Willi=
ams Energy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ag=
o. It also  raised quarterly payment to unit holders by 12% to $0.59. The p=
ossible purchase of the Midwest pipeline could be financed through a combin=
ation of debt and equity, Williams Energy Partners said. The partnership ha=
s $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th quarter loss had wide=
ned and its banks have warned that the it may be in default of their credit=
 agreements. Williams stock dropped 13.9% yesterday, down 2.64 to 16.36.=20

Lay Makes Himself Scarce

A congressional committee trying to serve a subpoena on former Enron Chairm=
an Ken Lay can not seem to locate him. His personal attorney does not know =
where he is and would not accept the subpoena. The House of Representatives=
 Financial Services Committee finds the whole situation quiet puzzling. Lay=
's attorney says he is ill and has no idea where Lay is. Lay resigned from =
Enrons board yesterday as two congressional committees vowed to force him t=
o come before them to testify or take the 5th Amendment. He had been schedu=
led to appear before a House Financial Services subcommittee, but backed ou=
t over the weekend. It had hoped to compel him to appear today. Lay had als=
o been scheduled to appear before a Senate committee, but canceled that dat=
e also.=20

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is perha=
ps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to take th=
e short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer term trend=
 higher.  "When the March contract expired (January 29), it got as low as $=
1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the market was =
able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that advance worked =
well," noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.  "Today looks lik=
e a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not exceed Friday's hig=
h and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down to $1.97. I look for=
 a slow deteriorating front end of the board," he noted.  "I'm back in a be=
arish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00. I believe that there is a=
 99% probability the market will work lower, but it may take 3 months to do=
 it," he cautioned.  Other traders are more optimistic.  "Longer ter! m I'm=
 bullish," says John Beaver, President Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City=
.  "It's more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board, but lookin=
g at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap =
on the weekly chart between $2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week endin=
g January 18, and January 25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would =
be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher," he said.  A gap is=
 a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians. The idea is =
that the gap may act as a barrier to (in this case) further price advances.=
 Once the gap is "filled", however, a potential limitation to price advance=
s has been removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  "I don't =
have any interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't wan=
t to be in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry abou=
t it," he said.  "If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short=
 at $1.85! ? What is your board of directors going to say?"=20
