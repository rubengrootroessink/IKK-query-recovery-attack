   Ray Reaves, President and CEO of FieldPoint Petroleum, is sharpening his=
 pencil and putting on his poker face. Like a crazed bargain hunter heading=
 for the mall just after the Christmas Holiday, Ray is getting ready to go =
shopping.   [IMAGE]  Just as he has during past cyclical oil price declines=
, Ray knows he can purchase assets from the behemoths of the US Oil patch a=
t bargain basement prices for the next six months. Companies like Devon Ene=
rgy (AMEX: DVN) will eliminate producing properties which were profitable a=
t $25 per barrel, but not at $18. Ray runs a lean and mean company which ma=
kes money through all the market cycles, and he perceives an upcoming oppor=
tunity to enhance his asset base.   The editors of the SmallCapDigest feel =
this stocks is poised for a short term move to at least $2.50, which would =
represent 31% return on invested capital. Investors with a 12 to 18 month h=
orizon have the potential for a $5 plus with the next cycle of surging oil =
prices. As oil prices drop, Ray Reaves is getting ready to add assets to Fi=
eldPoint.   The SmallCap Digest has discovered a growth company in the oil =
and gas sector that is poised to surge. FieldPoint Petroleum (OTC BB: FPPC)=
 has taken much of the guessing out of investing in this sector. The compan=
y has executed and excelled in every market environment. FieldPoint has sho=
wn a propensity to maintain profitability and grow revenues at very impress=
ive levels by making the right decisions. The company business is hedged in=
 such a way that it has and will continue to make money regardless of commo=
dity prices.   [IMAGE]  November Focus Company Report: FieldPoint Petroleum=

t Petroleum Corporation (OTC BB: FPPC) is engaged in the acquisition, opera=
tion and development of oil and gas properties, which are located in Oklaho=
ma, Texas and Wyoming. FieldPoint looks to continue expanding in Texas and =
Wyoming, as well as in other Rocky Mountain and mid-continent states such a=
s Montana, North Dakota and Oklahoma. It is a primary objective of the Comp=
any to operate most of the oil and gas properties in which it has an econom=
ic interest.   Company Analysis   FieldPoint is regarded in the industry as=
 a nimble low cost provider. Unlike many of its' competitors, FieldPoint co=
nsistently generates positive cash flow, and has a history of acquiring pro=
perties far below market prices. Many poorly run oil and gas companies get =
themselves in a position where they must raise cash to survive. These distr=
ess sales allow FieldPoint to purchase these companies' properties at price=
s where the production from the land pays for the purchase itself. FieldPoi=
nt takes advantage of the competition through efficiency. The company's ste=
llar performance in the past has created confidence and tremendous leeway w=
ith financiers. FieldPoint has access to capital that will allow for growth=
 while most of its' competitors will experience contraction.  The company's=
 track record speaks for itself.  Below is the revenue growth FieldPoint ha=
s experienced in the past three years.    [IMAGE]  As depicted in the table=
, revenues grew 78% from '99 to '00, and are on track to grow 59% this year=
.   Growth has been so prolific that the company was recently recognized by=
 the Oil and Gas Journal as one of the Top 200 Independent Oil and Gas Prod=
ucers in the U.S., and the 8th fastest growing publicly traded Oil and Gas =
Company in the US.   The company currently has 50% of its monthly oil produ=
ction hedged at $22 per barrel, thereby virtually assuring continued positi=
ve cash flow.   Existing Properties       [IMAGE]  Chickasha Field, Grady C=
ounty, Oklahoma.  Giddings Field, Fayette County, Texas.  Big Muddy Field, =
Converse County, Wyoming.   Serbin Lee Field and Bastrop Counties, Texas.  =
 West Allen Field, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma.   Hutt Wilcox Field, McMullen=
 and Atascosa County, Texas.     FieldPoint currently currently has ownersh=
ip interest in 338 productive wells located in three states, Texas, Oklahom=
a, and Wyoming. FieldPoint intends to continue expansion in Texas and Wyomi=
ng, as well as in other Rocky Mountain and mid-continent states such as Mon=
tana, North Dakota and Oklahoma. Management is constantly keeping an eagle'=
s eye on potential properties that will increase FieldPoint's asset base.  =
 Plans For Growth   [IMAGE][IMAGE]  As depicted in the bar charts, growth i=
n both production and reserves has grown consistently since 1997. In 1996, =
FieldPoint had $1 million in booked assets from which they derived $640,000=
 in revenue and $115,000 in net income. The average price of oil in 1996 wa=
s approximately $18-$20 per barrel. In 1997, prior to going public, FieldPo=
int's results were slightly improved as the price of oil per barrel increas=
ed to an average of $19-$21, but their asset base held steady.   At the end=
 of 2000, FieldPoint completed another acquisition that boosted assets to $=
4.5 million, and through the third quarter assets stood at $4.8 million. In=
 the meantime, revenues have jumped from $1.6 last year and are projected a=
t $2.5 million this year. As a low cost producer, FieldPoint successfully i=
ncreases production and lowers operational expenses every time they make an=
 acquisition.   Over the course of the next 36-48 months the company hopes =
to accumulate over $50 million in assets. Past performance would indicate t=
his is not an unrealistic goal. That is a tenfold increase from where the c=
ompany's assets are today. For investors, the market capitalization of the =
company should reflect the increase in assets. A $50 million dollar asset b=
ase would value the company at approximately $42 million dollars or $5.75 p=
er share. That is an annualized gain of over 57% over a four year period.  =
  Market Conditions   A dispute between OPEC which produces about 40% of th=
e world's oil and non-OPEC oil producing countries have pushed prices to th=
eir lowest levels since mid-1999. Oil markets opened lower Thursday after t=
he Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided Wednesday not to c=
ut its output quotas unless non-OPEC producers agree to go along. Russian P=
rime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov is quoted by the Financial Times as saying "=
We are not going to at any time reduce production on a big scale; it's impo=
ssible".    With oil prices taking a nosedive, many poorly run and poorly f=
unded oil and gas companies will be feeling the squeeze. Lower oil prices w=
ill deal a blow to the oil and gas industry, resulting in less investment, =
reduced production and ultimately more volatility as supply and demand fluc=
tuate. This means FieldPoint will be privy to some very attractive opportun=
ities to purchase land at very favorable prices.    However, oil prices may=
 not stay depressed next year. OPEC says it will cut output on Jan. 1 only =
if non-OPEC producers act. So far, Oman and Mexico have pledged output cuts=
 -- of 50,000 barrels a day and 100,000 barrels a day, respectively -- and =
Norway, the world's third largest exporter, is still considering whether to=
 contribute. But all three countries say they will only reduce production i=
f Russia pledges to cut its output by some 300,000 barrels a day.   Conclus=
ion   FieldPoint is currently trading at $1.90 but in the near term has the=
 potential to reach $2.50 due to the sizable opportunities the company curr=
ently has to expand it's asset base at rock bottom prices. We expect the st=
ock to reach this target in the next 30 days. A target of $2.50 would mean =
a 31% short term profit. This doesn't match the company's growth rate but i=
t is certainly respectable, and much higher on an annualized basis.    Grow=
ing companies need to reinvest in themselves. The challenge is to make mone=
y while growing. FieldPoint applies the cardinal rule of business: MAKE MON=
EY. CEO Ray Reaves has demonstrated an uncanny ability to propel growth whi=
le running a profitable business. The goal of the company is to increase it=
s' asset base while maintaining profitability and providing shareholders a =
return on their money.    Over the course of the next 36-48 months the comp=
any expects to have over $50 million in assets. That is a tenfold increase =
from where the company's assets are today. If the company's past performanc=
e is any indication, it is an obtainable goal. For for investors, the marke=
t capitalization of the company should reflect the increase in assets. A $5=
0 million dollar asset base would value the company at approximately $42 mi=
llion dollars or $5.75 per share. That is an annualized gain of over 57% ov=
er a four year period.    FieldPoint is structured to take full advantage o=
f volatility because the company thrives on outsmarting its' competitors. T=
he company is a growth stock that has the full confidence of its' financier=
s.  This access to capital allows the company to increase its' assets while=
 benefiting when the market rebounds.    Investors looking for a well run o=
il and gas company that exhibits outstanding growth should own FieldPoint P=
etroleum Corporation (OTC BB: FPPC) in the risk end of their portfolio.=09
