Dear Investor,

Here's the biggest lie in technology today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the dark
about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A LOW-RISK
tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money by this time
next year--then make your fortune several times over in the
years to come.

IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this
stock, complete details and my full "buy instructions"--
absolutely FREE, without obligation of any kind.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm talking
about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic cable.

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed
down--very noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came
to a grinding halt!  That means there isn't enough capacity
or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip
in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about
this problem.  After all, this is the second time it's
happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed
the Internet to a crawl for two full days.

That means our communications systems--and therefore our
economy--are very, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to
the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of Americans even begin to
understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said
they're 60% loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound
too bad...until you understand how these networks operate.
You can't load a network much past 65%.  In fact, 70% is
virtually catastrophic--because the network spends so much
time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any time
actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes
to a standstill.  And business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber
glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has ever been
laid is "dark"--that is, it's not activated.  And the
company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of the
components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--
possibly a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully
expect to multiply our money five-times over by 2007.  In
fact, this stock truly has "ten-bagger" potential!

So get in on the action.  Click on the link below to get
the name of this stock in your special FREE report: Meet
the Powerbrokers of the Real Economy.  I think you'll find
this FREE offer well worth your while.  In 1999--the last
time tech stocks started from such depressed levels--my
clients earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert Financial
Digest.  And that earned us Hulbert's #1 RANKING for all
investment advisories!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly
20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government is
ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending into the
economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need
isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's a question
of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT
on.  This "ten-bagger" has a long ways to run--but it's
already UP 51% since October 1st, in recognition of this
company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this--data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network running at
63% of capacity needs to double its load by this time next
year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to get your
special FREE report now.
