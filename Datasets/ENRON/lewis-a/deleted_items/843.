Email Bloopers

Using email for prospecting and customer acquisition is
more difficult than ever. With the volume of messages
increasing at an unprecedented rate, you've got stiff
competition for the reader's attention. What's the
solution? Debbie will tell you (after a bit of venting).

Online Advertising: Bouncing Back

It has been a tough year so far. It wasn't long ago when
everyone knew a millionaire; now you know at least three
people who have been laid off. For many, exuberance has
given way to insecurity. But the industry is responding in
the right way -- with innovation, not retreat.

The Plot Thickens

Storytelling is a sophisticated art form, practiced by many
and mastered by few. But do today's masters have the skills
to tell the story when it becomes nonlinear and
interactive? Perhaps. Or it might take an entirely
different skill set. But that chapter has yet to be written.

Can Portals Resist the Dark Side?

Quicker, easier, more seductive is the Dark Side. But
resistance is not futile. If we want to explore the new
worlds of the Web, seek out new search results, to go not
only where paid placements take us, then the Force will be
with us. And we will live long and prosper.

Don't Give Away the Store

Our job as marketers isn't to create value by persuading
people to buy our products. It's to create value by
persuading people to pay a higher price for them -- and be
happier as a result.
