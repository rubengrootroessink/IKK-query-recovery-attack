uityAlert.com.     New TI Chipset Leverages OMAP(TM) 710 GSM/GPRS System-on=
-a-Chip for Next-Generation Wireless Data and Voice=1DTI Delivers Industry'=
s Most Complete Smart Phone Chipset Reference Design   DALLAS, Oct 24, 2001=
 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- The broad market availability of 2.5G mobile sm=
art phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) will receive a significan=
t boost today, thanks to a new highly-integrated chipset offering from Texa=
s Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) (TI) that delivers voice and enhance=
d data. The new chipset provides wireless device manufacturers with a compl=
ete "antenna-to-applications" solution and reference design for enabling op=
timal performance and power savings for 2.5G mobile devices. TI's OMAP(TM) =
platform technology lies at the heart of the chipset and is the first proce=
ssor to integrate a GSM/GPRS modem and a dedicated applications processor o=
n a single chip that supports next-generation, bandwidth-intensive wireless=
 applications. (See http://www.ti.com/sc/TCS2500 )   The programmable digit=
al signal processor (DSP)-based TCS2500 chipset leverages the OMAP710 proce=
ssor to enable services such as multimedia messaging, short video clip and =
Internet audio downloads, e-mail, real-time Web browsing and games. Buildin=
g on the benefits of TI's TCS2100 GPRS chipset announced in June 2001, the =
new TCS2500 chipset combines the OMAP710 processor with TI's leading analog=
 baseband and RF technology to offer a comprehensive silicon and software o=
ffering. Tailored specifically for 2.5G smart phone and PDA devices, the TC=
S2500 chipset adds to TI's growing family of GPRS solutions.   "The TCS2500=
 chipset is an integral part of TI's strategy to provide powerfully integra=
ted solutions that speed time-to-market for our OEM customers," said Jean-L=
uc Villevieille, general manager of TI's wireless chipset solutions. "With =
the TCS2500 offerings, wireless designers will benefit from TI's 10 years o=
f wireless expertise plus our OMAP platform, which has already been selecte=
d by a wide variety of manufacturers as the de facto standard for 2.5 and 3=
G devices."   TI Chipsets Provide Significant Advantages for Wireless Indus=
try   Wireless device manufacturers can significantly reduce cost and form =
factors over current smart phones and PDA implementations due to the integr=
ation in the TCS2500 chipset. At the same time, the chipset allows new syst=
ems to maintain low power and performance comparable to today's voice- cent=
ric 2G wireless phones. Also important for wireless device manufacturers, T=
I's TCS2500 solutions includes the key building blocks for quickly and easi=
ly developing 2.5G devices: a GSM/GPRS digital baseband processor, which in=
cludes dedicated applications functionality, analog baseband and RF compani=
on chips, plus complete software solutions including protocol stacks.   At =
the core of the solution is TI's OMAP710 processor that incorporates a DSP-=
based GSM/GPRS digital baseband engine and an ARM9 microprocessor with inte=
grated MMU and cache for complete modem and applications support. As part o=
f TI's OMAP family of flexible, open processors, the OMAP710 features full =
support of advanced mobile operating systems such as Microsoft's Windows CE=
, PalmOS, Symbian OS and Linux(R). In addition, the OMAP710 provides Java p=
rogramming support and gives wireless device manufacturers access to a netw=
ork of application developers who are actively creating applications for th=
e OMAP platform.   The OMAP710 processor is code compatible with TI's OMAP1=
510 processor and other future OMAP wireless products. This allows designer=
s building products on one processor to quickly and easily port code to ano=
ther, saving significant engineering resources for manufacturers.   Other d=
evices in the TCS2500 chipset include the TWL3012 analog baseband and the T=
RF6150 RF IC. The TWL3012 combines voiceband and baseband codecs with singl=
e and multi-slot IQ RF interfaces, and auxiliary RF converters into a highl=
y integrated device. The TRF6150 is a highly integrated RF IC based on an a=
dvanced direct conversion architecture, yielding bill of materials (BOM) re=
ductions of about 30 percent versus competitive super heterodyne architectu=
res.   Complete 2.5G Wireless Smart Phone Reference Design Reduces Time to =
Market   The TCS2500 chipset includes a full array of software development =
tools as well as a complete OMAP710-based reference design that together ca=
n reduce development time by more than half a year. The reference design in=
cludes the complete BOM, board design and layout, a fully type-approved ref=
erence design, best-in-class and worldwide customer support and access to a=
 complete GSM/GPRS Layer 1, 2 and 3 stack. The reference design is a comple=
te 2.5G wireless system solution that is ready to be manufactured and put i=
nto final plastics.   The TCS2500 chipset is sampling to customers today an=
d will begin shipping before the end of 2001.   Texas Instruments Incorpora=
