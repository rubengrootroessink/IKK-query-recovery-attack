THE WEEK/ The Evolution of Digital Design

"Why are PLD companies like Altera (ALTR) and Xilinx (XLNX) on our list
while ASIC companies like LSI Logic (LSI) are not? In electronic design,
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) connote high performance,
high density, and low cost for high-volume uses. Think DVD player.
Programmable logic devices (PLDs) connote flexibility, low performance,
and high cost for prototyping. Think latest Cisco (CSCO) router.
Continuous improvements in PLDs raise their performance and lower their
cost, increasing the uses for which PLDs and ASICs compete. ASIC vendors
are adding programmable logic to their chips. The PLD vendors are adding
"hard" macros. Are these businesses con-verging? Or are companies like
Altera and LSI Logic practicing "diworsification?" Altera, a PLD company,
is making chips that can't be changed, and LSI Logic, an ASIC company, is
making chips that can be changed. What strategy will dominate? We'll
develop the insight to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of
digital design from the introduction of integrated circuit building blocks
-- "IC macros."

"Each technology wave changes the designer's job. As Moore's law drives
more transistors onto the chip, the design process changes. The
productivity and the skills of the designers change. The level of
abstraction for the engineer changes. By level of abstraction, I mean the
units that are the building blocks for the translation of the written
specification into the physical hardware. In the early days of digital
design, the level of abstraction was the inverter and the AND gate.
Working with inverters and AND gates was simpler and quicker than
designing with individual transistors, resistors, capacitors, and other
"discrete" components. As I trace the evolution of digital design, I'll
point out changes in the design process, designer productivity,
engineering skills, level of abstraction, verification and debug methods,
and changes in the flexibility and capability of the end systems."

Tredennick and Brion Shimamoto. Posted this week for subscribers at

FRIDAY FEATURE/ Broadband or Bust

"In a recent survey, by a margin of 2 to 1, Internet dial-up users said
that lack of compelling applications, rather than price or availability,
kept them from upgrading to broadband."

"In times of national emergency, as with the horror of the terror assault
on New York and Washington, communications capacity is rapidly
overloaded... The vast potential of broadband optics is the best way to
obviate the need for such rationing."

Just a few tidbits from the new report "Broadband or Bust: Networking
Society to Accelerate Economic Growth" written by George Gilder and John
Wohlstetter. Posted, free of charge, and published by our good friends at
the Discovery Institute http://www.discovery.org/
~~~~~~~~~~
FRIDAY BONUS/ Rising Star

Just yesterday the Wall Street Journal had this to say about Bret
Schundler: "The most intriguing politician this election autumn is Bret
Schundler, the 43-year-old former Mayor of Jersey City." We happen to
agree. In the current issue of the American Spectator our own Bret Swanson
sat down with the rising star.

FRIDAY BONUS 2/ Weathering telecom's dark and stormy night

In this interview, McKinsey adviser and former FCC chairman Reed Hundt
probes the future of the telecommunications industry and discusses how
companies in it are reacting to deregulation and to their current travails
with high debt and sluggish revenues.

In-depth, insightful, lucid, and must reading if you are at all interested
in the future of the telecommunications industry.
Aren't we all? Published by The Mckinsey Quarterly at
