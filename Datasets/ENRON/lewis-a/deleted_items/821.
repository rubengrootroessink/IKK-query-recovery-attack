1.	Introduction

This summer's blockbuster movie season has really warmed
things up in the Leisure/film/distributing {.FDI} group on
the Big Chart.  In just one week, this group has surged from
a 0 percentile rank to a near-sizzling 79th percentile rank.
This is especially remarkable, as prior to its most recent
showing, a 19th percentile ranking was the highest it had
mustered, dating back to April 30th.  Other groups within
the Leisure/films sector have also done well as a result,
with the Leisure/film/entertainment {.FIL} group rising to
an 80th percentile rank, from a 63rd percentile rank just
three weeks ago.  Of course this sector continues to derive
its success from the Leisure/film/theaters {.FTH} group,
which has never charted a percentile rank lower than 98th
in past 11 weeks!

2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

The Retail/stores {.RET} group appears to headed for higher
percentile territory, climbing from a 42nd percentile rank
to a 74th percentile rank in only four weeks.  Accordingly,
the Retail/stores/apparel {.RAP} group has also warmed up,
moving from a 42nd to 86th percentile rank over the same period.


Textiles/producer {.TPR}, Publishing/graphic {.GRA}, and
Home/jewelry/silverware {.JSW}, are also groups which have
experienced a heating up.  TPR has surged from a 42nd to a
71st percentile rank in only a month, while GRA has soared
to a 81st ranking from the 7th percentile, within the same
time frame.  JSW has moved from a 43rd to a 68th percentile
rank in the past four weeks.

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

The Food/serving/restaurants {.FRS} group has endured a
severe chilling, falling from 93rd to 34th percentile rank in
only a month, a direct effect of the cooling U.S. economy, as
fewer consumers choose to dine out.

In a largely seasonal move, the Textiles/apparel/manufacturer
{.TAM} group plunged from a 99th percentile rank, to a
staggering 4th percentile rank in only a week.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

The Energy/Oil-gas refiner {.ORF}, as well as, the
Energy/Oil-gas retailer {.ORE} are two groups that continue
to remain red hot on the big chart.  With the summer driving
season upon the nation, these groups are likely to extend
their hot streak for, at minimum, the next three months, thus
warrant close monitoring.
