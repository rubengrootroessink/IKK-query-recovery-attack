Dear Andrew:

See How One Trader Average A Documented $42,704
Profit Per Month...

...For 3 Straight Years!

You can know when and where price will turn in every
market. Short-term and intra-day moves and turning points
can be pinpointed - absolutely!

Discover the price and time forces that propel and even
drive the market each trading day.

These forces are nothing less than amazing. There are
rhythmical, natural patterns that occur an astounding
85%-95% of the time in virtually every stock, currency,
bond and futures contract movement.

In other words, 85%-95% of the time we know where the
market is going . . . precisely. Trading with up to 90%
plus win rates - as you'll see inside - is no accident.

This secret - the secret to becoming a millionaire - lies
within a powerful and shocking new book.

These explosive insider secrets from George Angell unlock
the door to staggering profits, allowing you to cash in on
the most powerful moneymaking opportunity in existence.
