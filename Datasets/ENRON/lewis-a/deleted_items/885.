al Members:   Last week's Trading Alert on Petapeer Holdings (OTC BB: PETP)=
 was a failure. We hoped the unique news of the company's intention to file=
 a patent on its revenue generating technology would restore the stock to i=
ts previous high. Instead, the enhanced volume brought out sellers, and the=
 stock dropped. This demonstrates the importance of selling quickly when th=
ese stocks we feature in Trading Alerts go against us. You should have sold=
 the stock at $1.06 if you followed our advice, and gotten out with a small=
 but manageable loss. It's always preferable to be out wishing you were in,=
 rather than in wishing you were out.   In this edition we have a follow up=
 on XML technology in the news, and coverage on Energy Power's earnings ann=
ouncement which was issued yesterday.      [IMAGE] XML Global (OTC BB: XMLG=
) in Investor's Business Daily and Worth Magazine's Informative Article   L=
ate last year we were contacted by an associate in the computer industry wh=
o told us we needed to find a microcap stock with leading edge technology i=
n XML programming language. At the time we had no idea what XML was, but we=
 learned, loved it, and found a pure play in the microcap arena to cover.  =
 Information on the XML revolution is starting to appear in the main stream=
 financial media. Last Thursday's edition of the Investor's Business Daily =
contained an article which referenced our choice, XML Global Technologies (=
OTC BB: XMLG). Many thanks to the members who emailed us concerning our typ=
o in the weekend edition. We mistakenly printed the article was in the May =
12th edition. It was actually in the May 24th edition.   It's of no consequ=
ence as we have the article available for you in its entirety. Investors Bu=
siness Daily gave the company permission to post the article in PDF Format =
on its corporate web site. Simply click here  to go directly to it, or go X=
ML Global's investor relations section at their web site- Click Here  for t=
hat section.    In addition to the Investor's Business Daily article, June'=
s edition of Worth Magazine has a feature article entitled The XML Revoluti=
on. This article has an understandable explanation of XML- what it is, how =
it works, and how it will be used. This is a must read for anyone intereste=
d in the future of computer programming. Click Here  to read the article, o=
r go to the following URL: http://www.worth.com/content_articles/0601_xml_r=
evolution.html    XML Global Technologies has spent the last two years deve=
loping tools for programmers working on code for the XML revolution. We exp=
ect media attention to continue to grow in this arena, and hopefully we hav=
e identified an outstanding pure play for our members. Please read the arti=
cles and let us know if you agree. We are getting more excited as coverage =
of this new technology continues to accelerate.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Sy=
stems LTD (OTC BB: EYPSF) Announces 3rd Quarter Results   We believe there =
will be a bull market for North American energy related companies for the n=
ext two to five years. In the microcap arena, Energy Power Systems LTD is o=
ur contribution.   The company's market cap (only $18 million) leaves plent=
y of room for upside, and we are anticipating substantial growth in future =
quarters. New business will start to come out in the June and September qua=
rters, and their M&M Subsidiary is embarking on $5.5 million in new project=
s right now.   On Tuesday nine month financial performance was announced by=
 the company. Revenues were only up 9%, but the earnings turnaround was imp=
ressive. The company turned a small EBITDA profit of $100,000, but this com=
pares to a $1.3 million loss in year 2000. This is very positive news as st=
ocks generally trade on investor perception of the future, and this company=
 is definitely headed in the right direction.   Here is the complete text o=
f the press release for your review:     Tuesday June 5, 5:14 pm Eastern Ti=

BUSINESS WIRE)--June 5, 2001--Energy Power Systems Limited (``EPS'' or the =
``Company'') (NASD Bulletin Board: EYPSF) (CDNX: YPS - news; www.epsx.com) =
announces that it has issued unaudited consolidated financial statements fo=
r the nine month period ended March 31, 2001. These statements reflect the =
following activities of EPS and its subsidiaries:    consolidated revenues =
of $15.2 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2001 ($13.9 million -2=
000); consolidated gross profits of $1.5 million for the nine months ended =
March 31, 2001 ($2.3 - 2000); consolidated EBITDA of $0.1 million for the n=
ine months ended March 31, 2001 ($1.3 million negative EBITDA -2000); conso=
lidated loss from continuing operations of $0.5 million for the nine months=
 ended March 31, 2001 ($2.0 million - 2000); and consolidated basic and ful=
ly diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.13 ($.63 per sha=
re - 2000).   EPS's consolidated revenues of $15.2 million for the nine mon=
th period ending March 31, 2001 increased by 9% from the $13.9 million repo=
rted during the same period the previous year. Increased activity from the =
Company's Engineering and Offshore Division and new sources of revenue from=
 the Company's Oil and Gas Division that began operations February 1, 2001 =
contributed to this revenue growth.    Consolidated EBITDA of $100,000 for =
the nine-month period ending March 31, 2001 was positive versus consolidate=
d EBITDA of $(1.3) million reported for the previous nine-month period. The=
 consolidated EBITDA increase was largely due to the benefits of a corporat=
e restructuring initiated at the end of fiscal 2000 as well as the addition=
al cash flow from the introduction of the oil and gas division. ``It was ou=
r corporate objective at the end of last year to turn the Company cash flow=
 positive this fiscal year,'' stated Scott Hargreaves CFO, ``to achieve thi=
s we eliminated two non-core subsidiaries and created the Oil & Gas Divisio=
n. We are most pleased with the positive improvement in cash flow as EBITDA=
 increased $1.4 for the nine month period ending March 31, 2001.''    The E=
ngineering and Offshore Division is currently working on recently announced=
 contracts of $5.5 million of work to carry itself over the fourth quarter =
and beyond. Construction of the 'floating production, storage and offloadin=
g' platform for the White Rose Oil Field expected to get the go ahead late =
this summer could feed further growth for the Engineering and Offshore Divi=
sion in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001. In addition the Oil and Gas=
 Division is adding positive cash flow to help fund corporate operations an=
d future exploration and acquisition strategies. At present the Company is =
planning its summer exploration, drilling and development program to increa=
se production and oil & gas reserves.    EPS is an Independent Power Projec=
t Developer, an Oil and Gas exploration company and a Contractor of infrast=
