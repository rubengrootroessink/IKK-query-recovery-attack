Cool, thanks Andy.  I'll see you there tomorrow night.  Just came back from
lunch with your honey.  She looked fabulous today (as usual).  =)

     Head East on Memorial Drive
     After passing Memorial Park, take a left onto Westcott Street
     Take a right onto Blossom Street (I think it is the fourth right)
     Take a left onto Reinerman Street (It is approximately eight blocks
from Wescott)
     Their address is 709 Reinerman (Their are 3 townhomes on the corner of
Reinerman and Floyd, they are the middle townhome)

     See you there,

   Hi Andy,

   I'm sorry I missed your call last night.  Yes, Mike and I will be there
   on
   Friday at around 7 or 7:30pm.  Please let me know if I need to bring
   along
   anything.  You know I can't cook, but I'll bring along candles, cake,
   dessert, or a bottle of wine if you want me to.  Just let me know.
   Would
   you also give me direction to Trang's house, please?  Say going there
   from
   my apartment at San Felipe and Fountainview.  Thanks a lot and I'll talk
   to
   you more later.
