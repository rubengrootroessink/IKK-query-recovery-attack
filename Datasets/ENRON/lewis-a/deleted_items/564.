Lazy Traders,

In the last 5 trading days the Nasdaq has been up 4 out of 5 days, so
trading is great, even if you just go with the flow.

Today as I am looking at the market, 4 stocks are up between 28% and 300%.

The stocks are:

WEFNW  up 300%
TDDD   up  79%
MAGZ   up  50%
INAP   up  28%

Would you have been able to capture any of these increases if you had:

1. Fast execution speed, get in in less than one second.
2. Could see in real-time how many buyers and sellers there were.
3. Were alerted in real-time the exact second WHEN the stock was buyable.
4. Would only have to pay $1 to trade 100 shares. How much are you paying
now?

Well, if you become a Lazy DayTrader at:
http://www.lazytrader.com

you can learn how and when to capture part of these increases as they
happen.

After you become a Lazy DayTrader you can join Michael's Chatroom for a
small monthly fee; Michael's Room has produced more than 1000% profit for
its members in the last 6 months and 40 to 70% profit weeks are not
unusual.

So if you have an hour or more to spare per day between 7.45 AM and 8 PM
EST and are careful to trade only when the opportunity is perfect become a
Lazy DayTrader at:

http://www.lazytrader.com

and join Michael's Chatroom as well.

Michael's Room buzzes your computer when there is a buy and an Icon
appears on your screen with the Stock Symbol.

You can start with as low as $500.-

Have a nice day.

*1130% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 12 weeks if
you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would
have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in
the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
