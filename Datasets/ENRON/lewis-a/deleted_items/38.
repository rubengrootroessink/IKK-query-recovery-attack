 Patriots Win But The Markets Lose!   [IMAGE]This week investors will be he=
aring about how the markets are doomed.   The 14 point underdog New England=
 Patriots upset the St. Louis Rams which was said to have had the greatest =
offense in history.  What does the Super Bowl have to do with your portfoli=
o?    According to the Super Bowl Predictor theory, if an NFC team wins the=
 Super Bowl then the markets go up for the year.  If the AFC wins then the =
market drops.  (Team from the old NFL ala Baltimore Ravens (Old Cleveland B=
rowns) are categorized as an NFC team)   Before you laugh at the notion of =
a football game determining the markets, there is some hard data backing up=
 the theory.  The indicator has been correct 29 out of the last 35 tries.  =
Being right 82% of the time is nothing to snicker.  However, in the past fe=
w years the indicator has failed miserably.  In 98 and 99 the AFC Denver Br=
oncos repeated as champions and the markets were supposed to have been claw=
ed by the bears.  Instead, investors saw the most stunning gains in history=
 as the Nasdaq hit 5,000 and the Dow Jones topped 10,000.   In 00 and 01 wh=
en the Rams and Ravens won their Super Bowls respectively the markets saw a=
 brutal decline which seemed to send investors in to a tail spin.   Take a =
deep breath before you decide to take all of your money out of the market a=
nd purchase some safe 2% yielding CDs.  The stock market has been a differe=
nt animal the past four years and 2002 looks to be no exception.  We are no=
w in a market of stocks where individual companies have been outperforming =
the overall market significantly.    Remember, it is always very important =
to diversify your portfolio with companies in different sectors and market =
caps.    This brings us to what could be the "Tom Brady MVP" company of the=
 year.  For those of you football neophytes, Tom Brady is the 24 year old q=
uarterback extraordinaire who piloted the Patriots to victory.    Our next =
profile will be occurring this week but we do not have the precise time whe=
n the new issue is trading.  The company will be completing a reverse merge=
r and opened for trading this week.  We will be sending out an alert to our=
 subscribers the moment the stock begins trading.  However, for the fastest=
 way to find out when the company opens for trading is by visiting our home=
 page where you will find a real time alert.   Here's to dispelling the Sup=
