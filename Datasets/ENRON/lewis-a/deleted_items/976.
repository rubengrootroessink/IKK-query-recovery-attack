Dear Investor,

I've written you several times since September 11th --
urging you to keep things in perspective.

Urging you to invest in great companies at these
depressed levels.  Urging you to believe in America's
future.  And urging you to join my investing advisory
to grab your full share of the immense profits ahead.

SO FAR, I haven't heard back from you.  I hope you're
in the market.  Most of all, I hope you own the stocks
we do -- stocks posting explosive gains now...with huge
profits still ahead.

The market is in clear RALLY mode.  There is virtually
no way it couldn't be.  Not from such oversold levels.
Not with interest rates near zero.  Not with more tax
cuts coming.  Not with easy money and a $100 billion
stimulus package.

So far in October, the Dow is up 8%...the NASDAQ is up
18%...and my entire POWERHOUSE portfolio (that's every
single stock I recommend, not some made-up "best of"
list!) is UP 27%.  How about you?  Are you making
money like this -- right now -- or are you missing
out???

Take a look at some of the stocks my clients and I own
-- and how well they're doing RIGHT NOW:

*Analysts are jumping back on the cell phone
bandwagon.  Why?  New personal security issues;
soaring sales in China; and a generational shift in
technologies.  Powerhouse Nokia is UP 38% in October
so far.

 *Chip-makers that power sophisticated communications
devices are hot now, too.  Our LSI Logic is UP 51% in
October.

*And that's a boon for KLA Tencor, which provides
critical in-line testing equipment that keep small
mistakes from costing millions for chip-makers.  The
stock?  UP 40% since the beginning of October.

*Security is a HUGE issue now.  And many of the
answers that will make our lives and businesses more
secure are technology-based.  Security POWERHOUSE
Check Point Systems is UP 46% in October.

*What's more, this rally is exceptionally broad.  An
example -- even the enterprise software sector is
booming.  Since the beginning of October, our stake in
Peoplesoft has SOARED 71%!

Get the picture?  If you're sitting on the sidelines,
you're missing out!

DO YOU REMEMBER 1998?  After Russia's financial
crisis, the market nose-dived.  That's the last time
TECH'S POWERHOUSES were priced this cheaply.  Earnings
were lousy then.  But growth returned -- like I'm
already seeing signs of growth returning now.

What happened then?  In 1999 my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING
clients earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert
Financial Digest.

Join me at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING now, and I'll explain
exactly what to do:

*Which industries -- from high-tech and biotech --
will rebound most quickly,

*Which companies dominate those industries NOW.  A
crucial point, because many people -- unwittingly --
are investing in the wrong stocks,

*And what to pay when you buy.  My "buy under" prices
protect you from chasing after stocks and assure
BIGGER PROFITS.

BIGGER PROFITS!  Isn't that what investing is supposed
to be all about?

TRY my advisory RISK-FREE for six full months.  Don't
like what you see...don't make the profits you want,
just cancel, and your subscription doesn't cost you a
dime.   That's reason enough to give it a try.
Because if I'm right -- and I'm staking my reputation
and my own money on this call -- you can make 75% to
100% or more in the next twelve months...and a small
fortune over the next couple years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

Sincerely,

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  In many ways, today reminds me of the aftermath
of The Panic of 1998 -that was the last time
POWERHOUSE technology companies were knocked this low
by crisis.  We piled in during that moment of
"irrational pessimism," and our holdings soared 157%
in 1999, as verified by The Hulbert Financial Digest.
While I'm not looking for an exact repeat performance
in 2002, I do expect to earn 75% to 100% GAINS over
the next twelve months.  Unfortunately, most investors
will miss out.

Don't you miss out.  Go here now:
