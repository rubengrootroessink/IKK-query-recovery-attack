CRS Robotics Corporation (TSE:ROB.)

One of our picks for a double has been the steady CRS Robotics
(ROB). The company has had rather good growth as evidenced by
their last Q3 report which showed sales of $7,687,000 compared
with $4,701,000 in the similar quarter last year. Net income before
amortization of goodwill was $295,000 compared to $252,000.
Earnings per share before amortization of goodwill increased to
$0.03 from $0.02.

All in all, not a bad showing for this global manufacturer of laboratory
automation technology solutions. For the first nine months of this
year (ROB) has shown a 68 per cent increase in sales by generating
$21,582,000 and a 131 per cent jump in net income of $1,006,000
prior to goodwill amortization compared to a year earlier.

Ralph Steedman, the President and CEO of the company stated that
"Despite the general economic downturn, we continue to outperform
as a result of accelerated pharmaceutical research and development
worldwide."

In fact, projected industry growth is pegged at 15% whereas ROB's
growth has been 22%.

Despite this warm and fuzzy Q3 report, ROB has not exactly been
a stellar performer in the market, certainly not bad compared with
most small caps but, we are after all, looking for a double. So what
does the future hold?

In January of 2002, the company will launch their new Dimension4
(TM) product with all the prerequisite industry hype needed to make
a big splash in the industry.

The Dimension4 is being touted as a radically new lab automation
technology that will take lab automation to a new level. The big
selling feature is that it will increase productivity in labs by a factor
of 4 according to Steedman when interviewed by ROBTV. (See the
company website www.crsrobotics.com

The big question remains, what will this do for the bottom line?
Steedman skated around that topic rather smoothly in his ROBTV
interview but would only comment that sales would commence
in Q2 of 2002 which would start a building year and 2003 would
probably be a big year.

We continue to view ROB as a good pick for growth.

Global Investment Financial Group (GIG,CDNX)

Revenue Sources Ramping Up

Global Investment Financial Group (GIG) is moving forward with
its primary objective of turning on their revenue streams.

Since my Special Report, a regional Licensee came on board
in the Province of British Columbia. These licensees will be
granted exclusive rights, within the licensed region, to develop
a successful and ongoing business utilizing the Company's
infrastructure. The Licensee will receive a pro-rata share of
the revenue generated from the active profiles, directory
listings, transaction fees, internet services, education
courses, newsletters, and other products within their area.

The fee for the British Columbia license was $66,000 which is
a welcome cash injection to help sustain the company while
other revenue sources come online. (see below)

More regional licenses will be offered in other Canadian regions
as well as in the US. Currently the Ontario region is under
negotiation which would garner $190,000 for GIG, hopefully
within the next few weeks.

All told, the licensing program could bring in $7.5 million CDN.

**Site Development**

The communication module is now active which features a private
mail system, community board, and an investor relations board.
More bells and whistles will be added regularly.

Also check Commerce Place where an active Profile system
for Members and Financial Advisors is now operating. The Media,
Financial, and Education Centers are also near completion.
Watch for an announcements to come out soon on those fronts.

For those investors who want to monitor this company as a
potential investment or others who want to get in on the
bottom floor of what some describe as the next internet
wave, you can become members of this fledgling organization
by registering at www.investment.com

Check the site our every few days for the latest features as
posted on the "what's new" section.

Once the active profiles are all activated, the billing system
will be launched sometime in December. At that time, more
online revenue streams will be activated.

The Magazines are also ramping up providing added revenue.

Global Investment Group has re-launched the "Planning for
Profits" magazine. The cover story features an exclusive
interview with Mexican President Vincente Fox. Planning for
Profits will be distributed at the end of November and will
be made available online to Investment.com members at
the Media Centre.
