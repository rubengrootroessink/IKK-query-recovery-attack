Tests Only an Internet Marketer Could Love

Why not break away from the tried-and-true and instead test
some other potential response boosters out there that are
both specific to and take advantage of the best that the
Internet has to offer?

GRPs, TRPs, Reach, and Frequency... Oh My!

A Copernican worldview is emerging, disrupting our page-
view- and click-through-centric world. So what shape is
this undoing of the old "new" view of online media currency
going to take? Odd that something "revolutionary" might
actually be a turning back...

Brand Version 1.1

Just as manufacturers change toys and games to satisfy
evolving play preferences, brands must also keep pace with
social evolution if they are to preserve their relevance in
the marketplace.

Set Your Sites on Providing Information

Not every interaction with a potential customer is about
making a sale. Sometimes -- and more often than we think --
facilitating the process of helping the consumer become
more informed is far more important.
