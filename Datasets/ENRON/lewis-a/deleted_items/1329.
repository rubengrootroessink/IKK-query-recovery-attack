LazyTraders,

Didn't I say the economy is improving?


""Frank,
We had 2 picks today. The first one was at 9:35AM, HAND- it was at $4.83 a
share and went to $6 a share within about 1 1/2 hours. THe next one was OCCF-
we called it at 10:15 at $1.70 it went to $1.80 in about 6 minutes. About 25%
today! Not a bad day! Talk to you soon!

Michael aka ChatMaster""

*840% profit is the maximum you could have made in the last 10 weeks if you
would have bought Michael's Stockpicks when he called them and you would have
sold at the high for the day. To be able to sell at the high for the day
consistently is not realistic.
The risk factor is high in stock trading and  only "Risk Capital" or
"Risk
Funds" should be used in such trading. A person who does not have extra
Risk
Capital, or Risk Funds, that they can afford to lose, should not trade in the
market. No "SAFE" trading system has ever been devised, and no one
including us
can guarantee profits or freedom from loss. We are not brokers or stock
advisors.
