The holiday season is officially upon us, and we know how frantic life in the
City can become this time of year. With that in mind, we thought you might
like to know about some chamber music concert coming up in the next couple of
weeks -- the perfect escape from the pressures of the season.

The FINE ARTS QUARTET will perform two different programs this weekend at
Bargemusic. On Saturday, November 24, the program includes works by
Mendelssohn and Bruckner; and on Sunday, November 25, works by R. Evans,
Dohnanyi and Mendelssohn.
