quityAlert.com.     Applied Micro Circuits Corporation Announces Stock Opti=
on Exchange Program   SAN DIEGO, Oct 18, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Ap=
plied Micro Circuits Corporation (Nasdaq: AMCC) today announced that it wil=
l be offering a voluntary stock option exchange program to its employees, o=
fficers and board members.   Under the program, which is expected to commen=
ce before the end of October 2001, participants will be able to tender for =
cancellation stock options that have an exercise price equal to or greater =
than $20 per share for replacement options to be issued on a date which is =
at least six months plus one day from the date of cancellation of the tende=
red options. The exercise price of the replacement options will be equal to=
 100 percent of the market price of AMCC stock on the grant date of these o=
ptions. The terms and conditions of the replacement options, including the =
vesting schedules, will be substantially the same as the terms and conditio=
ns of the cancelled options.   "Our most important assets are our employees=
. Equity, in the form of options, has been a major employee motivator and a=
s such, a significant contributor to our success in the past," Dave Rickey,=
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said. "In light of the decline in the=
 price of our common stock, we recognize that the exercise prices of the ma=
jority of outstanding options to purchase our common stock, whether or not =
they are currently exercisable, are higher than the price of our common sto=
ck. We believe these options are less valuable as an incentive to retain an=
d motivate employees. By making this offer to exchange options, we intend t=
o provide our employees with the benefit of holding options that over time =
may have a greater potential to increase in value, and thereby create bette=
r incentives for our employees to remain with us and contribute to the atta=
inment of our future business and financial objectives and the creation of =
value for all of our stockholders."   As of October 4, 2001, options to pur=
chase approximately 59 million shares of AMCC common stock were outstanding=
 under the Company's stock option programs. Options to purchase approximate=
ly 39 million of these shares are expected to be eligible for the program. =
