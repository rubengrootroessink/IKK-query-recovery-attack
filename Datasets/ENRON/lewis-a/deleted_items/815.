	Here is a deal you will not find anywhere else. Moguls' Mountain Passport allows you to travel where you want, when you want. Let's say you want to mountain bike in Crested Butte, but you don't want to spend a whole week there. No problem. Call ahead and reserve two of your nights in the Butte, then explore the rest of Colorado at your own pace. Head over to Aspen for the Snowmass Balloon Festival and then on to Vail for some world-class golf. What ever you want to do, wherever you want to go, it's all up to you. Rocky Mountain freedom!
<P>
How it all works: We have a wide selection of hotels and condos at several Rocky Mountain resorts throughout Colorado and Utah for you to choose from. You buy a block of room nights from your Moguls travel specialist.  We arrange your flights, rental car and your first night's lodging at your resort of choice. From there, it's all up to you. Having a great time and want to stay another night?  No sweat!  Ready to hit the road and try another resort? Just call to check room availability, make your reservation and you're off!  Everything is already paid for, so go where you want. If you need some help making reservations, feel free to give your Moguls agent a call.
<P>
Choose to stay in any of the following Colorado resorts, Aspen/Snowmass, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Crested Butte, Lake Dillon, Steamboat Springs, Telluride, Vail and Winter Park. As if that was not enough, you can even visit Park City, Utah. The type and quality of accommodation are also up to you.
<P>
Are you ready for a mountain of adventure? Give us a call today for more information or to sign up for your own Mountain Passport. 1-800-6 MOGULS (666-4857)
