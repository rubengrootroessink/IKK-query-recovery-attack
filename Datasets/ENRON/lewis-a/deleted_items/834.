   AMCC and Zarlink Semiconductor to Develop Complete 120 Gigabit Short-Rea=
ch Optical Solutions=1DVertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL)-Based=
 Solutions to Quadruple Capacity and Bandwidth Density of Optical Interconn=
ects   SAN DIEGO, Jun 5, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Cor=
p. (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) and Zarlink Semiconductor(TM) (formerly Mitel Semic=
onductor) today announced they are developing multi-channel, interoperable =
10 Gigabit per second (Gbps) per channel products that will offer customers=
 complete short-reach optical connectivity solutions for high-capacity, nex=
t-generation networking systems.   Zarlink will introduce 12-channel, VCSEL=
-based parallel fiber modules operating at 10 Gbps per channel, for an aggr=
egate bandwidth of 120 Gbps. AMCC will bring to market interoperable physic=
al layer, switch fabric, network processing and framer products. The intero=
perability of AMCC's components and Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel modules w=
ill enable optical systems vendors to quadruple equipment capacity, while r=
educing development cycles and time to market.   Zarlink expects the market=
 for very short-reach parallel fiber solutions used in and between high-cap=
acity network equipment to grow beyond US $1 billion within three years. Th=
e companies' new 10 Gbps parallel fiber products meet customer requirements=
 for lower cost and higher speeds by offering four times the bandwidth dens=
ity of today's 2.5 Gbps short-reach optical systems.   "This is the next st=
ep in our program to develop a family of very short-reach, high-capacity pa=
rallel fiber modules that deliver the industry's best price-performance rat=
io," said Claes Johansson, director of Zarlink's Optical Communications uni=
t. "Developing modules that transport data at 120 Gbps is made possible by =
continuing advances in our 10 Gbps VCSEL and patented packaging and manufac=
turing technologies."   Collaborative work on the new 10 Gbps products foll=
ows a successful joint program to develop short-reach optical solutions ope=
rating at 2.5 Gbps per channel. Zarlink's current generation of 4-, 8- and =
12-channel modules utilize AMCC's S7022 Quad VCSEL driver and S7025 Quad tr=
ansimpedance amplifier (TIA), with integrated limiting amplifier and Loss o=
f Signal (LOS) detection circuitry.   "We will continue to build on our suc=
cessful relationship with Zarlink for complete terabit connectivity solutio=
ns that complement our PHY, framer/mapper, network processor, and switch fa=
bric products for seamless distributed networking systems," said Paul Duran=
, AMCC's product marketing manager. "This compelling technology is an essen=
tial ingredient in the development of terabit networking systems that requi=
re the lowest cost and power dissipation per gigabit as well the highest ba=
ndwidth density per square inch."   Target applications for the new product=
s include proprietary interconnects in high-capacity scalable multi-chassis=
 routers, switches and optical cross-connects; and standardized interconnec=
ts between this type of equipment in central offices. For example, the comb=
ination of Zarlink's 10 Gbps per channel parallel fiber modules with AMCC's=
 PHY/framer products will enable a complete and cost-effective 40 Gbps tran=
sponder solution for Very Short Reach (VSR) OC-768, compliant with proposed=
 Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) standards.   About Zarlink Semiconduct=
or  Zarlink employs its formidable analog, digital and mixed-signal capabil=
ities to offer the most compelling products for wired, wireless and optical=
 connectivity markets and ultra low-power medical applications. Zarlink is =
trading as Mitel Corp. on the New York and Toronto stock exchanges under th=
e ticker symbol "MLT" until the new legal name of the company -- Zarlink Se=
miconductor Inc. -- is approved by shareholders. For more information, visi=
