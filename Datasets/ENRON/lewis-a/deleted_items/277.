<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Commodity futures sank ahead of the three-day weekend,
led by sharp falls in Silver, Gold, Grains and Exotics.
Stocks failed to recover from a rough week after IBM
and Microsoft gave gloomy outlooks on Friday.  True to
form, the Dollar stayed firm though FX traders expect
a correction shortly.  The approaching Martin Luther
King, Jr. holiday curbed activity, but didn't prevent
widespread declines that reached to Coffee and Cocoa,
while Sugar and Cotton also faded.  In Grains & Oilseeds,
Corn fell on a Spark's seedings report, South American
weather pushed Soybeans lower, and Wheat ended near its
weekly lows.  Sharply lower lease rates affected Silver,
while fund selling weighed on Gold.  Copper was lackluster.
Crude Oil rebounded from declines on Thursday, but not
too convincingly.  Short-covering boosted Cattle.

- Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator
