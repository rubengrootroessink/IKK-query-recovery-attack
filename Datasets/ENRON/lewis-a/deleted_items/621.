Dear Andrew:

Shocking, all new book reveals the most accurate and
profitable trading strategies I have ever seen - anywhere.
With 491 wins out of 494 trades since May 1995, this is a
virtual sure-thing-profit secret!

In fact, in over 26 years in futures and options, I have
never seen a trading system that came so close to virtually
guaranteeing profits, trade - after - trade.

Win on at least 9 out of every 10 Trades -
Absolutely Guaranteed!

Now I've seen hundreds of trading systems claiming huge
profits - and most just self-destruct when put to the test.
That's why I immediately began following this
strategy...way back when I first learned of it.

The results blew me away! Every trade - every last one -
has been profitable since. Take a look for yourself.

The phenomenal record was no pipe dream. Trade after trade,
it has proven to be the trading system of a lifetime.
