**** A FREE 30-DAY TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION to Erlanger 
Squeeze Play, PLUS bonuses, altogether worth $227! 
Learn why the biggest names on Wall Street follow 
Phil Erlanger's buy and sell recommendations ****http://www.erlangersqueezeplay.com/subscribe/trial3.html?x=gabrielle 
Dear Investor,
Have you ever wondered whom the "experts" on 
Wall Street or even investment newsletter editors 
listen to when they're investing for themselves?
The truth is that most "investment gurus" would 
rather walk on a bed of red-hot coals than admit 
that any of their competitors or even friends 
are good at what they do, much less be big enough 
to admit that they're taking advice from them.
You know the game. They want you to believe they're 
the only "guru" on the face of the earth that you 
can trust for solid investing advice.
Meanwhile, many of Wall Street's most powerful and 
mega-rich insiders including:
*  Peter Lynch of Fidelity Investments
*  Jeff Vinik, former manager of Fidelity Magellan
*  More than 100 top fund companies, collectively 
Managing over 1 trillion dollars?http://www.erlangersqueezeplay.com/subscribe/trial3.html?x=gabrielle 
...have been glued to the buy/sell recommendations 
of one amazing man  -- Phil Erlanger. They follow 
his advice because he has a reputation of being a 
genius.
Phil Erlanger is a mathematical computer whiz who 
has developed a scientific method of pinpointing 
investor sentiment that allows him to tell whether 
a stock is going to go up or down with an incredible 
degree of mathematical certainty -- many say it's 
almost "supernatural." This is the reason Phil 
Erlanger has been highly regarded as the top-secret 
weapon for the biggest insiders on Wall Street.
Because Phil's newsletter wasn't available to 
investors like you (until now), many of those big 
shots on Wall Street been able to side-step the 
"from whom do you take investment advice" question. 
Even more relevant,
Phil's newsletter and the price tag of his service 
-- $30,000 -- made subscribing impossible for most 
of our subscribers. Wall Street can't keep their 
"secret weapon" secret any longer.
Phil Erlanger is making his groundbreaking, 
scientifically-precise method of investing available 
to investors for the first time for just $295 a year, 
or $29.95 per month. As one investment newsletter 
familiar with Phil Erlanger and his newsletter 
recently said:
"I hate to admit it, but Phil's newsletter is AMAZING, 
and any investor who doesn't subscribe to Erlanger 
Squeeze Play is missing out. Anyone with a brain 
should subscribe immediately."
Now you can through this limited offer. Try Erlanger 
Squeeze Play FREE for 30 days. But that's not all! 
Counting the 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION and the 
bonuses we'll send you, this offer is worth over
$227!
It's an amazing opportunity that we think few other
financial publications would have the guts to offer. 
Phil's so convinced that once you've enjoyed a trial 
subscription and have read Phil Erlanger's special 
reports, you'll do back flips and love his newsletter 
-- you'll want to be a subscriber for life.
How can you argue with a FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION plus 
bonuses
altogether worth $227?
We're thrilled to introduce you to Phil Erlanger, and 
happy to offer you this trial subscription and bonuses 
-- worth $227!
Erlanger Squeeze Play tells you when to buy and when 
sell.
Every month, by e-mail, you'll receive a monthly issue, 
then throughout the month you'll also receive special 
Squeeze Alerts. These are urgent buy and sell 
recommendations as well as updates and comments from 
Phil Erlanger himself -- from his mind to yours in a 
matter of minutes.
You'll get the kind of edge that Wall Street's most 
successful and powerful insiders plop down $30,000 a 
year to receive. They're happy to pay, because his 
recommendations virtually guarantee success.
Phil goes through a time-consuming, mathematical 
ordeal every day to make you rich
Every day, Phil Erlanger uses his revolutionary 
computer programs to sift through 6,000 stocks and 
dozens of stock indexes, searching for the 
opportunities that will make you wealthy. It's an 
enormous task: the variables are staggering, and 
the numbers are constantly moving. It's like trying
to hit a moving target traveling at 500 miles per hour.
Make no mistake about it; his computers go through a 
time-consuming, computational ordeal every day. For 
even the most advanced investor or sophisticated 
technical analyst, recreating this data would be 
impossible. But incredibly, Phil has done it. We've 
seen his recommendations deliver a string of profits 
including 75%, 89%, 101%, even 431% in just the past 
several months. But these profits are just a tiny g
limpse of the profits he's been generating over the 
last 10 years.
Erlanger Squeeze Play is a serious, no-nonsense trading 
newsletter --it's not about glossy bonus reports on the 
top 3 stocks you should buy and hold for 12, 24, or 36 
months. Phil Erlanger doesn't work that way.
Phil's revolutionary scientific method of trading 
requires fast, fresh data and speed of light 
communications.http://www.erlangersqueezeplay.com/subscribe/trial3.html?x=gabrielle

There are just two perfectly reasonable catches to this 
Special 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION!
This 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is worth $227, but is 
yours free --ZERO COST! No smoke, no mirrors -- just TWO 
very reasonable catches:
First, this is a very limited offer. One 30-DAY FREE 
TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION per person, family, or address, etc. 
Trust me -- you'll only need 30 days to enjoy Erlanger 
Squeeze Play and see for yourself why so many of Wall 
Street's "experts" follow Phil Erlanger to generate 
huge profits.
Second, you must call Gabrielle at 1-888-570-2090 or 
1-561-750-7719 to sign up for this free offer, and 
you must provide us with a valid credit card and 
expiration date. After 30 days Erlanger's staff will 
automatically start billing your credit card $29.95 
a month for your subscription to Erlanger Squeeze 
Play until you tell them to stop.
The first 30 days are a gift to you -- a 30-DAY FREE 
TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION. Thereafter, you pay the normal 
monthly price. This monthly billing agreement 
guarantees that Phil Erlanger will show you healthy 
profits each month, or you can pull the plug on him 
at any time. If he doesn't do the job, he gets 
dumped. On the other hand, if he shows you the kinds 
of profits he's been delivering for Wall Street's 
insiders, you'll stay aboard.
That's what they call "singing for your supper"!
This offer is only valid for the next 72 hours. We 
begged Phil to extend this offer for a longer period, 
but he is just starting to make his publication 
available to private investors, and he wants to start 
off slowly. Up until now, his subscribers have been 
a small number of Wall Street's insiders. You're 
going to be among a precious, small group of private 
investors to receive his newsletter and his buy/sell 
recommendations.
Understand that during the next 30 days you will 
receive Erlanger
Squeeze Play absolutely FREE. No smoke, no mirrors. 
You will also receive two bonuses: Phil's special 
report, "How to Read the Crowd and Squeeze a Fortune 
Out of Wall Street," worth $99, and Phil's second 
bonus report, "How I Avoided the Big Tech Crash," 
worth $99, in which Phil lays out in detail the
methodology that allowed his clients to completely 
escape the disastrous Nasdaq crash from 5,000.
Only after your 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION is 
completed, your credit card will be charged $29.95
a month for your subscription to Erlanger Squeeze 
Play. Your subscription may be cancelled at any 
time, at which time this billing will be stopped.
Call Gabrielle at 1-888-570-2090 or 1-561-750-7719 
to accept this 30-DAY FREE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION - 
the gift of Erlanger Squeeze Play. You get his 
recommendations FREE for 30 days, and he gets a 
chance to show you how incredibly profitable 
Erlanger Squeeze Play is. What could be fairer?
