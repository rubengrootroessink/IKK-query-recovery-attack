Dear Trader,

Have you ever wondered what's the difference between a successful
commodities trader and a non-successful trader? The answer is not that
difficult, it's knowledge! Knowledge can be obtained several different ways.
One way, is the "school of hard knocks" which many people have honorary
degrees but no money.(I've been there, in case you are wondering) Another
way, a better way, is to find someone who knows how to trade and have that
person teach you. This is certainly a better, and less costly, choice.

My name is David Duty and I started trading over five years ago after I got
a brochure in the mail about trading commodities. It seemed interesting and
I got pretty excited about the possibilities. I ordered a course that
promised everything, but delivered almost nothing. I lost $10,000 in less
than 90 days, not to mention the $5,000 I threw away on these courses. I
quickly found out that I did not know what I was doing.

Then, I got mad, not at the man who sold me the almost worthless courses,
but at myself for jumping into something without knowing what I was doing. I
ask myself, "What's The Difference" between someone who trades, and
consistently makes money, and what I was doing. I found the answer pretty
simple. Like I said, it's knowledge. So, I took a year off and studied and
read everything I could lay my hands on. During this time, I found a lot of
good material and some that was so bad that the person who wrote them should
have been shot!

I started compiling information that I deemed to be reliable, that had
substance to it. What I found was a common thread among them. I started
formulating a trading plan and put that plan into action. This time, it was
completely different. I was trading and making money, and was only spending
about an hour a day at it, and some days, as little as 30 minutes.

I then had friends and relatives who saw what I was doing and they too
wanted to learn how to trade. So, I started teaching some of them how to
trade. Then, people they knew wanted to learn also, so I started teaching a
class at a local college and the rest is history.

I've written an in-depth 450 page course, designed to teach you how to
successfully trade commodities. I have students on every continent (yes,
that includes Antarctica) and in over 20 countries. I'm also doing seminars
around the world and having the time of my life doing it. My course has been
rated the #1 course on the market by my students, who collectively, have
bought probably every other course ever written.

I also have a "Mini-Course" which is almost 100 pages and I would like to
send it to you FREE. That's right, for free. No strings attached. This
Mini-Course", is the first three lessons in my full course, which like I
said, is 450 pages. This will give you a very good idea of what my full
course offers. Read it at your leisure and if you like it, and I think you
will, you can order the full course at my web-site. I've had many people
write me and tell me that they learned more from this Mini-Course than from
courses they paid several hundreds of dollars for.

I will also put you on my guest list for 30 days also. You will get ongoing
lessons, live chats, access to my student only forum, full access to my
web-site, market alerts, and market analysis. Again this is free! In
addition, if you would like to attend a seminar that I do, I'll give you a
25% discount to that as well.

To get a free copy of my Mini-Course, just click on this link,
http://www.davidduty.com/merchant/req_mini_course.htm
and you can instantly download it.

I hope you enjoy the Mini-Course and I look forward to having you as a
student or meeting you in person at one of my seminars. If you have any
questions, my e-mail address and phone number are below.  If you e-mail me,
I'll get back to you usually within a few hours.

Best wishes,
