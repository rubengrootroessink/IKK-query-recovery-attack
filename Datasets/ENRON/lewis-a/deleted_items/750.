Catch of the Day: This is not rocket science

Over the past few months, I've been indulging myself by
talking to people in the aerospace industry. What they've
been telling me I'm still having a hard time digesting. We
have been led to believe that the only way to get to space
is to spend billions of dollars doing so, and furthermore
that it is an environment in which you and I have no
business.

These two tenets ignore both psychology and economics. The
Dennis Tito incident shows that NASA fundamentally
misunderstands the draw and the power of putting real people
into space, as well as the entrepreneurial (risk-taking)
spirit these people have. And it does not cost billions to
get into space. Millions, perhaps, but this may be low
enough to make space tourism viable.

This is what XCOR Aerospace president Jeff Greason believes.
XCOR is developing low-cost rocket engines for suborbital
and low-earth-orbit manned vehicles. Amazingly, the company
is already in its third generation of development, it has
revenues, and it's gotten there on angel funding of only
$300,000.

There are people who want to ride spaceships, and there are
people who want to build them. And this market may have
bigger revenues, and smaller expenses, than most people
think.

Investor Center
PeopleSoft is a solid company that has completed a fantastic
turnaround in the last year. But the stock is now incredibly
expensive, proving that good companies aren't always smart
investments.

VC and Startups
New advertising or e-tailing ventures won't see much money
in 2001, but intermediaries and service companies could make
great returns for the brave souls who back them.
