Wall Street City's Stock Search of the Week

1.  Low Volume Stocks Coming Under Strong Buying Pressure

The September 11 attacks and the recent anthrax outbreaks
have pushed several thinly-traded stocks into the spotlight.
Traders who identified these stocks early in their breakouts
were able to benefit from substantial short-term percentile
gains, particularly since the stocks had already traded up
on extremely high levels of volume before the investment
media began to draw attention to the upward moves.  Thus the
importance of being to identify such moves early in the
breakout cannot be understated.

Low Volume Stocks Coming Under Strong Buying Pressure is a
search strategy that allows traders and investors to find
such stocks.  The strategy defines illiquid stocks as having
average volume of 5,000 to 250,000 shares per day.  Within
this universe, stocks are screened for upward price movement
on volume levels that are at least 50 percent greater than
average, with emphasis placed on those stocks with highest
levels of relative volume.  The results produce a list of
thinly-stocks that may be in the midst of significant upward
moves.

The search strategy is designed for those investors who are
looking for short-term trading opportunities and have a very
high tolerance for risk.  Because of the volatility inherent
in the search results, interested investors should consider
running the search strategy on an intraday basis.  Investors
