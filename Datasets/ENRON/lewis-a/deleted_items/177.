<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

The U.S. Dollar continued to claim the high ground in the
Currency markets after Alan Greenspan expressed greater
optimism about economic recovery.  Blue Chips also responded
positively, but not so Technologies which were affected by
poor earnings forecasts. In Commodity Futures, a gasoline
refinery outage Friday boosted the Energy complex helping
Crude Oil advance all five days of the week.  Gold and
Silver finished higher despite the Dollar's gains, while
Copper tripped on late selling after scoring new highs for
three consecutive sessions.  Cash market fundamentals took
Cattle and Hogs to their highest levels in about a month.
Forecasts of more Brazilian rain dented Soybeans, Corn
closed lower despite brisk export sales, but Wheat surprised
with a late rally and closed near its January highs.  Coffee
sank, Cocoa and Sugar closed higher, as did Cotton which
spun around on improved fundamentals after four down days.
