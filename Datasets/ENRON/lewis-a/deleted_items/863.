Avery Communications Inc. Enters Into Management Support and
Asset Purchase Agreements With OAN Services Inc.


Avery Communications Inc. (OTCBB:ATEX), a provider of
customer care and billing services, announced that, through its
wholly owned subsidiary, ACI Telecommunications Inc. (``ACI''), it
has entered into a management support and post-petition financing
agreement with OAN Services Inc. (``OAN'') and has reached a
definitive agreement to acquire certain assets from OAN for $19.7
million.

Located in Northridge, Calif., OAN is a competitor of HBS Billing
Services Inc., Avery's local exchange carrier billing clearinghouse
operation in San Antonio. OAN Services filed a petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on May 25, 2001. Both the management
support and the asset purchase agreements are subject to
Bankruptcy Court approval.

The management support agreement with OAN provides for ACI
management to assist OAN in operating its business during the first
90 days of the bankruptcy period. Under this agreement, OAN's
customers are assured that there will be no disruption of services
during the post-petition period and that payments relating to those
services will be made promptly in the ordinary course of business.

ACI has also agreed to provide debtor in possession financing to
OAN in order to maintain an orderly transition of the business.

Under the asset purchase agreement, ACI has agreed to pay
approximately $19.7 million consisting of a combination of assumed
liabilities, debtor in possession financing and cash. OAN assets to be
purchased include customer contracts, local exchange carrier
contracts for providing billing services, certain hardware and
software technology, and a customer care call center.

``We are pleased to be able to assist OAN's management and
customers during this challenging period,'' commented Patrick J.
Haynes III, chairman of Avery. ``Our focus in this transaction is to
provide financial stability for OAN's creditors and continuity of
services for their customers.

``The potential combination of OAN and HBS will position us as a
market leader in the LEC clearinghouse market with an unrivaled
depth of services and the highest quality of support for our
customers. The synergies created by the combination will reduce
overall operating costs and provide additional revenues to meet our
growth objectives. This transaction meets our investment criteria for
growth opportunities within the LEC billing clearinghouse market.''

``While we regret having to take this action, we believe it ultimately
will be in the best interests of all stakeholders,'' said Harvey Berg,
president of OAN Services.

``OAN's primary concern remains continuity of service for its
customers, and Avery's involvement helps achieve that objective. In
addition, the OAN/Avery combination will be much stronger, with
the necessary resources that enable it to thrive in a highly
competitive environment.''

Avery Communications Inc. Enters Into Agreement With
Qorus.com Inc. to Acquire Aelix Assets


Avery Communications Inc. (OTCBB:ATEX), a provider of
customer care and billing services, announced it has reached a
definitive agreement with Qorus.com Inc. to acquire the messaging
assets of Qorus.com Inc., known as ``Aelix,'' a global notification
and messaging clearinghouse for Customer Relations Management
(CRM) services.

The consummation of this transaction will be subject to a number of
conditions, including appropriate regulatory approval, the
affirmative votes of shareholders of the selling company, and receipt
of fairness opinions.

``The proposed transaction is consistent with Avery's business
expansion strategy to leverage our expertise of providing billing and
customer care solutions to the telecommunications industry to other
industries and immediately positions us with established global
partners in the travel and hospitality markets. This transaction
supports management's growth objectives without a significant
dilutive impact on earnings,'' commented Patrick J. Haynes, III,
chairman of Avery Communications.

``Qorus has begun to pursue other business opportunities to
leverage its expertise in information communications,'' according to
Thomas C. Ratchford, Qorus' chief financial officer. The new
business opportunities will likely focus in the business services area.
``We hope to reposition Qorus as a leader in one or more business
service areas. There have been opportunities to add value to
profitable cash-flow businesses,'' he said.

``We are excited about the prospect of becoming a part of Avery
Communications Inc. This acquisition progresses Aelix from a
venture capital stage company to an operational business subsidiary
of an organization with a much stronger financial base,'' said Aelix
Chief Executive Officer Wesley N. Waite, Sr. ``To assure continuity
within our industry we will maintain the Aelix corporate identity and
continue to offer our OmniReach(SM) product.

``The additional financial and technical resources available from
Avery should increase our efforts to develop next-generation
platforms that target enhanced services capabilities and product
offerings. I believe the strength of Avery will substantially increase
our penetration of the travel and hospitality markets.''

real-time, bidirectional communications between companies and
their customers via a number of different media and devices
