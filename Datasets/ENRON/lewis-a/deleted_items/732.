Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/02)
--------------------------------------------------------

***** Special News Flash******

"Tom Bierovic to join CTS Brain trust!"

I was in the presense of greatness last month. Tom Bierovic and I had
lunch at my favorite restaurant (Sailfish Marina).

Tom is a futures trader, advisor and educator with loads of experience.
His most recent endeavor was to create systems for Omega Research.
Over the past three years, he has created hundreds of systems and has
learned the statistics behind most commonly used indicators. Here's
what I gleaned from our 2 1/2 hour conversation:

1. Purely Mechanical trading systems as a group do not work very well
over the long term. He personally has had more success with using
a combination of system inputs with discretion for timing entry and
exit.

2. He believes strongly in the trend confirmation concept and is writing
about it in his new book due out later this year.

3. We agreed on the importance of profit/loss ratio's and balancing our
desire for profits with our respect for risk. Tom was quoted in Trader
Profile
in Futures Magazine, saying a 2 to 1 profit loss ratio is his target.

4. Tom believes that interest rates and currencies are superior trending
markets and that trend-following systems are likely to do the best in those
sectors. He commented that the Yen and Swiss were better vehicles than the
Pound.

5. Tom believes strongly in chart based analysis and classical chart
patterns. One of his favorite books is still the classic by Edwards and
Magee
on price patterns.

In addition to being very knowledgeable, I was impressed by his humble
spirit and gentlemen nature. Tom Bierovic is a class act from the word go.

I am pleased to announce that Tom has joined the CTS Brain Trust and
will begin writing advisory and educational articles starting  in July.
With this addition to our team, we believe ctsTrader.com has just taken
another giant leap ahead of the competition.

Why do we continue to make these kind of investments? So that we fulfill
our mission statement which says: "We will serve our customers with uniquely
effective trading tools while evolving smartly with technology."

We are working incredibly hard to be THE source for traders. ctsTrader.com
is a first major step in the right direction. If you haven't checked out the
new site, now is the time (just enter ctsTrader.com in your browser--
without
the usual "www"). We already believe it is the best website on the web
because it is shaped from the combination of over 600 member wishes and our
R&D pipeline, which is heating up with new innovations faster than ever
before. But we are not stopping now. You have more wishes to fulfill. And
we have some big ideas that we can now develop and deliver through this new
superior site. With Tom now joining our team, we are going to be adding
another layer of potent expertise to our mix, as well as extending our
offerings with more new features.

Can we do more? You bet. Tell us what we can do for you, and it is likely
that we will develop it. The new site reflects some of our member's
brillance. What else could we do to better serve you? I would love to
read your comments. Please send them directly to me: nvannice@ctsTrader.com

With Tom, ctsTrader.com, our R&D pipeline, and the suggestions of our
members being turned into reality, how can it be any other outcome than
for you to meet me in the Winner's Circle? I look forward to seeing
you there!

Key Technical Developments (close of 06/01)
-------------------------------------------------------
With the CRB tanking this week, it's hard not to look for a bottom
in the long end of the yield curve. Especially, now that the short
end has dropped so low.

Grains appear to be losing downside momentum. I would be surprised
to see a strong short covering rally of 50 cents or more in July
beans between now and July the 4th.

The U.S. dollar has decisively broken out! We like the short side
of the EURO and Pound.
