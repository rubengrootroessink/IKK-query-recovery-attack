WeatherBug Advertising Improvement Survey

Thanks for taking a moment to give us feedback about AWS WeatherBug! In the same way that Sponsors underwrite the costs of TV, Radio, and many popular Web Sites, Sponsors also help make AWS WeatherBug a free service. By telling us how you feel about WeatherBug advertising, you are playing an important role in helping us improve your overall WeatherBug experience! 
1. As you have probably noticed, the background colors and images on your Weatherbug change on a regular basis to feature various Sponsors. How do you feel about these regularly changing "WeatherBug backgrounds" (also called "Wraps")?

2. As you close your WeatherBug, a Sponsor message often "pops-up" on your computer screen. How do you feel about this?

3. From time to time, we send you email offers on behalf of our Sponsors (if you originally gave us permission to do so). How do you feel about these emails?

4. Recently, when you installed (or upgraded) your WeatherBug, you were asked to choose a Sponsor from a list of companies or offers. How did you feel about being asked to personally select your Sponsor in this manner?

7. The idea of someone being able to select a Sponsor (instead of passively receiving advertising) is a relatively new one. In general, how do you feel about this new concept of being presented with a list of Sponsors, then personally selecting which of those Sponsors can advertise to you?

8. If you were able to choose which Sponsors advertise to you as you use your WeatherBug, would you be:
More likely to "click" on their advertising when it appeared
Less likely to "click" on their advertising when it appeared

9. Now imagine that instead of being asked to select a sponsor just once (when you downloaded WeatherBug), you are asked to select a sponsor once every month. How would you feel about this?
