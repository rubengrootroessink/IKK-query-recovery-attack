1. INTERNET STOCK OUTLOOK

by Jerry Yeung

Having peaked at 2328.05 last Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite Index has been
on a slippery slope this holiday shortened week. Plunging about 250 points,
or more than 10%, during this period, the tech-heavy index erased all of its
gains since the Fed's most recent interest rate cut.

The pullback from its heights - which had served as a beacon for valuation
hawks - attracted some modest buying Thursday and short covering to pump the
Nasdaq back up to 2110.49, down about 140 points, or 6.2% for the week.
