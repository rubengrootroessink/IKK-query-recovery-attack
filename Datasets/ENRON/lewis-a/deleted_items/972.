<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Andrew:

Guarded optimism about economic prospects helped rally stocks to new
highs for October, and the US Dollar re-asserted its strength during
a week that saw most Commodities lacking firm directions.  Lumber
was a rare exception, shooting higher on the basis of increased cash
market activity.  Wheat also ended with a solid advance tied to
exports.  Corn and Soybeans, however, continued to be pressured by
favorable weather conditions, while there was little movement in
Energies, although Natural Gas was firm.  Cotton slumped to 29-year
lows, Coffee looked uncertain, and Hogs lost ground.  Short-covering
on Friday ahead of the weekend produced nice bounces for Gold and
Copper.

Alex McCallum, Editorial Director & Forum Moderator
