HotToday: Futures - http://ctsTrader.com

______May the 31st, 2001__________
-------------------------------------------------------
CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES
By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 3, Number 106___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (05/31)
--------------------------------------------------------

"What I wished I knew before trading my first account"

1. Trading is more about consistency and money management than method.

2. Having a structured trading method helps reduce emotional decision
making and that helps you be more consistent.

3. Most of the time, markets are not trending. Therefore, having a dynamic
portfolio based on a some sort of trend or breakout criteria is essential.

4. Winning on a high percentage of trades is important because it lowers
your risk of ruin. Having a low percentage of winners like most
position trading systems have, leads to higher risk and a higher
degree of difficulty to trade.

5. You can make money swing trading and having a profit/loss ratio
near 1.5 to 1. It was my belief that I needed a profit/loss ratio of
3 to 1 or better that cost me my first account.

6. There is no way to predict which markets will be next years big winners.
Therefore, having a dynamic portfolio method, like the CTS Futures Selector
is key to catching the big moves with a smaller account!

7. I wish somebody would have told me about the 2% risk per trade rule,
and that it can work with a small account. You must trade Mid-ams
spreads and options, but it does work and you must figure out how to keep
losses
small. The 2% rule says that you should keep trade losses to 2% of your
account
balance. For example, a 10,000  account should keep losses to $200.
That's right $200! You can do this through the use of trading the smaller
markets with Mid-am contracts or with spreads in the bigger markets.
For example, you can trade interest rate futures using Mid-am Notes,
Eurodollar calls or the MID-AM Nob spread (ten year - 30 year bonds)
and get plenty of staying power. These are all serious strategies that
can pay off handsomely. During my first account, I was trading full size
bonds and currencies and losing 10% per trade....no surpirse, the account
did not last long. I hope you can learn from my mistakes and leverage this
wisdom into your profits.

Key Technical Developments (close of 05/31)
-------------------------------------------------------

The June British Pound is at a key junture! Hourly stochastics
are overbought again and the recent recovery appears corrective.
A drop below the recent lows opens the door to big downside potential.

Gold dropped $9 oz and is testing key support at 265! If prices can
stabilize near current levels, then we could see a resumption of
the uptrend. The market phsychology at a wave 2 low is often more
bearish than the ultimate low.

December Eurodollars are trading at a 40 point discount to September.
I like the long side of Dec heading into Friday's number!
