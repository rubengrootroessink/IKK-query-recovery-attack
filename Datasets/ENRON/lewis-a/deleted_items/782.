  TI Extends Wireless LAN Coverage Area By 70 Percent With New IEEE 802.11b=
 Chip and Reference Designs   DALLAS, Jun 4, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -=
- Answering market demands for better performing and more highly integrated=
 IEEE 802.11b consumer products, Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NYSE:=
 TXN) today announced a new wireless LAN chip which will be available for u=
se in reference designs for PC card, mini-PCI and USB applications. Increas=
ing the deployment of Wi-Fi(TM) technology in broadband homes and offices, =
TI's new chip increases WLAN coverage area by 70 percent versus competitive=
 solutions in real life environments, the result of a 30 percent linear rea=
ch improvement. This reach/area improvement is vital for the growth of the =
home user market since it means consumers only need to purchase one access =
point or gateway to cover their entire home. (See: http://www.ti.com/sc/wir=
elessethernet ).   The new chip, the ACX100, is comprised of an integrated =
Media Access Controller (MAC) and baseband processor, combined with on-chip=
 PCI, CardBus and USB interfaces, thus eliminating the need for external br=
idging components. The chip supports both the CCK (Complementary Code Keyin=
g) and newer Packet Binary Convolutional Code(TM) of the current IEEE 802.1=
1b standard. With PBCC(TM) modulation, end-to-end solutions using TI's ACX1=
00 offer a coding gain advantage of 3dB over current CCK-only 802.11b solut=
ions, allowing for the 70 percent coverage area improvement.   Since it uti=
lizes an embedded microprocessor for implementing much of the MAC layer pro=
tocol, the ACX100 is firmware upgradable, which facilitates support of evol=
ving IEEE standards such as the forthcoming 802.11e (quality of service) an=
d 802.11i (security enhancements). The device is fully compatible with the =
IEEE 802.11b standard and also supports a 22Mbit/sec high rate mode that do=
ubles the throughput over today's existing 802.11b networks.   "By offering=
 cost optimized reference designs and a new generation technology that can =
enable a sub $80 retail price for better performing PC cards, TI's ACX100 w=
ill help increase wireless LAN penetration in homes and offices," said Alle=
n Nogee, senior analyst at Cahners In-Stat Group. "The extended range achie=
vable by the ACX100 will also impact the growth of wireless networking in t=
he home environment since consumers will now be able to easily experience b=
roadband Internet sharing through a single access point, which has not been=
 always the case today."   Complete Reference Designs Speed Time to Market =
  To help manufacturers achieve a faster time to market, TI is offering thr=
ee reference designs using the ACX100 for PC Card, mini-PCI and USB applica=
tions. The reference designs include a complete hardware development kit (H=
DK), which reduces engineering resource requirements by providing schematic=
s, layout, Gerber files and bill of material requirements. These same refer=
ence designs also support the 22Mbit/sec high rate extension.   Network dri=
ver interface specification (NDIS) 4/5 drivers, including configuration and=
 site survey tools, that are Microsoft(R) Windows(R) Hardware Quality Labs =
(WHQL) certified are also included. TI expects to take each reference desig=
n through WECA certification of Wi-Fi interoperability to further improve t=
ime-to-market for customers. To prepare for the fall arrival of Windows XP,=
 TI is also developing NDIS 5.1 drivers required for this platform. WHQL ce=
rtified Windows XP drivers for the ACX100 are scheduled to be available by =
4Q01.   The ACX100 was also designed with considerations for access point d=
evelopment. Leveraging a 32-bit PCI/CardBus or 16-bit slave interface, the =
ACX100 can easily connect to a network processor to provide a highly effect=
ive solution for access points. TI has created an ACX100 driver development=
 kit (DDK) offering an easy way for developers to create customized drivers=
 often required for access point applications.   "TI strongly believes that=
 802.11 will reshape the Local Area Networking landscape," said Marc Cetto,=
 general manager of TI's Home Networking Business Unit. "With our new ACX10=
0 solution we will be able to drive wireless networking into more broadband=
 homes, offices and public places by offering a solution with extended reac=
h and range at the right price point for more consumers to adopt the techno=
logy. We will continue adding technology enhancements while targeting syste=
m cost discontinuities for all our forthcoming wireless LAN products "   Av=
ailability   ACX100 based reference designs are available today. Production=
 shipments of customers' systems based upon the ACX100 are expected in 4Q01=
