Well here is the great news!  We will be open tomorrow for the winter
season!  We have received about 25 inches of new snow over the weekend and
today, allowing us to open tomorrow with our Shoshone Quad Chair from 9 AM -
4PM.  Tomorrow's lift ticket price is only $27.  Only the Shoshone area will
be open.  We are planning to open the Dreamcatcher Quad to the summit of
Fred's Mtn. by Wed. or Thurs.  I will send another email out when we know!

We also have a FREE SKI DAY, for our Vertical Value Plus Card members!  Go
to this site for more info.
