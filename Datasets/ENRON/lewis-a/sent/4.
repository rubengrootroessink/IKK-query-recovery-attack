I received an e-mail earlier stating that I was to be included in the second 
pilot along with Martin Cuilla and several other members of the Central 
Desk.  Recently, Martin received a second e-mail asking him to accept an 
invitation to the program.  Since the deadline for this application is 
tomorrow, and I have yet to receive this e-mail, I would appreciate you 
contacting me by phone in order to verify my inclusion.
