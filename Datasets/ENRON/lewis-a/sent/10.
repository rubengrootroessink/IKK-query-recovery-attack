It's really me!!!!

Where are you nowadays?

Where have you been?

What have you seen?

Inquiring minds want to know!

I don't know if you have corresponded with Flet lately, but he is officially 
a short timer.  Looks like he's the proud owner of Midwest Power now that 
John Z. has taken off for the Great White North (Calgary).

On a completely different note, Sandra is still waiting for her postcards.  
Apparently you promised to send a postcard every week or something.

Oh, by the way, Martin and Kevin are officially married now.  And Robin is in 
Toronto awaiting the fateful day.

That's about all for now.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
