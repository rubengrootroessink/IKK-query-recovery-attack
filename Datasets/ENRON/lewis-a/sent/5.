We finally got your postcards this week.  Sandra was excited to receive them.
It sounds like your having a blast in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit 
that part
of the world.  I have some friends that are moving to London in January, so I 
guess
that will have to be the first trip I take.

On a different note, this wednesday was a bit like a stick in the eye.  
However, there's 
always next week.

Robin's last name is now Zivic, so her new handle is Rhonda Zivic (Honda 
Civic).  

That's it for now.

E.B.

right...
i did write more, but i don't think it went through.
anyway, just got back from asia.  after thailand, i
went to singapore (bright lights, big city), malaysia
(resort in the south (note: resorts not fun during
monsoon season), and cambodia (worth the visit, esp if
not harassed by customs officer).  all in all, i would
say that the best place i went to was Chiang Mai,
Thailand.  Thailand, as a whole, is the kind of place
that i would visit many times.

hope all is well at big E.  hope weds are treating you
right.  what is better than...?
