To whom it may concern:

First, why does the Dell public website have more choices for upgrades then 
the Enron website?  For example, the website available to the public has a 
19" monitor (M991) for an extra $140.

Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it 
offers to the general public?  For example, the website available to the 
public allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor for $290.  
The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor 
for $400.  Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $110 for the 
same upgrade.

I look forward to your response.
