Hey,

How was your Christmas?  Did you guys get hammered with snow and ice?

My vacation was very relaxing, and I managed to leave just before the real 
cold weather set in.  It also looks like I'm going to miss the biggest snow 
storm of the winter by about five days.  

I'm still not sure what I am going to do for New Year's eve.  It's been so 
busy this week that I haven't had time to talk to any of my friends.  If you 
hear of anything let me know.

Anyway, since the Nymex closed at Noon, I think I am going to get the heck 
outta here.

Talk to you later.

Andy
