To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself 
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high 
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel, 
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

Andy
