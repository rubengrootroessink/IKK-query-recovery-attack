HOLIDAY RECIPES

o IMPRESS THE LADIES WITH FRUIT SALAD

There's a holiday party next weekend, and you were planning to bring some 
cold ones. But women love a man who can cook: think of how impressed they'd 
be if you showed up with a healthy fruit salad. (Yes, it's easy to make.) 
Take the challenge!

Feeling especially amorous -- er, we mean ambitious? Then investigate these 
Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa recipes.
