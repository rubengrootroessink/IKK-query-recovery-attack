Anti-Tax Haven Sanctions - What Happens If There Is All Out War?
by Bob Bauman, Editor

We're getting weary of writing about the OECD and FATF blacklists
and those "sanctions" that supposedly will be clamped on world tax
havens, come June 30. That was the Paris bureaucrats' self-inflicted
deadline chosen a year back when they believed CLINTON-GORE (remember
them?) leftist Treasury minions would be in control in Washington, DC.

Last June these nervy public relations megaphones for the rich G-7
nations issued arbitrary lists of small nations they accused of being
lax on criminal money laundering and/or engaged in nefarious "harmful
tax competition."

Then, and repeatedly since, the Blacklisted Ones have been threatened
with nebulous "sanctions," possibly including severance from world
banking and financial systems. As co-conspirators, the Clinton crowd
at the US Treasury tried and failed to get congressional approval for
this obtuse thuggery. Now a new president named Bush is more or less
in control, and still we wait for what should be an easy & resounding
official "NO" to the OECD high tax cartel. Absent the US, there's
little chance the OECD can impose any meaningful "sanctions," however
much the bureaucrat bullies bluster.

But what might sanctions look like? How disruptive could they be,
if they were indeed imposed on the 35 blacklisted offshore nations.

Sovereign Society advisory board member J. Richard DUKE
(http://www.assetlaw.com) calls attention to a 2 part article in the
April and May issues of the Journal of International Taxation,
(available only to subscribers on line). There New York attorney
David E. Spencer provides a glimpse of the chaos that could result
in world financial markets if the OECD has its perverse way by
imposing sanctions on "uncooperative" tax haven nations.

Among the OECD suggested sanctions nations might impose;
* use of domestic tax laws to deny all deductions, exemptions,
allowances and credits for taxpayers or entities doing business in
haven nations;
* under civil and criminal penalties, require new, extensive reporting
of all offshore financial activity;
* expansion and strict enforcement of controlled foreign corporation
(CFC) rules;
* levy new withholding taxes on payments or transfers to havens;
* increased tax audits of all offshore business activity;
* review, repeal and/or refusal of bilateral tax treaties;
* special new tariffs on financial activity involving haven nations.

In the case of the US and most other nations, all of these radical
proposals would require legislative action that is highly unlikely to
occur. But imagine what this would do to the international financial
world as we now know it. June 30, here we come!
