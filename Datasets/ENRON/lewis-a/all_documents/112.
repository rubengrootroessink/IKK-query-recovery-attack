AMCC First to Enable the Next Generation Multi-Carrier, Transparent
Network Architecture With Introduction of 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper and FEC
Device=0F=3DAMCC's Hudson is the Industry's First Device to Meet the Rapidl=
y=20
Growing
Demand for 10 Gbps Digital Wrapper Solutions From the Man, Transport and WD=
M
Sectors

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AM=
CC)
(Nasdaq:AMCC), a leader in high-bandwidth silicon connectivity solutions fo=
r=20
the
world's optical networks, today announced the Hudson (S19203), the industry=
's
first 10 Gbps silicon device architected to support both the evolving G.709
digital wrapper standard and traditional SONET/SDH infrastructures.

The Hudson variable rate, digital wrapper framer/deframer and performance
monitor device facilitates the transparent transport of multiple protocols
across the network, while aiding interconnection between multiple carriers.
Hudson incorporates programmable Forward Error Correction (FEC) for rates u=
p=20
to
10.66 Gbps and supports OC-192 transmission standards. The digital wrapper
technology provides an extension of the current SONET/SDH infrastructure,=
=20
while
enhancing both flexibility and transparency across the network. The Hudson
easily interfaces with AMCC's 10 Gbps mux/demux devices, SONET/SDH/digital
wrapper backplane devices and AMCC's mapping and pointer processing devices=
.

"The digital wrapper is the next important step for large optical networks =
as=20
it
incorporates the best features of SONET/SDH while removing some of the rigi=
d
overhead structure that makes SONET/SDH sub-optimal for an IP-centric,
intelligent optical network," said Brent Little, vice president of marketin=
g=20
for
AMCC. "By using key devices such as Hudson, OEMs will now be able to create=
=20
more
efficient and interoperable systems without starting from scratch."

AMCC's digital wrapper design has already been adopted by most of the major=
=20
wide
area networking (WAN) equipment manufacturers. The demand for digital wrapp=
er
products stems from the need in the WAN to transparently transport multiple
protocols at 10 Gbps, coupled with the need to efficiently provision bandwi=
dth
across today's multiple-carrier network.

"The Hudson is built for the next-generation multi-carrier transport networ=
k
architecture and ushers in an efficient and cost-effective means of=20
transporting
traffic while extending existing SONET infrastructures," said Ken Prentiss,
AMCC's director of marketing for telecom products. "We are seeing=20
unprecedented
demand for Hudson across a large customer base due mainly to the device's
flexible architecture; customers can wrap, unwrap or monitor traditional
SONET/SDH traffic, or wrap and unwrap IP or any other traffic using a singl=
e
device."

The digital wrapper concept involves grouping together a number of existing
frames into "super-frames," which can then be more efficiently managed with=
 a
relatively small allocation of overhead-per-byte of data. By aggregating
together the provisions for "framing bits" that are already defined for use=
 by
existing time-division multiplexed (TDM) structures, the super-frame concep=
t
allows for the implementation of an intelligent operation, administration a=
nd
maintenance (OAM) capability without materially expanding the amount of dat=
a
currently being transmitted. This creative use of available control bits al=
so
allows FEC functions to be very efficiently incorporated within the digital
wrapper definition without a significant net increase in overall bandwidth
usage.

The Hudson's core logic runs on a 1.8V power supply and features two input =
and
two output ports, which are configurable in many ways. Figure 1 shows a=20
typical
network application supporting a single data stream with dual redundant inp=
ut
and output lines. The input and output ports can be configured as a dual
redundant I/O on a single data stream for protection switching or as two
completely independent data streams for duplex operation. Either input port=
=20
can
be directly connected to either output port for loopback testing.

The Hudson provides full digital wrapper performance monitoring and feature=
s
Optical Channel Overhead (OCh-OH) insertion and extraction, which are
independently controllable. All 64 OCh-OH bytes in a superframe are=20
programmable
in function and are available for insertion from and drop to FPGA or
microprocessor. Data entering and leaving the Hudson device can be optional=
ly
differentially decoded and encoded, deframed and framed, descrambled and
scrambled, and decoded and encoded with FEC information. In addition, SONET=
=20
data
can optionally be performance monitored for integrity, alarms, and trace
messages.


Pricing and Availability

The Hudson (S19203), packaged in a 624-pin CBGA, will be sampling to=20
development
partners in December with volume production commencing in Q2 2001. AMCC=20

set pricing can be obtained from the company by calling 800/755-AMCC
(800/755-2622).
