dear eb,
hope you had a fun and healthy thanksgiving.  just got
peru.  it was great fun, except that one time in a
bakery, i left my backpack there.  returned 7 minutes
later and it was gone.  goodbye camera, palm pilot and
most importantly journal.  it was the most expensive
queso empanada, ever!  anyway, going to europe on the
5th.  then off to school... rat guts.
