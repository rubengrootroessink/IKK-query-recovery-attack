TOP STORY: Forget about Bush and Gore. If the technology
sector is to continue its recent rally, Larry Ellison's
Oracle had better produce the strong numbers the market
expects from Oracle's application software business.

Insecurity complex


Under Thornton May's name, on his Guardent business card, is
a Fast Company-esque title: "Corporate Futurist and Chief
Awareness Officer." As if it's possible to not be aware of
Thornton.

He's unignorable, a kinetic public speaker and staccato
conversationalist. These are good traits, given what he's
trying to drum up awareness for: Guardent's service of
building secure information infrastructures.

Most security services (monitoring services, hackers-for-
hire, etc.) generally don't probe the weakest links in any
system: the people. Thornton's out to educate a whole class
of IT professionals about human behavior -- what to look for
in on-staff security risks, and how to behave with other
professionals so as to better exchange information about
security.

Sounds like a great consulting gig, but Thornton is very
dismissive of consultants. He claims that Guardent's 160
people are, in fact, hyperspecialists on security, and that
Guardent is one of a new kind of company that will rise from
the ashes of the great e-consulting washout: focused, best-
of-breed, expert organizations. The challenge to come, he
says, will be the corporate customer's who, fed up with
broad but shallow consulting firms, will have to learn how
to tightly integrate contracted, fanatical specialists into
their own teams.
