Cindy,

Several of the traders on the Central Desk have asked me to forward our 
opinions to you regarding the sale of Astros tickets.

First, on Tuesday, March 7, Eva Pao and myself went to get lunch and buy 
Astors tickets at 11:30 A.M.  We walked the entire floor looking for the 
table with the tickets.  It wasn't until later that day we found out the 
tickets were sold out before they were supposed to go on sale (11:00 A.M. on 
Tuesday).

Second, it is extremely difficult for any of the traders or schedulers
