Broadcom Reports First Quarter 2001 Results

IRVINE, Calif., Apr 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Broadcom Corporation (Nasda=
q:
BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadband
communications, today reported financial results for the first fiscal quart=
er,
ended March 31, 2001.

Gross revenue for the first quarter was $318.1 million, an increase of 66%=
=20
over
the $191.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of =
16%
from the $378.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue=
=20
for
the first quarter was $310.5 million, an increase of 62% over the $191.6=20
million
reported in the first quarter of 2000 and a decrease of 9% from the $340.2
million reported in the fourth quarter of 2000. Net revenue includes the
non-cash revenue deduction of the fair value of assumed performance-based
warrants earned by certain customers.

Pro forma net income was $24.2 million, or $.09 per share (diluted). This
compares with pro forma net income of $44.9 million, or $.18 per share
(diluted), for the same quarter in 2000, and pro forma net income of $88.8
million, or $.32 per share (diluted), in the fourth quarter of 2000. Dilute=
d
earnings per share for the quarter were based on 281.0 million weighted=20
average
shares outstanding, compared to 252.6 million weighted average shares
outstanding in the first quarter of 2000 and to 274.1 million weighted aver=
age
shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Broadcom reports net income and diluted earnings per share on a pro forma=
=20
basis,
which excludes the effects of the non-cash revenue deduction related to
performance-based warrants, acquisition-related expenses, certain=20
non-recurring
settlement charges, and payroll taxes on certain stock option exercises.
Including these charges, substantially all of which were non-cash, net loss=
=20
for
the first quarter was $356.9 million, or $1.43 per share, compared with net
income of $38.6 million, or $.15 per share (diluted), in the same quarter o=
f
2000, and with a net loss of $768.3 million, or $3.28 per share, in the fou=
rth
quarter of 2000.

During the quarter, Broadcom announced and closed its acquisition of=20
ServerWorks
Corporation, a leading supplier of high performance SystemI/O(TM) solutions=
=20
for
server and storage platforms, network appliances and workstations. Broadcom=
=20
also
completed the acquisition of Visiontech Ltd., a leading supplier of digital
video/audio MPEG-2 compression and decompression chips enabling Personal Vi=
deo
Recording (PVR) and IP video streaming for the consumer electronics market.
These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounti=
ng.

"Our first quarter results met the revised expectations that we communicate=
d=20
on
March 6th. Looking ahead, as a result of the continued weakness in the
communications sector, we have not yet seen improvement in order visibility=
=20
from
customers," said Dr. Henry T. Nicholas III, Broadcom's President and CEO.
"Despite the current weakness that exists in the business, we continue to b=
e
confident that our product roadmaps in both the core and emerging markets w=
ill
position us well as the economy recovers."

During the first quarter, Broadcom introduced several significant new=20
products.
The company announced the world's first 0.13 micron CMOS Gigabit Copper
Transceiver, a four channel device on a single monolithic chip. This produc=
t
enables cost-effective, high port count Gigabit Ethernet switches and route=
rs=20
by
doubling port density and reducing size and power requirements by 50%. This
industry leading product marks the fourth generation of Gigabit transceiver
products from Broadcom.

Broadcom's new products for optical communications applications included th=
e
world's first system-on-a-chip OC-48 line card, the world's first single-ch=
ip
OC-192 CMOS transceiver, a low power and low cost OC-192 framer and the=20
world's
lowest power 10-Gigabit CMOS limiting amplifier. These product introduction=
s
position Broadcom very well in the market for broadband optical=20
communications.

Broadcom's newly acquired ServerWorks business made two noteworthy=20
announcements
during the first quarter. First, ServerWorks unveiled its new Grand=20
Champion(TM)
architecture for future Intel(R) Xeon(TM) based servers. This product is th=
e
first to support PCI-X, the new high performance input/output standard for
server and workstation platforms and the first to deliver memory bandwidth =
of
6.4 Gbytes/second or four times the company's previous solutions. In additi=
on,
ServerWorks announced new SystemI/O logic that is optimized for dense Inter=
net
network servers produced by OEM customers such as Compaq, Dell, IBM, NEC an=
d
Siemens.

During the quarter, the Home Networking Business Unit extended its industry
leading position by surpassing the two million unit milestone for total num=
ber
of units shipped. HomePNA(TM), which utilizes the phone lines already in a=
=20
home,
continues to be the most widely produced home networking technology.

Broadcom also announced, sampled, gained design wins and has begun shipping=
=20
the
world's first single-chip IP phone solution incorporating Ethernet switch
technology, dual Ethernet transceivers, DSP and RISC processor cores and=20
analog
CODECs for handset and speakerphone support. This highly integrated Etherne=
t=20
IP
phone chip enables toll-quality IP phones with the lowest power consumption=
.

Broadcom also introduced the first all-CMOS Bluetooth(TM) radio to achieve
Bluetooth qualification. This radio is designed specifically for use in mob=
ile
phone handsets and further extends Broadcom's Blutonium(TM) line of Bluetoo=
th
solutions.

Broadcom's tuner chip was the first to receive CableLabs(TM) certification =
and
EuroDOCSIS certification. This will continue to allow manufacturers to=20
utilize a
highly integrated CMOS tuner chip to replace the 200-plus discrete componen=
ts
housed in a tuner can to achieve greater reliability while meeting industry
standards.

Broadcom will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to disc=
uss
its first quarter 2001 financial results and current financial prospects to=

at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time (1:45 p.m. Pacific Time). The company will broadc=
