c.,
a leading seller of downloadable music, today announced a one-hour public=
=20
forum
to discuss the artistic and financial impact of MP3s and Napster on=20
independent
record labels and musicians. All interested parties are invited to=20
participate:

"MP3 & Napster: An Indie Label and Artist Perspective"

Date: Thursday, December 14

Time: 1:00 p.m. PST

"There is obviously a lot of confusion and emotion over the issues around
downloadable music," says Hoffman. "We hope that opening this dialog will h=

music fans better understand how the music business works -- especially for

mutually-respected, we believe MP3s offer a great opportunity for these
