COMMENT: The Money Laundering Farce Must End
by Bob Bauman, Editor.

One of the major arguments of the world money police is the imagined
need to stop "money laundering." They claim widespread abuse of banking
and other financial systems by sinister criminal forces. Offering little
proof, artful officials use their questionable premise to justify a
supposed right to monitor and record all financial transactions. By
design, banks and their employees have been forced into the unwanted
role of spies and police deputies.

In the only popular uprising against this arrogant attack on financial
privacy, in 1999 protests from hundreds of thousands of irate Americans
forced the US government to back down on so-called "Know Your Customer"
rules. The KYC proposals would have made every American banker a
government vetting agent, with a duty to investigate, watch for and
report supposed "suspicious activity" of all account holders. (Since
then the Clinton administration has pressed banks to adopt "voluntary"
KYC rules in spite of these protests).

From earliest history, unless restrained, governments always have used
every available tool to spy on citizens. Until this trumped up money
laundering scare the consensus in western democracies has been that
personal freedom and privacy greatly outweighed prior restrictions
aimed at potential criminal abuse. This established principle rightly
forced police and prosecutors to build each individual case on legally
gathered evidence rather than use the dragnet approach.

But now prosecutors reverse this traditional right to privacy. Instead
of a presumption of innocence, whole classes of people are viewed as
potential criminals based solely on wealth and its free use. Subject to
civil forfeiture, the accused are stripped of their assets and forced
to prove their innocence.

Are these drastic restrictions on financial freedom justified?

Existing anti-ML efforts have proven very costly and highly ineffective.
In the US in 1998, only 932 people were convicted of money laundering,
yet the cost to the private and public sectors exceeded $10 billion,
averaging more than $10 million per conviction. Based on several years
statistics, a British law professor calculated that the UK government
has stopped only 0.004% of the criminal money that flowed through the
City of London. The professor concluded: "Money launderers do not have
a statistically significant chance of being caught, hence the deterrent
effect of such laws is negligible."

The question must be asked: "When is this madness to stop?" No one
should ever have to justify he right to keep their personal business
private, except upon an individual indictment based on specific facts
presented to a court of law.

This financial dragnet must end. A continuing and expanded popular
resistance holds the key to success.

RUSSIAN FLAT TAX STARTS SOON
