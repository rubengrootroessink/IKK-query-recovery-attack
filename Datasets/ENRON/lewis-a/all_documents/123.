Beyond The Numbers

Are the markets ready for a rally?

Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topi=
c=20
that can probably be argued for a long time to come. Some may argue the=20
fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal. While others may=20
argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition.=
=20
Then there are those few, including RealTimeTraders.com who believe it's a=
=20
good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow.

Important factors may be coming together for a move up

Notice, our heading states =01&a move up=018 rather than a rally. Along wit=
h a few=20
market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal=
=20
or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few session=
s.=20
Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally ga=
ve=20
the markets what they had been anticipating. His favorable comments were=20
interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the=
=20
economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels.

Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were=
=20
below the consensus estimates. Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will b=
e=20
back in the crude oil market. If Iraq's crude comes online, that may furthe=
r=20
pressure the crude oil prices, (which is in the best interest of US=20
consumers). The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is=
=20
also a positive for the markets. All the above facts coupled with the usual=
=20
year end rally (better known as Santa Claus rally) may set the stage for a=
=20
meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year 2000.=20

Economic slowdown may impact future earnings

Last week some of the biggest and well-known names warned their upcoming=20
quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Street=01,s expectations. Despit=
e the=20
earnings warnings, markets have started to rally on the FED Chairman=01,s=
=20
comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the=20
economy from slowing down. While lower rates are expected to help the marke=
ts=20
move higher, it is important to note that corporate earnings will not=20
immediately start to move higher. Given that, we believe markets are likely=
=20
to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace. Moreover,=
=20
unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite=
=20
losing more money, stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the=20
companies future earnings.=20
<br><br>
We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies' earnings power=
=20
and their position within the sector. What we mean by that is, it is a good=
=20
idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is=
=20
moving higher, a good example of that is Applied Materials (AMAT) within th=
e=20
semiconductor sector. Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the=20
Semiconductor equipment world, and as such it has always produced steady an=
d=20
predictable earnings.



Sector Analysis

Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract  money

Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad=20

=20
investors. We at RealTimeTraders.com believe the healthcare and insurance=
=20
related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility o=
f=20
technology stocks coming back into the spotlight. Some of the stocks that a=
re=20
worth mentioning are United Healthcare (UNH) has been hovering around its=

52-week high for the past few weeks. Friday the stock closed at a new 52-we=
