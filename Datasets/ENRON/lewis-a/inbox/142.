Hello Andy.

I hope your Monday is going well. Per our discussion last week, I have
communicated to our management your limited availability for this project.
Hopefully we will resolve this issue in the upcoming week. Our plan is to
request additional resources to help you write the content. However, you
will still be responsible for signing off on the final product. I will keep
you updated with more information as soon as I know more.

In the meantime and until we've identified additional resources, I am
sending you  the high-level outline for each content area that you are
responsible for this week. Let me know if you have time to complete this,
or any other past assignment. I've included reminders below on where/how to
develop.  Thanks.
