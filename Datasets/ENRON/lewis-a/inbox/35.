Here's the daily historical load information for WSCC that you requested. Stephen Swain in the Portland office provided them. Give me a call if you have any questions.

Here you go, sorry to take so long but we had a couple of things here to deal with.  I went back to 1/1/2000, which gives you 15 months (through the end of last month).  Note that CAISO are actuals, all else are forecasts.  Let me know if you have any questions.
