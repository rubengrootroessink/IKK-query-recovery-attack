2.	Groups That Are Heating Up

Furniture stocks have been performing very well over the past
several weeks, evidenced by the four-week rise in
Home/Furniture {.HFU}.  Attracting investors to the group has
been strength in the upholstered segment as consumers are
opting for new chairs and sofas, which has helped sales at
Furniture Brands {FBN} and La-Z-Boy {LZB}.  Hardly anybody's
first guess as a industry segment that would fair well during
an economic contraction, the surprisingly strong performance
of upholstered furniture is reflective of three trends:
lifestyle changes oriented towards updating home interiors on
a regular basis, a cheaper price than full room sets or wood
furniture, and an inclination to stay home and watch
television.

Not so surprising has been the performance of
Drugs/Biotechnology {.DBI}, which has risen in rank for four
consecutive weeks.  Anthrax bioterrorism has boosted the
stocks of several small companies, while earnings, drug
research news events, and a higher tolerance for premium
valuations have caused buying pressure in many of the stocks
with larger market capitalizations.  How sustainable this
momentum is, however, may be tied to overall performance of
the Nasdaq and its ability to stay above its 50-day moving
average.  Among those stocks that have been trending upward
are Corr Therapeutics {CORR}, Transkaryotic {TKTX}, Aviron
{AVIR}, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals {MLNM}.

Other groups with rising rankings include Chemicals {.CHE},
Computer/Computer Services {.DSE}, Drugs/Research {.DRE},
Home/Housewares {.HSW}, and Retail/Stores/Warehouse Clubs
{.RWC}.

3.	Groups That Are Cooling Off

Rankings for Financial/Consumer Loan {.FCL} have plummeted
from the 83rd percentile to the 39th percentile over the past
five weeks on concerns that loan default rates may rise.
Both Americredit {ACF} and Metris {MXT} have seen their stock
prices fall by 20 percent or more during the past two weeks
as investors fear that the rising joblessness rate will force
many consumers into financial problems.  Americredit provides
subprime automobile loans, while Metris offers credit cards
to subprime borrowers.

Other groups with declining rankings include Banks/Savings &
Loan {.BSL}, Electronics/Household Appliances {.EHA},
Finance/Services {.FSE}, and Food/Meat-Poultry {.FMP}.

4.	On The Radar Screen This Week

The retail sector should start coming into play over the
course of the next few weeks as investors digest data out of
three key events.  First are Halloween-related sales - better
than expected revenues will suggest that consumers are
putting the anthrax scares behind them, while worse than
expected sales could suggest that consumer confidence remains
fragile.  Secondly, third quarter earnings season will be
starting for the sector and analysts will be paying close
attention what inventory levels are at and the extent to which
retailers are relying on promotional pricing to drive store
traffic.  Finally, the holiday shopping season is beginning to
warm up and will viewed as a proxy for judging the overall
state of the economy.
