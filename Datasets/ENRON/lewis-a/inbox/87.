June 7, 2001 - Intel rose after hours Thursday after announcing it will
meet estimates this quarter. Nasdaq futures traded up 2%, on top of a 2%
gain during the day.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ added 3 to 269, and the Nasdaq
surged 46 to 2264. The S&P 500 rose 6 to 1276, and the Dow added 20 to
11,090. Volume edged higher to 1.27 billion shares on the NYSE, but
declined to 1.62 billion on the Nasdaq. Advancers led 15 to 14 on the
NYSE, and 20 to 16 on the Nasdaq. For earnings reports, visit our earnings

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rose more than a point after hours after saying
revenues will be "slightly below the midpoint" of the range it provided on
April 17. But Handspring (NASDAQ:HAND) fell on an earnings warning.

During the day, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 1.32 to 73.68, breaking out
of a 10-month base.

Chip stocks surged 7.7% after National Semi (NYSE:NSM), up 3.07 to 31.04,
beat estimates with a breakeven quarter and said the worst may be behind
the industry. Broadcom (NASDAQ:BRCM), up 5.14 to 40.71, warned but said it
is seeing an improvement in orders that could lead to a rebound later this
year.

S1 (NASDAQ:SONE), the best-performing Net stock last month, soared 2.35 to
13.85 on an alliance with IBM (NYSE:IBM).

Loudeye (NASDAQ:LOUD) soared .58 to 1.79 on a deal with Napster.

Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) rebounded 3.31 to 52.50 on comments from First
Union that the sell-off in the stock was overdone.

Salomon Smith Barney handicapped the winners and losers from the SuperComm
conference. The firm was cautious on Redback (NASDAQ:RBAK), Juniper
(NASDAQ:JNPR) and Nortel (NYSE:NT), and positive on Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO),
Extreme (NASDAQ:EXTR) and Foundry (NASDAQ:FDRY).

The Nasdaq broke through 2252 resistance today and is clearly headed
higher tomorrow. Tonight we're going to take a look at the bigger picture
since the April lows and see what's forming, because at least for now, the
chart patterns forming off the lows look mainly bearish. The Nasdaq (first
chart) and Nasdaq 100 (second chart) could be forming either bearish
rising wedges (the black lines), or head and shoulders tops (the blue
lines). Our best guess is that they're rising wedges, and that those upper
trendlines will be reached in the near-term, but that's just a guess based
on the surprising strength in the market. However, at least one cycle
watcher is expecting a significant peak in the June 18-June 26 timeframe.
Those patterns make 2100-2150 on the Nasdaq and 1760-1850 on the Nasdaq
100 important support. A look at two possible outcomes: the Nasdaq 100's
bearish rising wedge rally of last summer (third chart), and the Dow's
bullish negation of a rising wedge at 10,300 in mid-April and subsequent
nicely-formed uptrend (fourth chart). We'll watch the charts for clues as
to how these patterns will resolve. Also notice that the S&P 500 (fifth
chart) and S&P 100 (sixth chart) could be forming head and shoulders tops
within otherwise nicely shaped uptrends. Note that the Dow and S&P 100
bounced off their uptrend lines today.
