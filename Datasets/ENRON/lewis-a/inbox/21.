As long term subscribers know, we have been more upbeat
than most in our economic outlook.  Now the recession
has disappeared and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
has exceeded the Nikkei.  What more could one ask for ?
We had always believed that prior to September 11th a
recession would have been avoided, but we were hoping that
the Dow would exceed the Nikkei at "somewhat" higher
levels.  All kidding aside, though, last week was positive.

To almost everyone's surprise, 4th Qtr GDP was positive,
but barely so.  So, for the record, at least until the
revisions are released, 2001 GDP growth by quarter was
+, +, -, +.  That doesn't officially qualify as a recession,
but there certainly was a profits recession, and that's
what counts.  Nonetheless, there is a message in the data.

Specifically, if such a mild "recession" can cause such a
severe erosion in corporate profits, the "flip-side"
should be that leverage works both ways.  In other words,
as the economy recovers, profits could surprise on the
upside, even as we believe overall economic growth will
disappoint by "snapping back" less than consensus.

Although the 4th qtr GDP number was driven by consumer
spending, the personal income data imply that the consumer
should not hunker down.  The gain was the best since December
of last year, and with auto companies already announcing
deals, the price sensitive shopping trends should continue.

The other noteworthy item in the GDP report was the huge
drop in inventories, and yet overall GDP was still positive.
With consumer spending likely to be maintained, it seems
highly likely that the inventory correction is over, and
that production will have to increase in the near future.
In fact, some of the lead reports already imply that is
the case - say the new orders component of the Chicago
Purchasing Managers' Index.

The Labor Department Report was also a positive surprise.
However, at year end there are a lot of cross currents in
the numbers so we wouldn't read too much into the decline
in the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, it could have some
psychological significance, and help maintain the more
upbeat tone of consumer confidence.

And finally, there is the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) and their decision to leave rates unchanged, but
to maintain their bias toward lower rates.  As you know,
we expected the former, but thought they would remove
the bias given the rise in consumer confidence and the
three consecutive monthly gains in the leading indicators
series.  It appears that they are trying to micro manage
expectations, as the bias is clearly not needed.

My point is simply that Chairman Greenspan appears to be
becoming increasingly sensitive to financial market
reactions to the FRB's actions of any kind.  He went out
of his way to "correct" the negative impression, we would
argue misinterpretation, of one of his speeches.  Our view
now is that he wanted to leave the bias in place to drive
home his view, and ours, that the recovery will not be sharp.
And, of course, at a subsequent meeting they can remove the
bias, to reinforce perceptions of recovery.  We think such
an approach is a tad too cute, but probably harmless.

Overall, we obviously continue to like the economic data.
It supports our view of a recovery by Spring, if one hasn't
already begun.  Under such a scenario, earnings estimates
should at least hold, taking pressure off the stock market.
We'll see, but at the moment we like the risk/reward ratio.
