significantly help us deter any copyright infringements. Thanks.
2.  Although you are ultimately responsible for these assignments, you can
ask people who work for you to help you with them. Please keep in mind that
if you choose this method, you should review the content before handing in
the assignment.

Finally, and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the ability of our BRM project to
stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me or Monica ahead of time and provide an
estimated time for completion.

Thank you and keep up the good work!
