Photos, music, important documents?
Now that everything is on your computer, copy it
The EPO CD Backup Duplicator makes flawless copies of any format CD, including audio, data or video.

To make backup copies of CDs, you typically need a CD reader (CD-ROM) for the source disk you are copying, a CD burner (CD-R or CD-RW) to write the copy CD, and a computer with appropriate software to format the files. The EPO CD Backup Duplicator does it all-easily and automatically-without the need of a computer. Most duplicating procedures may not be able to copy certain protected files. But CD Backup uses a technology called "image copy" to duplicate the exact same data found on the original disk. The EPO CD Backup can flawlessly duplicate any format of compact disk, even protected ones (see warning below). The CD Backup is the right choice for excellent accuracy.
You can use CD Backup to copy important data and application files for safe storage. And you can use the duplicator to create your own personal audio disks from tracks taken from your own personal CD collection.*

Disclaimer:  EPO CD Back-up should be used only for backing up personal data and compiling personal audio tracks.  Any copyright of material in a source disk belongs to the author and/or company which issued the disk.  Unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material is strictly prohibited.
