1. INTERNET STOCK OUTLOOK

By Jerry Yeung

Rising five of the past six sessions, the Nasdaq Composite Index pulled
within striking distance of its May 22 peak of 2328.05. For the week, the
tech-heavy index has risen 114.56, or 5.3%, to close at 2264 Thursday -
hurdling resistance at 2250.  All the while, the market has ignored renewed
signs of economic weakness and more warnings on the corporate front.
Instead, investors focused on the increased likelihood of more interest rate
cuts and shadowy signals that the worst of the downturn may have passed.
Confirming economic weakness alluded to in April durable goods orders, new
and existing home sales and purchasing managers' data for May, Tuesday's
numbers showed April factory orders fell a bigger-than-expected 3.0% and
first-quarter productivity was revised lower to minus-1.2%.

25-Basis Point Cut Expected at Next Meeting

In response to such weakness, the futures market has priced in a 100% chance
of a 25-basis point cut in interest rates when the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meets June 26 and 27. The market is giving just slight
consideration to a 50-point cut - likely in recognition of the 250-points
already slashed from the Fed funds rate since the beginning of the year.
Which leads us to a big reason for the market's recent rally. Flooded with
"cheap" money, investors appear willing to bet on a recovery in the second
half of the year - evident as they latch on to suggestion of the sort, while
ignoring blatantly negative warnings.  Two such examples of this were
chipmakers Broadcom (BRCM) and National Semiconductor (NSM), both rallying
after dismal earnings warnings Thursday. Both noted signs of stabilization
and hopes for a turnaround later this year.

Ailing telecom-equipment maker Lucent Technologies (LU) was an unlikely tech
giant reaffirming third-quarter guidance Tuesday, while semiconductor
kingpin Intel (INTC) reiterated its second-quarter guidance and predicted
"?a seasonally stronger second half" on Thursday.  With the market
apparently ready to take on the second-quarter earnings warning season, the
notion that Wall Street usually gears down for the summer months may prove
untrue - analogous to how many expected the market to outperform during the
winter months.

Chip Stocks Expected to Take the Lead

Thursday's exceptional strength among chip stocks, which powered the
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up nearly 8% to just under 700 - a key
resistance level - may provide clues as to where the market goes from here.
It is generally accepted that movements in the chip sector lead the broader
market moves by about a month and the broader market leads the economy by
about six months.  While few believe that stocks are ready to return to
their heights, overly cautious strategies may miss some steady gains.

Next Week

The economic calendar is fairly heavy, with the May retail sales figures
scheduled for release Wednesday, the May Producer Price Index (PPI) Thursday
and the May Consumer Price Index (CPI), capacity utilization and industrial
production numbers on Friday.  Several tech firms are scheduled to check in
with earnings. Among them are NaviSite (NAVI), Engage (ENGA), CMGI (CMGI),
Leitch Technology (LVID) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).
