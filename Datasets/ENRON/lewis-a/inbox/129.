June 8, 2001 - Juniper Networks spoiled Intel's party on Friday, as the
router maker upstaged Intel's positive earnings preannouncement with an
earnings warning.

Traders were also unnerved by a software glitch that caused the New York
Stock Exchange to shut down for more than an hour in the morning.

The ISDEX http://www.wsrn.com/apps/ISDEX/ lost 9 to 259, and the Nasdaq
dropped 48 to 2215. The S&P 500 declined 12 to 1264, and the Dow fell 113
to 10,977. Volume fell to 859 million shares on the NYSE, and 1.42 billion
on the Nasdaq, but the decline was largely due to the NYSE shutdown.
Decliners led 17 to 13 on the NYSE, and 21 to 15 on the Nasdaq. For
earnings reports, visit our earnings calendar at

Juniper (NASDAQ:JNPR) plunged 8.47 to 38.16 after announcing that earnings
will be 8-9 cents a share, well under 24-cent estimates. The company also
declined to provide guidance beyond the June quarter. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)
fell 1.25 to 20.57, Avici (NASDAQ:AVCI) lost .90 to 9.42, Ciena
(NASDAQ:CIEN) dropped 5.60 to 56.24, and Tellabs (NASDAQ:TLAB) fell to a
new 52-week low of 30.92.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) slipped .47 to 30.67 after saying revenues will be
"slightly below the midpoint" of the range it provided on April 17.
Traders took the reaffirmation as good news initially, but then the stock
lost ground after the Juniper warning. Handspring (NASDAQ:HAND), off .90
to 8, issued an earnings warning.

i2 (NASDAQ:ITWO) added .85 to 24.09 on rumors of contract wins.

Verity (NASDAQ:VRTY) surged 4.04 to 23.35 on a positive earnings
preannouncement.

Openwave (NASDAQ:OPWV) fell 2.15 to 40.15 after Chairman Alain Rossmann,
the "Father of WAP," resigned to security start-up Secret Seal.

NetZero (NASDAQ:NZRO) and Juno (NASDAQ:JWEB) announced they will merge,
forming a new company called United Online. Both companies will become
wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Liberate (NASDAQ:LBRT) surged 1.55 to 9.53 on a Wall Street Journal report
that the company plans to scale back its interactive TV service in favor
of a less complex version, which could help the company with AT&T.

Some technical comments on the market: Note: We include charts in the
technical market commentary. If you can't get the charts via the e-mail
newsletter version, try this link:

The Dow (first chart), the S&P 500 (second chart), and the S&P 100 (third
chart) all broke their most recent uptrends today (the lower black
trendlines), and also kept the potential head-and-shoulder tops intact.
Those potential tops make 1250 on the S&P 500 and 642 on the S&P 100
critical support. The Nasdaq (fourth chart) and Nasdaq 100 (fifth chart)
are forming similar topping patterns, making the 2100-2175 range on the
Nasdaq and 1760-1850 on the Nasdaq 100 important support. Finally, also on
the Nasdaq (sixth chart), notice how MACD and PPO, two very good trend
indicators over the last year, are giving sell signals but are trying to
turn up (the arrows). Also note the declining volume since the May 22 top.
That could support the formation of a right shoulder on a head and
shoulders top, or it could just make the whole move since then a bull
market correction, with perhaps one more downleg coming. When that
downtrend line on the volume indicator breaks, the next big move should
come. Next week is options expiration, typically an up week, but the
following week could potentially mark the beginning of a strong move down.
