CORRECTION: In the May 31 Media Grok, we reported that television ads
for Outpost.com were aired during the Super Bowl. That was not the
case. Also, we misattributed a quote by a PC Connection spokesman to
that company's CEO. We regret the errors.

Juno and NetZero: A Skeptic's Field Day

Unfortunately for Juno and NetZero, the press seemed to use news of
the free ISPs' planned merger as a refresher course in being
skeptical, with virtually all outlets expressing doubt about the
combined company's prospects for success. Witness TheStreet.com's
George Mannes: "Divided they'd fall. Now the question is whether
united they'll stand." And that's one of the nicer characterizations.

Reporters had no trouble rounding up analysts and other observers to
suggest that the deal, which would make United Online, as the new
company will be called, second only to America Online in subscribers,
won't ultimately have much effect on the companies' sagging fortunes.
Heck, even NetZero CEO Mark Goldston, who will head the new company,
said the free ISP idea isn't all it was once cracked up to be, telling
the San Jose Mercury News, "The free model absolutely works when you
put usage limits on it. Free doesn't work when you don't have the
capital and you can't wait out the advertising downturn."

The Wall Street Journal talked to Earthlink president Michael S.
McQuary, who didn't miss a chance to get a jab in at the competition:
"When you add more weight to a sinking ship, it just sinks faster."

A few outlets mentioned that the merger will put an end to the
quarreling that's been going on between Juno and NetZero for the last
year or so; others focused on the companies' furious struggles to
convert free users into paid. Under the new agreement, free service
will be offered under the NetZero name, while those lucrative paid
subscribers - currently only 1 million of the companies' 7 million
customers, as outlets were happy to point out - will belong to the
Juno brand name. (Griped one analyst to the L.A. Times, "They'll just
lose money cooperatively.")

Though the $70.7 million agreement between the companies was widely
described as a merger, that term, as usual, has a very flexible
definition. NetZero stockholders would own about 61.5 percent of the
company, and Juno president Charles Ardai would slip off to sunnier
climes while NetZero's Goldston takes over, once the deal is completed
later this year. As for United Online's prospects, the folks at
SatireWire weighed in, running a short piece with the headline "Juno,
NetZero Merger to Create Largest ISP to Someday Declare Bankruptcy."
How's that for skeptical? - Michaela Cavallaro

Microsoft Supplies the Missing Links

Microsoft celebrated the one-year anniversary of a federal judge's
order to break up the company by stirring a fresh firestorm of media
criticism over a new feature that enables its browser to add links to
other publishers' Web sites.

The feature, Smart Tags, shows up on the browser and on some Office
applications in test versions of Microsoft's Windows XP operating
system, set to be released on Oct. 25. When a page loads into
Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the browser can identify words in the
text and attach links to Microsoft's own sites, or sites Redmond is
friendly with.

News.com's Joe Wilcox reported the feature on Wednesday, describing it
primarily as a way to build links from applications such as
Microsoft's Excel spreadsheets to Microsoft's Web services. Ticker
symbols in a spreadsheet could link to company information on
Microsoft's MSN MoneyCentral site. Wilcox quoted analysts who wrung
their hands over the prospect of Microsoft hijacking visitors to its
own sites. "Wouldn't that be something," Gartner analyst Michael
Silver said. "You spend millions of dollars designing a Web site, and
Microsoft has a Smart Tag that sends (users) to one of (Microsoft's)
own sites." Grok wonders if Judge Jackson would find that to be
something.

On Thursday, Wall Street Journal columnist Walter Mossberg turned up
the heat, calling Smart Tags "something new and dangerous." A
Microsoft official had the gall to tell Mossberg the feature will
spare users from "underlinked" sites. Supposedly, the feature will
come turned off by default in new browsers, and Web site publishers
will be able to add a tag to their pages to block the feature. "If the
feature is so benign," Mossberg writes, "why is Microsoft hiding it
and offering sites a way to block it?"

By Thursday afternoon, the war drums were pounding. On Slashdot,
notice of the tags drew, predictably, several hundred damning comments
from Redmond-baiters, and hoots of chortling, cynical laughter at
Michael Silver's comment on News.com that "I don't think there's any
nefarious plot."

Nick Wingfield's report in Friday's Wall Street Journal quoted
UserLand Software chief executive (and sometimes Microsoft critic)
Dave Winer saying, "It's creepy. It's bad. ... They don't have the
right to modify my work." Microsoft appears to be already tugging
nervously at its collar; a spokesman reminded us that "things
sometimes change from the time they're in beta to the time they ship."
Looks like there's plenty of time to change the code, or at least
change the spin. - David Sims

Everything's Coming Up Semiconductors

Maybe it's the approach of the weekend or the nearness of summer, but
all it takes are a few words from Intel, and the bulls are on the
loose. In its first-ever mid-quarter conference call (thanks to those
pesky SEC regulations that make companies share their secrets with all
investors, not just selected analysts), Intel said things aren't
really as bad as they seem. As Bloomberg put it, "the largest
chipmaker said second-quarter sales will be at the lower end of its
estimates, surprising investors who had expected less."

In a conference call variously described as "positive," "upbeat" and
"relatively good," Intel execs expounded on the wonders of what they
said is a rebounding PC market. Analysts - and reporters, for that
matter - would love for that to be true; one analyst told Bloomberg,
"This is almost like a status quo announcement, and these days, that's
mildly positive." TheStreet.com mentioned, however, that the company
is "a bit of a lone voice in the personal computer sector right now,"
since other manufacturers are still saying the market is weak.

Andy Bryant, Intel CFO, did acknowledge that the communications-chip
part of Intel's business is still lousy and getting worse, though he
added that the second half of the year should be better as regular
seasonal ordering patterns pick up. Not so fast, cautioned the
Financial Times: "Last year the traditionally strong second half for
Intel did not materialize. Also, a large part of its revenues are
usually booked in the final few weeks of its quarter, which makes it
more difficult for the company to know at the mid-quarter if it will
meet its prior expectations."

Even National Semiconductor's news that it "expects a deep loss and a
further decline in sales in the current quarter," according the Wall
Street Journal, didn't dampen anyone's spirits. Nat Semi, as the
Journal chummily called it, did manage to beat its own lowered
earnings expectations, and the San Jose Mercury News reported that CEO
Brian Halla "offered a slight glimmer of hope for the downtrodden
communications sector." These days, it seems, that's enough to make a
bull out of the gloomiest investor. - Michaela Cavallaro
