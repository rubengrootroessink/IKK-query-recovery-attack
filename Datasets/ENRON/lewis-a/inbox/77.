D-Level Alert.

Read below for a free DiNapoli Alert, but first
mark your calendars: We will be in Washington DC
for the Traders Library Technical Analysis forum
June 22-23.. See details here:
http://www.traderslibrary.com/forum/

The markets recently pushed though major resistance,
with the DOW making a sudden 342-point up-move! We
warned of the potential for that up-move 4 days before it
happened!

To see how we assess the market, and how we made this
great market call, follow this link:
