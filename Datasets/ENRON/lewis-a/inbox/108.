THE WEEK/Let The Bells Have It

"The lack of cheap, always-on, last-mile broadband connections to small
offices and homes is a short leash around the U.S. economy's neck. Yes,
taxes are too high, especially those on capital formation. We hope
Congress will figure out what every businessman knows: This recession is
investment-led. And yes, the Fed should drop its funds rate to 3%. And
yes, there is huge inventory overhang everywhere you look in IT. If all
that isn't enough to give you a bad hair day, ponder the telco debt bomb
that threatens to blow up Wall Street.

"The dot-com boom started in 1995 and went bust in 2000. Every dolt
imagined he was a venture investor. There was overfunding galore, idiot
businesses up the gazoo--and then pfft. Net Boom, Act II awaits. It will
occur when a catalyst technology changes everything, just as the 386 chip
and graphics transformed PCs. What the Net awaits is obvious: cheap
broadband (enough for streaming video) and always-on connections.

"Already I can hear skeptics howling that bandwidth demand is not a sure
thing, that the dogs will never eat it. But who can forecast demand
without the supply that fires the imagination and stirs entrepreneurs to
create radically new uses, not just extensions? Who in 1984 ever guessed
that most CEOs would use e-mail by 1998? Who in 1989 imagined the
necessity of Web-based supply-side chains, let alone the Web? How accurate
is it ever to gauge, say, traffic for a proposed bridge by counting ferry
boats and swimmers? Forget last-mile as you know it today: clunky DSL or
cable modem service. These are mere swimmers and ferry boats. The bridge
will come when last-mile connections are easy to order (one phone call or
Web click); quick to deliver (the very next day); always on (like
electricity in, uh, 49 states); and cheap ($20 a month or less). When the
dogs are served that, they'll eat till they burst."

Nobody makes the bandwidth case better than our great friend and tireless
Silicon Valley watcher Rich Karlgaard. Read the full text of "Let The
Bells Have It" at

BIOTECH WATCH: Old Stem Cells Do It Better

"All systems were go for federally funded embryo stem-cell research at the
National Institutes of Health. New guidelines bequeathed by the Clinton
administration for skirting a congressional ban were in place. A meeting
to review the first applications for grants was set for mid-April, when
NIH's acting director Ruth Kirschstein suddenly received the word from on
high: cancel the meeting. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson wanted a chance to review the new guidelines. Some NIH
researchers were aghast.

"What's all the fuss about? Stem cells represent a mother lode of possible
new treatments for diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and
more. Capable of differentiating into the full spectrum of other cell
types--from a new liver cell to a new neuron--they could be ideal for
repairing or replacing diseased organs. The furor is not over their
usefulness, but their source: Should researchers use aborted or discarded
human embryos? Or should they be restricted to adult stem-cells, found in
fat, bone, and the brain?

"Those ethical questions are riveting, but they are being trumped by the
market, specifically the venture investment market, which is voting with
its dollars for adult stem-cell research. The universe of established
companies doing stem-cell research encompasses about 30 public and private
biotechnology firms. Of these, fewer than half are involved primarily in
developing treatments from stem cells. And only two of those 15 pure-play
companies do significant work with embryonic cells."

Dr Scott Gottlieb, Gilder's newest analyst, dives into the stem-cell
debate in June's issue of The American Spectator. Read the full text at

FRIDAY BONUS/Gelernter Live

Venerable Peter Drucker argues that the greatest profits go to whoever
supplies the key missing element in a technology, igniting new spirals of
advance. Think Windows or CDMA and you have the idea.

With an elegant software application called Scopeware, Yale's prodigal
David Gelernter could hold a similar key to unlocking the pent-up power
stemming from the intersection of big bandwidth and data storage--what we
call the storewidth paradigm. At our Storewidth 2001 conference in Laguna
Niguel in April, edited excerpts from a videotaped interview we did with
Gelernter in New Haven earlier this year riveted the house. Now we're
making the full two-hour conversation available for the first time. Tune
in now, at www.gilder.com.
