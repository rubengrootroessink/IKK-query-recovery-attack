Catch of the Day: Balance of power

The California power grid is finally getting some official
attention from the federal government. When President Bush
was in Los Angeles a week ago, he met with Governor Gray
Davis, and also with 13 business leaders, to discuss the
energy situation here.

As widely reported, the Democrats' response to the visit was
not positive, since Mr. Bush declined to favor price
controls to help ease California's power bill.

However, Mr. Bush's reluctance means opportunity for
entrepreneurs. One of the 13 attendees at the energy
roundtable was John Woolard, CEO of Silicon Energy. He told
me that Mr. Bush, who clearly trusts the supply side to
modulate prices, appeared extremely interested in the
ability Silicon Energy has to "send price signals" into the
system. John's company makes energy monitoring systems; he
has a technological solution for the free market.

John has something for the Dems, too: he said Governor Davis
is keen to install Silicon Energy's systems into state
buildings. That's not surprising, since without federal
assistance, California's government is going to have a
pretty big power bill itself.

Energy management makes sense even absent politics. So I
hope that after the crisis is over, we continue to use power
more intelligently.
