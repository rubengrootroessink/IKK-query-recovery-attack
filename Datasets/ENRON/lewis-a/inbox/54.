On April 2nd, when everyone was calling for lower lows, we predicted
Dow support at the 9400-9450 area. Days later the market had rallied
from there an incredible 780 points!

Also, our Double-RePo pattern called the market top in January 2000,
before the recent bear market. This is when Joe suggested traders move
to cash etc.. It was a truly classic DiNapoli pattern, with excellent
advice from Joe too!

You can learn how these market calls were calculated
on the following web pages:
