Andy,
It was great to see you at the end of last week. The rest of the weekend flew by as George packed in 8 am golf games on Saturday and Sunday.Plus, visiting with guests, never gives one the time they need to relax or visit with friends. I hope you had a good rest.
I just wanted to send you a quick note to say hi and let you know that I am here if you need anything - and I am serious when i extend an open invitation to Connecticut. 
Keep in touch,
Always, Robyn
