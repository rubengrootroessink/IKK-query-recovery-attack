Andy,

We are in the process of finalizing the high level design for the Risk
Management Simulation and need your input on some details. Please focus on
the trader tasks; I have provided the structurer tasks FYI.  If you could
please provide your feedback by noon on Wednesday, it will help ensure that
the BRM Deal stays on schedule and on budget.

I have attached two documents:
1) Simulation Flow
   Depicts the flow of the learner's tasks through the simulation
   Provides context for the "Learner Tasks" document (see below)
   Please respond with any concerns or questions about the flow (For
   example,  tasks are out of order; two tasks are listed separately that
   should be combined, etc.)

2) Learner Tasks
   Provides a detailed description of each task the learner will complete
   Please answer the italicized questions in the document (the questions
   are written throughout the chart; a list of all the questions can be
   found at the end of the document)
   Please edit any points you would like to change (For example, a key
   learner decision is missing, we are giving the learner a piece of
   information that they should be calculating or gathering on their own,
   etc.)
   The easiest way to edit this document is to: 1) Detach the file from
   this e-mail and save it on your hard drive. 2) Open the document and
   track changes by selecting Tools/Track Changes/Highlight Changes; check
   all 3 check-boxes, and click OK. 3) Answer the questions and make any
   necessary edits 4) Attach the document to an e-mail and send it back to
   me

This is a critical week for our team; we need to finalize these details as
soon as possible in order to move on to detailed design. If you will be
unable to review these documents by Wednesday, please let me know when you
will be able to provide your input.

Thank you for your help. If you have any questions, you can reach me at
5-6676.
Mery
