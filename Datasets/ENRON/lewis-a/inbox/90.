How Did We Get Here?

Just like almost every other profession -- medicine,
law, and politics included -- affiliate marketing has a
checkered past. Worse, affiliate marketing seems to have a
checkered present. Where's the problem -- and the solution?
In corporate organizational structures.

An Affiliate Marketing Primer: Chapter III

You've set the affiliate program's objective and figured
out the offer. You've found the right outsourcing partner,
measured the results, and marketed the program. What's
next? Care for and feed affiliates -- or if they're
fraudsters, weed them out.

The Proof's in the Presentation

A presentation to an investor can border on pleading -- or
worse, it can become an inquisition. Greg and Emily offer
some basic tips that every entrepreneur should know to make
a solid presentation -- whether to investors, a board, or
the staff.

Going Global With Internet Marketing

Global Internet marketing -- and the electronic commerce
associated with it -- is predicted to escalate dramatically
in the next several years. The possibilities are ever-so
pleasing. Yet some barriers are all-too real. The good news
is, they're surmountable.
