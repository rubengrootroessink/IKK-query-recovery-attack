Simtek Adds Manufacturing Capacity

Simtek Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: SRAM), is adding
equipment required to increase manufacturing volumes of its
nonvolatile memory products.

In cooperation with its subcontract test facility, Amkor Test Services
of Wichita, Kansas, Simtek is installing additional printed circuit
boards required to electrically exercise nvSRAM products. The
equipment is specifically designed to support 32 pin surface mount
packaging used for 256Kbit devices. The equipment will be on line
and operational by the end of June, increasing manufacturing
capacity of STK14C88N parts by 30%.

``Last year, industry-wide silicon wafer shortages restricted our
ability to supply the market demand for some products,'' stated
Douglas Mitchell, Simtek's president and CEO. ``That shortage is
now resolved, so we are addressing the remaining issues to increase
production output. It is imperative that we continue to invest the
resources required to support our customers' needs.''

Simtek Corporation delivers the world's fastest re-programmable
nonvolatile semiconductor memories and the industry's most
cost-effective FPGA to ASIC conversions. Information on Simtek
products can be obtained from its web page: www.simtek.com;
email: info@simtek.com; by calling (719) 531-9444; or fax (719)
531-9481. The company is headquartered in Colorado Springs,
Colorado, with international sales and marketing channels. Simtek is
listed under the symbol SRAM on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
Board.
