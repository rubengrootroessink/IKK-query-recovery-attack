New Research Report From Dr. Ed Yardeni:

STOCK MARKET CYCLES: BOTTOM FISHING
http://www.yardeni.com/public/mktcycle.pdf

During bear markets, stock investors and investment strategists are
constantly on the lookout for the bottom. This time is no different. Indeed,
many of them thought they caught it at the beginning of April this year.
They were wrong.

Picking the exact bottom can be very rewarding, of course. Since 1960, there
have been nine major troughs in the S&P 500, following declines of 15% or
more and averaging minus 24%. After these cyclical lows in stock prices, the
average 12-month gain was an impressive 28%.

In this special issue of the Global Strategist's Handbook, I present
numerous charts relating key economic and financial indicators to the cycle
in stock prices with the focus on finding the ones that are most useful in
picking bottoms. My conclusion is that many of the ones that have worked
best in the past are currently suggesting that the panic-selling low of
September 21 was probably "the" bottom for this cycle.

There are no guarantees: Past performance does not indicate future results,
as we say in the investment business. The low might be retested. A lower low
might still be in the cards. Moreover, even if it was the bottom, the
rebound in stock prices over the next 12 months may be well below the
average, in my judgment, because stocks are not as undervalued as they were
at previous bottoms.

One of the best times to buy stocks is during crises, when panic selling
occurs. The crises usually trigger corrective policy responses, which prove
the doomsayers wrong. So they present great buying opportunities for bargain
hunters. Of course, this is easier said than done. For example, during the
first week that the stock market was open for trading after the Attack, the
right time to buy was on Friday, not Monday. By the end of the following
week, most of the bargains were gone.

Exhibits 3-18 in my latest research report show many of the best market
timing tools, (including a few that are not as useful as widely believed):
price-to-earnings ratios, valuation, the federal funds rate, bond yields,
the yield curve, credit-quality yield spreads, earnings, production,
commodity prices, employment, and money.

Most institutional investors can't raise a great deal of cash while waiting
for the next crisis to create buying opportunities. Most tend to be always
fully invested, so market timing may not be a very relevant exercise for
them. Nevertheless, market timing can help boost performance by identifying
sectors and industries that tend to either underperform or outperform during
a cyclical recovery in stock prices. Exhibits 19-48 in this report are
designed to provide some insights for the selected industries where relative
performance data are available for several years.
