The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.
