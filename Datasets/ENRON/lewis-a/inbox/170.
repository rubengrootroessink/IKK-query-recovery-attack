Dear Gordon,
Let me help you improve Continental:
I have called customer service three times in order to receive a
confirmation of my upcoming flight.  I have asked for an eticket
confirmation sent to me via regular mail and an e-mail.  My flight is now
nine days away, and I still haven't received any confirmation.  If you
can't handle the simple task of sending a letter or an e-mail, how can I
trust you to run an airline?

This is not the first time I have had problems with your company.  After
having used the online services of American; United; and Continental, I
have found your service to be vastly inferior.

Although it is difficult to avoid Continental when flying out of Houston,
I am going to do my best from now on.
Would you like a response from someone at Continental? Yes
