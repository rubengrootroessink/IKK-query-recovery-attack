HotToday: Futures - http://ctsTrader.com

______June the 8th, 2001__________
-------------------------------------------------------
CTS HOT TODAY: FUTURES
By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 3, Number 113___________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today: Futures
is to help you prepare for the trading day ahead.
--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (06/08)
--------------------------------------------------------
"Develop your own favorite Indicators"

Every trader has his or her favorite indicators much like a bass
pro has favorite lures and color combinations. In my opinion, it
is very important to develop confidence and a mastery of a few good
indicators, before attempting to learn too many.

A powerful lesson I've learned is the importance of
keeping my trading method simple. When I keep things simple, it makes
it easier to understand my results. There's nothing better than to
completely understand your method to a point of mastery. Many positive
things,
including a deeper conviction in your trading will start to emerge.

I have complete confidence in this approach:

#1 - Utilize the CTS Futures Selector as a trend condition to select
the futures markets to trade. I trade all three categories.

#2 - Utilize daily and hourly stochastics for setting up the trade.
I look for trend confirmation signals as a primary set-up condition.

#3 - Elliott wave counts are utilized for timing entries and establishing
price targets. The wave counts are done by me personally and give me a road
map structure to follow for the 1-3 day period (hourly)1-3 week period
(daily).

Key Technical Developments (close of 06/07)
-------------------------------------------------------
Wow, talk about a dead cat bounce! Have you seen what Gold has done
lately. A break below support near 266 opens the door for a $10/oz
drop! Friday's COT report for commercials will be big! If they
have held onto large short position, then look out below! I can smell
small spec bottom feeding.

The seasonal of corn over wheat continues to work as Mr. Bernstein
outlined in High Odds Seasonals. Jake has offered many ctsTrader.com
subscribers some great seasonal reco's this year!

Check out the pattern in August Feeders! A breakout above today's
high will trigger a trend confirmation buy signal on hourly charts.
