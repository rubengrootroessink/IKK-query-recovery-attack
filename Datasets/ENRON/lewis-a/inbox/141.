EquityAlert.com.     TheSUBWAY.com Announces Investment Opinion: Falling In=
terest Rates Improve Income?   WESTON, Fla., Oct 29, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -=
- Monday's stock market standouts include Globalstar, (Nasdaq:GSTRF), TheSu=
bway.com's premarket pick for Monday, up 121% on new business news, Ariad P=
harmaceuticals Inc., (Nasdaq: ARIA), up 39% on discovery of new drug, TRSG =
Corp., (OTCBB:TSGO), up 83% on new product line, eConnect (OTCBB:ECNC), up =
48% on 26 million shares, and Verado Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:VRDO), up 23% o=
n business unit sale.   "In short, analysts say that falling interest rates=
 improve the incomes of those still employed, which can help prop up the wo=
rld's largest economy even as job losses climb. So, rising unemployment may=
 not necessarily mean a subsequent drop in consumer demand. Still, investor=
s are mired in the uncertainty of the times, keeping volatility in the fina=
ncial markets at an excessive level." Stated Peter Antipatis. More availabl=
