The STOCK INDEXES closed lower on Friday as today's halt in trading
on the big board due to software problems caused nervous traders and
investors to dump stocks ahead of the weekend. This led to the
posting of a key reversal down in September S&P's and a lower close
in the Nasdaq. Additional weakness in both markets on Monday would
increase the odds that the corrective bounces off the late-May lows
might have run their course for the time being.

The Dow closed lower on Friday due in part to today's software
glitch, which halted trading on the big board for the first time
since 1998. Nervous traders dumped stocks due to uncertainties over
the half in trading as the decline off Tuesday's high continues.
Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's setback
signaling that additional weakness is possible. Closes below last
week's low crossing at 10,835.40 would renew the Dow's decline off
May's high and set the stage for a test of May's low crossing at
10,673.20 later this month.

INTEREST RATES September bonds closed lower on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's key reversal down. Today's decline turned a
number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that the
corrective bounce off the late-May low might have come to an end with
Thursday's high. Additional weakness on Monday could lead to an
eventual test of broken trendline resistance drawn across this
spring's highs.

The CRB INDEX posted a key reversal up on Friday erasing all of this
week's losses in the process. Strength in oilseeds, hogs, bellies,
some precious metals, foods, fiber and crude oil underpinned today's
rally. Today's high-range close leaves the door open for a steady to
higher opening on Monday as closes above 211.75 would renew the
rebound off the late-May low crossing at 208.43. Momentum indicators
are oversold and are turning neutral warning bears to use caution, as
additional short covering is possible during June.

ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Friday due to short covering as they
consolidated some of this week's losses ahead of the weekend. Gains
were limited as worries over refinery snags and crude oil offloading
affected by stormy weather in the U.S. Gulf dissipated.

July crude oil rebounded on Friday erasing all of this week's losses
to post a positive close for the week. Momentum indicators are
oversold and turning neutral to bullish hinting that a short-term low
was posted with Wednesday's spike of this year's uptrend line. It
will take closes above 29.05 to temper the near-term bearish outlook
in the market.

July heating oil posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. Closes above this week's
high at 78.40 would confirm that Wednesday's low marked a double
bottom, which coincides with the 38% retracement level of the
December/May rally crossing at 75.66.

July unleaded gas closed slightly higher on Friday as it extended
Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's trendline
breakout. Session lows tested the 50% retracement level crossing at
88.93. This week's trendline breakout has opened the door for
additional weakness during June. If the decline resumes, the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 85.62 is July's
next target. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) remains in a
bearish mode signaling that additional weakness is possible.

July Henry Hub natural gas posted a key reversal up on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. Forecasts calling for a
warm-up across the Midwest next week and continued heat in the South
are expected to raise demand for natural gas, which triggered today's
rally. Closes above 4.179 or below 3.67 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market.

CURRENCIES The September Dollar closed slightly higher on Friday as
it continues to grind sideways to higher this spring. The daily ADX
(a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that additional
strength is possible as the door remains open for a test of weekly
resistance crossing at 121.50 later this month. It would take closes
below May's uptrend line crossing near 118.62, which coincides with
gap support to signal that a short-term top has likely been posted.

The September Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Friday due to
light short covering ahead of the weekend. September continues to
consolidate above the contract lows but remains poised to renew this
spring's decline possibly next week. Wednesday's key reversal down is
still a warning to traders that the underlying tone of the market
remains weak. The daily ADX is still in a bearish trend mode
signaling that additional weakness is possible.

The September Canadian Dollar extended this week's rally as it spiked
above the 62% retracement level of this winter's decline crossing at
.6573. If this resistance level is clear, gap resistance beginning at
.6600 is September's next upside target. Closes below broken
resistance crossing at .6541 would increase the odds that a
short-term top has likely been posted. Momentum indicators are
bullish but overbought warning bulls to use caution as a short-term
top might be near.

The September Japanese Yen renewed this week's decline with a lower
close on Friday. The setback from last week's high has returned
September to this spring's trading range. Momentum indicators have
turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices during the
first half of June are possible. If the decline continues, gap
support crossing at .8272 is September's next target.

PRECIOUS METALS August gold vaulted sharply higher on Friday due to
short covering. Trading volume was thin, which helped exaggerate
today's gains. Nevertheless, a short-term bottom has been confirmed
with the recent consolidation around the 75% retracement level of
this spring's rally crossing at 267.20. Today's rally turned
short-term momentum indicators bullish signaling that additional
gains into mid-June are possible. A setback is likely on Monday as
today's gains were overdone.

July silver also closed higher on Friday as it posted a key reversal
up. Session lows tested trading range support crossing at 4.31 cents.
Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold hinting that a
short-term bottom may have been posted with today's low. Additional
gains on Monday are needed to help confirm today's bullish reversal
pattern. Closes below 4.31 would open the door for a possible test of
weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month.

July copper plunged to new contract lows and below weekly support
crossing at 74.10 as it renewed this spring's decline. Weekly support
crossing at 72.85 is July's next target. Stochastics and RSI are
bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.
Today's sell off was triggered by fund liquidation due to concerns
over the global economy.

GRAINS July corn closed lower on following Thursday's poor close and
weekend weather forecast for the Midwest, which should allow for a
warm up that should spur improved crop development next week. Losses
were limited due to dry weather concerns in China and expectations
that next Monday's crop conditions report will come in steady to
slightly below this week's levels. Momentum indicators remain bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices into mid-June are possible.
Closes above minor resistance at $2.00 are needed to set the stage
for a possible test of May's high at 2.11 1/2 later this month.

July wheat closed fractionally lower on Friday as it consolidated
some of its late-week gains. Losses were limited due to reports of
heavy rains across parts of the hard red winter wheat belt overnight,
which raised concerns about further crop losses. Gains this week
remains limited due to sluggish world wheat demand and U.S. winter
wheat harvest, which has moved into southern Oklahoma. Closes above
2.72 or below 2.58 1/2 is needed to clear up near-term direction in
the market. Stochastics are giving a divergent buy signal hinting
that sideways to higher prices are possible next week.

SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans posted its highest close since March
13th as it extends its trading range breakout. The stage is set for a
test of March's high crossing at 4.77 1/2. Continued strength in the
cash markets along with strong foreign and domestic demand continues
to underpin the late-spring rally. Commodity funds were active buyers
across the complex buying about 1,000 contracts of soybeans. Momentum
indicators remain bullish signaling that additional gains are
possible.

July soybean meal closed sharply higher on Friday and above the 62%
retracement level crossing at 169.40 to keep this spring's uptrend
alive. Today's breakout above fib resistance has opened the door for
a possible test of the 75% retracement level of this winter's decline
crossing at 175.40 later this month. Strong foreign and domestic
demand along with a tight cash market continues to underpin meal's
rally. The daily ADX has resumed its bullish trend mode signaling
that additional strength is possible.

LIVESTOCK August hogs closed sharply higher on Friday falling just
short of the contract high at 65.95. Fund related buying along with
local short covering triggered today's rally due to tight supplies
and ideas of firming cash bids and higher cut-out values. Additional
support came from the Goldman roll as they continue to buy the August
contract. This week's rally has turned weekly momentum indicators
bullish signaling that additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see a brief period of consolidation around 65.95 next
week.

August cattle gave us the short covering bounce ahead of the weekend
that I was looking for as it consolidated some of this week's losses.
While additional short covering is possible on Monday, momentum
indicators have turned bearish warning traders that last week's high
likely marked a broad double top with January's high. Expectations
for seasonal weakness during June should continue to put pressure on
August cattle next week.

FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed slightly higher on Friday due to
short covering ahead of the weekend. July's ability to hold above the
late-May low of 57.10 leaves the door open for a short covering
bounce next week should weather forecasts for Brazil's coffee growing
region turn bullish. Momentum indicators are oversold hinting that a
short-term low is in place or near. Closes above 60.80 are needed to
temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market.

July cocoa posted an upside reversal with a higher close on Friday
due to short covering ahead of the weekend. July's inability to
sustain Thursday's move to new lows hints that a short-term low might
be in place. Stochastics and RSI are oversold warning traders not to
press the short side of the market at this time.

July sugar closed higher on Friday erasing the losses of the past two
trading sessions. While today's bounce was expected, it does bring
into question whether or not the rebound off last week's double
bottom has ended or if there is one more leg up in the correction
before the larger-degree decline off May's high resumes. Momentum
indicators are bearish but nearing their respective oversold zones
warning bears to use caution and not to press the short side of the
market at this time.

July cotton closed out the week on a high note as it continues to
rebound off the late-May lows. However, floor sources indicate that
there has been little fundamental news to support this month's short
covering rally, which leaves the market vulnerable to a resumption of
this year's decline later this month. Stochastics and RSI have turned
bullish signaling that additional short covering into mid-June is
possible. If the rebound continues, trendline resistance crossing
near 43.25 is the next target.
