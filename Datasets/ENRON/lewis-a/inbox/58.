COMMENT: In 1984, I coined the term "Bond Vigilantes" to describe the
growing power of fixed income investors and traders over the economy. In
recent years, they've lost some of their clout because the U.S. Treasury is
paying off the federal debt. Also, inflation has been relatively tame, and
so have they. Venture capitalists became the new power elite in the late
1990s leading the Nasdaq to record highs. Now the bond crowd is back: They
are tightening credit conditions, while the Fed is easing. The Treasury bond
yield is up over 50 basis points since March, which is boosting mortgage
rates. The spread between A-rated corporate and 10-year Treasury yields has
widened dramatically from around 150 basis points at the end of 1999 to more
than 250 basis points recently. The high-yield and commercial paper markets
are essentially shutdown for all but prime borrowers.

On the other hand, the yield curve is ascending again with the 30-year yield
more than 200 basis points above the 3-month T-bill rate. At the start of
the year, the curve was inverted with a spread of 50 basis points. This is
good news because an ascending yield curve gives banks and other financial
intermediaries an incentive to lend. The banks also have lots of money to
lend because shell-shocked stock investors are putting more of their funds
into bank deposits, which are up $350 billion over the past 12 months.

The resulting rapid rise in the monetary aggregates is Exhibit A in the case
against both a recession and a prolonged bear market in stocks. Indeed, real
GDP was up 2% during the first quarter and stock prices have rebounded
nicely since early April. Still, the rolling recession is likely to continue
rolling over the technology industry, and shows more signs of spreading to
labor markets around the country. Furthermore, the stock market is now more
than 15% overvalued as stock prices rose at the same time that earnings
expectations fell and bond yields moved higher.

SUBSCRIBERS: I can only conclude that either bond investors need Prozac, or
stock investors are back on Ecstasy. For more on this subject, see my latest
GLOBAL PORTFOLIO STRATEGY and tune into my Monday WEEKLY AUDIO FORUM. In my
latest commentary, I also lower my outlook for 2001 S&P 500 operating
earnings per share from $53 to $50. The profits recession is getting worse.
In the latest EARNINGS WEEK, Joe Abbott and I observe that already 132
companies have publicly released downward guidance for the second quarter!
We also slice and dice the Energy sector, which remains one of our
"overweight" recommendations.

PUBLIC: Our ONLINE CHART ROOMS are packed with Slide Shows of credit and
yield curve spreads. Did you know that Xerox is the best performing
component of the S&P 100 so far this year, followed by Microsoft? We've
added more Daily Stock Trackers to help you keep track. Check out the
important results of April's CIO Magazine Tech Survey (in partnership with
yardeni.com) on Tuesday morning at 10 am on www.peoplepolls.com.
