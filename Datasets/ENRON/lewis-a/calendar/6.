Subject:	Risk Management Simulation


I want to give you an update on the progress of the Risk Management
Simulation project, since you were unable to attend Tuesday's kickoff
meeting.

1. This is the presentation we went through at the meeting.

(See attached file: SME_Kickoff.ppt)

2. We also demonstrated a simulation for everyone. Yevgeny Frolov has a
demonstration CD with a 10-15 minute self-running simulation demo; if you
would like to view it, please contact him.

Here are the NEXT STEPS:

1. Attend the two Hexagon Sessions (sessions to design the simulation
model, or engine)
Tuesday, September 4,  3:00 - 6:00, Room 18C1, 3 Allen Center  (dinner
provided)
Monday, September 10, 3:00 - 6:00,  Room 18C1, 3 Allen Center
(If you can only attend one -- please do!  We need your help.)

2. Schedule one 2-hour individual meeting between September 4 and 7
Please e-mail sheri.a.righi@accenture.com to set up these meetings

3. Prepare for individual meeting by reviewing attached document

(See attached file: Agenda First Mtg.doc)

Thank you for your time. We look forward to seeing you on the 4th.
Don Barnhart
