FYI - once again.  First day at work has been hectic!  Unbelievable!  I moved 
again, and now I am sitting not far from you.

I remember you mentioned that you and your friends were planning a trip.  
This website is offered by the Tourism Authority of Thailand.  I took a look 
at it, and thought that it was good.  I would even use it to lure my 
boyfriend to visit home with me next year.
