Does this mean that you will consider providing this access in the near 
future?  I imagine their are quite a few employees who live in an apartment 
(almost all recent college graduates).  Considering the intentions of the 
program were to bring high technology into every employee's household, 
neglecting those that live in an apartment would make the program a failure 
in my opinion.

I would appreciate a more detailed response.

Thank you,

Andy

To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself 
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high 
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel, 
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

Andy
