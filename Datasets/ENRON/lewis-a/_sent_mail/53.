Hey Eva,

Sorry for the delay, but it has been absolutely nuts lately.  I think the 
smallest move we have had in the last 2 weeks was 30 cents.  Not to mention 8 
of the days were close to or more than $1.00.  Luckily, most of us have been 
on the right side through all this.  And lest I forget about basis.  Demarc, 
Vent, Chicago all up 70 cents.  And PEPL basis trading as high as plus 25 
cents.

Anyway, I am taking a much deserved vacation.  I will be flying to Boston 
tomorrow and coming back on Christmas.  I am looking forward to just hanging 
out with the family and spending time with my nephew.  Let me know if you are 
going to be in Boston during this time. My cell phone number is 713-306-0760.

On a completely different note, we finally got your postcard from Peru.  
Sorry to hear about the backpack fiasco, but it sounds like you had an 
incredible. time.

Looks like its about time to get outta here.  Lots of laundry and packing to 
do.
