Hi Andy,

I'm sorry I missed your call last night.  Yes, Mike and I will be there on
Friday at around 7 or 7:30pm.  Please let me know if I need to bring along
anything.  You know I can't cook, but I'll bring along candles, cake,
dessert, or a bottle of wine if you want me to.  Just let me know.  Would
you also give me direction to Trang's house, please?  Say going there from
my apartment at San Felipe and Fountainview.  Thanks a lot and I'll talk to
you more later.
