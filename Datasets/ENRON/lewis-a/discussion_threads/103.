who go to the organization's nationwide network of Learning Centers -- embr=
ace
the online community," said Cree McCree, Senior Editor, Yahoo! Internet Lif=
e.
"We also liked the way the people who meet online -- through the book group=

SeniorNet also was chosen for its enormous potential. "With its give and ta=
ke

wisdom with the world.

we're delighted to see it validated in such a prestigious forum."
