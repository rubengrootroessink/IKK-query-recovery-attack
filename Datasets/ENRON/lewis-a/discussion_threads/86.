Lazy money

Nick Denton is CEO of Moreover. Previously, he was a writer
for The Economist, and an investment banking correspondent
for the Financial Times. So it's not surprising that when he
decided to ditch news writing and start his own operation,
he picked something related to journalism -- but not a
content company. As Nick says, "Journalists don't scale."

Nick's product indexes a finite number of frequently
updated, unscalable content sites; right now, it scans more
than 2,000 sites about every 15 minutes. By comparison,
normal global search engines, from Google to Inktomi, crawl
everything and anything. Because a complete tour of the Web
can take weeks, these engines can miss current articles.

The clever part of Moreover's model is that the company is
not, strictly speaking, in the search engine business.
Instead of running machines that answer queries directly, it
exports its index to its partners (new sites and
corporations that need current market intelligence), so
their own search engines have a better content set to use.

The 50-person company partners with search companies today,
but its technology would probably make a nice snack for one
of these much-larger companies -- providing Internet stocks
go back up and make acquisitions possible again, that is.
