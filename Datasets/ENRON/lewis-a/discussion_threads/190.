Dear Fool,

Wouldn't it be great to have a time machine? If you had traveled
back to 1991 and invested a cool $10,000 in Cisco, you'd have
made more than $1 million by now. Or if you'd journeyed back to
1987 and bought a little Microsoft, well, you'd probably own a
large tropical island today.

Our lawyers aren't too hip on the whole time machine idea, so
we're offering you the next best thing=01(
