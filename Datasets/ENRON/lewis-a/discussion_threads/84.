Previous Session's Best Performing Alert

One of Monday's Before the Bell Alerts Human Genome Sciences Inc.=20
(HGSI) gained 9 points after our alert. RealTimeTraders.com offers free=20
real-time stock alerts throughout the day. Why pay for=20
chat rooms and stock pickers for old news?

Beyond The Numbers

Monday=01,s action resembles the good old days

Monday morning futures indicated for a very sharp opening. Markets=20
gapped open higher and traded lower due to the continued uncertainty=20
in the political front. However, shortly after dipping into the negative=20
territory, buyers stepped up to drive the markets higher again. Strength=20
in technology stocks helped Nasdaq outpace the blue-chip index.=20
Nasdaq finished the session higher by 97 points to close above the=20
3000 mark. Blue-chip index for its part finished the session higher by=20
only 12 points, thanks only to the strength in Intel and Microsoft. Monday,=
=20
as tech stocks picked up momentum old economy stocks went out of=20
favor. It is worth noting that we saw the same pattern of trading many=20
months ago when Nasdaq was in favor.?=20

Federal Reserve=01,s actions will take time to produce results

Monday=01,s =01&Market Analysis=018 explained why a change in interest rate=
s=20
by the FED may take many quarters to produce any meaningful effects.=20
This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates 6 times=20
beginning last June 1999 to slowdown the economy. As our readers=20
may realize the effects of all those rate hikes were not evident up until=
=20
recently. Which implies that buying stocks in anticipation of a rate hike=
=20
may not translate into a sustainable long-term rally.

Plenty of problems ahead

Monday more companies pre-announced negative earnings for their =20
upcoming quarters. We like to remind our readers there are still many=20
weeks left for pre-announcements. We at Realtimetraders.com expect=20
this quarter=01,s pre-announcements to exceed last quarter's. We also=20
believe the earnings picture for US companies to be mixed with a=20
negative bias for the next few quarters.



Sector Analysis

Momentum is starting to build in technology stocks

Despite the problems in the economy, the oversold technology stocks=20
are setting the stage for a Santa Claus rally. In Monday`s market=20
analysis we wrote of several reasons why we expect the markets to=20
see an upside move in the next few weeks. Given Monday=01,s upside=20
move in tech stocks and the fact the tech index (Nasdaq) managed to =20
close above the initial resistance level of 3000 is yet another reason=20
that leads us to believe the markets may be setting the stage for a =20
rally in the next few weeks.

Semiconductor and biotech Indices are heading higher again

Some of our readers may recall that semiconductor and biotech were=20
the 2 strongest sectors that powered the Nasdaq index to record levels=20
in early 2000. Monday=01,s best performing sectors were the 2 former=20
high-fliers. Given the momentum that is building in these sectors, it is=20
a good idea to watch these 2 sectors and the Nasdaq as a whole in=20
the next few weeks.



Economic Reports & Bond Markets

Bond markets remain quiet

As the equity markets have been rallying in the past few sessions,=20
bonds have been trading in a range. Monday long bond finished the=20
session lower by 2 ticks at 103.08. There are no major economic=20
reports due out on Tuesday.
