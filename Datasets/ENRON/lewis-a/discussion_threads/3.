Tony indicated to me that PGL would prefer to have his summer Harper 
purchases done as ENA.  The gas supply contract was set up to allow PGL to 
continue to purchase their own supply (for vendor diversity reasons I 
believe), but there is no reason ENA can't purchase this gas themselves 
(assuming that Tony's counterparties don't object to the change).  Tony will 
try to complete these transactions as ENA (or enovate, if necessary).
