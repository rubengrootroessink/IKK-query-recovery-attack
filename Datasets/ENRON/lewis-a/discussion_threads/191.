The Fed Cut Rates a half-point today.
Is this just the shock the market needs?

Dear Investor,

Just when you think the Fed is going to leave us
anxiously waiting until their planned meeting in
May...surprise...they go and cut rates a half-point,
today.  And like most investors you're probably
wondering: "Why did the Fed cut now? and "What will
this mean for the market?"

To be honest, I'm a little surprised myself at the
Fed's timing.  They've had plenty of opportunities in
the past to cut when the reason seemed crystal clear.
Today, the only insight we have into why the Fed cut
is that they saw some compelling economic data that
justified their action.  And you know what, that's
really all they need to tell us.

Now that a cut's been made the more important story
here is what this will mean for the market. While I
expect this news to bolster consumer confidence a bit
and result in a nice short-term rally, I don't believe
this half-point cut will spell relief for the entire
market for too long.  Corporate earnings are forecast
to be down in the next two quarters and that's going
to take a toll on some of the flagship stocks on Wall
Street.

So while I think a rally is in store...it's going to be
a selective one.  I strongly encourage you to take a
long, hard look at your portfolio now. I believe you
will be making a big mistake if you rely on last
year's winners to excel in this extremely difficult
economic environment.  With the market entering a
short-term upswing, this is a good time to unload some
stocks that just won't go the distance in the months
ahead and replace them with companies who will
continue to produce strong sales and earnings growth
for the remainder of the year.

We're in the midst of earnings season and while the
news from most companies hasn't been good...so far EVERY
single one of the stocks I'm recommending to investors
have surpassed Wall Street's estimates!  And while
many bellwether companies have been reporting
substantial DECLINES in their sales and profits, the
companies on my buy list are growing their sales and
profits by more than 100% on average. These are the
kind of fundamentally superior stocks that are going
to truly reward investors in the months ahead.

If you don't know where to find these companies, I can
help.  My team and I scour the market every day to
find these proven winners, and we have a track record
of 28% gains in the last 18 months that shows our
strategy produces PROFITS-no matter what the market
environment.

I'd like to share our complete list of stocks with you
today. Sign up for this special offer to my BLUE CHIP
