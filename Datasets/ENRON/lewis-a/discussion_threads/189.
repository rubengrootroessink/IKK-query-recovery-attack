Greenspan obviously sees a bumpy road ahead as he  lowers interest rates 
again. This is causing an abrupt stock market rally. The  energy markets are 
off precipitously! We seem to have located?7 million  barrels of crude 
somewhere making people believe inflation is at bay. Our belief  is that this 
will be short lived as energy consumption continues to increase  going into 
the summer months. Bad earnings, consumer confidence, and other  related news 
should remind investors where this market is going over time!

Weekly Humor:  How Deep It  Is

An American tourist was visiting a small village in Ireland when there  was a 
sudden gust of wind which blew his hat off into the middle of a nearby  pond.

Walking over to a young boy who was sitting beside the pond, the  tourist 
asked, "Say, son, how deep is this pond?"

"Oh, only a few  inches," replied the boy.

After taking his shoes off and rolling his  trousers up over his knees, the 
tourist stepped into the pond to retrieve his  hat and, within a few seconds, 
was completely submerged in the water. Swimming  out to the middle of the 
pond he finally reached his hat, and then struggled  back to edge.

Climbing out, he turned towards the boy and screamed, "Hey  you, I thought 
you said that pond was only a few inches deep!"

"Well,"  shrugged the boy, "the water only comes half way up that duck over  
there."
