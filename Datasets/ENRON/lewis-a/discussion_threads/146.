Post Election Tech Stock Alert, December 13, 2000

The never-ending election is FINALLY over...and tech
stocks are dropping yet again.  What should you do
now?  Read on for my critical post-election advice:

Dear Investor,

Don't let this happen to you...

Every time technology stocks hit a rough patch,
scaredy-cat investors run and hide...only to kick
themselves a few months later when they miss out on
the next wave of huge, unstoppable profits.

I see it happening again right now.  Everyone,
everywhere is proclaiming the end of the PC...the death
of tech-behemoths, like Intel, Cisco and Oracle...and a
never-ending tech stock bear market.  And Wall Street--
in typical knee-jerk fashion--is dumping the stocks
as fast as they possibly can.

It's happened many times before, most recently in late
1998 when everyone from here to Timbuktu was down on
technology stocks.  Four short months later, the
technology sector rocketed--with the NASDAQ Composite
up a whopping 76%.

So those of us who've been around awhile--and unlike
most of the Johnny-come-latelies you hear blathering
on CNBC, I've been analyzing technology stocks for 30
long years--can see what's coming now.

Almost every company I talk to says business is good,
orders are ahead of schedule, European demand is
unusually strong (despite the weak euro), and they are
bullish on the outlook for 2001.  And that means it's
just a matter of time--most likely weeks, once the 4th
quarter earnings announcements start in earnest and now
that it looks like the election uncertainty is finally
cleared up--before everyone and their uncle starts the
mad dash to pile as much money as they can into the tech
sector, before it once again breaks out to new heights.

But don't be fooled--there will be lots of
disappointed investors.  You see, most people will be
too slow to figure out what's really going on, and
they will inevitably jump back in at the wrong time,
missing most of the next run-up.  Don't let that
happen to you. Wall Street is handing us an especially
great opportunity right now to buy the dominant
industry leaders at absolute rock-bottom, fire-sale
prices.  Take advantage of it.

My Technology Investing readers and I did exactly that
in late 1998--and we raked in 157% profits over the
following 12 months.  You can bet your bottom we're
doing the same thing again this year.  YOU SHOULD TOO.
I urge you: If you do nothing else after reading all
the stock recommendations and other advice I've sent
you, run out and get yourself fully invested in
technology stocks right now--today.  This time around
you'll be kicking your profits all the way to the
bank!

Sincerely,
Michael Murphy
Editor, Technology Investing
