find EMC attractive at 77 1/2.  launching accumulation operations.
meaning, time perspective is 'long term core technology holding'.
unless (of course) the fundamentals deteriorate.

will they?

briefings take from a bit ago.

16-Nov-00 11:23 ET

EMC Corp. (EMC)90 +1 3/16: A forward p/e of 87x is not scaring Bank of 
America Securities from initiating coverage of the king of storage 
infrastructure
with a Strong Buy and a 12-month $120 price target. The analyst views EMC as 
a core holding for technology investors and believes storage is an essential
component of Internet infrastructure. Also, Bank of America believes EMC is 
one of five pillars of technology, joining Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and 
Sun....EMC's
two goals are: 1) while EMC dominates the storage area network (SAN) arena, 
they are looking to penetrate the network attached storage (NAS) space and 2)
increase software to reach 20% of sales. Entering the NAS field is a cause 
for concern for investors of players in that space, particularly Network 
Appliance
(NTAP), the NAS leader. EMC's management believes the company will be the 
leader in the NAS market in 2001. The company believes that the upcoming
launch of its new mid-market appliance will go a long way towards achieving 
this goal. This mid-range NAS product, code-named Chameleon could be a drag
on the shares of NTAP when unveiled. While EMC has a long way to go before 
outstaging NTAP in the NAS space, this launch will be a precursor of 
additional
competition which would pressure margins. Network Appliance recently warned 
of slowing sequential growth rates. On the software front, EMC's recent
purchase of CrosStor is the latest of several software acquisitions in its 
effort to boost software sales to 20%. The industry is realizing that 
software is one of the
key features that separates a million-dollar EMC storage system from a few 
dozen $500 hard disks. EMC uses software to fend off increasing competition 
from
IBM, Sun Microsystems and others. However, the CrosStor acquisition is a help 
to both of EMC's goal as its software is primarily used in the NAS
market....EMC is unique in that it provides an end-to-end storage 
infrastructure portfolio consisting of storage systems (both SAN and NAS), 
software,
networking and service and support. We believe the company has tremendous 
upside, but at such a high multiple, we would be wary of entering the stock 
at these
levels. -- Robert J. Reid, Briefing.com

the key point briefing seems to make is that the fundamental story is
intact and that management is moving in agro fashion to get more
revenue streams on-line.  one objective : number 1 category player
in NAS.  that sounds overly agro.  which is good regardless of
whether they get there by 2001.

the caveat briefing notes is that valuation issues need to be worked out.
this note was penned with the stock at 90.  it is now at 77.  so these
issues do seem to be working themselves out.

support at 76 and then 72.

important to watch interactive of price and volume at these
important support points.

what moves the market next?  that seems quite clear : the tuesday FOMC
meeting.  feeling here is that after this bit of selling dries up, the market
rallies into the FOMC meeting.  the selling seems to be on relatively low
volume and of the profit taking garden variety.
