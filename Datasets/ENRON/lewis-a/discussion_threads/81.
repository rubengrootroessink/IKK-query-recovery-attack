CTS HOT TODAY...By Nick Van Nice
-------------------------------------------------------
_________Volume 2, Number 208 __________

Good morning everyone, the purpose of CTS Hot Today is to help
you prepare for the trading day ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------
Nick's Trading Tip of the Day (12/12)
--------------------------------------------------------

"Develop a Solid Daily Routine" (A classic from the archives)

Some of the best traders I know are incredibly disciplined
about their daily routine. They believe their routine gives them an
edge and they will not trade with out it. For your benefit, I will
describe the routine that my Father passed along to me.

It all starts with the Benjamin Franklin secret to success;
Early to bed and early to rise.
In bed by 10:00 PM ET and up at 5:00 am ET.
Watch CNBC for 15 to 20 minutes to see what developed
in over night action. Exercise for 30 minutes and then have a
well balanced breakfast.  Arrive at the trading desk by 6:30 am
EST.
Print out all CTS weekly and daily charts and look for our
preferred technical set-ups. Look for well established trends
that were under going intermediate term corrections back to major
support (resistance levels).
After finding the best 2 to 3 trade opportunities for that day,
go to the hourly charts. If inclined to buy, consider waiting
until hourly stochastics are oversold. For new shorts, require
stochastics to be overbought. To refine timing for entry and exit,
look for clear cut Elliott wave patterns or classical price
patterns on the hourly charts. The hourly Elliott wave patterns
are tradable, because you know quickly when you're wrong.

This routine may or may not work for you.  The main point I'm
trying to make, is that every trader needs a routine that he or she
believes in. The routine helps you focus your research and thus
maximize your ability to find winning trades.

Key Technical Developments (close of 12/11)
-------------------------------------------------------
The December Canadian dollar is retesting the neckline of the large
head and shoulders top as seen on the weekly charts. The pattern
projects a decline to the 62.00 level over the next few months.

The March Yen is pausing above long term support. A decline below
Friday's low near 91.24 opens the door for a massive decline of 700-
1000 points over the next few months.

Nearby hogs got quite a boost from the nasty weather over the
midwest. Blizard conditions will likely take their toll on nearby
supplies.
