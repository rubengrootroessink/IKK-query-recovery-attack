Fast Company's Fast Take newsletter
June 06, 2001

"Celebrate weakness. Play the fool in your group or
your company by embracing inversion, absurdity, and
perseverance. Inverted thinking may help you leapfrog
the competition. And just think of the innovations that
rose from failure: Post-it Notes, the telephone, Silly
Putty, the lightbulb."
-- Annette Moser-Wellman, author of
"The Five Faces of Genius"

How to Stay on the Move ... When the Rest of the World
Is Slowing Down | by Scott Kirsner
It's hard to remember a less-inviting time to have a
great idea for a new company or to champion new ideas
to change a big company. But leaders who think big
aren't willing to downsize their ambitions -- they just
have to work harder (and smarter). Here's advice on how
to stay fast in slow times.

Innovations to Go | by Fara Warner
Sometimes it's the people who come late to a technology
that push the envelope. Here's how firefighters and
doctors learned to love their PDAs.

John Chambers, After the Deluge | by George Anders
How do you guide a legendary growth company through the
worst slump in its history? That's the challenge facing
Cisco's CEO. In an in-depth interview, Chambers
explains how to slow down smart, why the Internet still
matters, and what to do when your big customers stop
buying.

New on Fastcompany.com: On the Eve of Destruction?

On the Eve of Destruction? | by Keith H. Hammonds
"Creative Destruction" argues that corporate survivors
must be flexible -- unconcerned by threats of
cannibalization, channel conflict, or earnings
dilution. In short, they must rethink the "Built to
Last" credo.

The Reinvention(s) of Sophia Collier | by Ron Lieber
Few executives boast a resume as diverse and successful
as Sophia Collier's. Even fewer approach their work
with Collier's thirst for self-understanding. A story
in two parts.
