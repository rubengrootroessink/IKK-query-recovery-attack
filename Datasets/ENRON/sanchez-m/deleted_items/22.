>MORE THAN SPEEDING?
>
>A police officer  pulls a guy over for speeding and has the  following
>exchange:
>
>Officer: May I see your driver's  license?
>
>Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I  got my 5th DUI.
>
>Officer: May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
>
>Driver: It's not my car. I stole  it.
>
>Officer: The car is stolen?
>
>Driver: That's  right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's
>card in the  glove box when I was putting my gun in there.
>
>Officer:  There's a gun in the glove box?
>
>Driver: Yes sir. That's where  I put it after I shot and killed the woman
>who owns this car and  stuffed her in the trunk.
>
>Officer: There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
>
>Driver: Yes, sir.
>
>Hearing this, the  officer immediately called his captain. The car was
>quickly  surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver
>to handle  the tense situation:
>
>Captain: Sir, can I see your  license?
>
>Driver: Sure. Here it is.
>
>It was  valid.
>
>Captain: Who's car is this?
>
>Driver:  It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.
>
>The driver owned  the car.
>
>Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I  can see if there's
>a gun in it?
>
>Driver: Yes, sir, but  there's no gun in it.
>
>Sure enough, there was nothing in the  glove box.
>
>Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was  told you said
>there's a body in it.
>
>Driver: No  problem.
>
>Trunk is opened; no body.
>
>Captain: I  don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you
>told him  you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the
>glovebox,  and that there was a dead body in the trunk.
>
>Driver: Yeah,  I'll bet he told you I was speeding,  too.
