Monique,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we could've
gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days and
then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold of
you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

Take care and stay safe.

joe
