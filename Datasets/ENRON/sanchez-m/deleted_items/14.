Each week, fastcompany.com highlights one of the
designated fast companies from our A - Z database.
Read articles and insider comments, and search jobs
at one of more than 2,000 companies on the list. This
week, the spotlight shines on Ford Motor Co.

As Ford braces for yet another lashing by the media,
customers, and Firestone tires, we ask, "How many
puncture wounds can one company survive?"

An Employee Says: "We affectionately refer to Ford
Motor Co. as 'an aircraft carrier on valium.'"
