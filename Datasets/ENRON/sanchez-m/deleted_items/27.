I called you Wednesday night and got the message that your phone was
disconnected.  When I got the same message on Thursday, I got worried.  I
called John's phone and left a message.  Hope you get reconnected soon.
David and I are thinking of going to Ft. Sam tomorrow morning.  Need to buy
some things on post.  Will talk to you this evening.

Love you much,
Mom
