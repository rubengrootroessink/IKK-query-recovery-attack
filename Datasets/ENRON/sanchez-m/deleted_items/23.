 Imponderables 
1)      If you take an  Oriental person and spin them around several times, do they become  disOriented? 
2)       If people from Poland are called Poles, why aren't people from Holland called  Holes? 
3)      Why  do we say something is out of whack? What's a whack?

8)      Why is the man who  invests all your money called a broker? 
9)      Why do croutons come in airtight  packages? It's just stale bread to begin with. 
10)     When cheese gets its picture taken, what does  it say? 
11)     Why is a  person who plays a piano called a pianist, but a person who drives a race car  not called a racist? 
12)     Why are a wise man and a wise guy  opposites? 
13)     Why do  overlook and oversee mean opposite things? 
14)     Why is the number 21 pronounced twenty one  and 11 is not onety one? 
15)     "I am." is reportedly the shortest sentence  in the English language.  
Could it be that "I do." is the longest  sentence? 

16)     If lawyers are disbarred  and clergymen defrocked, doesn't it make sense that electricians can be  delighted, musicians denoted, cowboys deranged, models deposed, tree surgeons  debarked, and dry cleaners depressed?

20)     I was thinking about how people  seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on  me..........They're cramming for their final exam!
21)     I thought about how  mothers feed their babies with tiny little forks and spoons, so I wondered what  Chinese mothers use? Toothpicks?
22)     Why do they put pictures  of criminals up in the Post Office? What are we supposed to do, write to them?  Why don't they just put their pictures on the postage stamps so the mailmen  could look for them while they delivered the mail?
23)     If it's true that we are  here to help others, then what exactly are the others here for?

25)     No one ever says, "It's only a game!", when  their team is winning. 
26)     Do you ever wonder what the speed of  lightning would be if it didn't zigzag?
