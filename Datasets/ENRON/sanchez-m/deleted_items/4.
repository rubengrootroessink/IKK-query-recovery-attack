Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian
