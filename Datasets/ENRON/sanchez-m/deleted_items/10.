No need to perk up for me.  I should learn to live with you on days like
this.

Yes, I do need to pack/start laundry.  I'm flex for dinner.  Two
suggestions:

1. Eggs and bacon (me)/biscuits (you).  Dishes (me).  Walk with dogs (us).
2. Meet at home, slip into our running gear, grab the dogs, and go to
Memorial for a jog.  Stop on the way home and pick something up for dinner
(veggies with tofu).
