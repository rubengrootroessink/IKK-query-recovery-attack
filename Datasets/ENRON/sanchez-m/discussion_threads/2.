Dear Valued Ameritrade Customer:

Thank you for using the wire request feature on our website.  I have 
submitted your withdrawal request in the amount of $5700.00.  Federal 
Securities regulations require that stock and bond trades settle three 
business days after the transaction.  Per your instructions to send the funds 
upon settlement, your wire will be processed on 01/29/2001, settlement day 
for these transactions.

If you would like the funds requested sent to you prior to the settlement 
date, Early Settlement fees will apply.  The fee structure is as follows:

$25.00 + $0.35 per $1000.00 per day

The $25.00 is a one-time charge per wire request.

If you have further concerns or inquiries, please contact the Wire Team 
through Customer Service at (800) 669-3900 or (402) 970-5805.

Thank you for choosing Ameritrade!

Sincerely,



Damon Hynes
Customer Service/Wire Specialist
Ameritrade, Inc.
