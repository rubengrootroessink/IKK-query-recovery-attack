Yes I got it - and i love it.  It brought a tear to my eye!!  My goodness -
your life sounds like it has become very exciting - not that it ever
sounded
dull. . . Yes - we would love to go skiing sometime!!  We are always up for
that and would certainly wait until John has his knees under him again.  I
WILL call you this weekend.  We must catch up.  I am also looking into
coming to Houston sometime.  I arranged for a conference there earlier in
April, but before I could call to see if you would be there, I decided that
things at work were too hectic and I couldn't spare the time away from the
office.

I SO look forward to talking with you!!

Have a wonderful evening.  So, is it Survivor or Friends?

Hey there...i'm trying to send you this thing again....it just really
reminded me of us in college.  Let me know if it still doesn't work.

As for me..still no wedding plans.  Your recap of life in armadillo sounds
exactly like our life in houston...work,eat,sleep,work,eat,sleep....kind of
depressing...I often feel we are ships passing in the night and not
romantic little newlyweds.  But we managed to take a vacation in park city
a month ago..learned to snowboard which was a blast.  We also have a longer
trip planned in June to go to Alaska which I think will be good medicine
for the day to day grind.  My job is going very well.  I am trading gas now
for enron and trading that crazy california market you probably hear about
on the news...very exciting and the group is very fun.  I've been able to
do a lot of travelling as part of the perks of the job.  I went to portland
in jan and skied for the first time in my adult life...absolutely loved it
and booked a trip BY MYSELF (yes...by myself) a month later in park city.
It was great.  Lots of time to myself and a great looking private ski
instructor for 4hrs a day.  A few weeks ago I went to the Cayman Islands
with my group....and couple of us are going to vegas this weekend.  I also
went to south beach a month ago with a broker i do business with in newyork
(we have to go there...definitely a girls trip).  Then lastly I'll be going
to the kentucky derby next month....So basically this has been like some
huge dream I haven't woken up from yet.  Unfortunately all this play comes
at the wrong time in my life...this is the life to have when you are right
out of college...not settling down...But oh well,,,I am definitely taking
advantage of it knowing that in due time things will slow down.

John is liking his job and doing well. Still a sweetheart. We are looking
at early 2003 for possible relocation from TX.  At this moment I hope to be
able to transfer to our Portland office and trade power..but more
importantly live in what I think is the most beautiful state in the US.
We'll see though...things certainly change with time and it is easy to keep
pushing off something major like that......I'm still shocked that I am
still in houston. Unfortunately and fortunately I really like my job right
now (finally).

The dogs are well...growing up fast.  Bought a harness for Jake and w/ john
on a skateboard and me on blades..we were pulled down the block at
lightening speed chasing after a standard poodle last night.  It was
hilarious.

What else,,,what else.....I am done w/ c school...i did a program that was
equivalent to 1/2 a culinary degree.  I was working at a restaurant after
that on saturdays and a bakery occasionally..but with this new job...i gave
those things up and hardly have the time to cook and bake..though i do fit
it in every once in a while.

Anyway...we should really see eachother in person.  You name the weekend
and I will fly up to armadillo...i am serious...and of course you are
always more than welcome to come here.  It doesn't matter to me.  Also..if
you and Tom want to plan any sort of ski vacation next season and need
people...LET ME KNOW. I plan to do a tremendous amount of that next year.
I think John might have knee surgery in September...so for the 2 of us to
go....February would be best or after.....we could always go to canada..I
would love to go there.

My family is doing well...though my gma is getting very old and slow...very
sad.  My mom takes care of her when she is not working and it has been
wearing on her as well. Not just to give the care...but just to see her
grow old.  Makes me sad...something though that I think most families are
having to deal with.  I have 2 nephews and one niece.  I can't imagine with
my current job situation and possible move to Portland..when we would have
kids...though I really want to...it just sucks..it's such an either or
situation career wise.  I don't want to have our kids raised by a sitter or
a nanny if we can avoid it.  AUgh!  Sometimes I feel like I could just
choke on all the pressure/anxiety I sometimes feel about the whole thing.
I've said before that I feel like age 30 is just this big wall where I have
to accomplish all these things before I get there..and then BAM have kids.
I just don't feel there yet..but I don't want to keep pushing the wall
back. AUGh!  I'm sure we could rap a lot on this subject...which is why we
should get together.  Like I said.  Name the date.

John and I have cell phones not a home phone.  Mine is 713-516-0651.  John
is 832-724-7102.  You can also call me anytime (though afternoons are much
much better) at work at 713-853-1917.  I'm looking forward to talking to
you soon and hearing more about your job and how things are going.

Again..let me know if this thing below is unreadable...I will fax it to
you.
Take care,
Love-MO

It's only taken me 6 months to reply - I've been meaning to write you back
and tell you that my attachment didn't open!!

I was at home a few weeks ago and figured that you probably had broken down
and gotten a normal telephone with a listed number by now, but I was wrong.
I will not gloss over the fact that I have failed miserably as the friend
of
a newly engaged person in that I have not been seeking regular updates from
you on the progress of everything.  Also, I generally wonder how you are
doing outside of that pre-marital thing.

Have you determined a time frame for the marriage?  Location - Houston vs.
Bali??
How is work going?
Are you still taking culinary classes?
Is John still with the Canadian company, or at least the company that does
a
lot of work in Canada?
How is your Grandma?  Mother?
Jake?

Things here in Armadillo are status quo.  We just work, sleep, eat, work,
sleep, eat, eat some more, and occasionally do things with the few couple
friends we have in town.  Pretty boring life, but it keeps up too damn
busy.
It's all perspective, I suppose.

I miss you terribly and hope that you can describe for me what I was
supposed to be able to open as an attachment.  I'm not sure why it didn't
work.

Take care, and I look forward to talking with you soon!!!
Kristi

Okay,
Everything in this email reminded me of our shenanigans in college.  Enjoy
the walk down memory lane.  Miss you.
