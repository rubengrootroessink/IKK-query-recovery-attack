As many of you already know, my last day at Enron was last week.  I wanted to
let you know that my work at Enron over the last few years has been an
enjoyable, challenging and rewarding experience thanks to folks like you.  I
consider it an honor and pleasure to have worked with so many intelligent,
motivating and friendly people!!!

My personal contact information is included below and I hope that we can keep
in touch and our personal and professional paths will continue to cross.
Thanks again .
