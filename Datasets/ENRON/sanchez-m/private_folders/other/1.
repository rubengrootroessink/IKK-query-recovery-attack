Mo,

I understand how broker dinners can be, but hope you can make it anyway.  It was great getting to know you.  Too bad we didn't hang out more this past year!  Keep in touch, and be sure to give me the updates on the cooking career.  I'm coming back to TX as soon as you open your restaurant.  I don't have my new address in Boston yet, but my email is bthoskins@hotmail.com.  You can always catch up with me at my parents' house: 5200 Boulder Ct.  Louisville, KY 40207, 502-895-0980.  Hope the trading is going well.

Brian

Hey there,

I have a broker dinner on thurs.  These things can drag out...so I'm not sure I'll be able to stop by.
Best of luck in school.  I enjoyed hanging out with you the short time we knew each other.  Forward me your new email address when you get one.  I'll write you if I take the plunge and reverse the long trading/short cooking spread.  Who knows.
Take care,

Mo

Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian
