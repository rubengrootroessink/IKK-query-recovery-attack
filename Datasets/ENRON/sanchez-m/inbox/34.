Fast Company's Fast Take newsletter
October 17, 2001

"The real entrepreneur is always spurred on by a wish
to attract every customer -- by a childlike belief that
you can win all the time, every time."
-- Feargal Quinn, executive chairman of Superquinn

NOVEMBER ISSUE: Who's Fast 2002
----------------------------------------------------

In a world shocked by evil terrorism, what genuinely
matters? Whose contributions count? The new context of
a world reframed by mass murder and covert warfare can
cast a harsh light on the celebrations of innovation,
leadership, and personal challenge that have been the
hallmark of the Who's Fast issue, and of Fast Company,
since its inception.

This year's Who's Fast celebration presents 11 unsung
heroes and rising stars -- high-impact figures from all
walks of life and from all kinds of companies and
organizations. These are neither the most famous people
in business nor the richest. These are people who
matter because of the reach of their ideas and the
depth of their impact -- people who are shaping the
future of strategy, competition, work, and change.

Leader: Feargal Quinn | by Polly LaBarre
Ireland's "Pope of Customer Service" dominates his
market -- and continues to beat bigger and
better-financed rivals -- with a leadership philosophy
that is at once folksy and radical. Behind all his
success is one big question: How do we convince our
customers to come back?

Change Agents: Michael J. Fox and Deborah Brooks |
by Keith H. Hammonds
Michael J. Fox isn't just another movie star promoting
a pet cause. He and his colleague Deborah Brooks are
reshaping the pace and logic of research devoted to
curing Parkinson's disease.

SPECIAL FEATURE: Terrorism, Trauma, and the Search for Redemption
-----------------------------------------------------

Terrorism, Trauma, and the Search for Redemption
by Harriet Rubin

Silke Maier-Witt, a trauma psychologist in Kosovo, is
seeking to heal the wounds that terrorism has inflicted
on women from both sides. She's also seeking redemption
for her father's dark past in Nazi Germany and her own
as a revolutionary gang member.
