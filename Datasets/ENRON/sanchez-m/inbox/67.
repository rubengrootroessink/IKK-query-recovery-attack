Rob and I had fun in CS.  Yes, the Ags need to get better.  This weekend
should be a huge test.

Mo and I would like to go to the Braden reunion but I seem to have misplaced
my invite.  Can you sign us up?  I'm not sure what are plan will be (I think
Mo has a running event on Saturday morning of the 20th) but we'll talk next
week.

Hi John, I'm glad the ags won but did they look good?  We need to get
better, yes!!!  Are you and Mo planning on coming to the Braden reunion on
Sunday 21st?  Granddad is treating but we're trying to determine how many.
Let me know.  Have a great week.  We will stay home this weekend in our own
