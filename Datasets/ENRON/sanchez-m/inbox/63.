Dear Mo,
Thank you for all of your help with this job search.
I hope Victor was happy, let me know if he has any
questions.  I hope your last day at work is a great
one.  I will shoot you an e-mail and we can get
together for some good cooking.  I hope to hear from
you soon.  Keep your chin up and focus on your dream,
it will all work out well.

XOXOXOXOX,


Scott
