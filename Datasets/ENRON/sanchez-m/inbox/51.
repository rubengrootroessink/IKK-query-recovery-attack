Hey there!  Long time no see. 
Patrick tells me that you are moving to Utah to work at a resort.  I'm interested to hear how all of that came about. 
Before you get out of town we need to have dinner.  Patrick can join us on Mon., Tue., or Wed. nights.  (Although not this Wednesday)  If you have an interest in dinner one night, let me know and I can see if Dennis is available.  I'd like to get together if possible.
Take care.
