"The great paradox of the 21st century is that, in this
age of powerful technology, the biggest problems we
face internationally are problems of the human soul."
-- Ralph Peters, former U.S. Army lieutenant colonel
and author of "Fighting for the Future"

NEW ON FASTCOMPANY.COM: Battle Plan
-----------------------------------------------------

Battle Plan | by Anni Layne Rodgers
Former Army lieutenant colonel Ralph Peters outlines
nine strategies for understanding, fighting, and
defeating the new enemy. Rule #1: Culture is king.
http://robin.fastcompany.com/cgi-bin/nph-t.pl?U=1781&M=79151&MS=3242

Good Work | by Polly LaBarre
An important new book testifies to the power of
professional excellence and to the challenges of
meeting social commitments in the face of fierce
marketplace pressures. Can you pass the "mirror test" ?

Who's Fast Spotlight: Bob Moffat | by Charles Fishman
Bob Moffat has one of the more thankless big jobs in an
industry ruled by price wars, vanishing stock prices,
consolidations, and layoffs. So why is Moffat, head of
IBM's PC group, having such a good time at work?

NOVEMBER ISSUE: Who's Fast 2002
----------------------------------------------------

In a new world reframed by terror and war, we continue
to celebrate the acts of innovation, leadership, and
personal challenge that are the hallmark of our Who's
Fast issue and Fast Company. Last week, we brought you
two of these everyday heroes. Today, we present two of
our greatest disrupters ...

DISRUPTER: Stephen Friend | by George Anders
The driving force behind a genomics technology that may
reshape how drug companies fight disease and test new
products is conducting a second experiment: figuring
out whether he can transplant the energy of a startup
into the giant that bought his company.
http://robin.fastcompany.com/cgi-bin/nph-t.pl?U=1785&M=79151&MS=3242

DISRUPTER: Akira Ishikawa | by Paul C. Judge
The semiconductor has been the driving force behind the
digital revolution. Now Akira Ishikawa is looking to
force the revolution into overdrive by creating
semiconductors in the form of spheres instead of chips
-- a breakthrough with truly electrifying implications.
