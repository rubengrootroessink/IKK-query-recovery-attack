        Weekend Update: Go easy on yourself and others Friday. Set aside ti=
ght schedules and worries. Take things as they come, without getting bogged=
 down in impossible expectations. Delays and adjustments are very likely. S=
aturday is excellent for making sense out of Friday's events. Calmly piece =
together fragments until they assume some sort of order. It is so important=
 that you consciously forgive those who have disappointed or inconvenienced=
 you or your loved ones. Hanging onto resentment will tear holes in your he=
art. Sunday brings bliss. Doubt is replaced with a comforting sense that al=
l will be fine in time. Private talks with loved ones bring healing and emo=
tional intimacy. In fact, you may experience a gratifying breakthrough in o=
ne of your most important relationships. Encourage your significant other t=
o relax, dream, and cultivate hope. Things will evolve in wondrous ways. Gr=
aciously accept the unasked for changes entering your life and let the tran=
sformation begin. . . .    =09
