Sorry we missed you on Easter.  We had been doing so much driving and still had to go to my moms.  John is actually out of town this weekend.  I will be going to my mom's sat night for dinner.  Maybe there is a time i can meet up w/ you before or after?  Hope all is well.  
I'll be in town for the next 3 weekends as john will be doing a bit of travel.  Drop me a line if you want to do anything.
Talk to ya later,
Mo
