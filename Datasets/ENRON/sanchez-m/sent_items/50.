Hope things are going well.  David and Terry leave tomorrow morning early t=
o
Colorado.  If you have time, give Terry a call.  Mom is about the
same...neither one of us get any sleep.  Have I ever told you how bad I hav=
e
claustaphobia?  It really it this past Monday when I went for my Treadmill
with Cardio Imaging.  This monster of a machine sat two inches from my face
while I was on my back.  I was so stressed I could have just died.  Someday
I will find out what in my past has contributed to this god awful fear.
When I was on the Treadmill I felt like I was climbing Mt. Everest.  My
tolerance was really tested.  I don't have any results from the test.  Got
Army this weekend. Talk at you later.
