Mom,
I know you are really strapped to find people to take care of granny on the weekends and i know the costs are adding up as well.  But, if you find someone who can come on saturday or sundays for the day or even for a few hours on a weekly basis i can help pay for that expense.  With the weather improving,  I think it would be good for your stress to be able to get out in the morning and go to the park and just walk the memorial loop and be oustide.  Do you think Robin could come for a few hrs on sat or sunday mornings?  We could meet at the park, David could meet us as well.  I do have a few trips planned for the near future, but I would be very happy to meet you at the park to go walking or at Hanks when I am in town.  I would not be able to cope well with the stress of my job without the outlet of going to the gym or the park to work things out..  Let me know how I can help.

Went to the doctor this morning.  Was telling him about the mild chest pain
(over the left side) that have been coming on and lasting no more than 5
minutes. Told him I have been under a hugh amount of stress for quite a long
time and that I thought that could very well be the problem.  After giving
him the wonderful health history of both maternal/paternal side, he decided
to do an ECG and complete blood work.
	 ECG states an "abnormal ECG -- non-specific T wave abnormality".  I
will have to read about the T wave.  My blood pressure was 178.  Never
before that it ever been over 110/80.
	I am now waiting for referral approval for both a Stress Test at St.
Lukes and a bone density/mammogram at St. Joseph.
	I feel confident that everything is allright, but I thought just in
case I should keep both of you posted.
