Monique,

I really wanted to spend some time talking with you this past weekend but
with the bachelor party I was involved with, it was impossible to fit it
in.  And the fact of the matter is I'm sorry on a number of levels.  The
most obvious is that I simply enjoy spending time with you...always fun and
you always have intelligent things to say.  At a different level, I think
you have a very level head and are great at giving advice and I value you
what you have to say about relationships, something I don't think I'm very
good at yet.  And finally, and at the deepest level, I want to hear what is
happening in your life and how you are doing?  I know there are things
going on in your head about career, relationships, etc. and I'd love to
hear about it and hopefully provide some sort of insight, help.

You know I have always had a soft spot in my heart for you and in a strange
way I cheer you for your successes and I am sad for you when you are
troubled...I'll stop there because this just doesn't come across well
through email.  Maybe we could grab a beer on Friday afternoon like last
time at the Ale House (I'll be in town).  Let me know if you are available,
respond by email when you can

Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon,

joe
