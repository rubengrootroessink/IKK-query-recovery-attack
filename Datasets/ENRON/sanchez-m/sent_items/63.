hey there,

this just in....we may all have var limits now....lavo imposed a million dollar fine on our group bc we exceeded var...of course we just exceeded it by 130k....you can imagine our reaction and the discourse....i'll let you know what comes out of that.

so it looks like you did no trades today.
your curve shift is -218.
mike went out w/ fixed price phys today.  it looks like elpo has picked city gate to manipulate this month....they are lifting the fixed price like it is going out of style.  june basis at the cg ran.
the juan cash today was mostly given.....i think matt was able to cover stuff pretty quickly...and with no fluff...ha ha

i guess that is about it.  aga was 118...with 110 being our expectation.  the screen fell a bit as a result

we have prebid today.  hope you feel well.  talk to ya later.
attached are just the curves since your positions are unch.

later,
Mo
