Hey there,

Ironically I got the card the same day I sent the email.  Count us in for sure.  Still no date for us.  I'll give you plenty of notice.
Take care and i'll talk to you again soon.
Mo.

Hi,

It's September 15.  Two weeks after labor day.  You should be getting a save the date card soon, if you haven't already.

Hope things are good.
