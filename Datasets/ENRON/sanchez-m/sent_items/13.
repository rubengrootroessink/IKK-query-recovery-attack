Alright!

Lets start the invites...
I'll invite suebob and anyone she wants to bring with...she's got a friend from outta town.
May invite Keith and Tracy...he wants to check out our house/neighborhood.
May even invite Dennis from cooking school and his wife since they live close by...hmmmm
this could get a bit large..which is not to bad....we could set up horseshoes in the front yard...that would be fun.
We'll talk more tonight and construct an email......Based on our headcount we can figure out what the best food is to fix and then possible divy up some of the bringins.

Latersky
