hey there,

i will probably not have the aol on in the mornings....too distracting....but i wanted to let you know that i will continue to send you an email everyday after curves until you let me know you have closed all your positions.  give me a ring if you need anything, or shoot me an email.   i'm sure you are also talking to janie.  
take care,
mo.
