hey there,
wondering what you'd like to do tonight for dinner?
i know you probably need to do stuff like pack for germ.
i am supremely grouchy.  i will do my best to perk up for you when i get home.
i forgot shoes so i will not be joining sue at hanks.
my plan was to go home....start drinking...and do some desk work/sparebedroom work.
just shoot me a line when you get a chance...........latersky.
Mo.
