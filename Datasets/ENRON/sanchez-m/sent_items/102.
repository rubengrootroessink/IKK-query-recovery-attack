Subject: options exercised

I exercised my options today...for various reasons.

First: stock moved around 1.3 yesterday and was up as high as 1.5
today...now on its way back down.  I exercised when it was 1.0 up....i
really felt that this was more a peak for now than a trend up.

Also, the move yesterday I feel was influenced by news that we were
selling our India power plant....this is the 2nd news story related to
enron selling assets (Portland General) and reducing workforce (Enron
Europe laying off employees).  Yesterday there was an article that was
released stating that there may be some difficulty getting the India
deal to go through....hence...me feeling like this thing was probably
going to move back down.

Also, the employee survey results I read.....not good...enron employee
"consumer" confidence is not good.  Not to mention the fact that I see
many of my peers getting solicited w/ big bucks to work elsewhere and
the volatile trading environment (hence $$$$$ for enron) slowly
dissapating.

Lastly....I can always buy enron stock .....at these price
levels...taking 3500 bucks and throwing it in the bank..is probably easy
money....I can always take the money market and get back in
enron....sure I am forgoing getting in at 28.5 (the strike price) but
the difference between that and getting in at lets say 40....is a few
thousand dollars....rather forgo that and get back in on a definite
uptrend...then risk losing this easy money and have nothing to show.

OH...lastly..I am still in EOG which will move in sympathy w/ ENE if
that market continues to trend up.

So there you go....the most detailed trade report i think i've ever
written.
Talk to you later hun
L-me
