Hey there, 
haven't done the recipes yet. I'm actually planning on doing just the chocolate one.  I am going to do another cake that is a white chiffon cake w/ white choc buttercream frosting.  It also has the buttercream/fresh berrries/ and seedless jam in the layers.  I'll let you know how that turns out.
My plan is to do the frostings/ganache on monday..and bake the cakes on tuesday...assemble wednesday.  I've been wiggin out about it because I am doing this to feed 30 people and I have not been practicing at all.......But....i slapped myself around yesterday to calm down and i'm ready for it.  I will do all the measuring on sunday too..so i think i'm giving myself enough time.  Wish me luck.
By the way...I loved Make A Cake..AND they have those expensive silicone molds on sale from 67 to 40 each....i bought a financier mold.  The guy is getting rid of them because they don't sell.  You may want to pass this on to Dan.
I'll let you know how it goes.  John is joking with me by asking "When are the cakes due?"....like it is homework.
Talk to you soon,
Mo.
