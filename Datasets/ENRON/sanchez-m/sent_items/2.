Excellent....i will be in town that weekend.  You just name the time and place.
I was definitely mint-juleped...i love that.  I think those were the last days of disco for mo.
I plan to be very lame for the next few weeks..read a lot...spring cleaning, that kind of thing.
So hopefully i'll hear from you soon.  Take care,
Mo.

Hey,

Yes, I tried calling on Saturday night but you must have already been mint
juleped (if that is a verb...you tell me?)  I actually did not make it down
this weekend...forgot it was Mother's Day so I stayed here and did the
brunch thing with Mom and Grandma in Connecticut, will be coming down on
Memorial Day Weekend so maybe we can say hello then.

I'll try calling you this weekend anyway and we can swap our relationship
stories.  Glad you had a good time in Kentucky and you made it home safely.
Talk to you soon...promise.

joe

Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a
voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very
intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was
maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.
Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the
next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you
soon.
Take care,
Mo.
