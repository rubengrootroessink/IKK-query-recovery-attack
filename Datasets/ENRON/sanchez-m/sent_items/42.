We should talk soon and it actually won't be that long before I come into
town again.  I'll be down the weekend of May 12 that Thursday night and
nothing would make me happier than to spend a chunk of the afternoon at The
Ale House again.  A few beers always helps these kinds of conversations
because they are difficult emotional things to think about and that is best
done if you are willing to let your guard down.  I have been thinking a lot
about my relationship and what it means to me and I would love to share if
you are willing to listen.  You haven't slowed the traveling down at all I
see...all I claim in terms of travel are weekly trips to lovely suburban
New Jersey.  Enjoy the Derby (if it wasn't this past weekend and I'll talk
to you soon)

peace, love and flowers

Hey there,
I would love to have more deep conversations on these topics.  Maybe we can
schedule a long phone call sometime since i'm sure it will be a while
before you come in.  I am so bad about answering my phone in the
evenings...i just shut down shop when i go home....but we should definitely
talk.  I'm interested in hearing about you as well.  From our talk last
time it seems we may have some of the same dilemmas.  I've got a trip
coming up to the Kentucky derby next weekend...was in vegas last
weekend....but will be around here until mid june when john and I go to
alaska.  I am slightly ready to slow down now...way too much travel...john
and i need to spend more quality time together.  I don't know how you do
the long distance relationship..it would be very hard for me.  I guess I
crave more constant attention--high maintenance---Ha!  Kidding.  Anyway, it
is always great to hear from you.  Hopefully we can talk soon.
Take care,
Mo.

How the hell is my globe-trotting, beach combing, vacation taking, cake
baking, food preparing, favorite Enron employee?  I promised i wasn't going
to let you go another 12 months before i talked to you again and i'm
keeping my word.  We have a lot still to talk about in line with the
conversation we had at the Ale House...you know, good times, good friends,
good beer and deep conversation about love, career, marriage and what we do
with our lives.  Respond when you can and I hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

joe
