   Monique,

   Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we
   could've
   gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days
   and
   then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
   catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold
   of
   you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
   maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.

   Take care and stay safe.

   joe
