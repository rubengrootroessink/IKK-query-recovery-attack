Count me in, but the dogs will probably have issues.  Talk to you later.

Subject:	FW: 4th of July


Todd is trying to reserve a large (sleeps 16 comfortably) cabin on Lake
Travis around the 4th of July holiday.  The 4th is on a Wednesday this year
so he'll probably reserve it through the proceeding or following weekend.
I'm just trying to get a head count for now so anyone interested please let
me know.

We rented this place a couple years ago and had a great time.  It's located
on the lake and has a private boat dock.  Todd will most likely have his
boat for skiing and cruising the lake.  Other activities include Jet Ski
rental, wind surfing rental, sun bathing, cooking out, and drinking.

John

I called and it's available. I'm going to send them an email this afternoon
and find out what the charges would be. I spoke to Bob's wife and she said
that it goes for $600 a night, but that for an extended stay he will usually
negotiate.

I guess the next thing we would need to find out is how many people would be
interested in staying at the house. Can you send Mark a note and let me know
how many of the folks in H-town would be interested and for what days?
