Hey there,

Did you call me at the Derby?  I have some vague recollection of getting a voice mail from you...however i had many many mint juleps and was very intoxicated.  I actually flew in on saturday and out sunday morning....was maybe there 16hrs tops.
Anyway,  I guess you were here this weekend.  Hope everything went well.  Give me a call anytime if you'd like to talk.  I will be home solo for the next 3 weekends....great time to chit chat.  Hopefully will talk to you soon.
Take care,
Mo.
