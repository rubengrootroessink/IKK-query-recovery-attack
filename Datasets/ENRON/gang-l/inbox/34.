Subject: More on OATI Certificates


We are hoping to be able to begin using OATI certificates by the end of this 
week or early next week.  At some point, I will notify you of a default 
password to use for your first login.  You will be expected to replace the 
default with your own password on your first login. However, before we can 
implement, I need updated information from you.    Please reply to this 
message with the following information.

1.	User name

2.	Email address

3.	Phone number

4.	Do you currently have an OATI digital certificate?

5.	I you have an OATI certificate, what is the common name?

6.	If you do not have an OATI certificate, what is the name of your Security 
Officer or security contact?

I am not certain at this point whether we can use Tradewave and OATI 
certificates in parallel.  It seems to be a good possibility, but hasn't yet been 
confirmed.  If we are able to do so, we have until the end of June to complete 
everyone's conversion.  If not, we will have to pick a date certain for the 
change.  Since I will be on the road from June 25-28, the changeover date 
would have to be no later than June 24.

The attached file describes how to obtain a certificate from OATI.
