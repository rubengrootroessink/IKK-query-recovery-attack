Lisa - 
Still fighting with the Mo-Jo huh??  How is everything going, are you able to leave with a smile on your face everyday?  Awesome that Susie is coming back, that should be fun for you guys, get the old team back together!!  Good luck with Law school, I think that is a fabulous idea, I think I might go back to school as well, but for what I am not yet certain.  I miss you too, we should get together in the relatively near future.  Say hi to Julie for me, Serena
