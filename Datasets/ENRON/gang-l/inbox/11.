Virginia,
I talked with Molly from Avista and she said that this payment was for Dec 01. 

Mo,
Unless you disagree, I have applied this payment to the month mentioned above. Let me know. Thanks.

Hi Sabrina.  

  Sorry it has taken me a while to get back to you on this.  Jenny Thome and Lisa Gang are working on Avista true-up from Jan '02 thru current. I believe that this pre-payment for $899,464.00 is for the week of Jan 1 thru Jan 7, 2002.  Mo - can you please confirm this?  The wire transfer request is pending 26, but  just says prepay without a trade date.  Payment was made 12/21/02.

  Virginia

Hi Virginia,

On December 21, 2001, Jake Thomas sent a prepayment wire request of $899,464 to be paid to Avista. I'm doing a reconciliation for Avista and I need to know for what month this should be applied to. Can you please e-mail me back if you have this information? Your help is deeply appreciated. Thanks.
