On Wednesday, June 19, at 1000 MDT (0900 PDT) we will test the EHV web 
site server's ability to utilize OATI digital certificates.  This will require moving 
to the backup server for about an hour.  While on the backup, access to the 
site will not be available through Tradewave.  After the test, we will switch 
back to Tradewave.

We'd like as many people as possible to participate in this test.  To 
participate, you must have an OATI digital certificate.  If you do not yet have 
an OATI certificate and are ready to get one, please send a message to me 
and I'll let OATI know.  It will take 2-3 days to obtain and install a certificate.

Please let me know today if you plan to participate in the test.  Following the 
test, I'll be requesting information from you as to how successful you were in 
accessing the site.

As I have announced before, after June 30, the access through Tradewave 
will no longer be available.
