Hello all,

As many of you may already know, I decided to pursue new opportunities for employment and have accepted a position with Legacy Health Systems as an HR Assistant. My last day at Enron will be Wednesday, May 1st. 

I'd like to thank you for contributing to my experience at Enron. You have helped make the work environment fun--even in spite of the ups and downs of the recent months. I know that the knowledge, experience and memories I have gained in the past 2 1/2 years will travel with me in my future endeavors.

If you'd like to keep in touch, you are welcome to e-mail me at rodriguezgm@hotmail.com. 

Warm regards, 
Grace
