Attached is a breakdown of duties and the person assigned to carry them out.  Please look it over and let me know of any neccessary changes or additions.

Just a reminder:

Last week Murray requested that the group work up standardized documentation describing the steps necessary to complete each of the duties listed in the attached job list.  He would like the information on his desk Monday morning.

If you would like assistance with production of the documentation, I would be happy to help.  Please get the info to me by noon tomorrow (Friday). 

Thanks,
Kathy
