Enron is paid up through June for two people.  The current names on the account are 
Tim Heizenrader and Robert Cooper Richey.  However, unless they left their security 
files with Enron, you will be unable to use the site without registering again with 
Tradewave.  This is not a good time to do this, because Tradewave goes away on 
June 30.  We are moving our website security to OATI about mid-June.  If you want 
continued access to the site, you will have to get an OATI certificate and let me know 
who you want to register.  I'll be charging $200/year per person for administrative 
costs, OATI certificates are free to OATI clients, $120/year for others.  I don't have all 
the details on how to switch over yet, but expect to have them in a couple weeks.  I'll 
put your name on my distribution list, so you will receive instructions when I send 
them to everyone else.
Bill
