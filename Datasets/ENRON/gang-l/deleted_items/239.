My Sincere Greetings,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your participation in
the roll out of OATI webCARES certificates within your organization. I
enjoyed the contact I had with you and because of your direct involvement
with webCARES your users are properly authenticated to the ETS 1.7 Tagging
system and their data is encrypted and securely transferred.

I would greatly appreciate your constructive feedback on webCARES by taking
a few minutes to respond to the following questions. Your response will help
us plan future enhancements to webCARES products, services and support to
meet your needs.

Note: Please use "reply", NOT "reply all" when responding to this email.

1.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the webCARES web site
to better accommodate your needs?

2.) What improvements, if any, would you recommend to the certificate
delivery process (i.e. exporting and importing of certificates)?

3.) In general, do you believe it is better for company Security Officers or
end users to have control of certificates and corresponding private keys?

4.) Do you believe there is a need for security related classes covering
topics like SSL (https:), encryption, digital signatures, PKI and
troubleshooting certificate related issues? Would you be interested in
attending?

5.) Do you believe there is a need for a monthly security related newsletter
covering topics useful to you in your role as Security Officer, Backup
Security Officer, or Audit Officer? 

    5a) If interested in a security newsletter would you like to receive it
in plain text, rich text, or html format?

6.) Do you want to pay approximately $170/ea for a DST certificates when
your OATI certificates will work on OASIS nodes? 

(if not please contact your OASIS node administrator(s) to let them know you
do NOT want to pay for DST certificates and would like to use your existing
OATI certificates for OASIS access? They are facing an important decision
and feedback from you (their customer) is the only way they can make the
RIGHT decision for your company.)

7.) OATI webCARES certificates are X.509 compliant and thus can potentially
be used to secure any application. Just as OATI secured it's ETS (Tagging)
system, you can use existing webCARES certificates, or create new ones, to
secure your in-house or third party applications. Do you have any interest
in using OATI webCARES certificates to secure your in-house or third party
applications? 

    7a) If yes, would a "Certificate Integration Toolkit" or direct
involvement from OATI staff be more useful to you?


Once again thank you for the important role you played in rolling out
certificates within your organization and for your responses to the above
questions. If I can assist with any certificate related questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.



Sincerely,


Patrick Tronnier
