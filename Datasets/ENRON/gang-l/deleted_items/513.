Lisa,

Paul asked that I relay the contractual information for developing the
Edwards AFB Parker-Davis hourly schedule for April that will need to be
completed no later than COB Thursday, March 28.  

Contract Rate of Delivery for April = 18,285 kW
Firm Electric Service = 8,809,000 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4782)
Non-Firm Interuptable Service = 0 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4783)
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service = 4,571 kW
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service Energy = 1,389,660 kWh

I've attached a Firm Electric Service Schedule that would meet the
above contractual requirements for your review.

Please contact me at (602) 352-2678 or lgarrett@wapa.gov if you have
questions.  Once you have the hourly Parker-Davis Firm Electric Service
schedule prepared please forward to CBristow@wapa.gov and
presched@sce.com and myself.  Thank.
