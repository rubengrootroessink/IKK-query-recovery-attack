Lisa & Julie -- here are the schedules you requested.  Sorry for the confusion; anytime you need advanced or special schedules to submit, please let me know as much ahead of time as possible.  I'll also be glad to help to the extent I can with questions and stuff.  Unfortunately, I never knew exactly how all operations in Portland worked.

The attached schedule covers both Friday and Saturday, March 29-30.  Associated text files have been posted to Sparky.
