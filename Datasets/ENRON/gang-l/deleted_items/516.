Hi Murray,

Valley Electric was scheduled from December 1st to December 6th.  It appears no power has flowed on any of the deals related to Valley since the 6th of December.  

Susan Rance left a message with Stephany Panus, in Global Contracts, to determine the date and deals included in the contract termination.  We need to know the which deals and time period of theose deals, the $299,984.80 of liquidated damages applies.  Once known, we will adjust Enpower as required.

If you have any questions please call me at 503 464 5065 (work) or 503 449 5463 (cell).

Hope to see you soon in Portland,

Regards,

Gord
