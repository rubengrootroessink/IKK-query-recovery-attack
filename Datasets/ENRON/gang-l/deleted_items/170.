The other day I was in the local auto parts store. A blonde lady
comes in and asks for a 710 cap. We all looked at each other and said,
"What's a 710 cap?" She said, "You know, it's right on the engine. Mine got 
lost some how and  I need a new one. "What kind of a car is it on," they 
asked?

Now I'm thinking maybe an old Datsun 710, but no, she said it's a
Pontiac."OK lady, how big is it?" She makes a circle with her hands
about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. What does it do?," we asked. She said, "I 
don't know, but it's always been there." We gave her a note pad and asked if 
she could draw a picture of it. So she makes a circle about 3 1/2 inches in 
diameter and in the center she writes 710.

The guys behind the counter are looking at it upside down as she
writes it...and they just fall down behind the counter laughing so hard in 
hysterics.

(Directions ... draw a circle, write 710 in the middle of it, and
turn it around.
