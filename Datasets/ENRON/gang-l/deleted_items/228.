As of today the CARP I ran from Enpower does not contain May 1st delivery for Sierra Pacific Power and Nevada Power Company.  The 1st information was in the report on the 7th and has been removed since then.  Attached is the deals that were there as of the 7th.

Thanks,

Mark

Lisa, 

Are you still having problems with Enpower?  It is essential that every day is scheduled in Enpower, for us to report the correct MTM P&L, which we are doing on a daily basis.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
