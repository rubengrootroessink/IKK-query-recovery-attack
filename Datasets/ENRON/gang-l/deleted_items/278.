Grace-

  In regard to proposal #3 in your email:

 Our Scheduler Lisa Gang has volunteered to go thru and see that EnPower matches the Scheduling excel worksheets for December 2001 thru January 2002.  Some changes have been made already by Susan Rance, Gordon Savage, or myself.  Lisa will attempt to hi-light further changes that need to be made to EnPower and we will make those changes here in West Volume Management.  Hopefully this will get EnPower trued up so that we have more confidence that EnPower is correct according to our information.
