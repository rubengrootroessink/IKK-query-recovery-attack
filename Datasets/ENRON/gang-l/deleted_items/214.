MARKET NOTICE 
MAY 14, 2002


Attention IT and Scheduling Personnel
Your participation is requested in the Transmission Constrained Unit
Commitment / Minimum Load Cost Compensation Market Simulation.

As previously announced, the ISO has scheduled for month of June 2002 the
implementation of the Transmission Constrained Unit Commitment (TCUC) and
Minimum Load Cost Compensation (MLCC) programs.  Prior to this
implementation, a Market Simulation is being scheduled for all Market
Participants in order to provide for simulation on the use of this new
functionality.  

Transmission Constrained Unit Commitment /  Minimum Load Cost Compensation
Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 20, 2002.

The ISO will hold an kickoff meeting conference call on Tuesday, May 14 from
10:00 - 11:00 A.M., to elicit participation and review the scope of this
Market Simulation.  During this conference call, we will also request
participants help in finalizing details of the Market Simulation Plan which
will be distributed along with this notification. 

All Market Participants with Resource which fall under the Must Offer
Obligation are strongly urged to participate in this simulation.      

Please respond to Steve Auradou at sauradou@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on
Thursday May 16 if you intend to participate.  Please provide the name,
phone number, and e-mail address of your contact personnel. It is suggested
that this include personnel that would be responsible for IT and Scheduling.



The attached documents provide an agenda for Tuesday's Conference call, a
Proposed Market Simulation Schedule Summary and Market Simulation test plan
and scripts . I have also included the connectivity documentation for the
testing server.
