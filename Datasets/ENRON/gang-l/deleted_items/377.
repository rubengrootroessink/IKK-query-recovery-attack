*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

We all need to have a discussion around current California processes for both the business which is being processed for EPMI as well as the Services business we are providing to our customers.

I would like to walk through each process tomorrow and make sure that everyone understands their roles.

In addition, I feel that everyone needs to understand how to do the other persons job.  I know in some cases this will be harder for some than others.  Trying to understand all of the settlement processes is not something that I expect everyone to pick up. However,  I do expect everyone to know how the scheduling process works and if needed how they can back fill.
