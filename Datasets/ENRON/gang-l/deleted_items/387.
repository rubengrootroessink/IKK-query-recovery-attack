Subject:	Tag's that EPE did not have

There were 3 tags that EPE gen did not have, I circled them and filed them under the 15th in the acordian file.  They were amended after EPE's prescheduler went home.  Just wanted to let you know.  It took 45 min. of time to verify with all parties and this time I needed to work on other things since 4c5 was up and down all night and we lost neman 3, copper and 75 coming in from IPC throgh the peak pretty much all at once.  My notes are in the drawer on the right of the rt desk if you need to look at them, it's a yellow pad.  Just wanted to keep you informed.  Call with any questions.
