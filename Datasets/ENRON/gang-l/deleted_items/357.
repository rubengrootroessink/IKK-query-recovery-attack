Julie,

That is also the week that we will be setting up for the month of May correct?  Or are we going to do that at the end of next week after we purchase the remainder of peek and off-peak power?

I will be taking the week of April 29th-May 3rd off, and heading to sunny Arizona.  Not quite Hawaii, but I'll work on the tan just as well!
Darren is studying to fill the void left by me, so not to worry, California scheduling will be covered!
