Hi,

I just tried to e-mail you a presentation of instructions for the new e-tag, but it is too big to go thru properly.  Darren just called to ask me if I knew anything about it, and I am printing up 3 copies of the presentation for them.

E-tag 1.7 goes live on the 10th, with a dress rehearsal on Monday.  It is going to be UGLY. Most vendors are not ready, and NERC is railroading the start anyway.  The protocol will be for tags to be made, BUT if there are problems to call or fax the control areas and transmission providers to make sure the schedules get implemented
