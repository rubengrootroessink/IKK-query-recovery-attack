> Dear Lisa Gang,
> OATI has successfully verified your identity as the Enron North America
> West (EPMIWE) Security Officer for the OATI webCARES System.  As the Enron
> North America West (EPMIWE) SO, you will have full access to the OATI
> webCARES System for the purposes of issuing and managing Digital
> Certificates for the Enron North America West (EPMIWE) organization.  It
> is very important that you at least login to the OATI webCARES System
> once.  During your initial login, you will be presented with your Digital
> Certificate for download and installation.
> 
> You may access the OATI webCARES System from the following site:
> http://www.oaticerts.com.  As a new Security Officer accessing the
> webCARES System for the first time, please click on the "First Time Users
> Page" link for valuable information and instructions regarding computer
> setup and accessing the system.  In addition, attached to this e-mail,
> OATI has provided a Security Officer's Users Manual that will guide you
> through your initial login to the OATI webCARES System, Importing and
> Exporting Digital Certificates, and solutions for many issues that may
> arise while working with Digital Certificates.
> 
> Patrick Tronnier, our OATI Digital Certificates expert, will be contacting
> you shortly to provide you with your Username and Temporary password to
> the webCARES System.  At this time, Pat will assist you with your first
> login to the system and obtaining your digital certificate.  Once Pat has
> assisted you with access to the webCARES System, then he will provide you
> with login information for your Backup Security Officer, Darren Cavanaugh.
> 
> Finally, attached to this e-mail, we have provided a list of your existing
> webTag (ETS) Usernames.  A corresponding Digital Certificate must be
> created for each Username in the list.  On April 10, 2002, when E-Tag 1.7
> is implemented, your webTag (ETS) Users will not be able to login in to
> the system unless they have a Digital Certificate corresponding to their
> Username loaded within their web browser.  In addition, if your Users need
> access to our webOASIS Node (TVA, AECI, BREC, & EKPC Data), please visit
> www.oatioasis.com for instructions on registering your company and users
> for access.  Please note that a user can use the same Digital Certificate
> to access both the webTag (ETS) and webOASIS systems.
> 
> If you experience any problem with the process or have any questions,
> please feel free to contact the OATI webCARES customer support by either
> E-Mail: webCARES@oatiinc.com or Phone: (763) 553-2725.
