Lisa and Virginia,

A few of us are planning to take Julie to lunch on Friday.  She wanted to go to Typhoon in NW PDX for Thai food.   Jody mentioned that you might be interested in joining us.   So far it's Grace, Jody and I.  Let me know so I can change the reservation.

We're going to leave here at about 11:10 a., pick up Grace at 11:30,. and the reservations are for 11:45 a.m.   Julie is driving.

Kathy
