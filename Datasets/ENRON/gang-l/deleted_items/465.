Lisa,
I know you are busy. I thought I would email you, so you don't have to call me back later..
 
Rhonda wanted me to let you know that we are checking into the state tax question you had yesterday. She had to call Oregon Tax Commission and she is waiting for them to call her back. She said that it won't go into effect this paycheck, but we should hopefully know something soon. 
 
Also, I wanted to clarify your hours on last week's timesheet. I am coming up with 55 hours instead of 57. 
 
Have a good day!!
Talk to you later!
