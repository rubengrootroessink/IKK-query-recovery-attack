HEY - WASN'T SURE IF THAT WAS YOU OR NOT.  I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE BACK
THERE AGAIN.  I FIGURED YOU WENT AHEAD AND POSED FOR PLAYBOY IN THE
WOMEN OF ENRON ISSUE AND MADE YOURSELF A LUCRATIVE CAREER WITH THAT
WHOLE GIG.  I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT YOU OFTEN AND WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.
I TALKED TO STACY AT SMUD SEVERAL WEEKS BACK AND SHE SAID SHE HAD BEEN
IN TOUCH WITH YOU FROM TIME TO TIME.  I MISS YOU GUYS AND DEALING WITH
ENRON.  LIFE IS JUST A LITTLE MORE BORING NOW.  SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP
TO?? I'M REALLY CURIOUS.  I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUY SOME TICKETS TO AN
INDY CAR RACE IN PORTLAND IN JUNE AND WAS THINKING THAT I COULD FINALLY
MEET YOU BUT I DIDN'T GET THEM YET AND WASN'T EVEN SURE IF I COULD GET A
HOLD OF YOU OR IF YOU WOULD EVEN WANT TO.  LIFE HERE HAS BEEN PRETTY
MUCH THE SAME - JUST WORKING AND PLAYING.  THE WIFE IS OK - WE'RE STILL
WORKING ON SOME ISSUES  - SEEMS NEVERENDING BUT WE HAVEN'T KILLED EACH
OTHER YET SO I GUESS THAT'S GOOD.  YOU SHOULD CALL ME WHEN YOU GET A
CHANCE - I'D LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU.  I HEARD BOONE SAY THAT LISA FROM
ENRON WAS ON THE PHONE AND CRAIG AND I BOTH LOOKED AT EACH OTHER LIKE -
IS THAT THE OLD INFAMOUS LISA.  I HOPE YOU ARE DOING GREAT.  RESPOND
WHEN YOU CAN.

KEVIN
