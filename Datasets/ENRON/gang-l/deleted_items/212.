MARKET NOTICE
May 15, 2002
Weekly ISO Operations Conference Calls
ISO Market Participants:
Attention: Operations Personnel
Beginning May 22, the ISO will host a weekly conference with ISO Operations
staff, Scheduling Coordinators, Municipal Utilities, IOUs and other control
areas to review and discuss current operational issues.  
The ISO's objective for these calls is to provide a forum for discussion of
current operational issues.  We will begin the calls with a review of any
current operational issues at the ISO and provide time for feedback from
participants on these issues. Then participants will have an opportunity to
raise operational issues from their viewpoint. 
The calls will be open to anyone, but will likely be most useful to
operations managers, forward market and real time schedulers and other
personnel involved with unit dispatches.  We anticipate that Generators,
Municipal Utilities, IOUs, and other control areas will participate.  
The first call will be held Wednesday May 22 from 11 AM to noon (PST)
Subsequent calls will be held every Tuesday from 1:30 to 2:30 (PST) from May
29 to June 25.  In late June we will evaluate the calls with participants to
determine whether and how best to continue this dialogue, especially during
the summer.
The call in information is: 877-670-4111 Passcode 589314
If you have questions or would like additional information, please contact
Sue Happ at shapp@caiso.com or (916) 608-7059.
