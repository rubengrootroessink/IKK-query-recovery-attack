I've had a couple questions about being able to use DST certificates to 
access our web site.  The answer is "no."  We could program the server to 
accept certificates from different sources, but we would have to install a 
server certificate for each one.  DST wants about $25k to do that.  OATI's is 
next to nothing by comparison.  And OATI client side certificates are free to 
OATI clients, $120/year to nonclients.  So if you want to have access to the 
EHV web site and don't have an OATI digital certificate, you'll need to get 
one.
