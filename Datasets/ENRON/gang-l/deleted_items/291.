Hello all-

  Here is the final wrap on Jeffrey's Suprise Birthday party:

  We are going to meet up at the Willamette Athletic Club in the Cafe between 4:00 - 4:15 pm this Saturday.  Elaine at the front desk knows what we are doing; just tell her that you are there for Jeffrey Oh's thing and she will show you where to go.  Jeff and I will be there at about 4:30.  Jeffrey thinks that we are meeting his brother John and one other friend there to go to Who Song.
  If possible, please park closer to Who Song and Larry's; especially if Jeffrey knows what your car looks like. (don't want him to wonder why all his friends are at the athletic club...)  After the cafe, we will head over to Who Song and Larry's (some time around 5ish for those who can't make it earlier).

  Call me if you need anything at all. My cell is 503-703-7685.

  I look forward to seeing you all there!  Thanks for helping me pull this off.
  (If you haven't RSVP'd, please shoot me an email so I have an idea of how many are comming.)

  Thanks again,

  Virginia

     
DATE: 	Saturday May 4, 2002
