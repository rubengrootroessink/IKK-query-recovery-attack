Continued curtailments from BPA.

The curtailments for BPA continued for last week.  I believe we need to have the BPA purchases adjusted accordingly.

 
All curtailments began at 7:00 AM

I have / am requesting cash payments for the purchases to Avista. (I'm already paid through the 27th)

On 5/1/02 Curtailments were 4 contracts #21892 and #21896 from 25 to 22MW and #23273 and #23274 from 50 to 43MW
Lisa will have to tell you the Light load cut on Sunday.

Mo.

Subject:	BPA CURTAILMENT FOR APRIL 22ND 

On April 21st and April 22nd, Pat Kelley from BPA prescheduling group called and informed me we were curtailed by a total of 12 mw for HE 7-22 for April 22nd at COB.  Accordingly, we purchased 12 mw from Avista to cover our position.  At 1:00 p.m, April 22, Rob called from BPA and informed me they made a mistake with the hours of the curtailment and that it was only supposed to be cut HE 7-20 and not HE 21-22.  Therefore, BPA will not charge 12 mw for 2 hours on April 22nd.

The deal numbers are as follows:  deal#153325(2mw),153327(2mw),305699(4mw) and 305700(4mw)

If you have any questions, please see me.

Lisa
