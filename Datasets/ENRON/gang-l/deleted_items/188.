Lisa-

  I will be out at an appointment this afternoon.  I know we spoke a bit this morning; can you sit with Jenny Thome this afternoon and go over the following:

  1. How scheduling works
  2. How to access the scheduling spreadsheets (please give her the path to the sheets)
  3. A list of what tie points are under which spreadsheet
  4. How to navigate her way thru to find purchases, sales, and transmission

 and anything else you come across.

  Thanks,

  Virginia
