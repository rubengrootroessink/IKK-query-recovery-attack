Market Participants & Schedulers:

Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time Transition 

The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should prepare schedules
for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI) system for the
upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on 4/7/02.

When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for Trade Date
4/7/02, which is considered a "Short" day, SC's should  schedule all 24
hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data from/to the SI
database for the "Short" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will be sent to
settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have only 23
records for this "Short" day, Trade Date 4/7/02.

If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade date, please
contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-2213.
