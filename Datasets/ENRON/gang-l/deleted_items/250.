MARKET NOTICE
May 9, 2002
Timelines for Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets
ISO Market Status Distribution:
The ISO Tariff requires the ISO to follow specific timelines for validating
Schedules and closing the Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets.  These markets
must close on time.  The ISO also must adhere to these timelines both to
permit the ISO to complete its congestion management and unit commitment
processes and give timely approval to balanced Schedules and to help ensure
that other control areas have sufficient time to perform their own
validations, check-outs and e-tagging.
To help meet the timelines for the Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead Markets, please
initiate and conduct your own Phase 2 validation before the 10:00 a.m.
deadline for submitting schedules, rather than waiting for the ISO to
perform the validation.  This will help to resolve in advance issues that
could prevent timely Market closing, including identifying and balancing any
unbalanced inter-Scheduling Coordinator trades.  The ISO reminds Scheduling
Coordinators that all Schedules must comply with all of the requirements set
out in the ISO Tariff.  The Tariff does not permit exceptions from
requirements for Schedules submitted close to the closing time for the
markets.
If you have any questions about the Scheduling process or would like
additional training on resolving imbalanced Schedules or other timing
problems, please contact your Account Manager.
