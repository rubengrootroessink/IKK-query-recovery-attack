Hey Lisa-
 
  Here is the information for the SUPRISE 'party' for Jeffrey's birthday.  His B'day is Friday and we are going to have a party for him (and another friend named Ron who's birthday is Thursday) this Saturday.  Since this is Cinco De Mayo weekend, we are going to go to Who Song and Larry's in John's Landing, but it will be packed, so we are all going to meet up at the Willamette Athletic Club in the Cafe', which is right across the street. We will have snacks and cake at the Club and then walk over to Who Song & Larry's together so we all get in together. Who Song's will have drinks, food, dancing, etc.

 Please let me know if you can make it.  

  Thanks,

  Virginia
