How funny you ask, I spoke to them today and they did say that the deductions should start on your next check.  I realize that the past we have not made any but they have asked me to call back on Monday to discuss.  I will keep you informed.

Thanks for your patience.

Lisa,

I apologize for the delay!  This is a new one for us and they are taking their sweet time on getting the paper work back to us.  I have copied Pam LaRue on this email as you can see and she will respond to you on how that process is going.

Rhonda

Hi Rhonda,

 I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.  Thank You.

lisa
