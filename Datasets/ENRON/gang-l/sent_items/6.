Lisa:

Do you know if this issue was resolved ---did we verify how we charge BPA for LDs?

Thanks!  Jenny

What matters is what the contract indicates. What is the Enpower deal confirmation number? I will have someone pull the contract to determine EPMI's rights as it relates to charging BPA LD's.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

I assume that on all cuts on COB deliveries that we are charging BPA liquidated damages. In this case $3.50/MWhr for 6/18. Please let me know if this is not the case. Also, how do we track and record COB non-delivery LD's for BPA's?

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.
