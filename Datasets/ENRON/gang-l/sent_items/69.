Julie, this is about autoscheduling.  Can you make sure everything is autoscheduled.  Ask Paul if system is not working.

Lisa, 

Are you still having problems with Enpower?  It is essential that every day is scheduled in Enpower, for us to report the correct MTM P&L, which we are doing on a daily basis.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.
