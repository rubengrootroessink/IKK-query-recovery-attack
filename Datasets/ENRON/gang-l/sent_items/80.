Lisa, here is a sample of what Jesse Bryson was doing on the monthly
schedule activity, basically just took the applicable Enron monthly schedule
from the contract package and added it to the WAPA hydro monthly schedule, I
have given your Name/number to Lynn Garrett who is our WAPA POC for this,
the Enron allocation (per contract) must be 25% green energy, certifable
with green tags for use at Edwards.  
I'll be in touch, 
Paul Weaver

Paul,
Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron. 
Regards,
Jesse
