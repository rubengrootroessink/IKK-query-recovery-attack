Hi Rhonda,

 I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.  Thank You.
