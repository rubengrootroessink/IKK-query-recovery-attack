Hi Lisa,
The counterparty is showing this deal but I am not and their deal numbers are different from ours. They supplied a tag number but it was not enough information so I have asked the counterparty for addition information and I will get back with you on this. Thanks.

I'm working on settlement issues for NVP, DMS 12398.  Can you provide me with a deal#?
