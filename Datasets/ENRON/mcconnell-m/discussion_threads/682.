I'm pulling together some sample presentations that should help.  In 
addition, I ususally get fairly involved the first time someone presents so 
just let me know if I can help.  I had assumed that Shankman would attend and 
you are welcome to bring additional people to the Board meeting if you think 
they can contribute to the presentation in some way.  I just ask that you not 
have a cast of thousands!

Rebecca,

I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.  He 
has never attended one.

It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially 
like this.  Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of 
presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of 
information.

Thanks,
mike
