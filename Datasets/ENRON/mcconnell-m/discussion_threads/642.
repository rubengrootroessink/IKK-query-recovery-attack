Below is a quick follow up to some of the things I mentioned I'd check out at 
our last meeting.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance with your 
efforts.

Contributions
The contributions from last year that I mentioned at the meeting turned out 
to be inclusive of Enron Corp., individual and matching funds.

Weather
I had a chance to talk with our folks from the Weather Group.  The 
information regarding Oklahoma that I told you I'd look into actually ended 
up being a center for Weather Research that was being sponsored by Williams 
not our weather group.

Scholarship
There are a couple of different scholarship and fundraising initiatives 
underway that are being driven by Enron employees and alumni of the 
individual universities employed here.  They take advantage of matching funds 
and are administered by employees here with some assistance by Community 
Relations and University Affairs.  If you are interested in organizing an 
effort like this for Oklahoma, let me know and I can work with you on the 
details.
