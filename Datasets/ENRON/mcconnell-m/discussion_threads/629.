Jeff-

Can you believe it! What's there not to love. It is the  finest
mural/painting of its kind I have seen available since the great TH Benton
mural cycle purchased by Equitable. Historically and qualitatively,
Lewandowski is at the top of the second tier of industrial/precisionist/
social realist painters after artists like Benton and Charles Sheeler. This
is a "machine age" masterpiece that epitomizes the glorification of the
worker and industry- a message Enron should appreciate.

The Lewandowski is a 103" x 67 oil on canvas executed in 1942. It came off
the wall of a building in Milwaukee where Lewandowski lived and worked
during the 1930s-40s.
The condition is quite good with almost no inpainting and a few horizontal
crinkles in the canvas.

The Greenville County Museum of Art had the Lewandowski on final
approval,but they hesitated today and I just committed to buy it as it sat
at the museum.

The price is $275,000.00 which is higher than any of Lewandowski's other
works, but this is monumental and unlike any other work. I hope youw ill
agree taht the price is reasonable for a painting of such scale, quality,
and historical significance.

Lewandowski's good early industrial watercolors of this era, 18" x 24" +/-,
have sold for $50,000.00+++. The "Circuit Breakers" painting I own that you
have seen at the gallery is priced at $150,000.00 and it is close to being
sold. I think Southwestern Bell has a Lewandowski watercolor and I know I
recently saw an 1939 industrial  Lewandowski painting hanging at the Dallas
Museum of Art.

The Lewandowski will be shipped to me from the Greenville County Museum in
the coming weeks and I hope you and others at Enron can arrange to see it.

-Michael
