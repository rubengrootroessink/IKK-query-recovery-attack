I've discussed in detail the strategic outline/process with both John and 
Larry and they're both in agreement.  We're (EGM Orig. Team) meeting w/ 
McKinsey this Friday to "kick it off!"  We'll start implementing the Regional 
Analysis the following week.  The wheels are in motion!

Randy,
Thanks for the update.  I like your plan.  I like the McKinsey part as 
well.   Please make sure that Suzanne understands the plan and that you John 
and Larry agree on the way forward.  If there are any issues, please let Jeff 
or me know..
