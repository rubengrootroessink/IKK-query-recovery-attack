Subject: Coal information

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m
