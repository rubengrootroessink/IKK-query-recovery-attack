Mike:

Thanks for taking the time to visit with me.  By way of follow-up, I would
like to confirm my understanding of the action items.

   Sheryl will coordinate with Cathy to arrange for a dinner meeting with
   you and the executive team of Enron Networks
   Steve Morse will contact you in the near future to coordinate meetings
   to discuss how Enron Networks can leverage i2 technology, domain
   expertise and intellectual capital  to gain competitive advantage in
   your choosen marketplaces
   Steve Morse will coordinate a meeting with Enron Broadband, Enron
   Networks and i2 to explore opportunities to go to market together
   leveraging our respective strengths

Mike, I want to reinforce i2's commitment to Enron and our desire to move
forward as a strategic partner.  Thanks for your time and consideration.

Regards,
Sanjiv
