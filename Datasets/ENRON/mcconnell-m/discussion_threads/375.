Mike,

My apologies for bothering you on your holiday.  Dr. Irani has had the
opportunity to visit with HRH, the Foreign Minister on a couple of occasions
in the past week.  We have been given a few insights that I would like to
share with you.  The most significant is the suggestion that we request
permission from the Negotiating Team to begin discussions with the other
short-listed companies about possible consortium arrangements.  We want to
make sure that Enron is comfortable with that at this stage.  Our intent
would be to have very high-level contacts to guage interest but not to make
any commitments at this point.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards and I hope you had a great holiday,

Casey Olson
