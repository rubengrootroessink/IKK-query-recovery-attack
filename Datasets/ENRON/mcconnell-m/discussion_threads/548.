FYI - see message below re: our potential trip to Mexico City on 5/21.  We're 
pushing to get the meetings back to back but you know how politicians can 
be.  Will keep you posted.  If the meetings can NOT be back to back would you 
want to consider taking one of the smaller company jets?  Your call, I can 
work either way.

Randy:

I just spoke with Pedro regarding the Ministry of Finance Meeting in Mexico
City.  He is hopeful (but not certain) that we can schedule a meeting on
the back end of the PMI session.  I suggest you and Mike continue to keep
the entire day open at this point.   If it turns out that the Ministry of
Finance meeting will be later in the day, Pedro can shuttle you and Mike to
our Mexico City office where you may access phones, desks, etc. during the
interim.

You will most likely meet with the Director General of Credit who is
responsible for managing fx, and financial credit with the international
markets.  He's in a very influential position within the Finance Ministry.

Let me know if you need any additional info at this point. Otherwise, we'll
review the Ministry of Finance document and Maya pricing concepts on
Tuesday, 15th, at 9 am here in our office.

Regards, Eric
