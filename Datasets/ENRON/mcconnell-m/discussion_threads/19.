I am pleased to announce the following additions to the Enron Global 
Strategic Sourcing Operations Group:  

Effective June 1, Tracy Ramsey has joined the group as a sourcing portfolio 
leader and Cheryl Slone has joined the group as a travel coordinator.  In her 
new position, Tracy will be responsible for overseeing all travel, 
entertainment and conference-related sourcing activities.  She has held 
various positions within the travel industry and most recently served as

Cheryl joined Enron in 1998 as a travel coordinator.  She brings more than 
seven years of travel industry experience to her new position.  Prior to 
joining Enron, she most recently worked in travel management services for 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

Additionally, Amanda Becher has joined the group as a supply analyst.  Prior
