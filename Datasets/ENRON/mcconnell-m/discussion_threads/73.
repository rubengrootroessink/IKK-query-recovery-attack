Mike,

Attached is the "Net Works" section we discussed.  In addition, could you ask 
the Online team for the missing information in this Jeff Skilling earnings 
release quote.  We need to distribute the earnings release draft early this 
afternoon.

 "In the second quarter, EnronOnline registered a ______% increase in volumes 
and a _____% increase in transactions versus the first quarter."

Thanks,
Mark
