Rebecca,

I would also like to bring Jeff Shankman with me to the board meeting.  He 
has never attended one.

It has been a long time since i have presented anything to board especially 
like this.  Would you please provide me a copy of the last couple of 
presentations so that I can be consistent and give them the right kind of 
information.

Thanks,
mike
