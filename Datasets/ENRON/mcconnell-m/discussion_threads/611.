Hello Mike,

My name is Brian Dawson and I work in ENA Merchant Finance.   I heard you 
speak at the Adams Mark Hotel last week discussing the future of EGM.  I 
wanted to let you know that I may have some information that might be useful 
to you.  I have a close friend who is the Vice President Marketing/Purchasing 
of Rigid Building Systems located off of Aldine Westfield and Beltway 8.  He 
has over 20 years in the industry of buying from the mills and selling steel 
components to contractors, end users, and service centers.  We were 
discussing the steel industry as a whole and some of his ideals were 
identical to yours.  I didn't know if you would be the right person for this 
information.  If you would like for me to forward this information to someone 
else, please let me know.  Thank you for your consideration.

Brian Dawson
