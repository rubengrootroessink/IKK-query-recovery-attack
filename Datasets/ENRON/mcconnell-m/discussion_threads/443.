Eric,

Hoping all is well,

Wanted to have a quick chat with you, when you are next in Houston, about the 
Egypt LNG opportunity.  I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy 
minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased 
participation in the LNG field in Egypt.  They are interested in diverse 
off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would 
like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found 
for the remaining equity).  They know they don't know how to project finance 
such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at 
least partial) off-take.  They alluded that the situation with Finosa, 
although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.

At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a 
conversations--and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a 
project forward.

Cheers'

Hamd
