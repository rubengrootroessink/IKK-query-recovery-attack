Hi Mike.  The tournament was great to watch on tv, so it must have been
terrific to be there.  I feel badly for Duval.  He played his heart out and
Tiger gave him an opening, but he just couldn't convert.  I will definitely
let you know when I am next in Houston; it would be fun to hit the links
again together.  Similarly, if you are in New York and have some extra time,
please let me know.

Our email address at home is poling@optonline.net.   Jennifer told me that
she tried to email Chris a couple of days ago; I have given her your home
email again to make sure that she has the right address.

Doug,

The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was
magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever
miss the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were
not at max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler
weather.  What a great tournament.

Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game
at Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this
year.

Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.

Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home
email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com.

Mike
