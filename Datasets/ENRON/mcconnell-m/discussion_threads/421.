Per,

Today, I submitted a brief summary of each groups 2001 goals.  I wasn't able 
to talk to you before putting these out but they were fine for step one.  
Please review  and make any changes you wish to them.  I also need you to add 
as many specifics as possible.  For example number of transactions, $ 
amounts, etc.  Please read and make the changes on this email and return to 
me asap.  Keep your goals to no more than 5.

Thanks,
