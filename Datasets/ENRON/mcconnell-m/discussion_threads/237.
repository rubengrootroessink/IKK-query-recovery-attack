Mike,

Per our conversation yesterday, attached is a brief work history.  If anyone
has any questions or wants more information, tell them to feel free to call me
next week.  I can most easily be reached during the day at 713-267-4192 or on
my cell phone at 713-817-7624.  Looking forward to seeing you on the 6th.

Neal
