Based on last weeks meeting and discussion between the team here and you it 
seems like you are moving toward
separating the non-Nordic region and headquartering it in London.  John 
Sherriff and I are comfortable with this and would like to 
move forward with the plan if at all possible effective April 1, 2001.  We 
would split the groups with one Nordic group here in Oslo, reporting back to 
Enron Europe, and one Team for the rest of Europe in London, reporting back 
to you.  I assume that we can arrange all technical and practical things to 
get this done as soon as possible.  Please give me a call to confirm your 
support (or not if we need to discuss further) and let's see how fast and 
smoothly we can get these changes made.

Regards 


Thor
