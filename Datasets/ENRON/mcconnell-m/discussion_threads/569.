Cathy:

 I spoke to the Outlook migration team and they have added you, Yolanda 
Martinez, and Mike McConnell to the Outlook Migration schedule for the night 
of Monday, June 11th.  I am copying Gary Bode so that he has plenty of notice 
regarding the public folders and other requirements you have discussed.

 Also, I have put a ticket in to have the Outlook team look into your 
addressing problem.  In the meantime, if someone sends a message to your 
internet address (Cathy.Phillips@enron.com), it will still go through, even 
from within Enron.


Thanks!
