Jeff,

Attached is the outline from today's meeting.  

If I could put in my two cents about my future boss, I'd say:  hungry 
director... some good gas trader who's really sharp and excellent at what 
he's doing, but he's never going to be king of the gas desk because there's 
too many crown princes, and he'd rather side-step them all and push this LNG 
forward with a vengence.  and if he's tired of Houston and not too much of an 
arrogant bastard, that's a bonus.

I'm off to the pub.  These 7:30pm meetings don't do much for me.  Have a good 
weekend.

Merritt
