Mike,

I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that I enjoyed meeting
with you and your wife.  If there is any additional information that I can
furnish you with (homeowner reference list, etc.) please let me know.  I can
be reached at the following  numbers: pager (281) 279-6500 or cell phone
(281) 960-3749.

I look forward to speaking with you in the near future.

Alan Kent, President
Flair Custom Homes
