The project name was changed at the request of Corporate Development as they 
are concerned about discovery and a project name which could imply Enron 
stuffed EOTT.  The following is a current overview we are using to update the 
different disciplines involved with the transaction to date.  Our 
calculations continue to show a net $100MM benefit to EGM with 2Q $62MM due 
to Enron's current 38% economic ownership of EOTT.  No new updates to 
fastrack a sale of the GP.
