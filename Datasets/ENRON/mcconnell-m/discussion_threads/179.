Robert,

Attached is the draft review for Steve.  Please review and make 
changes/corrections as you believe are necessary.  I could use the help, this 
is a tough one.   Please let me know your views on the tone and message as 
well.  I will give him  the actual review when i get back from Asia.

Thanks,
mike
