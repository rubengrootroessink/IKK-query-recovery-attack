Attached you will find a list of OU alumni from the GIS system.  Please look 
it over and let me know if there are any alumni that you feel should be added 
to our OU team.  The information in this spreadsheet is taken directly from 
GIS, so it should be fairly accurate and complete.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thank you for your help.

Have a great day!
