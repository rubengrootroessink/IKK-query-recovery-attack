Tom,

In response to our discussion, attached is Fritz's resume.  It doesn't prin=
t=20
well.  As i mentioned earlier, I have know him for many years and was his=
=20
employee and then his business partner.  I exited the business when we were=
=20
ready to go public (which never happened as planned).  His company went und=
er=20
a couple years after that. =20

Fritz is an amazing self made man.  He is the consummate salesman and would=
=20
be (and he now has some background) a great trainer.  He works tirelessly a=
nd=20
has a great deal of energy and sales experience.  At one point he was=20
considered to be one of the top natural gas transport experts in the US and=
=20
that is where he made his millions at Excel.  He lost all of it in the end.

He needs help and has come to me for consulting work or a job.  Robert Jone=
s,=20
VP for HR for Wholesale - Networks, worked with him and he did some work fo=
r=20
us and was pleased with the training work.  He is also considering other=20
options.

I thought he might fit somewhere in your organization because of his sales,=
=20
marketing and ability to work with a wide variety of  customers.  EES has s=
o=20
many different types of jobs and skill sets.

I would be very grateful if you or Beth would interview him and see if ther=
e=20
is a fit somewhere in the organization.  I would really appreciate it if on=
e=20
of you would take 30 minutes and see if there is a fit anywhere.

Thank you very much.  I consider this a favor and one that might just work=
=20
out.

Sincerely,
Mike
