John,

Below is a response from Richard Harper.  A couple of interesting thoughts.  
Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or  testing 
concepts.  He is brilliant on this.
Just a thought.

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our 
approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block 
and did not forsee a shortage of production.

 It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or 
whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to 
co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.  
Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.

As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy 
themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the 
money.

With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the 
appeal courts?   This is probably nearest to the truth.

I'm afraid this isn't much help and I do not recall any willful default 
provisions in the agreement.

Richard

Richard,
 Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding 
the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your 
thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please 
follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he 
mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory 
fades on some of the details in just a few years.

Mike

I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John
