Allan,

Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.  We need to 
follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the 
number  2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.  He is a Ken Lay buddy as well.  
Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply 
respond and say thanks no thanks.  We just don't want him to think that Enron 
blew him off.

Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time.

Mike
