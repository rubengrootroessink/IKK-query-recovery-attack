Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 37/2000




Highlight
Coeclerici deal is on track for completion in a weeks time.  Looking for our 
second big cape deal with potentially SK Shipping or Bocimar which would net 
out all our underlying expossure with Coeclerici and allow us to keep the 
options.
Fixed a Panamax  on subject with Bocimar for 3/5 months to do the first grain 
cargo ( US gulf/Japan ) with Dreyfus

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	UP	Flat	Flat
Panamax	UP	UP	Flat
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat


Panamax : Market continues to rise in the east from Australia to China and 
.next year based soly on sentiment.
Capes : Market is a little flat as many asian countries were on holiday this 
week
Crude is not falling which keeps owners unwilling to discount
