Dear Mr. McConnell,

After reading this mornings Wall Street Journal article with interest, I
thought it appropriate to write you, introducing our firm to you and our LNG
facilities.

Coincidently, we had talked to our friends at Vinson and Elkins a few weeks
ago about an introduction to the right person in Enron to discuss our LNG
projects with.

I am sending by courier hard copies of the items attached to this e-mail.

We look forward to meeting you, and discussing the LNG opportunities in
greater detail.


Yours faithfully,


Steve Meheen
