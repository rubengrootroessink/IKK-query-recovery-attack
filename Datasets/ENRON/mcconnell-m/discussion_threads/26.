The purpose of this email is to highlight a few points and action items tha=

were emphasized during my recent trips to South America, Japan and Korea. =

Overall the trips were definitely worth the effort and each business unit n=

is not meant to be a complete laundry list of all the important issues and=

Enron South America

worked with Greg Piper.  I believe that this is the best and short-term=20
opportunity out there.
? Metals and mining is big in South America.  This was also brought up=20

until decision made on Project California.

Enron Japan
Joe is building an impressive team and he has a thorough and well thought o=
ut=20
business plan.  Japan has the opportunity to be really big (another Enron=

Europe?) and we have an excellent opportunity to get it right from the star=
t=20
and drive this market.  He is in a unique position to develop a huge busine=
ss=20
and drive it with technology without having the burden of a large legacy=20
problem.  I think they look more like an Enron Net Works type of business=
=20
than most the other business units.  Enron Japan needs to use the internet =
