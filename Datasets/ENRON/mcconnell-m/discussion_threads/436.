Ken,

You might point out to McConnell that there is a strong correlation between
OU's football success and the price of a barrel of oil.  Talk about the best
team money can buy!

Also, if Mike has any friends coming from the East Coast to visit him in
Oklahoma tell him to send them these directions:

1)  Head West until you smell sh_t--you have made it to Texas,

2)  Head North until you step in it--you are now in Oklahoma!

OK.  But at least we have upside.   The ability to count past 7 exceeds the
limit  of most OU students, alums, football players and coaches thereby
either
capping the number of national championships you can talk about at 7.
Alternatively, OU would have to increase academic standards to enable them
to
count beyond the 7 national championships.  Unfortunately, we already know
that
actually winning a national championship with athletes possesing an IQ above
plant life only occurs at Nebraska, so you are in a horrible Catch 22.  (I'm
sorry, for OU grads like yourself a you wouldn't understand the term "Catch
22".
Just take it from me,  you can't  win).

Oh.... you may note that I have decided to involve the big guns in this
debate!

Ken,

I had to respond.

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops
not
taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job that
will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started working
on
his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who are the
Huskers?

Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom
Osborne
who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch.

Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by
Tom
Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in
Coaching.  It was a best seller.

Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst
loss
in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS?

Thanks for the note.   Sooners rule.  We'll find time when things settle
down.

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone
again,
I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we have to
have
the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday night so I may
be
working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty good shape so I will
probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two
of
them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I can't
remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college
football
fan.
