Had internal meeting (Mahoney/Hardy/Davies/Quick/Anastasia), decided to :
1/ send a brief fax asking for whereabouts of payment due today
2/ will send tomorrow (if we don t have anything positive back) that we 
postpone meeting Barcelona due Thursday.

Seems from discussion with Anastasia/Pam Shaw that GM intends to propose a 
global package (whatever that means) during our next meeting, but we don t 
want to move over there, before we hear more details. 
Last minute : Pam now just calling saying Antonio will call us thursday to 
discuss late payment (tomorrow is holiday in Spain).
My feeling is that they will propose a part payment now, and balance plus end 
november instalment,  with a new time schedule.
Will need a few more boxes of candle..
