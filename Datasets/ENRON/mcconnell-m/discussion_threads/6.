Jeff, 
FYI.  I will co-ordinate an executive dinner.  He is a great guy and a real 
player.  Sanjiv has asked Ken to be on the board and he is considering.  
I'll give more details later.
Mike

   expertise and intellectual capital  to gain competitive advantage in
   your choosen marketplaces
   Steve Morse will coordinate a meeting with Enron Broadband, Enron
   Networks and i2 to explore opportunities to go to market together
