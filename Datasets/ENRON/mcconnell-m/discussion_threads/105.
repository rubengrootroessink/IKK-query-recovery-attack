Good Afternoon,

Attached please find the results for your operating company from the "Who 
Wants to Help Millions" contest for United Way.  The spreadsheet contains 
only those who answered them correctly and those who missed 1 to 5 out of a 
possible 15 questions.

We would like to have 5 employees from every business unit for a 
pre-qualifying round to be held before the all employee meeting on August 
9th.  On the spreadsheet that contains the names of those participates who 
answered the questions, please choose the 5 employees you would like to 
represent your business unit.  We feel that those individuals who either 
answered them all correct or only missed one should be automatically 
selected.  How you determine your remaining representatives will be at your 
discretion.  

We must receive your responses by Wednesday, August 2nd.

Should you have any questions please feel free to contact either Kathy 
Mayfield (3-3264), John Walt (3-5379) or myself (3-7554).

Thank you for your support for the 2000 United Way Campaign.
