"12" OU facts.....

Legendary head coach Bud Wilkinson was 145-29-4 with 3 National
Championships at OU.

In 1985, heading into the Orange Bowl, Barry Switzer's record was
144-29-4, with 2 National Championships. A win by Switzer would
mean the two men would be dead even. He won.

Bud Wilkinson was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gomer Jones,
who had a difficult time replacing a legend, and was replaced by Jim
Mackenzie. Mackenzie played college ball at Kentucky under Bear Bryant,
Mackenzie would only be OU's coach for one year. He was replaced by
an NFL assistant named Chuck Fairbanks, who would be replaced by Barry
Switzer.

Switzer was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gary Gibbs, who had
a hard time following a legend. Gibbs was replaced by Howard
Schnellenberger, who played his college ball at Kentucky under Bear
Bryant. Howard was OU's coach for only one year. He was replaced by an
NFL assistant named John Blake, who would be replaced by Bob Stoops.

Killer B's -- Bud, Barry & Bob

OU plays in the Big 12. Until this year, OU had never won 12 games.

There are 12 letters in: Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer, Robert Stoops.

There are 12 letters in Boomer Sooner.

Stoops was 12 years old when Barry Switzer was hired as head coach.

OSU has beaten OU only 14 times -- the 12th time they beat them, the
score was 12-0.

John Blake won 12 games, in 3 years.

There are 12 letters in Florida State and Miami Florida.

And the BIGGIE... Up until 2 January 2001, OU has won 11 of 15 Orange
Bowls.

Now it's 12. How about those Sooner players and Coaches!!!!!!!!!!!!
