John,

Jeff and I had many excellent meetings with your team and received a very=
=20
good run down of their businesses.  We went out to dinner with the key=20
players and I think they understand our new vision and they appeared to be=
=20
fired up.  As a follow-up to those meetings and our QBR,  Jeff and I would=
=20
like you to prepare a more definite business plan for the future. This will=

Once this is done, we will present it to Mark Frevert and then the other CE=

Your vision of the future

Resources - how do we attract top talent since we don't offer a piece of th=
