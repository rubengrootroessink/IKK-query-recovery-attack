Dear Mike and Chris:

I received the message you called before Christmas.  I apologize for the
extended delay.  I wanted to follow up with you.  Unfortunately, the
message-taker was not efficient, thus if you could specify again your question
I would be happy to research it out for you.  Please let me know.

How was your Christmas and New Years holidays?  I returned home for the
holidays to Pennsylvania.  It was wonderful to visit again with family and
friends.  But I will have admit it was quite shocking to arrive off the plane
to a high of 6 degrees.  I guess I have become quite acclimated to the temp
orate climate here in San Francisco.

Looking forward to continue working with you.
