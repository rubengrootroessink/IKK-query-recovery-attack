George,

I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the 
political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 
credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will 
have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the 
meeting. 

Thanks,
mike
