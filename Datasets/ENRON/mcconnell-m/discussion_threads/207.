Virginia,

Thanks for the email.  I apologize for the slow response.  Life is crazy and 
I have been back on the road again.

 I am interested in purchasing "Blue Note" and I understand that the price is 
$4,500 framed as before.  I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have 
stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I 
have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there 
is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't 
leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience.  
That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will 
commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can 
tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that 
price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller.

Please let me know what you think.  I am in this week.

Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I am 
ready to make a decision.

Mike

Dear Mike:

How is Tokyo?  Events look serious in the Middle East right now.  Where are
you heading to next?

The weather here has been lovely.  When do you think you and your wife will
next be in San Francisco?

Please let me know how you would like to proceed on the Lichtenstein artwork
'Blue Note.'  We have located the work on your behalf but cannot proceed until
we have a serious commitment from you.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky
