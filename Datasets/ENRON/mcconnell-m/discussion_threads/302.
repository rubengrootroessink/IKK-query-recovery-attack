Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week 
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was 
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I needed 
the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.  
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks co-ordinated 
and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go skiing.  We 
didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last discussion a 
while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that 
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll 
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun 
year.  It is nice to be back.
