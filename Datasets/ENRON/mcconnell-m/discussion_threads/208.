Rick,

Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am 
putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is 
on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need 
to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
 I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we 
complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
Thanks,
Mike
