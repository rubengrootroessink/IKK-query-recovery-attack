Chip will forward the signed dashes to you. Let me know if you don't get it.

We keep signed DASHs on file.  I'll have copies forwarded to Mike.

Can you help me on this?  I wasn't aware Mike wasn't getting copies. Is this 
something we were responsible for and didn't do? Joana and I both were 
working under the assumption RAC distributed signed copies of the final Dash 
approval to everyone. I haven't received signed copies either, but was happy 
to assume they resided in RAC and I could get them if needed.

Let me know what to do.

Thanks.

Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.  I want 
them for my files.
Thanks,
