John, 

Thanks for your outlines.  Here are a couple of others that aren't kid 
related.  The Choice is just 1 small piece but I love it.  Actually,  The 
Choice moved me so much, I sold my piece of the business (Excel)  and 
returned to Enron -  the rest is history.

Enjoy,
Mike

PS - We are way to similar!
