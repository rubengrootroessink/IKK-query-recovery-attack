Dear Mr McConnell

Some two weeks ago we sent you the colour illustrations of the works by
Signac and Cross which you had said were of interest to you. Since that
time we have had no reply fromyou.

Did you receive the package? Perhaps you could let us know the situation.

I llok forward to hearing from you

William Weston.
