Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow
reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of
interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients.

The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The
details are:

Paul Signac Le Soir - Evening Jetty at Flessingue
Original lithograph in five colours. 1898. From the issued edition,
commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for the album 'Pan', Berlin 1898.
Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98. Ref: Kornfeld and
Wick Paul Signac Prints no 20, as completed and issued. Exceptionaly fine
and fresh impression with totally unfaded colours. On off-white chine
volant paper. Full margins. Image: 8 x 10 3/8ins. o2500 (US$ 3750)

There is no illustration of the Cross on the website. If you do not know
the image then we could arrange for a printout in colours to be sent to you
by Fedex (we do not currently have scan available for e-mail) but we would
need your full mailing address.

The details are as follows:

Henri Edmond Cross - In the Champs Elysees. Les Nourrices.
Original lithograph in colours. 1898. Numbered in pencil from the very
scarce de-luxe edition of 75 impressions. Prior to the regular issued
edition for the album. Commissioned and issued by Meier Graefe for 'Pan,
Berlin 1898. Drawn and printed at the studio of Clot, Paris 1897/98.
Exceptionally fine fresh impression of the rare de-luxe edition. On china
paper mounted on a japan backing sheet as issued. Full margins. excellent
condition. Image: 7 7/8 x 10 1/4ins. o 2500 (US$3750)

Shipping and insurance extra (c. US$115 for either work).

I will look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your interest in my
gallery

William Weston.
