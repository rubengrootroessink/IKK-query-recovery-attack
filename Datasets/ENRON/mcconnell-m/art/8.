Dear Mike:

I wanted to let you know the status of your artwork, "The Blue Note."  We
should receive the artwork in-house latest Friday.  By the middle of this week
I should know the exact edition number for you.  I will keep you updated.  Do
you want us to frame the artwork here or ship it to you unframed?

Warmest regards,

Virginia Repasky
Christopher-Clark Fine Art
