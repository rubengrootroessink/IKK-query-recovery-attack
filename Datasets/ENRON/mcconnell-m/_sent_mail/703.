Joe,

Thanks for the email.  Project Summer does bring up some big questions and 
issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.  We'll talk later 
and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.  On your other issue, I 
understand and we'll discuss.

Thanks,
mike

Mike,

You have probably heard that a tentative agreement has been reached on 
Project Summer.

When convenient, I would like to talk to you about what that means for the 
South Amercia Networks effort.  Given that we have been pursuing this stuff 
through a matrix approach many questions arise.

I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.  I have the 
feeling it is not a "big blip" on anyone's radar screen. 

I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do 
not know anything (at least officially and/or from me).

Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.  I 
am not necessarily wed to the "Newco" (unless Enron puts out a former EI 
hiring moratorium) despite what people may be assuming.

Thanks,

Kish
