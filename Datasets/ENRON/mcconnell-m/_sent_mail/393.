Subject: Senator Lugar Event

Wendy Gramm invited Jeff Skilling to attend a social event for Senator Lugar 
(R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, 
so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf?  
I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies.   
Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary 
jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a 
senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy 
debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign 
relations issues, and is pro-trade.

Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I 
will get additional details to you asap.

Thank you.
