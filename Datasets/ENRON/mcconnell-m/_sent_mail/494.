From November 14-17, Houston will host Gastech 2000, one of the world's 
largest international natural gas, LNG, and LPG conferences.  The conference 
will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center and is expected to 
attract 3,000 delegates from around the world.

Enron has played a leading role in this conference for many years, and this 
year we will participate as a sponsor and prominent exhibitor.  Several Enron 
executives are speaking or moderating panels at the conference, including 
David Haug, Bill Gathmann, Doug Arnell and Dr Lay.  

On Wednesday, November 15, Ken Lay will serve as a keynote speaker at an 
Enron Sponsored luncheon at 12:30 P.M. and we would like to invite you to sit 
at the Enron table.  The dining room is located at the George R. Brown 
Convention Center, Ballroom Level Three.

Please RSVP via e-mail or call me at 5-6442, or Hal Means at 5-5384 if you 
have any questions.  Once we have the guest list finalized, we will provide 
you with details on the location of the entrance to the dining room, a pass, 
transportation/parking and other pertinent details.

Best regards
