Ken,

I'm back.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up 
on emails especially the fun ones like this.

My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head 
especially as an Enron  "B" teamer.  In response to your worker bee comment, 
I can certainly say "buzz" but not someone who can sell that many shares of 
stock!  You are the king.

Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at 
least I didn't get help!

You win......but you still owe me lunch.

Mike

You're awfully quiet up there.  I guess getting your name in the Wall Street 
Journal has gone to your head and you can't respond to us lowly worker bees.

Ken,

I had to respond.  

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops 
not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job 
that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started 
working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who 
are the Huskers?

Luckily, Tom Osborn did not coach at my alma mater.  Our coach was Tom 
Osborne who, by the end of his career, made OU his bitch.

Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by 
Tom Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in 
Coaching.  It was a best seller.

Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst 
loss in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS?

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.
