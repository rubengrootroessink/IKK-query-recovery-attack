Jonathan,

Thanks for the update.  Great to have you on board.  This job is going to be 
great.   I am looking forward to working with you again.

Subject: Update

Just thought I'd update the two of you with my plans. I am leaving Tokyo on 
the 21st March, and going to London for probably 10 days to get my US Visa 
done (Unfortunately cannot be done in the US). I will be working out of the 
London office from the end of next week 100% concentrated on LNG matters, as 
I have now wrapped up all of my Enron Japan handover.

Look forward to seeing the two of you in Houston in early April.

Jonathan
