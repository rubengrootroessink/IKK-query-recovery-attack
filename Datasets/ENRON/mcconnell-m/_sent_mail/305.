Thanks for the email.  The game was great and my throat still hurts.  I've 
never been to a better event or had as much fun.  I'll be calling Roberts.

Mike,

Congrats to the Sooners! With that impressive victory (what a defense) OU now 
has seven national championship in football, which surpasses Wichita State's 
six national championships in bowling. Wanted to put it in perspective. Only 
downside to last night is that soon you will be getting an alumni bill to pay 
for Bob Stoops new contract. I sure hope you use this opportunity to call 
Roberts and give him hell about his whining Canes. Did you see their mascot 
get in trouble?

I'm due to meet with you next week on Wednesday, January 10 at 2:00pm. See 
you there.

Happy New Year,
Doug
