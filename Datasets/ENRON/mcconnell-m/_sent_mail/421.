Ahmad,

Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank 
you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away 
from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the 
Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put 
together in the Middle East.

I promised you some of the speeches that I have delivered and attached below 
are 3 different ones that illustrate Enron's view of the future.

Thanks again.

Mike
