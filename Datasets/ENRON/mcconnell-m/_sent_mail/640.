Stuart,

Thanks for the email and raising this issue.  While reading it, I must admit 
I was very surprised.  I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 
games this year and I hadn't noticed it.  I just called Cindy Olson and left 
her a voicemail with your concern.  I will not forward your email and I will 
respect your privacy request.  When I hear from her, I'll let you what she 
says.

Thanks,
Mike

Mr. McConnell,

I went to Enron Field this past Fri.  and saw something disturbing.  Just 
after the Astros pitcher stuck out a batter, a cartoon came on the screen.  
The cartoon showed 3 K's dropping on a batter, turning him into a small black 
puddle. The 1st thing that ran through my mind was the Klue Klux Klan, and 
some extremely unpleasant memories I've had with them. If I'm alone in my 
thinking there should be no problem, however if other people have similar 
thoughts, this could raise some bad publicity. 

I did not feel gong through the proper chain of authority would be correct in 
this situation. (The less people that know, the better)   I do not know who 
the proper contact is to voice this concern, but felt you would be in a 
better position than me to decide if this is an actual problem, and how to 
resolve it if it is a problem.

Stuart
