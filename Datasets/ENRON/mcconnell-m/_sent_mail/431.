Hi Nina -

It is highly doubtful that Mike will be available to attend the Art Committee 
meeting since his big 2001 budget meeting with Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling will 
begin at 2:00 p.m. on that same day.

Can you do us a big favor and please also send the Art Committee messages to 
me.  When Mike is traveling it makes it much easier if I have been copied on 
messages that involve putting meetings on Mike calendar.

I hope all is going well for you.  Thanks so much.

Cathy P.

This is to confirm that there will be an Art Committee meeting on Tuesday, 
November 7, at 1:30 p.m. in conference room 461 of the Enron Building.  We 
realize that some of the committee members will not be able to attend.
