Hi Mike,

I'm going to use this from you in my story:

"The IT personnel reported into Global Technology, but we did that for
communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control. They 
attended
business unit staff meetings, and the business units gave constant feedback.
When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the
employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where
the person actually ranked and was rated."

If it's OK with you, I'd like to put it in the present tense as I understand
this is still the case today. I think it might be confusing to readers in the
past tense, as if it no longer applies. Would that be OK with you? Thanks 
much.

Regards,
Gary Anthes
