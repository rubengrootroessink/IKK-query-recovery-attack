Pup,

Mark and I are confirmed with flights.  Chris is not coming.  Where are you 
staying, any good hotel ideas.  Mark had a room for 1 night by the stadium 
but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around Miami 
and therefor  may want to stay closer to the city.  Any thoughts?  When are 
you guys flying in?

mike
