Subject: Health Clubs -- NY

Jeff and Mike,

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

Thanks,
Shanna
