Hi Mary Anne -

I am responding to your message on behalf of Mike McConnell.  Mike is in 
Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in 
dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.  

Thank you very much for your message.  We solicit one time lump-sum 
contributions to JDF rather than per mile.  In addition, we collect the 
pledges for the walk - rain or shine.  The reason of course is that our main 
goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or 
other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.  
However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn 
out for the walk.  This year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.  
The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very 
generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.  Therefore, the 
matching forms are not necessary.  

If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join 
us for the walk.  If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at 
the following address:

 Mike McConnell
 Enron Global Markets
 1400 Smith Street, EB 3328
 Houston, TX  77002

If you donate $25 or more you are entitled to an Enron/JDF Walk T-shirt.  If 
you are interested just send us your size (M-L-XL-XXL) and location and we 
will get one to you.

Thanks again.

Hi Mike -
Saw your announcement regarding the walk on wEBSource.  Although I don't have 
the funds to fly down to Houston to participate, I'd be happy to at least 
make a donation!  How are the donations tallied?  Pledge per mile walked?  
Lump sum contribution?  Let me know!

I too am an insulin dependant diabetic - for 32 years now - and do know what 
a child goes through when diagnosed with this disease.  I just thank God that 
I have parents that instilled a strong sense of self and urged me to 
understand as much about the disease as possible.  I've seen too many kids 
and young adults, in my association with the Oregon Chapter of the JDF, that 
didn't understand and didn't want to deal with their diabetes - some of them 
dying at a very young age due to complications.  I volunteer my time to talk 
to newly diagnosed diabetic children, so they and their parents can 
understand that it isn't a death sentence, it's a way of life.  And a way of 
life that can be long and productive.

Here's wishing you the best in your endeavors on the JDF's behalf.

Best regards,
Mary Anne
