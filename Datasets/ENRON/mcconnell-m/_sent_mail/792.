Mr. McConnell,

I received a call tonight from Elliott Katz in our Sydney office regarding 
the problems that you were having with connectivity. I spoke to the 
technician in Tokyo and we were able to get everything working.

I tested your account via IPass to the Tokyo number  (011813) 3525 3000 and 
through the VPN client - both worked fine. Nobu and I stepped through making 
sure your system was connecting properly and that Notes was operational.

Neither of us had your password so I changed it to change12me. I will handle 
getting the password reset to whatever you would like if you would like to 
email or call me with it. The only catch is that it must be unique.

You can reach me on my cell phone anytime. The number is 713.539.3814.

Thank you and I hope you have a good visit and a safe trip home!

Travis Williams
