Still taking in the big win.  Seems more incredible in retrospect that it
did at the time.  Stoops could name his price!

I still would like the video.  I know that J.R. would be disappointed if you
paid him for the tickets.  He gave them to me to use as I please.  Let's go
to the Tour Championship and call it even.

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.
I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating
Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting
old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike
