Dear Mike,

Rene Ortiz, the recent Minister of Energy for Ecuador (1998-1999) and former
Secretary General of OPEC (1978-83) is Conference Chair for a major gas and
power conference in Quito, September 18-19.  The Conference is expected to
attract key energy leaders from latin America.  I understand that former
Sauid Minister Yamani and Fadil Al Chalabi will also attend.

Rene is an old, old friend.

If this is of interest to you, ENRON please let me know.  From your
description of ENRON ONLINE at the Price School of Business in April, I think
this is a natural.

My Institute for Energy Economics and Policy will also partner with Global
Change Associates and a number of major services providers to hold a major
conference on energy ecommerce in Beijing, May 24-5, 2001. Again if this is
of interest we would welcome ENRON's participation on the program, as a
sponsor and/or an exhibitor.

Please let me know the next time you visit OU.

Best regards,

Dennis O'Brien
