David,

Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios.  
This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in 
the country.  Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for 
Enron.  This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any 
interest in his company or it's products.  I do, however, need someone to 
follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any 
interest.  We need to respond in some manner.  I forwarded this a while ago 
but he didn't hear anything.

He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big 
supporter.  I hope there is an opportunity here.

Thanks,
Mike

Dear Michael,
?
Thanks for your phone call today. As promised you  will find attached samples 
of our work.? Although the executables are all  flash files - please know 
that we are not limited to?that software and  design scope.?We are also 
excellent 3d animators, web designers and  multimedia specialists. For 
example we produce interactive CD-ROMs, Tech  animations and Trade Show 
presentations.
?
Due to proprietary restrictions there are other  grander, more 
complex?projects that I am unable to distribute. However, I  can personally 
showcase in 10 minutes our other capabilities to the appropriate  parties at 
Enron. I would like to emphasize that we are a "Digital Marketing  
Enhancement" company... we take ones & zeros and bland text messages, turn  
them into eye-catching animations and fire them across the net!
