>  TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ORANGE BOWL by Katy Shapard
>
>  Twas the night before the Orange Bowl
>  And all through the land
>  Not a Sooner was stirring
>  Not even the band.
>
>  Heupel and Norman
>  Both nestled in their beds
>  With visions of a Championship
>  Dancing in their heads.
>
>  I was just settling down
>  For a short winter nap
>  And reminiscing how October
>  Put Sooners on the map.
>
>  When out on the field
>  There arose such a ruckus
>  There was Rocky Calmus
>  Holding his Buckus.
>
>  Out of the door
>  I ran like a deer
>  Jumped up and down
>  And let out a cheer.
>
>  And what do I see
>  To my very own surprise
>  The Sooner Schooner
>  Had finally arrived.
>
>  With Stoops and Mangino
>  Leading the reign
>  They whistled and shouted
>  And called them by name.
>
>  Now Thatcher, now Fagan
>  Now Savage and Griffin
>  On Marshall and Woolfolk
>  On Litrell and Williams.
>
>  To the top of the scoreboard
>  To the top of the polls
>  Now catch the ball, run the ball
>  Win the Orange Bowl!
>
>  As they rode out of sight
>  With Sooner Magic in hand
>  They chanted exuberantly
>  WE'RE NO. 1 IN THE LAND!
>
