Steve, 

Thanks for the voicemail.  I was surprised that you were not up to speed 
(although I probably shouldn't be).  Please talk with Joe and get is view on 
this.  I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early 
and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.  Certainly he 
wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help 
with that. 

Let me know if you get any other news.

Thanks,
Mike
