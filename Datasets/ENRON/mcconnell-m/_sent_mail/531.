I wanted to give you an update on my progress in EES with the JDF - - - -as 
of this afternoon, I have collected (with Enron matching) $4,600.  

This is the letter I sent to my solicitation list last week - .....  Pretty 
good for one week, right?

Good afternoon.

My 17 year old son has had diabetes since he was 2 years old.  Imagine this - 
as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300 
finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until 
a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult 
blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage, 
heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today 
than it will be tomorrow. 

Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds 
for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes 
research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a 
morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group 
of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions 
of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.  

The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race 
Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please 
send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my 
attention - 1400 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx 
77002.                                                                        
                                                   

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.    My son and millions of other 
kids with diabetes thank you as well.
