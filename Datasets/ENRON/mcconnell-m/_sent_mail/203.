Sweet-um,
Howdy.  Does your AOL work after I go into the work VPN?

Subject: IPAQ and home machine


Your Windows98 home machine now boots up directly to the desktop icons.
The new IPAQ cradle is now connected and the camera card has been removed.

As soon as Microsoft Outlook replaces Lotus Notes for your mail client, we
can set up the IPAQ to synchronize with your mail.  Also, once migrated to
Outlook for email you can remotely access messages via Internet Explorer at:
http://nahou-msowa01p.corp.enron.com/exchange 

Without having you give us your Lotus Notes password, we could not be 100%
sure that AOL will now load after exiting email ... but Steve and myself 
cleared up two problems that likely caused that problem.  I'll get in touch
with Cathy tomorrow after the 4 Seasons conference in case any other issues
still remain after our trip.
