Cathy,

Pls provide Ono-san in Tokyo with Mike's travel details so that we can 
arrange.

Mike:  We are putting together  a presentation based on the discussion we had 
during our call the other day.  This would be our outline (and vision) for 
our interactive web site and how we plan to take reg/gov affairs online as 
well as some other initiatives.  We will be able to get you  a draft of this 
presentation before you arrive in Tokyo.  We will also look into activities 
for the weekend.

Joe

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

Mike
