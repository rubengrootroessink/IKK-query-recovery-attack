Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit.  
Mike

1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We 
have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large 
opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have 
spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our 
strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in 
this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.  
Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.

2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and 
transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of 
rail.  It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.   Dan Reck 
is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US.

Mike:

The following questions were asked but not addressed in today's all-employee 
meeting (no, they'renot about your wardrobe this time).  Would you please 
respond?  I will route to Ken, Jeff and Joe for approval, then post the 
questions and answers in eMeet.

Thanks for your help.

What is our strategy/plan in agricultural commodities trading?
Energy opportunity:  Have you thought about supplying electricity to 
railtrack for its EC4T (Electric Current for Traction), i.e. all its traction 
power (overhead power lines and 3rd rail system).  The full idea has been 
submitted to eMeet.
