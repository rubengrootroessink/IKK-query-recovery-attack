Subject: Subscription Renewal

Dear Mike:

This is to inform you that the following subscriptions are up for renewal:

Fortune
Wall Street Journal (We have a corporate account that I can add you to)
Wired

In the past, such renewals were routed to Info Central to be paid.  Our 
department has changed its focus to research.
If you would like to renew as a courtesy, we would be happy to take care of 
this for you.  We will contact the publisher and let them know that for the 
next renewal to send the invoice directly to you, and from then on, you would 
take care of payment.
Please let me know if you would like to renew this publication, as it will 
expire shortly.

Sincerely,

Susan Kennedy
713/853-9135
