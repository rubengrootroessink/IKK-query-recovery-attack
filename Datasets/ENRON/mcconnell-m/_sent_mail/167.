All,

I just talked with Andy Fastow and Brian Redmon.  We need to pass on him, 
they really didn't recommend him as I was led to believe.
Sorry,
Mike

I met w/ him a couple weeks ago.  Good guy w/ good overall experience but 
lacks any specific industry experience in crude/products/pet-chems.  I'm the 
one who referred him to you and Larry.

All,

Attached is some information on a guy that I just met with and is in 
re-deployment within Enron.  He is a finance guy by training, and has closed 
deals as an originator for EE&CC.  (He is not an EE&CC guy but was asked to 
go over there to help as an assignment)  Andy Fastow recommended that I see 
him.  I thought of your groups as a possible fit. 

He is out of redeployment on Friday and if you have an interest to talk to 
him I would lob in a quick call.

 Mike
