Dear Mr. McConnell:

I have been referred to you by a neighbor of mine, George Fastuca. I have
known George for approximately 18 months and when he heard I was looking to
do differently he strongly suggested I contact you. I am searching for a
position that will permit me to utilize the broad based business experience I
have acquired in commercial and investment banking, industry and public
accounting.

Most recently, I was Vice President for American Electric Power Energy
Services, a natural gas and electric power trading start up, responsible for
business development. As Senior Vice President of Capital Markets at Chase
Manhattan Bank, I launched an extremely successful derivative
products/structured finance business in Texas and contiguous states. At
Continental Bank, Citicorp and Motorola, Inc., I was responsible for a
variety of innovative marketing and financial initiatives which included
establishing new businesses, restructuring existing businesses and
refinancing established or newly acquired businesses.

Attached is a copy of my resume. Qualities which have contributed to my
success are:

? Entrepreneurial. 3 of my last 4 positions were start ups or turnarounds.
Experience with early stage ventures and acquisition identification.
? Partnership. Ability to build strong relationships by providing solid
counsel and negotiating skills. Established and maintained excellent working
relationships with other senior operating managers.
? General Management. Have held full P&L responsibilities. Established
policies, programs and procedures to achieve growth objectives, including
recruitment, evaluation and development of personnel.
? Core Competencies. Development and refinement of organization
infrastructure, including external marketing, joint venture relationships,
internal operations management, strategic planning and new product
development. Have identified and concluded acquisitions. International
experience.

I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about opportunities at
Enron. I will call Cathy this Friday to see if there is an appropriate time
when we may speak next week.

Sincerely,

Michael E. Fitzgerald
