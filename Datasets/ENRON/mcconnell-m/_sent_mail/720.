Mary, I would say a couple of things.  I describe Enron's unique culture 
using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high 
energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.  Each one of 
these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.  

I hope this is what you were looking for.
Mike

Subject: Fortune Best 100 Companies Survey

I'm compiling the information for this year's Fortune survey.  One of the 
questions included in the Culture Audit is "What makes your company unique?"  

If you were asked this question, how would you respond?  Please send me your 
answer by Thursday, July 20.   

Thanks.

Mary
