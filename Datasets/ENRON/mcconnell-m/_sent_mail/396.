CP, Howdy from my hotel room.  I decided not to play golf, big surprise.  I'm 
resting and working.
Looked at my email lately?

On a more serious note, would you please have Jason burn a disc of the most 
recent version of EGM.  I will need to have a computer to play it and how to 
work it for the off-site on Monday.

Thanks,
mike
