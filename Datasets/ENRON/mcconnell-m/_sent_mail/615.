Greg,

Thanks for the clarification.  I guess I was too serious and in a business 
mode.  By the way, I don't have any photos, all they would do is scare 
people, especially me.

Mike

God, or Mike I mean to say-

I think I may have confused you a little. I don't think we need a picture of
you presently (unless you have any nudes, especially a picture of you with a
morning missile). What I was trying to say was that I saw one or more
pictures of you in the brochure the actives prepared for last year's
President's Trophy competition. What I was hoping was that the actives could
have some more of those brochures printed up for distribution. You might
enjoy a copy. I'm not sure, but I assume they will do another one next year.
If so, they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section.
It is basically their deal. The alumni did not help them on this project.

Greg
