Subject: Coal Mine Tours - Itinerary

Gentlemen, 

 Attached is a preliminary itinerary for our upcoming visit to Black Mountain 
Resources, Cline Resources, and The American Coal Company.

 We plan to leave George Bush Intercontinental Airport early on Wenesday, 
March 7 and return Thursday evening, March 8.  During the course of the 
visit, we will tour two underground coal mines, a preparation plant, and a 
new mine opening construction site.  You will also have the opportunity to 
meet the principals, Richard Gilliam of Black Mountain, Chris Cline of Cline 
Resources, and Bob Murray of the American Coal Company.

 Please review the attached, and let me know as soon as convenient the 
following information:

Coverall Size ( or suit jacket size)
Boot Size
Belt Size

 Plan to wear casual clothes (blue jeans) for the mine visits.  We are 
planning to have dinner with Chris Cline on March 7.  If you have any 
questions on the trip, let me know.

 Bill
