George,

Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of a first draft of a 
presentation that i am creating on EGM.  This is for an upcoming analyst 
presentation and for our ongoing use.  Please review and make any comments 
you feel are needed.  Especially focus on coal which is on page 5.  Please 
take a quick look and return your initial comments quickly.  I need to get 
out a new and better draft ASAP.  Also, how do we illustrate your business 
graphically.  Please decide, fill in and I'll have our graphics guy make it 
look pretty.

Thanks,
mike
