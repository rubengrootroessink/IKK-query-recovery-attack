i'm all for it.  Please move forward.  He is a great guy but don't forget he 
is happy in his current job and all of this must be carefully done for him 
and not to disrupt his current job.  Let me know how it is progressing.  
Let's follow the book and proceed properly.

Mike -
      I wanted to follow up with you regarding Billy Lemmons.  As you know, 
both myself and Gary have spoken to Billy about an opportunity in the Ag 
effort.  I think Billy could help us pursue the origination opportunities we 
discussed on Wednesday and help us develop many more.  In addition to the 
tremendous experience he would bring to our team, he seems genuinely 
interested and excited about the opportunity.
      I know you and Billy have discussed the Ag effort and I wanted to know 
if you felt this would be the right move for Billy at this time.  Certainly, 
it is his decision but I believe he is looking to you for EGM's committment 
to Agriculture.

Please let me know if I can answer any questions you may have.
Thanks,  Elsa Piekielniak (37613)
