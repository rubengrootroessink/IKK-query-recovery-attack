I never received and answer from you to the e-mail below.

Can you please tell me who is replacing Alberto Gude for COMIT, so I can
forward information about the meeting on July 18.

Thanks!!

Al

Enron is a member of the Center on the Management of Information Technology
(COMIT) in the Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University.
Alberto Gude was the Enron representative for COMIT. Alberto indicated that
I should contact you concerning COMIT activities.

On July 18 from 9:30 until about noon, we will have the COMIT planning
meeting to determine activities for the next academic year. Please place
this date on your calendar. I'll be sending additional information at a
later date.

If you are not able to attend the meeting, I will appreciate you sending a
representative.

In the future, is there one individual I should contact rather than the two
of you?

I look forward to working with you.

Al
