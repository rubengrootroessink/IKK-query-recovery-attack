Virgina,
Hello from Singapore.  Thanks for the email.  I am interested in the 
Lichtenstein.  Is the #4 the same as the one you had in the gallery?
What is the price and what does the frame look like?  Do you have a picture 
or could you put it on your website?
I am still interested in the Matisse but Chris isn't so sure.  We are still 
thinking about that one.
Thanks,
Mike

Dear Mike: 

Greetings from San Francisco! 

Congratulations we have located on your behalf Roy Lichtenstein's 'Blue Note: 
Composition #4'.? If you are serious about the artwork we will need a 
commitment from you to acquire the piece for you. 

Please contact me as soon as possible since this is a time sensitive matter.? 
I will be in the gallery late this evening till 9pm PST and from 
9:30am-6:00pm PST Tues. through Fri. 

Have you received the package on the Matisse?? What do you think about the 
artwork? 

I look forward to hearing from you and Chris. 

Most sincerely,
