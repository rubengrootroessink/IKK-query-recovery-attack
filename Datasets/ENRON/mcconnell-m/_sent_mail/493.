Hi Eric -

I am Mike's assistant and I believe you discussed this meeting with my clerk 
when I was out of the office on Monday.  I am preparing Mike's calendar for 
tomorrow and I would like to make sure that I have all the correct 
information for him regarding the El Paso meeting.  Can you please provide 
the exact details for the El Paso meeting?  In particular, will you be 
meeting Mike at his office or does he need to meet you somewhere else?  At 
what time does he need to meet you?

Any specific information that you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  
Thank you.
