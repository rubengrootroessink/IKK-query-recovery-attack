Mike,

Thank you for your suggestion.  I was hoping that you could either forward 
this
message to Mr. Philippe Bibi or email me his contact information and I will 
get
in touch with him.  We are very interested in having someone represent Enron 
in
our Premier 100 IT Leaders list.

Thank you in advance.
Allison

Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud
of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am
still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified
candidate from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around
technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.
EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was
only 1 part of our transformation however.

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell
