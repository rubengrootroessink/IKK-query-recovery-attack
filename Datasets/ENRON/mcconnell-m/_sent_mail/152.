Mike,

Thanks again for meeting with me today.  It was a pleasure to finally meet 
you, I appreciate your help in my redeployment process.  Attached is my 
resume that should provide a snapshot of my background and skills for those 
you have in mind.

I will be in Houston meeting and interviewing until next Wednesday, April 
12th. Hopefully there will be the opportunity to meet with some your team 
before I return to London.  My contact phone is listed below, and I am 
sitting on 45 this week.  I'll update you with my progress before I leave 
next week.

Talk with you soon.

 Andy
