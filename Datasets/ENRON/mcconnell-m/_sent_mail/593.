Joe,
Sorry for the big delay in all my responses.  I'm out on vacation Wed - Wed. 
and can't make the video call. Please don't hesitate to set up with 
Shankman.  In general he is very on board with a big effort in Asia and 
realizes my views on Asia and that we have issues in Singapore.  Japan will 
be a  real focus for Enron Global Markets.  He could use an update.
mike

Mike,

Would it be possible to get yourself and Shankman on a video call sometime 
this week?  While we have given you an update a little over a month ago, 
quite a bit has happened since then.  This might also be a good intro for 
Shankman, particularly before we can you the both of you over this way.

Wed your time would be preferable... but we are flexible.

Joe
