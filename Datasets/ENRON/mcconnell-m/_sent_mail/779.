Pam,
I'm following up on a few old items.  Did you get what you needed here?  I 
was in Asia when I originally got this and didn't hear anything back on this.

Thanks,
mike

Mr. Sutton:
?
My name is Matt Bray and I am President of  EnergyStorehouse.com, an online 
marketplace for surplus energy equipment.?  Our company was recently acquired 
by EnergyPrism.com, an energy internet portal  developing equipment 
transaction capabilities for various sectors of the energy  industry.? I will 
not be joining EnergyPrism.com due to the fact I am  pursuing other high tech 
opportunities but will have a seat on their Board of  Directors.? We are 
currently in the process of securing one additional  member for the Board 
that possesses extensive experience in the international  energy sector 
and?thought this might be of interest to you.? If you  are interested in 
discussing in more detail, you can email me at this address or  call me at 
(713) 590-5020.? If you are interested I would gladly send you a  copy of the 
company's business plan and I encourage you to go to the  EnergyPrism.com 
website.? I look forward to hearing from you  soon.
?
Regards
Matt  Bray
