Joe,

Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and 
all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing 
this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane 
tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will 
be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.

I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but 
am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said 
that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, 
especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to 
have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at 
the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I 
think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the 
flight over knowing that I will have assistance.

Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.

Mike McConnell

Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  This would be 
most helpful.  We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in 
Europe and in the US.  Faster, quicker, smarter.  Thursday sounds great and 
just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Anthony 
was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive.  Remember,  I 
am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific 
applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and 
opportunities.  We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus 
of the business.  I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to 
Sherriff.  It is mostly up to date although continually changing.  This will 
help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.  On Wed, however, 
I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into 
our overall strategy.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  I don't think 
presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have 
something particularly appropriate.  The discussion with EPower/EJ on 
Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what 
Enron is doing across the focus areas.  On Friday, I believe that in the 
proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.  For the 
ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this 
would be great.  We could put this together here if you would like as I have 
a couple of your recent presentations.  Let me know.  Also, what is the 
appropriate dress code.  The Japanese still dress up.  I'm afraid suits are 
de rigour.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions 
about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about 
the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  We could try and find something, but I 
think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.  
Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.  Do I 
have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  All of us get 
back and forth on the train and the bus.  We can get you a driver, but you 
won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$500 one way).  I 
normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak 
any of the language.  If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.  Ono will set something set up here.  The hotel has its own 
massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Joe

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

Mike
