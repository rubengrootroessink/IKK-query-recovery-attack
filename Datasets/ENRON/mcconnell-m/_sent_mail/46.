Anuj is a great guy who worked for me then left (as they all do!) to work for 
a dot com.  The business has folded and now he's looking to get back into 
Enron in a structuring role.  He's a real smart guy with an MBA from Harvard 
and a petroleum engineering background.  He worked for the Global Investments 
group of EI before coming over to broadband.  I think he would be a dynamite 
structuring guy, or could help out in the upstream side of the petroleum 
business.  Do any of you have a need?  Rich
