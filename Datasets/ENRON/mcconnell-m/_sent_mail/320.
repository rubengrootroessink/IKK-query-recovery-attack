Dear Mike,

Thank you for the introduction to David Tagliarino.
We spoke at length yesterday, and he seems like a very
good guy.  He also seemed very receptive to the
possibility of us working together, and I am hoping to
schedule a meeting with him in the near future.  In
the meantime, I sent him some information on our
company, and the players we represent.  I am confident
that we can be of help to you, and obviously, we would
appreciate the opportunity to do so.

I know that you have been very successful at Enron,
and I am happy for you.  I am sure things will only
get better.

If I am fortunate enough to schedule a meeting with
David, I would love to stop by your office and say
hello.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I
wish you and your family a happy holiday season, and
again, I appreciate your help.

Sincerely,

David N. Winkle
