Thor,

I am sorry that you can't make it but please don't worry about it.  We wanted 
to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our 
businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your 
great work in Norway.  We intended to only invite 3 non-EGM officers, Joe 
Hirl, Paul Quilkey and you.  

I hope you have a great holiday.

Cheers,
mike
