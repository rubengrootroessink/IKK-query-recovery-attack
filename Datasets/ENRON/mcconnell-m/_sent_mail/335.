John,

thanks for the comments.  Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot.  I like 
the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final 
determination in Q1.  I also think "softs" is a big oppt that is probably 
worth pursuing.  More later.
I like the weather idea as well.

On another note, I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium.  He 
runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.  He has attempted to talk to 
someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.  He has given me his email 
address and requested a contact.  Would you please make sure that someone 
follows up with him.

Company:  Finertec, SA (?)
luis.reis@finertec.pt

Thanks, 
Mike

Thanks for the docusment - I will clearly take the chance to steal some 
of your material for my presentations.  A couple of minor suggestions:

1)  I would generally replace the term "trader" with "market maker"
2)  Are we committed to Ag markets yet?  I have doubts about
     the fit for us.
3)  For Weather how about showing the number of cities for which we 
      make markets?   Also the fact that we trade hot weather, cold weather,
      wet weather, and dry weather.

Regards,

John

Subject: EGM business presentation

John and Michael,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike
