Mike,

Please see the attached POA authorizing you and Rick Bergsieker to execute 
the referenced agreement and related documents.  The timing of execution of 
these documents is unclear at this time.  This matter has been pending for 
about 5 months as full agreement has not been reached with PDVSA, I believe. 

Please note that I will need your passport number to include in the POA, as 
this is required by Venezuela law.  Thank you.

Rick,

Nancy Corbet has advised that the timing for the execution of the referenced 
document is unclear; however, a POA was prepared in April of this year, 
authorizing Frank Stabler, David Haug, and Doug Rotenberg as 
attorneys-in-fact to execute this and other related "transaction documents."

We should replace Frank and Doug.  Nancy has suggested that you could be 
named to replace one of them.  Is this okay with you?  Should David be 
retained?  Who else do you recommend naming as the third 
signatory/attorney-in-fact?

Please advise.
