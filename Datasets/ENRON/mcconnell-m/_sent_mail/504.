Your schedules are very full so I went ahead and spoke to Mark F. about the 
drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated 
number (including Europe).  He agreed it would be easier for me to manage it 
in a single unit  and will get together with you and Dave D. for agreement.  
I suggested that he and all his managers get together with me if additional 
explanations are needed.

Hope this is satisfactory.

Gary

Also, Elsa and I meet with Greg on Monday at 10 am for ag review.
