Brent, I would like to illustrate the growth of our commodities to show why 
this a  great business unit and why this is a big focus for wholesale.  Also 
we will use all of this for the Jan analyst meeting.

Please compile some facts on each business by 
1. number of transactions
2. revenues
3. on line growth of each
4. size of each commodity;  e.g.:  number of barrels traded, tons of coal, 
tons of freight, etc.
5. other metrics that you think will illustrate the point

 Go back as many years as you can get data.

Thanks,
mike

Go ahead and send me preliminary copies of the figures as it is being 
compiled.
