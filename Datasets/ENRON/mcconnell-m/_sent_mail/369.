Thanks for the email and kind words.  

I did recover over thanksgiving and it was nice but I am sick once again and 
cant' sleep.  I am catchin up on this emai at 2:15 wednesday night.  I will 
try and go back to bed after this email.  

Let me know how the contract goes, i don't see any issues.  I actually 
thought it got done and that is why i havent heard anything.

Sooners have looked ugly lately, Saturday will not be a good day for the 
Sooners.

Mike

Mike,

Per our conversation at the Mgmt. Conf. thank you for everything you have 
done for the group and for me. 

I hope you have regained your voice and that the McConnell family has a great 
Thanksgiving holiday. 

Congrats on your JDF efforts. You should be very proud of your fundraising 
for such a worthy cause.

After your Sooners beat KSU again are you going to the Orange Bowl?

I am planning to meet with Shankman next week to discuss my contract or lack 
there of. It seems to have been on the back burner for the last two months. 

Happy Holidays,
Doug
