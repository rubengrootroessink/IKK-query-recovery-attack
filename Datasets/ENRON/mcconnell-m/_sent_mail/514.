Thanks, it was great and long over due.  The cold and rain didn't stop the 
ultimate enjoyment including 35,000 people chanting "over rated".  It was 
great and we must enjoy it until the Sat. when reality comes back to the 
sooners and we lose the next 2 or 3 straight.  K State, Neb and Tex A&M.  
Ouch, nice 4 game stretch.
