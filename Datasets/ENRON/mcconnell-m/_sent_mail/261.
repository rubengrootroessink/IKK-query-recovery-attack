this ready to go out tomorrow, close of business.  Please review again and 
mark up any changes that you believe are required.  Please read the Per and 
Randy section carefully for errors and wording.  JN, Please change wording 
for Randy's most recent assignment, i put something down as a marker.  Also 
come up with a 1 sentence lead for Randy on the expected growth and 
opportunities around his efforts.

Mike
