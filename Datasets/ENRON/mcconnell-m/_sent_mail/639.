Just wanted to let you guys know, that while on a family vacation last week
in Red River, New Mexico, the youngest sister on John & David Denner was
killed while driving one of those 4-wheel motor bikes. I guess John had to
hold on to her lifeless body for about an hour until help could reach the
spot on the mountain where she had the accident. I spoke to John on Saturday,
and at that point he seemed to be handling it well. The funeral is tomorrow.
