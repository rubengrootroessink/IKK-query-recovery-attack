Cliff,

Thanks for lunch.  I always really enjoy getting together and talking about 
life and our businesses.  Attached are the two presentations we discussed.  A 
little airplane (or boat, sorry, ship) reading.  I would appreciate any 
feedback.  I'll be making significant changes as I get ready for the analyst 
meetings.

Thanks,
Mike
