Chris,

Thanks for the email.   I certainly understand your situation and 
perspective.  Give me a call when you return and we can discuss it.  We do 
have a lot going on in Net Works and we may have some additional clarity on 
our direction and priorities when you return from your trip.

Thanks for your tips on SF and for offering your home in the wine country.  
Maybe we can take you up on it another time.

Mike
