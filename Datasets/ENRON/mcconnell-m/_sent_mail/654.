John,

Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  This job will be fun 
and it will be odd to return to the energy business after my last year in 
technology and the new economy.  I am glad to hear that all is well with you 
and your family.  I don't have a trip planned currently but I am sure I'll be 
in London at some point during the year.  I'll give you a call.

Cheers,
mike

> While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
