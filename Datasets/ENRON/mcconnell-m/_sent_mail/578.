Julie,

Thanks for the email.  I have moved again within Enron.  I am now President 
and CEO (about 3 weeks ago) for Enron Global Markets, a new business unit 
within Enron's wholesale group.  This group is responsible for all Crude and 
Products, Coal, Emissions, Global Risk Mgt. (insurance), weather, LNG, F/X, 
interest rates, equities and agriculture.  It's a wild time yet again for the 
McConnell family.  It's nice to be back in the energy business.

On the technology side, Phillipe Bibi is the Chief Technology Officer for 
Enron Net Works and he would be a good contact.  His email address is 
phillipe.bibi@enron.com

Thanks and I'll pass on SMU news to Chris.  Her email address at home is 
mmccontex@aol.com.  Say hello to Bob.
 
Mike

Tell Chris that we are heading up to see the SMU ponies in their new
stadium!!  Know you are busy, but have been trying to find out the contact
person in your new business unit.  Just completed two more assignments for
dot.coms, and have two others on the crest of huge developments.  Any help
would be appreciate, as we might be able to explore some mutual business
opportunities.  Thanks..
