Mike

Rick Buy asked me to let you have a summary of the limits that would now 
apply to commodities in Enron Global Markets.

I have set them out below, together with the levels at which various people 
in the organisation need to get notified (the respective Operations groups 
will take care of that). 



After tomorrow's Board meeting at which various other commodity group limits 
may get revised, we will issue rather handy laminated versions of these, 
which will better withstand general wear and tear and tend not to get mislaid.

Let me know if you have questions.
