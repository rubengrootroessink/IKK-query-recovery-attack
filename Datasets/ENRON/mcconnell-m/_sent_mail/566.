Mike,

Thanks a lot for your efforts here.  I've got interviews with Louise K, 
Jeffrey Shankman and Dan Reck this week!  I'll let you know if anything 
happens.

Dan,

Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds 
like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this 
sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up.

Mike

Hello Louise:

I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?

Thanks!
