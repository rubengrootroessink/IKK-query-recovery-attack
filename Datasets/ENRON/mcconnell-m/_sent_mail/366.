Jeff,
I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.  Not my favorite past time 
at 2:30am.  I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a 
while.  Please send it to me for my review.  I think it is important to get 
something out and i believe that people expect some changes
Thanks, m.
