Hello Kevin,

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.  I was asked to contact you
directly by my friend Abrar Sait, whom with I am sure you are acquainted.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading
exchange.  We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration,
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Broadband Services.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.  I have
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan
(and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed
industry participants, venture capital raising process for 3 Series of
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work, and
currently head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.  Prior
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.  It could be a bit more detailed, but I
prefer to keep it lean as it is easier to read, and I can always talk it
through in detail.

My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within a business
developement role, such as Mergers & Acquisition, Venture Capital, or
liasing between deal structuring and commercial marketers.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.  I appreciate that you are
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see
a fit between what I can offer and what your company is doing.

Best Regards,

Joseph P. Mathew
