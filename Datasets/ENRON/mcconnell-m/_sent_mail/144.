Doug,

The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was 
magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever miss 
the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were not at 
max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler weather.  
What a great tournament.

Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game at 
Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this year. 

Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.

Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home 
email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com.

Mike
