Subject: Executive Impact and Influence Program - feedback

I will be participating in the above program on September 12-13 and have been 
asked to gather input from managers, direct reports and peers/colleagues.
Keilty, Goldsmith & Company will send you a feedback packet on August 11th 
and I ask that you take a few moments to complete and return the form.

I appreciate your input.

Thanks,

Philippe
