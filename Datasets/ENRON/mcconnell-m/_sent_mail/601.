Cathy, before I forget, would you please make a tee time of approx. 1pm for 4 
people at the golf course at the Four Seasons under my name (friday).  Also 
if you would set up massages for Brenda Jones and Chris at about the same 
time or later.  I would really appreciate it.  All can be a little later but 
cant be any earlier.  We need to begin golf by 2pm to finish.
thanks,
m
