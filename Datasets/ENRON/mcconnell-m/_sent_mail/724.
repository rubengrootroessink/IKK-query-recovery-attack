Hi Paula -

Mike McConnell has again asked me to send you a message on his behalf.  We 
have received your message below to Zina and then also a message from Carrie 
Shapiro on the same conference.  George Wasaff, MD for Strategic Sourcing, 
spoke at one of these conferences recently and Mike said that he would like 
to have the conference organizers continue to contact George for future 
conferences.  I will pass this information along to both Zina and Carrie.

Again, let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Cathy Phillips for 
Mike McConnell

Zina,

Thank you for the information here and the followup phone message.  
Regrettably, I won't be able to participate in the aspect of giving a paper 
at your Conference.  Please keep us in mind for the future.  We will, 
however, be very interested in having staff attend.

I suggest that you consider contacting Mike McConnell at Enron Corp to 
discern an interest in a speaker from his group.
Thank you again.

Sincerely,
Paula
