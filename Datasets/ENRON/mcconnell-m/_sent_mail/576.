Stuart,

A quick second follow up.  I talked again with Cindy Olson and she has 
discussed the issue in detail with the Astros organization.  They are going 
to think about this and examine for next season.  They did say that this was 
the first time this was brought up but they want to be sensitive and will 
consider at change.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Mike
