Dana,

Hello from Tokyo.  I sent you a reply and forwarded your resume to our HR 
group.  I don't know if you got my reply the day I received your resume.  I 
have had a lot of people tell me that they didn't get a response from me 
about the same time as you contacted me.  My sent mail doesn't list you as a 
completed return email.   

I hope all is well.

Mike
