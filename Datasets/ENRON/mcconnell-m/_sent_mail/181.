David,

Howdy.  Thanks for the email.  I agree he is a very sharp guy and does a 
great job.

I will be attending the Masters again this year.  I will be on our 2nd trip 
which is Wed - Friday.  We do normally have a very full agenda but if you'll 
leave me your information, I'll try to stop and say hello.

Thanks,
Mike
