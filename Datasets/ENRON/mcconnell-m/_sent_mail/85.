Chris,

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary 
Cassat as a gift for her.
