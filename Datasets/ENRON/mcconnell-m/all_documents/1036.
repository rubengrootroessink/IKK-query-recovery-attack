Mike McConnell has asked me to respond to your message on his behalf.  He has 
asked that you please contact George Wasaff with Enron for this conference.  
Mr. Wasaff is the Managing Director for Strategic Sourcing.  He recently 
spoke at one of your conferences and this conference is more closely related 
to Mr. Wasaff's area of responsibility.

Thank you for your assistance.

Mike McConnell
