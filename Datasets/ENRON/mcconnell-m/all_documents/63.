Ron, 

I hope you had a good week.  I've thought a lot about your family and you've 
been in my prayers.  

I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with 
this while you were away.  As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors 
that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed 
are:

Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's 
self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles)
Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking)
Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission)
Dr. Wayne Dyer (many)
Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others)

Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.  To my extremee frustration I 
can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.  I got a lot out of 
all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.  I am 
a great believer in the old saying, "When the student is ready the teacher 
will come".

As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have 
had a profound effect on me and my family.  A few direct tangible results 
include:  my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation 
collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and 
growing) .....

When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can 
definitely find time for lunch.

Mike
