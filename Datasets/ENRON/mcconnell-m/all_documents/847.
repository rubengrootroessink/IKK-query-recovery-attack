Mike, I too am an insulin dependent diabetic for the past 27 years ( since 
age 7 ) and would be very interested in helping with your group.  Not really 
sure what I can accomplish with EGM from my Charleston, WV location but know 
that I am interested.

Kids are my concern as well.  In fact, I am coaching my sons soccer team and 
have a 5 year old diabetic on my team.

Just a thought for you.................I have been on an insulin pump for the 
past 7 years and it has made a tremendous difference for my life.  Certainly 
worth exploring if you are not using one.  Also, my brother ( Bank of America 
employee ) is on the ADA board for the Southeast region if you may wish to 
contact him about speakers ( doctors ).

Having said the above, I pledge $ 250.00 for the cause.
