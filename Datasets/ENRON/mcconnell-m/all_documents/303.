Neil -

Mike McConnell asked me to respond to your message on his behalf.  Mike said 
thank you for the message, but unfortunately, he will be out of town April 
4th - 6th and therefore unable to meet with you while you are in town next 
week.

Thank you.

Cathy Phillips for 
Mike McConnell

John/Mike
I will be in Houston on 4th and 5th of April.  Matthew Scrimshaw suggested I 
look you up.
It would be great if you could spare me some time to discuss what we are 
trying to do at ETOL and how I might be able to link with what you do.
I have a pretty flexible programme on the 4th  with my return flight to the 
UK at 15:00 on 5th.
If you could suggest a time and your office locations I'd be most grateful.
Best regards
Neil
