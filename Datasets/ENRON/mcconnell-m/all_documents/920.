Dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers.  He was 
a very nice man and his sudden death woke us all up about our priorities.

Subject: Thank You for Your Donation to the Fund for Don Richard's Family


Mike, 
 I wanted to personally thank you for your support to the fund that was 
established for Don's family.  As of today, we raised $4,106.62.  We have now 
closed this account and are in the process of distributing this money to his 
family.  I have personally spoken to his family regarding this fund and they 
were very thankful and speechless at the generosity that the Enron employee's 
have shown by attending his funeral, creating a scrapbook in his memory, and 
contributing to this memorial fund.  
 I assured the family that Don would be sorely missed, and although I did not 
have the opportunity to personally know Don, he must have been a very special 
person to have touched so many lives, both in his personal life and at work.
