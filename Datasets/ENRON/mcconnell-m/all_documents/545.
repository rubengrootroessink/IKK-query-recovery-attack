Joe,  

I have been reading about ePower and potentially building sites.  I know you 
are clarifying it's activities but until then, I have instructed my guys to 
respond to ePower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.:  possible LNG 
re-gas plans for ePower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you 
as well.

Let me know if you want something different or want me to email other 
instructions.

Thanks,
Mike
