I have been asked to coordinate a standing monthly meeting for the Art 
Committee.  We have scheduled the first meeting for Monday, January 8th, from 
4:00 - 5:00 p.m. in conference room, EB 3321.  Please check your calendar and 
let me know by return e-mail if you will be available for this meeting.  In 
addition, please let me know if every second Monday at 4:00 p.m. will work 
for you as a standing meeting date and time.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you very much for your 
assistance.
