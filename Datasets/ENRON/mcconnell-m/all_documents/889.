Mike:  Randy Maffitt, recommended I send you my resume.  I would be very 
interested in talking with you about activity within Global Markets at your 
convenience.  I am currently in ENA, but with the scaling back of our 
development efforts and my Int'l experience, I thought we would have a lot to 
talk about.  Thanks, Thomas x58286.
