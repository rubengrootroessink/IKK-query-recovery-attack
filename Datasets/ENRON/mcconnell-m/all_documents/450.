Virginia,

Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac 
impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in 
London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are 
beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein 
is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have 
also purchased an Appel in the last month.

I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for 
one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to 
own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find 
something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my 
wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I 
stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed 
and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an 
important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have 
done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I 
would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.  

At least that is what I am thinking now.

Bonnard (colorful only)
Lautrec
Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)
Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell

By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) 
that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 
1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an 
attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in 
SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking 
about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of 
other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because 
we already have one.  

Thanks,
mike
