As most of you know, we met recently with Caesar Pelli architects to discuss
art space outdoors on the Enron campus and on the first two floors of the
new building (public spaces.)  The conclusions were:  1)  The best outdoor
site is in Antioch Park and will require coordination with a landscape firm
pitching a renovation of the Park;  2)  The only interior wall feasible is
the tall space outside the auditorium on the first floor.  You have been
copied on an e-mail regarding potential discussions with Jeff Koons for the
Antioch Park project.

In an effort to continue to identify (in a detailed fashion) the other
interior art spaces available to us, we are awaiting scheduling of a meeting
with Gensler (interior architects for floors 3-40.)  I will let you know as
soon as we have dates/times available.  At this time, I hope to have more
information and seek input on the Koons discussions and to suggest a
timetable for proceeding on a presentation to Skilling/Lay and artist
discussion.
