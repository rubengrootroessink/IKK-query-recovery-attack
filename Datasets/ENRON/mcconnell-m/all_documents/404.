Jeff, 
My brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume.  Do you know 
him?  Any interest?
If you do, please forward on.
Thanks,

Mike attached is Mark Evans' resume.  He worked at Duke and I believe he 
managed their NE gas book.

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to 
someone in your group.

Thanks,

Mark
