Dear Mike: 

The artwork Blue Note is $4,500 framed like the previous artwork you saw here 
but if you choose a more expensive frame like the one you saw on the Matisse, 
the framed price would also increase.? I will speak to the owner tomorrow 
about price negotiations on your behalf.? Before I sit down with him, where 
do you stand on price?? It is important I have this information, so I can 
take this to the owner on your behalf. 

I must mention we stand behind all our artworks. All artworks are 
authenticated and qualified with a condition report.? In fact, each artwork 
comes with an authenticity signed by the owner.? Also if you have any 
questions you are always welcome to speak to the owner or our Director of 
Rare and Fine Prints about the art historical and physical nature of the 
work. 

If this artwork is priced somewhere else for much less one may question the 
condition or various other factors of the artwork. 

Look forward to hearing form you.

Thanks for the update.? I will not have an opportunity to talk with you 
right now.? I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to 
business events in the middle east. 

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,? I do want to know 
more about the price.? I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay 
for a lot less.? Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.? Is 
there room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.? The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.? If you can't get them down on the price,? it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while. 

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd 
time zones. 

Thanks, 
mike

Dear Mike: 

Glad to hear from you. 

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except 
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition. 
The 
price is $4,500.00.? That is unframed.? We can frame the artwork like the 
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.? You have 
that 
option. 

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail. 
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited. 

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork. 
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris? 

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily 
replaced.? Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working 
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.? I mention this only to 
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork 
to 
your collection. 

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow. 

Most sincerely,

Virgina, 
Hello from Singapore.? Thanks for the email.? I am interested in the 
Lichtenstein.? Is the #4 the same as the one you had in the gallery? 
What is the price and what does the frame look like?? Do you have a 
picture 
or could you put it on your website? 
I am still interested in the Matisse but Chris isn't so sure.? We are 
still 
thinking about that one. 
Thanks, 
Mike
