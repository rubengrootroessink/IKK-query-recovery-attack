Jon,
     For your information we have established contact with Siemens via their 
representative in Houston, Mr Mark Tartaglio, and he has identified Mr 
Friedrich Heimann (Siemens Germany) as the appropriate person for us to 
present our request.  Although we have not yet actually spoken directly with 
Mr Heimann, we understand that he is working to coordinate a meeting at their 
offices in Germany for Enron with certain persons from Siemens and the target 
date for this meeting is November 15 or 16.  It was also agreed that we would 
conduct a conference call prior to that date to better explain to Siemens 
what we are requesting and to explore whether the plant O&M costs would be 
impacted by the requested changes.  I speculate that we will have a meeting 
in Germany, but probably after next week.  It seems to me that it would also 
be a good idea if someone form FGPC could attend.
Regards,
Mike
