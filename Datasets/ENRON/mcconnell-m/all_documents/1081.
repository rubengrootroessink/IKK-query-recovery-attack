First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.
