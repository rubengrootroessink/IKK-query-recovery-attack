Here is a synopsis of what Mike and I talked about;
I will come up with 3 schemes and create 1/16th site/floor plans and a 3
dimensional rendering showing the form and massing. This conceptual phase
will take approximately 1 month and cost up to $1500 per scheme. After you
review them and have picked and chosen what you like from each, I will
develop ?" floor plans, sections and fa?ade elevations. This schematic
design phase will take approx. 6 weeks. I'll charge you $150 per hour and
depending on the scheme it will run from$3000 to $4500. After that point a
local architect can do the design development phase (which is a more
detailed look at the exterior and interior of the house and will probably
take 6-10 weeks) and the construction document phase (which will probably
take 3 months). I have several architects in mind and can contact them if
you'd like. The architect should also do construction supervision. I'm not
sure what architects charge there but it should run from 3 to 6 percent of
construction cost.
During this time I can look at any special rooms or cabinetry in more detail
and I'll charge you an hourly rate.
On large projects architects often work in this way, one designing and one
doing the working drawings. I recently worked on a house here for Craig and
Walter where I designed it and the working dwgs. were done in Chicago. I
hope this explains things.
PS Sorry this took so long but I started designing and already have one
scheme figured out.
Talk to you soon,
Steve
