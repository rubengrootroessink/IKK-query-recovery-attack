Vanessa,
Thanks for the note.  I'll check out the book but I don't think I'll stop my 
insulin!

Hi Mike,

I don't know if you'll appreciate the following info, but there is a book 
called "The Cure For All Diseases" by Hulda Clark. She outlines how to cure 
diabetes so there is no need to take insulin.  It worked for my hypoglycemia, 
and a lot of other things.  

Vanessa
