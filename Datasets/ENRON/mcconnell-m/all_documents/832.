Hi John -

Mike McConnell is out of the office today, so I am responding to you on his 
behalf.  I wanted to call you, but I cannot find a phone number for you.  Can 
you please send your contact information (phone number and location) to me 
and Mike so that we can get you signed up on a team.  

Thanks!

I'd like to be involved.  I'd be a walker and a pledger.
