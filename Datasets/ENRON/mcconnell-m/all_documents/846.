Ron,

Thanks for the great news.  Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just 
received.  I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you 
again. The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very 
pleasant distraction.

I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the 
dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease 
information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all 
the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please 
forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side 
dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I 
don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in 
that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with 
our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident 
that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal 
with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the 
dealership. 

Thanks,
mike

Mike:
I am in San Francisco on a short vacation (wife's Zurich, Switz. high school 
reunion).  However, I made a call this am to the Jacksonville, FL port and 
your car has arrived.  They could not give me any details yet as they are in 
the process of surveying (inspecting) all the cars that came off the ship 
whch is stanadard operating procedure.  Since your planned trip is in October 
and today is 9/8, I have to assume that you should be in your car by then.  
While I know what "assume" means, I also know that the port will not release 
any car until they have inspected it and have determined that it has no flaws 
(ie. scratched bumper that may have happened on the ship).  So, while I 
really cannot give you a 100% guarantee as to when you will receive your car, 
I do believe you should be fine for your trip to Dallas.  At times, it's a 
frustrating procedure, but in the end it is the correct way to deliver a MB 
and especially this type of car.
Ron

Ron,

I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did
we make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that
will require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and
was wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive
international travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible
delivery date.

Thanks,
mike
