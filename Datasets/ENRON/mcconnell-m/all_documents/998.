Greg and Jeff,

Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.  I am sure 
you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording 
from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW.

Please provide your comments and I'll make sure they get included correctly.

Thanks,
Mike
