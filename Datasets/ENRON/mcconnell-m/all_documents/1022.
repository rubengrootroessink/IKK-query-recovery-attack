Fred,

I haven't heard anything from you since this email.  Have you made any 
progress on your update?  I still believe this has a lot of merit and would 
like to hear your perspective.

Mike,

You and had a brief meeting in your office last week, where I introduced 
myself as an old school mate of Pat Wade's.  During our conversation, I had 
mentioned a business plan that I had written last year proposing a b2b 
platform for trading air freight capacity which received strong interest from 
ICG.  You then asked for a copy of it, thinking that Enron could use some 
background on the opportunity in air logistics.   

If you don't mind, rather than send you a year old plan for a business that 
didn't get off the ground, I suggest that I work (on my own time) on a 
document that will speak better to Enron's needs, presenting the air 
logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that 
utilize Enron's core strengths.  I hope to have this doc done and delivered 
to you by the end of next week. 

Fred Philipson
