We keep signed DASHs on file.  I'll have copies forwarded to Mike.

Can you help me on this?  I wasn't aware Mike wasn't getting copies. Is this 
something we were responsible for and didn't do? Joana and I both were 
working under the assumption RAC distributed signed copies of the final Dash 
approval to everyone. I haven't received signed copies either, but was happy 
to assume they resided in RAC and I could get them if needed.

Let me know what to do.

Thanks.

Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.  I want 
them for my files.
Thanks,
