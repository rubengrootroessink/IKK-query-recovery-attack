Subject: LNG Offsite -----Nov 20/21

Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

Rick

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include. 

Thanks

Wayne

Wayne -

I heard back from Emilio and he said to go ahead and leave Margaret's name 
(she might be gone by the time of the offsite) but he would advise of her 
replacement.  He does not have a replacement as this time.
