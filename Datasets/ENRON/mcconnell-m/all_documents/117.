Kathie,

Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I 
appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation 
that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This 
should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.

Here are a few other points of emphasis.

EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and 
commodities to enable them to grow quickly 
These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being 
active in them
EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to 
commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are 
enormous in market size
EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset 
positions
EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale 
businesses
EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings
EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 
quarters in existence
Go big or go home philosophy
EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model 
into other commodities this year
GROWTH is the key!!!


Thanks for your help.

Mike

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

Hope to hear from you soon.
