Good point on extra space.  Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.  I think 
that makes 33 less of an option.

Mike,

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

-Larry-
