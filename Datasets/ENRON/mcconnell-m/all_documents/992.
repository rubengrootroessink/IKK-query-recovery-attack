Jeff,

Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told 
him that I am not available but it does look good and it is in a nice place - 
also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.

Mike

per your request, attached is a list of speakers at the Industry Standard 
conference.  It looks like a very strong list. They would like to get an 
answer by Thursday.
My suggestion would be for me to go ahead and RSVP that I will do the speech. 
If McMahon is available and wants to do it then we will have the slot held.

Hello Stephen,

As you requested, here's a list of confirmed speakers. Enron will get a
prime slot on Thursday September 7, though we can move it to either Friday
or Saturday if that fits your schedule better. And you'll have a keynote
session, whereas many of the CEOs below will be on panels. Hope to hear a
confirmation from you very soon.

Best,
--John
