Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able 
to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am?
Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Thanks,
Mike
