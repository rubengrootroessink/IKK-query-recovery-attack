FYI---it looks like CMS and Enron are the two shortlisted companies for the 
SADAF power/steam opportunity in Eastern Saudi Arabia.  You may recall taht 
this opportunity could give a good base line income with upsides for energy 
management services in a huge petrochemical comples in Eastern Saudi. 

We will be receiving clarification questionnaires from SADAF and will meet 
with them in the near future.
