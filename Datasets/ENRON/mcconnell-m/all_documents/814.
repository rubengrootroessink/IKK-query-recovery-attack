Unfortunately, Mike will be unable to attend the meeting on Sept. 29th since 
he will still be Japan at the time.  Thank you.

The next Enron Art Committee meeting will take place in the Enron Building
(exact conference room to follow) from 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. on Friday,
September 29th.  At that time, the Caesar Pelli architects will review with
us key interior drawings for the new building.  I look forward to seeing
you there.
