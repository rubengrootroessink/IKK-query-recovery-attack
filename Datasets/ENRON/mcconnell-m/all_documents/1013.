Megan Heckerman (Bambi's daughter) who was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes=
=20
has agreed to be this year's honorary Enron Team Captain for the Juvenile=
=20
Diabetes Foundation walk (see Megan's letter below).  She is anxious for th=
is=20
walk to be successful and has asked if she could help kick-off the campaign=
=20
by selling "Casual Shorts Week" buttons and signing up walkers and pledges.=
 =20
Please stop Megan's table in the lobby and say "hi" tomorrow (Friday, July=
=20
21) from 11:30 a.m. until 1:00 p.m.

Casual Shorts Week buttons cost $5 and will allow the purchaser to wear=20
shorts the entire week prior to the walk (August 7-11) - won't that be nice=
=20
considering how HOT August usually is!

Hi,
My name is Megan Heckerman. I am 11 years old.  On August 3, 1999, I was=20
diagnosed with Type 1 Juvenile Diabetes.  For several weeks before that day=
,=20
I slowly became sicker every day and finally got really scared because I di=
dn=01,
t know what was wrong with me and my Mom was scared too.  I was thirsty, we=
nt=20
to the bathroom a lot, started not feeling well and then finally I lost a t=
on=20
of weight real fast. When I went to the Doctor my blood sugar was nearly fi=
ve=20
times normal.=20

Since August 3rd, my life has changed a lot.  I was told when to eat, what =
to=20
eat, what NOT to eat and how much to eat. Which is pretty tough to do=20
especially at Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day and Easter=
. =20
Mom paid me for my Halloween candy and took it to work, so that was a good=
=20
deal.  I was told that my genes contained a code for killing the insulin=20
making cells in my pancreas and that all that code needed was probably a=20
virus that I had had last spring to turn it on. My insulin making cells are=
=20
gone forever but they tell me that someday they hope there will be a cure.=
=20

Since I was diagnosed, every day I test my blood at least four times for=20
sugar and take insulin shots three times a day. I have given myself nearly=
=20
1,000 shots and have poked my fingertips for blood nearly 1,400 times and i=
t=20
hasn=01,t been even a year!  I would love to be normal again and there are =
a lot=20
of other people that have diabetes that I=01,m sure you know feel the same =
way. =20

So, I am writing to tell you about a project I am working on this year call=
ed=20
=01&Walk to Cure Diabetes=018. The Walk for Diabetes helps to raise money t=
o find a=20
cure for juvenile diabetes. On August 12, 2000 in Elmwood Park, I will be=
=20
walking with my team from Enron called Megan's Marchers.  I hope that you=
=20
will join my team or sponsor someone on the team.  I am hoping we can raise=
=20
over $3,000.00 and have at least 20 walkers participate. Please consider=20
signing up to walk, or if you can=01,t then please sponsor the Enron team.=
=20

Thank you,

Megan Heckerman=20
