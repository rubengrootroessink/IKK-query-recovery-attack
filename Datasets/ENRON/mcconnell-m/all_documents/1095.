Rick, here is the proposed email on George.  Any comments?  I wanted to keep 
it short and sweet.  This will be sent out at close of business today (they 
like to send out massive emails after hours).

Pleaes let me know any issues or comments ASAP.

Thanks,
mike



draft

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
("GSS") will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, 
managing director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice 
president and chief accounting officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 
2000, will continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for 
Enron.   We believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's 
global reach and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core 
mission of creating new electronic market places.
