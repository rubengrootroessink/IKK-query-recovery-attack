Gary,

Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think 
that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy 
Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot 
of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally 
for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a 
recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good 
opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange 
Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.

D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.

Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A 
phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He 
knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.

Mike

Mike,  please find attatched 2 resumes, as mentioned. 

1. Rob Tesar.  Position: Enron Networks, Agricultural Markets.  Rob Tesar is 
American and has worked for 15 years at Cargill, the first 10 or so inside 
the  grains businesses where he managed the central hedging desk out of 
headquarters.   He is a class act; if he has any weakness it would be a 
tendency to  be too cautious.   He is significantly underutilized in his 
present position.

2. Detlev Hartman.  Position: open.  Detlev is German and was my boss at DG 
BANK in Frankfurt, in the early stages of the development of the finanical  
derivatives markets in Germany in the late 80's.  His professional background 
is diverse with a pretty consistent emphasis on finance.   Detlev is one of 
the  brightest, intuitive minds I've ever worked with; he could contribute in 
the MG initiative or in any number of trading, risk management oversight 
positions.   Somewhat volatile personality, but exciting to work with.

Daudi Lelijveld.  Position: Enron Networks, MG or logistics.  Daudi is a 
dutchman with a broad background; he has run Cargill's UK metals business for 
the last 5 years, or so.  He is putting his resume together and I'll forward. 

Paul Lichter and Mike Walden.  Position: IT - I have forwarded information to 
Jahn Pavetto.
