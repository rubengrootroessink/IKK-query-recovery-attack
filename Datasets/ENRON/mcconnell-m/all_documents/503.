I hope you and Lorraine are having a great holiday season. =20

 Sorry for the slow reply but I tried to only work on critical items over m=
y=20
holiday.  Yes, this is only a marketing desk and it really only includes 1=
=20
person, Ross,  who doesn't want to move to Oslo.  I didn't think it was a b=
ig=20
thing and that is why I didn't get back with you.  It wasn't a big part of=
=20
the memo and i didn't focus a lot on it.  I would expect him to co-ordinate=
=20
daily with Thor.  I believe he works for Thor but we didn't  address it in=
=20
the discussion or memo.  I'll watch it and see if it becomes an issue.  I d=
o=20
know that Mark and Thor have talked about it and I believe Thor likes Ross=
=20
and is OK with his function in London.  We are not attempting to recreate t=
he=20
wheel in London or around Thor.
=20
See you when you come to town.

Mike

After re-reading your note - I see that it is not a trading desk in London=

but a marketing desk=20

shouldn't we be talking about this or your=20
guys talking to Thor who is running the European Weather business?

I thought we had specifically agreed that we were not adding a market makin=

function in London!  If you
have got traders to spare I can use about six of them.
