Hi Mike,

Amanda Martin asked that I forward my resume to you for your consideration.  
I am interested in a position in origination, risk management or structuring 
within Enron.  I graduated from Rice University and Stanford University in 
engineering and have advanced into a commercial role at Azurix.  I am hoping 
to build on my commercial skills at Enron Global Markets.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my plans with you.  I am 
available to meet at your convenience.  You may reach me at 713-646-7902.  
Amanda will also follow up with a telephone call to you next week.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,
Tameeza Asaria
