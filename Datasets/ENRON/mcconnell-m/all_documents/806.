John,

I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.  I ran out of the 
office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff 
for my trip.  Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd 
leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and 
are in the office for a while this afternoon.  I'll give you a call a little 
bit later.  If your call is urgent, please don't hesitate to give me a 
voicemail if our time zones don't match up.
Thanks and sorry for the delay.
