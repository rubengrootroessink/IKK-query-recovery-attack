Ron,

I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did we 
make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that will 
require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and was 
wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive international 
travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible delivery date.

Thanks,
mike
