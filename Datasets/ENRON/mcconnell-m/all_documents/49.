I would like to have a morning meeting in my office every Tuesday, Thursday, 
and Friday in the same format you guys have now around 8 or 8:15.  Obviously, 
these days are in addition to the Monday and Wednesday meeting general 
meeting.  I would like to start them one week from today and at 7:30 am, 
unless notified otherwise.  

Thanks.  

Jeff
