Chris,

I got the pictures yesterday.  They looked great and were very clear.  I am 
interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you 
have as well.  I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to 
an agreement.  What is your best and final total  price for the work?  I will 
make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email. 

Thanks,
Mike 


 PS -  I am going to pass on the Braque and Picasso for now.
