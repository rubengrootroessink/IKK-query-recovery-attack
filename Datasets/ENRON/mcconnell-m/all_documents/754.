Larry, here is the publication we discussed.  If you have an interest, let 
this guy know. 
Thanks and welcome aboard.  Wes Colwell is looking for an office.  Right now 
there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1 
office on finance floor.  Do you have a preference, if we have an option?
