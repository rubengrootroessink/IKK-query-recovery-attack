Mike/Jeff,

Rick and I discussed the attached analysis with Jim today. He is comfortable 
with the analysis. He does not believe we need to spend time on the Blk A 
only case. The main issue to address is terminal access at Lake Charles given 
the "open season" exercise that closes February 15th. Elba can not receive 
LNG from Oman at the current quality specifications. If you have any 
questions please give me a call or send an email. I will be on leave but my 
US mobile is on: 713/5015913.
