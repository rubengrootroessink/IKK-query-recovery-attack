Jeff, 

Attached is the first draft of the first organization announcement.  Please 
add your changes, ideas and corrections and return to me.  Once you have 
provide comments, I'll send to sally and Brent to make sure all of the that 
part is accurate.  Also I have a call into Jere confirming the move on the 
Corp insurance piece.  I didn't but in anything about Cindy Skinner, go ahead 
and add that as well.

Please don't hesitate to make wording changes.  I don't have any pride of 
authorship here.

Thanks,
mike
