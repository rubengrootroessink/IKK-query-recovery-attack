Mike,

We have an opportunity that may interest your management team.  We publish
LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique
form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and
growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our
publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and
consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.

LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no
exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel
capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases.
LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and
readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive
agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity
will close quickly.

Best regards,

Bob Nimocks
