Blake,
Thanks for the email.  I will work on it.  I am out for the next several 
weeks, S America (today), Korea and Japan in the next 2 weeks.  If I don't 
follow-up after that, please email me again.

Thanks for the kind words.

Mr. McConnell,

I am an Energy Management major at OU who is interning here at Enron.  My 
work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had 
hoped for.  I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in 
Norman and have been very impressed.  I have been impressed by the things you 
said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to 
excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.  The most 
impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive 
thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk 
with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.  These are beliefs which I have been 
raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.  It was very 
inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has 
obviously worked.  As I have started my internship here, I am implementing 
this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have 
some helpful advice.  I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to 
send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could 
speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your 
career.  If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would 
really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

Thank you for your time

Blake Lasuzzo
