Forest Products Group

Enron Industrial Markets is at a key point in its development.  At the end of 
March, we expect to close the purchase of Daishowa's Quebec City newsprint 
mill.  When combined with Garden State, EIM is now the seventh largest 
newsprint producer in North America.  These two plants will be a crucial 
catalyst for the transformation of the paper industry towards a true 
commodity marketplace with a robust spot market, transparent pricing 
mechanisms, and increased liquidity.  As EIM begins this next stage of 
evolution in the pulp, paper and lumber markets, we have decided to rename 
our effort the "Forest Products Group".  We are also pleased to announce the 
following organizational changes in our commercial organization.  All of 
these individuals will report to the EIM Office of the Chairman.  These 
changes are effective immediately.

? Rodney Malcolm will assume responsibility for a new Sales and Marketing 
Group within the Forest Products Group.  The Sales and Marketing Group will 
be responsible for managing the sales of all physical products in which we 
make markets and the development of new markets for EIM in Asia and South 
America.  The Sales and Marketing Group is also responsible for growing EIM's 
sales activities in financial risk management products.  By combining 
physical and financial activities into one organization, we hope to 
accelerate the growth of our business and force the transformation of this 
industry.  The Sales and Marketing Group will be the primary relationship 
contact with our producer and consumer customer base.

? Rob Saltiel  will create a new Forest Products Origination Group.  The 
Forest Products Origination Group will focus on seeking value in longer term, 
highly structured transactions.  By setting up Origination as a stand-alone 
unit, we hope to increase the focus on higher value, long lead time 
opportunities.  Rob joins us from Enron in London where he has enjoyed 
tremendous origination success in the U.K. and European power sector.  Most 
recently, Rob has been with Enron Direct, Enron Europe's successful effort 
marketing energy to commercial customers.  Please join us in welcoming Rob to 
EIM.  Jay Boudreaux and Debbie Chance will be joining Rob's group.

? Bob Crane will continue to be responsible for trading and risk management 
in all Forest Product markets.

? Andy Kelemen will take the leadership of the Transaction Development 
Group.  Transaction Development will continue to provide deal execution 
resources and deal management support to all EIM activities.  Transaction 
Development will also handle all of EIM's corporate development and mergers 
and acquisitions activities.  Andy joins EIM from ENA where he led the 
Transaction Development Group for West Origination.  Prior to West 
Origination, Andy was with ENA Corporate Development.  He joined Enron from 
McKinsey in 1996.

Please join us in congratulating these individuals for their new roles.  This 
new organization will allow us to more keenly focus on our mission:  To be 
the premier market maker in physical products and financial risk management 
products in the Forest Products sector.

As most of you are aware, Brian Burnett has decided to accept a position in 
Enron Broadband Services.  Brian has been a key leader in building Enron's 
franchise in the pulp and paper markets and will be severely missed.  Please 
join us in wishing Brian well in his new endeavor.  Brian will continue to 
assist with transitional matters through the end of this quarter.

On Tuesday, March 13th at 4:00 pm we are hosting an EIM all employee meeting 
and happy hour at the Mercury Room.  Please plan to attend.  We will begin 
the meeting with a business review and will provide more details about the 
new Forest Products Group organization.

Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen
