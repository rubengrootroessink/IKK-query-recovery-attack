Paula,
Thanks for the email.  I do have a question.  I am talking with these folks 
because of your personal reference but how does this work with Project 
Summer.  Although we don't talk about this, I have heard (not first hand) 
that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the 
deal.  I don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise  What 
is the scoop?

Mike

Mike - As a followup to my voicemail, I am forwarding the resume of Rafi 
Khan.  I have worked directly with Rafi previously and have a very high 
regard for him.  Currently is Enron's Middle East/LNG group, Rafi's 
experience spans tax structuring, financial analysis, risk management and 
deal structuring and origination.  He also has completed his law degree.  
Rafi is seeking a Houston-based opportunity and, with his global finance and 
commercial experience, would be a strong candidate for a position in your new 
business.  Please expect a call from Rafi.  Thanks, Paula
