Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud of 
our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still 
of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate 
from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around technology 
and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.  EOL ended the 
year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was only 1 part of our 
transformation however.  

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell
