I have attached the final draft of the CMS presentation.  Graphics is 
currently printing up transparencies, assembling two bound color copies,  and 
burning a CD backup.  I will bring them up as soon as they are done.  I am 
currently working on the narrative for the presentation and should have 
something ready by Thursday at 3:00.
