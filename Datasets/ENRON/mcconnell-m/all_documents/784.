Don,  

Howdy from Tokyo.  Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  I 
would be happy to talk with you in Dallas about your business.

In the mean time, why don't you send me a new email (without the personal 
stuff) about your company and references to your website and i will forward 
it to the appropriate people within Enron with a note to insure that it gets 
the proper attention.

Thanks and see you soon.
Mike

 Hey Mike, It's been a long time since we last spoke, hope all is
well with you and the family in Houston. I saw Jonny & Brenda in Telluride
this weekend and he mentioned we would be getting together in Dallas. It
will be great to see yall again.  It's already that time of year for the big
shoot-out when the Horns tangle with the Sooners. It looks like this could
be another very interesting game, no telling what will happen with the way
both teams are playing this year.

 I have been thinking of you and I had planned to call you to talk a
little business. Our company, Nexstar  is now up and running and working
with major corporations like Enron to provide mortgage loans to their
relocating employees and as a benefit to the general employment base. We are
a high tech , high touch approach to mortgage lending providing employees
with internet and/or telephony interaction with Nexstar. As a follow-up to
our discussion in the bar last year in Dallas, I thought we could chat about
what's going on in the financial services industry and if Nexstar's products
and services could be of any benefit to Enron. If you have any interest you
can view our website at nexstarhome.com.

Please drop me a note or give me a call so we can catch up and even talk a
little business. I also wanted to talk about that ballpark with your name on
it. I have not had a chance to see it yet but plan to when I get down to
Houston. Take care, and don't forget to HOOK-EM  Horns!

   Don
