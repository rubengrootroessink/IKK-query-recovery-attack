This one of the transactions that Per & David mentioned to you last week. 
Note that this is a draft, but we wanted to give you a chance to review this, 
as it will be coming through in the next two days for execution.
Regards,
Joana

All,
Attached please find the draft ORION DASH. The counterparty is anxious to 
execute this week & we are in final contract negotiations. Please review and 
contact us with any questions. Note that this is slightly different, as it is 
primarily a physical deal and the deductibles are calculated based on a 
weather index.
regards,
Joana
