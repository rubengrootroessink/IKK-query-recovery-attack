Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would 
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?  
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as 
well.

Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to 
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in October 
2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits 
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic 
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John Chambers, 
Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW 
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago. I 
have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which 
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has 
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy, 
including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other 
businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this 
subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.

I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the 
21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna 
Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa Weiner, 
is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology, whereas the 
E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic business 
transformation.

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to 
following up with you following the holiday weekend.

Best regards,
Cate Ambrose
Director of Programmes
