Subject: Skilling in Australia

BHP has advised V V Rao that Jeff Skilling is meeting in Australia with Paul 
Anderson of BHP, and that our discussions with BHP regarding NWS train 4 
wedge volumes (starting 2004) and the proposed Enron/BHP LNG terminal in 
Japan are on the list of discussion items
