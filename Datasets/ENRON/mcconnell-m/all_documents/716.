Jeff, 

Sorry for the slow response.  

I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea.

In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still 
slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost 
caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and 
best way to communcate.

Thanks,
Mike
