I do not know you but I work for Brian Redmond.  I am on Kathy Benedict's 
team and am happy to tell you that I have already received pledges for over 
$500.  I do not see this function as a competition, only as a wonderful 
opportunity to help so many people fight a disease that touches too many 
lives.  I have not worked for Enron for very long but I am happy to know that 
we have been #1 for 5 years!!  I hope that I can help to keep it that way 
again!!  I think that what you are doing is so great and I just felt like 
telling you!  Hope to meet you at the walk!!

          Sincerely,
          Lacye Brymer Trevino
