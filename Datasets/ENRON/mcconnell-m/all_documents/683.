Cindy, I don't think we have a fit here but would you please follow-up and 
let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything.  Also please 
forward to other groups as well.

Thanks,

Mike,

Thanks for the quick follow-up. My background is in the sales, marketing, 
strategic planning and M&A areas in the industrial sector. Do not know if 
there is a fit, but I had hoped to explore possibilities with you.
