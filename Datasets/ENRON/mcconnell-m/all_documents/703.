Maryfran,

I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.  As flattered as I 
am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is 
more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.  I am very proud of our 
accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology 
group but my tenor was only about a year.  In August I was asked to take on 
another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even 
more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave 
the technology world.

Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a 
great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and 
innovation.  He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.

Sincerely, 
Mike S. McConnell
