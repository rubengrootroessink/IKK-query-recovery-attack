Please see below the draft of our "potential" intervention into the current 
application process at FERC re. Elba Island.  

We have been working with Shelley Corman to assure that we won't be stepping 
on any toes.  Shelley feels our draft is fine aside from some minor language 
changes.  She also committed to run it by Stan Horton this morning and we 
will address any concerns he has if necessary.

We also plan to forward/discuss with the El Paso FERC people prior to 
submission.

Please call if you wish to discuss.

Also if you have received a similar note from me earlier this morning, I 
apologize.  I am sending this for the second time as I am concerned that my 
E-mail was not functioning properly this morning.

Thanks
