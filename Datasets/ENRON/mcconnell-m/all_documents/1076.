Rebecca,

Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.

Can we make this happen and when would it occur?

Thanks,
Mike
