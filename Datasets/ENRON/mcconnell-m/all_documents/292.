Christie, I don't have any interest.  Jeff Shankman is a Penn guy and I am 
sure he would like to do it and would be very effective.

Christie,

no problem.  The course is a MBA course on privatization.  We currently talk 
about project finance, and the idea was for Bill Gathman to talk about 
Enron's Dabhol project.  However, this could be substituted with a discussion 
of Enron's project finance activities in general, or with another project.  
There are 55 students in the course (48 MBAs in their first and second years, 
4 law school students in their 2nd year, and Ph.D. students in various 
years).  Dates are either 16 or 18 April, the class starts at 10:30 am and 
runs to noon.

Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you.  Felix

Hi Felix!

Sorry I have not yet had any luck.  However, I will give it one more try.
Would you please again give me the following:
course description, date, # and year of students?  Sorry for your
inconvenience...I'm really strapped for time, and this will be easier for
me than trying to relocate the information you've provided before.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Hi Christie,

I was wondering if you had any luck with finding a speaker for the
privatization course.

Thanks for your help with this.
Felix
