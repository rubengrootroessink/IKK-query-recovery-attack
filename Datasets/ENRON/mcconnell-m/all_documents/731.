I have attached the latest draft of the coal presentation for the Coal Market 
Strategies Conference in Scottsdale.  I am still waiting on an updated 
version of the bar chart on page 13 from the folks up in EOL.  I am also 
forwarding this draft on to Janet Gellici the woman organizing the 
conference.  I told her on the phone and in my email that this was only a 
draft, and we will have the final version for her by the end of business on 
Thursday.  Let me know of any further changes you would like to make.

Thanks,
Stuart
