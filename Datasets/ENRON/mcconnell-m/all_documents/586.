Subject: Weather deals



As discussed with Mark, I have set up a summary of what we did to get people 
interested in weather trading at the Marketing event that we had here in Oslo.


Background:
First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively. 
(There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders)
Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading.
Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start 
doing deals with Enron.
Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do 
weather deals.

Lottery:
We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option 
premium to 15,-  Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100,- NOK. Our 
counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium 
upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options. 
The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their 
first weather deals with Enron.  It was important that the traders could go 
short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was 
afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt 
that they traded weather deals. 

The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that 
have done weather deals already.
