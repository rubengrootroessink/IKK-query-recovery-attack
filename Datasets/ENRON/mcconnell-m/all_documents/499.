Pup,

Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your 
Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming 
quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to 
Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on Thursday 
afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make for a fun 
trip.

When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up a 
time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on 
Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!

We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make 
sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on 
Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there any 
earlier.  

Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light 
schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.  

See you in a couple of days!

Love to all,
Mike

Go ENE stock, we back to 85!
