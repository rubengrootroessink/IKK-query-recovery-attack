Mike McConnell is out of the office on vacation until next Wednesday.  He 
does not have his computer with him on this trip, therefore he has asked me 
to scan his e-mail for him.  Since he returns Wednesday, his calendar is very 
full and unfortunately he will be in a meeting with the Executive Committee 
off-site on Friday.  I can tentatively hold 1:30 - 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday 
afternoon.  Since I will be unable to confirm this meeting with Mike until he 
returns that same morning, can you please call me at X-36898 on Wednesday 
morning to confirm the appointment.

Thank you.

Cathy Phillips
Assistant to Mike McConnell

I understand you were in London last week. I'm sorry I missed you. As you 
know we have people in London supporting coal, global liquids etc and I would 
like to take the opportunity to chat about your plans and how we can assist 
you in the most efficient manner possible. 

I am in Houston next week with Janine Juggins who leads our trading support 
team in tax and would be available Wednesday afternoon or Friday morning to 
meet if you can fit us into your diary.


Regards


Rod
