Subject: E-commerce: An Enron View ppt

Hi Mike, 

I am an account manger in the San Ramon, CA office.  I am also an MBA 
student.  I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be 
doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses 
are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to 
market to).  I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline 
website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what 
we plan on covering.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation 
from you?  Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel 
the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?  I recently heard 
that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting 
together plans for e-commerce websites.  What are your thoughts on that?

Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 
Renee Fernandez
