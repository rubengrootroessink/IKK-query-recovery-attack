Would be good to see you.  We will be in the middle of our winter (~60-65 
degrees MaxT) in July.  Sydney has a relatively mild winter and there is 
still  all the regular sight seeing.  I will be here all month.  Timing would 
be good from a business perspective as we look to develop and assist with 
more EGM opportunities (e.g. grains).  Let me know firm timing and we can set 
an agenda.  btw Frevert was here last week and we had a great day on the 
harbour.

Paul,
I am in the early stages of planning my next run to Singapore and Sydney.  I 
was thinking about bringing my wife and staying over a couple of days (or a 
week).  What is the weather like in July and are you going to be there?
Thanks,
Mike
