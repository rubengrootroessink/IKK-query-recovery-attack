Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky
Christopher-Clark Fine Art
