I noticed a great job opportunity at Enron in the Houston Chronicle
yesterday that appears to be a perfect fit for my experience.  My resume
with the appropriate "Job #107224-Chron" in the header section is attached
for your review.  I really look forward to receiving your telephone call.

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Sincerely,
Marvin Avery
