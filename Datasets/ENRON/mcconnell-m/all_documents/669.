Dear beautiful and majestic butterfly and wonerful wizard Harry Potter,

How are you!!!!   Did you have a great time trick or treating?  I so wish I 
could have been there.  You know I wouldn't have missed it if I could have 
possibly been there.  Did Mommy take a lot of pictures?  I hope so.  I can't 
wait to see them.

Will you show me what you looked like when I get home?

I love you,

Daddy
