I couldn't sleep so ive been doing emails, its looking a little better.  And 
I didn't get up in the middle of the night and come into the office.  I think 
I'll try again and can still get a few hours sleep.  

I will be in a little later than I expected, I must drop young Michael off to 
school and cant leave there until 8.

See you in the morning.

Sleepy
