Virginia, 

Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right 
now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events 
in the middle east.

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more 
about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a 
lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there 
room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while.

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time 
zones.

Thanks,
mike

Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Virginia Repasky
