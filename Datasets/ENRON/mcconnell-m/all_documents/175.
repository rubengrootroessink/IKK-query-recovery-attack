CP,

Attached is the latest draft copy of the memo.  Each group has had an 
opportunity to comment and it has been amended several times.

I would like you to take a look at it and add your comments and changes.  You 
are always the key to a good memo and your changes are vital to making this a 
first rate memo.  Also Freight is in blue and i don't know how to take it 
back to normal.

I would like this out on Tuesday evening.  After i get your version back, go 
ahead and make your changes directly on the memo. Please send to Jeff for 
final review and one more pass thru the business units on Monday.

Thanks,
m
