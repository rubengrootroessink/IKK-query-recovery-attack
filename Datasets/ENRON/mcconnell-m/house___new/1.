RE: Flair Construction Co., Inc. / Purchase of Lots Six (6) and Seven (7),
Block One (1), THE LAKES OF STERLING GATE, Section One (1)

Dear Mr. & Mrs. McConnell:

Enclosed is a blue lined copy of the Survey we received today from the Title
Company.  Please note that there is a thirty five foot (35') Reliant
Energy/Entex pipeline easement and a fourteen foot (14') utility easement at
the rear of the property.  In addition, the fourteen foot (14') utility
easement runs along the northwest property line.  As such, no permanent
fixture will be allowed to be built over these easements, including a
swimming pool, gazebo or similar structure.

The Earnest Money Contract provides that you have seven (7) days from the
receipt of the Survey to object in writing to items appearing on the Survey.
However, we do not believe that Flair Construction can alter these easements
in any way, shape or form, and as such, the easements will most likely
remain intact.  If you feel that the easements will impair the construction
of your home, swimming pool or related structures, please advise us
immediately so that we may notify Flair of your objections.  If the
objections are not cured within twenty (20) days after Flair receives them,
in writing, the closing date may be extended.  If, however, the objections
are not cured by the extended closing date, the Contract will terminate and
your earnest money should be refunded to you.  We just wanted to make sure
that you were aware of your rights regarding this matter.

Assuming the easements cause you no problems, you should be ready to close.
We will be happy to schedule a closing with the Title Company and with Flair
if you can provide us with a number of dates that are convenient for both of
you to appear at the closing.  We will be happy to appear as well.

Very truly yours,



Donald S. Stirman
