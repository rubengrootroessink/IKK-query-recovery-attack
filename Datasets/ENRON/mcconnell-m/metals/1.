The presentation below identifies the size of the Non-Ferrous metals market.  
It was put together by our Corporate Development Team.  As there is no 
"authoritative text" for quantifying the market size, our guys had to rely on 
several industry publications, consultants and MG employee estimates. 

Steel Market Size:
825 million metric tons produced per year (@ an average price of $400 ton), 
the physical market size is $330 Billion
Merrill Lynch, in their Steel Report dated April 14, 2000, quantifies the 
total steel market at slightly over $800 billion (approx. 1.7 billion tons).  
Merrill assumes steel turns over 2 times by the time it reaches the final 
consumer.
Steel consumption in the US is 135 million metric tons per year (production 
is 105 million metric tons)
