Randy,

Thanks for the email.  Yes,  life is wild at Enronville.  It was a very 
difficult decision to leave this group but I am enjoying my first week.

I keep up via old channels with your company.  I am so glad that it all 
worked out and I know you will have continued success.

I'll give you a call when things settle down.  I hope all is well with you 
and your family.

mike

Subject: Organizational Announcement

I was on vacation last week, and just read the announcment.  Congratulations, 
you are really getting up in the thin air now!  Things are going well here.  
Give me a call sometime when you have a break in your schedule (ha) and I 
will treat you to lunch.  Take care.
