Mike,

I am playing in the Rhubarb at Champions on the 28th with another guy I've 
played in several tournaments with.  However, they have switched the format 
this year to 3 man teams, and wondered if you have any interest.

Either give me a call 3-4278, or reply by e-mail.

Hope you have a merry Christmas.

Jimmie
