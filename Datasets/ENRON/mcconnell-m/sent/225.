Subject: Approval of special LNG sidebar for 2000 Annual Report

Hi -- I'm the writer in Corporate Public Relations who writes the annual 
report.

I've written a short sidebar on Enron Global LNG. It's intended to give a 
bullet-point overview.

Please read it and forward any comments to me. I can be reached at ext. 
3-6305. If you prefer, you can fax changes to me at 914-736-5987.

I've sent it to Rick and Wayne, whom I interviewed about it.

Thanks,
Jeannie
