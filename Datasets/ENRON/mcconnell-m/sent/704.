Hi Cate -

Mike McConnell has asked me to respond to you on his behalf.  He said that he 
is fine with the bullet points you have listed below, with the exception of 
"Acquisitions".  Mike will not focus on acquisitions in his speech.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  Thank you.

Mike,
I am delighted to know that you are available to take part in the Atlanta 
E-Business Summit in October. I have tentatively scheduled you for 
mid-morning on October 3rd - let me know if that does not work for you.

With regard to the focus of your presentation, I have written a suggested 
session description below for your review. It reflects a strategic view of 
Enron's move into online B2B markets, which will be very relevant for our 
audience of C-level executives from the Fortune 1000.

The audience at the 21st Century Internet Summit will be primarily CIOs and 
senior executives from Internet companies, so perhaps you could deliver the 
same presentation with a slightly more technological content and perspective.

The programme for the E-Business Summit goes to print next week, so please 
forward me any modifications of the text below by July 19.


Leveraging core brick-and-mortar assets to create new businesses

o     Shifting strategies: turning an energy company into a new economy player
o     Acquisitions: targeting companies on which to build B2B platforms
o     Applying Enron's model to other wholesale commodity markets
o     Added-value as the competitive edge: risk management, financial 
services, liquidity
o     EnronOnline: evolving the customer relationship while increasing sales

Thank you for your interest in this project and I look forward to seeing you 
in Atlanta.
Best,
Cate Ambrose

Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as
well.

Mike McConnell

Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in
October 2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John
Chambers, Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago.
I have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy,
including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other
businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this
subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.

I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in
the 21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in
Laguna Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa
Weiner, is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology,
whereas the E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic
business transformation.

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to
following up with you following the holiday weekend.

Best regards,
Cate Ambrose
