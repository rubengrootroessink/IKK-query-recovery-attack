Subject: Team Room for McKinsey Study

Mike:

Your authorization is required to reserve conference room EB3014 from August 
29 - October 15 for the McKinsey Railroad study.  During this time the room 
will not be available to anyone other than McKinsey team.

My assistant, Angie has received authorization from Lisa Cousino, ENA/EGM 
floor co-ordinator, to utilize EB3014 for the period mentioned, but Lisa 
needs to hear directly from you that this is ok.

Thanks for your help,

Dan Reck
