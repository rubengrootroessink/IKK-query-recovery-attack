Philippe -

El Paso Energy is acquiring Coastal Corporation, where I am currently
employed.  El Paso will probably retain my employment in my current role as
Project Leader of Corporate/Refining & Marketing Systems Support, but I
would prefer working for Enron.  The proposed acquisition of Coastal by El
Paso will not be effective until October.

I just talked to Steve Schneider at Enron, and he highly recommended that I
forward my resume to you with a copy to Mike McConnell.  Steve also said
that he would be available to provide a personal reference on my behalf.

Attached you will find my current resume.  I would prefer opportunities in
the following areas (in this order if possible): project management,
database development, and mainframe system support.  My ideal job
assignments would include all three, but I am open to whatever might be
available.  Opportunities to learn new technology would be great!

Please do not hesitate in contacting me at my business telephone number
(713-877-3081).

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Marvin
