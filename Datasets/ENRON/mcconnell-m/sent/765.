Greg, 

FYI.  I'll give you a full update on Monday afternoon via voicemail.  We are 
on our way.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

mike
