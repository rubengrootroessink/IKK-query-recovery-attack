Mr. McConnell,

This is Jason Stirman, Don Stirman's son.  I e-mailed you my resume a few
weeks ago, and you sent it to a couple people from Enron.  I haven't heard
back from anyone yet, so I was wondering if you knew of someone I could
contact to follow up?  Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely,
Jason Stirman
