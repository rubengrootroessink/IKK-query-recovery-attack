David,

Thanks for the email.
On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our 
new group.  Paper will remain in NA as well.  Both will be re-examined at 
some point but not now.  I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.  Who is 
better, Cindy or Hoyt?

Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation?

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

I asked team to get you some org charts, personnel numbers and PRC results on 
Friday. They may be a little sketchy but we can refine for you over next few 
days. I specifically want to go over employment agreement and comp 
information with you.

Couple of things of immediate note:

 - MG metals is an issue from an HR stand point. I believe (possibly wrongly) 
that much of the NA end of this will fall in your world. Immediate issue 
appears to be desire to let go some staff that MG hired immediately before 
deal went unconditional that now don't fit. Hickerson is aware of where we 
are and I'll keep you informed as things develop.

- I am planning to dedicate Cindy Skinner (Shankman asked me specifically for 
her and I think she is ready for this challenge) to the new business as your 
lead HR person but I also have Hoyt Thomas (you may remember him from 96/97 
era) in the team for the next 6 months (he is on a contract at present and we 
may make it permanent). I'd like to discuss this with you next week.

- I am planning vacation for about 10 days from Weds of next week, but will 
leave you contact numbers.

David
