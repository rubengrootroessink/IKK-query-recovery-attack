Jeff,
I called Joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this.  I 
referenced the power of 100% focus and the accountability for someone driving 
the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity. 

I like your email and tone.  I would like to recommend you add a statement 
about Morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to "own" him vs. 
having a 100%  dedicated weather guy.  I would also add that you want to talk 
him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision 
with tawney.

MIke

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.
