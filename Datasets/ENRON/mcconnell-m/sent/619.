Greg,

I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your 
help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate  
experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep.  

I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult 
morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and 
may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you 
are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the 
Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor 
do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a 
formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for 
some reason. 

Thanks for the chuckle,
mike

PS:  I have been called a lot of things including "that God damned 
McConnell"  but that is as close as it gets.

Spot-I don't know if you know it or not, but a year ago I started serving as
Treasurer of the Sig Ep alumni board. It has been an interesting experience.
Some months back, it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped
by the house. I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those actives
now think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped them
win the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, and
pictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hoping
that some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand.
Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some of
these guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightly
prayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program.
If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, and
some of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you.
I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem,
however.

HFF,

Greg
