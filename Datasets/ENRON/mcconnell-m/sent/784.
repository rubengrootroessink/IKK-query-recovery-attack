John,

Howdy from Houston.  I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is 
involved with several ventures including a German VC  called eStreet.  Are 
you aware of these guys?  They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties 
in Europe especially Spain.  I will ask  him to call you once I talk with him 
but I don't have your number in London.  Two questions, what is your  phone 
number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these 
guys?

Thanks,
Mike
