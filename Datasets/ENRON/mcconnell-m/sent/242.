Gentlemen,

Per your request, attached are two slides detailing our Reliable Reserves 
product and our Term Working Interest structure.  Each slide contains a few 
bullet points describing the structure as well as a real transaction analysis 
of each and the corresponding results.  Please give me a call if you have any 
questions.
