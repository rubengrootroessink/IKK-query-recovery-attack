I just got the tickets the day I left for Telluride.  Why don't we just pick
you guys up for the game.  We aren't arriving until 3:00 on game day.  We're
staying at the Breakwater Hotel on South Beach (305) 532-1220.  I will have
my mobile phone (512) 426-1033.  What Hyatt are you staying at.

Your Spring Break schedule is great.

Pup,

Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your
Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming
quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to
Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on
Thursday afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make
for a fun trip.

When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up
a time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on
Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!

We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make
sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on
Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there
any earlier.

Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light
schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.

See you in a couple of days!

Love to all,
Mike

Go ENE stock, we back to 85!
