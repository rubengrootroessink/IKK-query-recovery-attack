Emilo,
A few things that I want to make sure that we have in our briefing package.
A map of the region and facility
Assessment of country risk
address concern that a lot of "old" money (big Landowners) are taking their 
money out of the country - something we shouldn't ignore
Update on other Ven. activities for ENE


Other 
How is this going to work with translators?
Earlier meetings with Ministers?
We want to have a dinner the night before with key people

We are now flying out after the meeting on Friday on the company plane.

Mike
