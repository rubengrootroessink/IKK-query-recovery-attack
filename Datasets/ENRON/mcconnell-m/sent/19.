Eric,

A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly.
Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d)
Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals
Elba - supply and managing t-o-p
Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan
R Bergseiker future and other EI people
Asia strategy and clarification
Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, 
facilities)

I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them 
down and get an update.

Thanks,
m
