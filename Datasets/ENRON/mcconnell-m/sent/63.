Chris,

Thanks for the response and thanks for the consideration.  I accept and we're 
done.  I will have a check out to you today via overnight mail.

Price:  9,500 less $500 plus $150 = $9,150

Please ship to:

Mike McConnell
13451 Belhaven Drive
Houston, Texas 77069

I look forward to doing business with you in the future.  I'll let you know 
the next time I'm back in the market for a specific piece or artist.  Also 
please give my home a call (281-895-6855) when the piece gets in the mail so 
that I can make sure that my wife is around to accept delivery.

Sincerely,
Mike 

PS - Your price was right on the mark for an easy personal decision.  My wife 
actually preferred another piece that was slightly cheaper and this let me 
get my favorite piece!

Dear Mike,
Sorry the photos took so long to arrive in Texas.  We feel the piece is
fairly priced at $9,500. but will give you a $500. discount if this helps
your situation.  The crating will be $150. and the gallery will cover
insurance.
May Thanks,
C. Neptune
