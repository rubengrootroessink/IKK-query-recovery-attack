Please cancel the Palm.Net service effective immediately.  I am no longer 
using the Palm Pilot and therefore do not need the Palm.Net service.

Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Mike McConnell,

The credit card you are currently using for the Palm.Net service is
about to expire.

To avoid any interruption to your service, prior to your next billing date, 
please update your expiration date prior to your billing date by accessing 
the My Account/Update Credit Card Info area at www.palm.net.

Thank you,

Palm.Net Customer Care
