Virginia,

Thanks for the emails.  No interest in the above or the miro.  I am actively 
looking for a Pierre Bonnard lithograph, in color and signed.  Also looking 
for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.  I will want to see numerous examples 
before I choose the Lautrec that we want.

If you have any Bonnards,  please let me know and send a copy of the image.

Mike
