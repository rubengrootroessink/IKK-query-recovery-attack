Billy,

I like it.  My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all 
your discussions with business unit head and AAs  we are (changing) improving 
the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.  I think this 
could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.

Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.

Good luck,
m
