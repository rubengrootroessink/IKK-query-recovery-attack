Per,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive 
statement about your business as an intro line of the section.   

Thanks,
mike
