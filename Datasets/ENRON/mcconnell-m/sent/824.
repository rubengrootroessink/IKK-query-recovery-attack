Subject: Need your help representing your Analysts

As you probably know, the Western Hemisphere A&A PRC will be held in Houston 
on July 19th.  Each member of the PRC committee will represent 15 to 17 
analysts that have been randomly assigned. I've been selected as a member of 
the Analyst PRC Committee representing participants that are under your 
direct supervision.  As a PRC rep, I will continue to represent the assigned 
Analysts (see list below) during their entire tenure with the Analyst Program.

Thus, I need your help in supplying me performance information for these 
candidates (including pre-ratings if available) and recommendations for 
promotion if he or she is eligible.  In addition, for those of you based out 
of Houston I'd like to meet with each of you individually (15 or 20 minutes 
should be enough) during the 17th and the 18th of July (if you are not based 
out of Houston or you'll be out of town during those days, we can certainly 
do it over the phone the week of the 10th.
I'm based out of Sao Paulo (in transition from Buenos Aires) and I'll be 
landing in Houston the morning of the 17th, so I'll be ready to begin these 
short meetings by 11am on the 17th.  I would very much appreciate if you can 
indicate your time preference for those two days. 

FYI, the following is the list of participants that I'll be representing in 
the July 19th PRC meeting:

Analyst Name    Supervisor
Ahanchian, Amir Cyrus    Humphrey, Gene
Allen, Margaret     Palmer, Mark
Ashmore, Garrett    Cox, David    
Benien, Michael     Moscoso, Michael
Black, Robin     Lewis, James
Cerny, Ward     Sethu, Vijay
Chenoweth, Christopher    Lewis, James
Falcone, Daniel     Moscoso, Michael
Ferrara, Julie     McConnell, Michael
Hausinger, Sharon    Vanderhorst, Barend
Hernandez Veiga, Alejandro   Gutierrez, Hector
Hoff, Jonathan     House, John
Jachimiak, Matthew    Lewis, William
Mena, Luis     Leibert, Richard
O'Malley, Justin     Pittenger, Cathy
Scarborough, John    Courtney, Mark
Vegalara, Mateo    Thomsen, Jon


Please call me at 5511-5503-1397 in Sao Paulo or at 5411-4891-3600 in Buenos 
Aires.  It will be of enormous help if you can let us know the name and 
telephone number of your assistants so Marianne Arake (Sao Paulo 
5511-5503-1197) and/or Nadia Rodriguez (Buenos Aires 5411-4891-3644) can 
follow up on the schedule in Houston.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Fede
