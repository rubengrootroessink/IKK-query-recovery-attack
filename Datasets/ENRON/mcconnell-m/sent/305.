Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail 
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another 
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.  I 
hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating Madeline's 
birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned 
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to 
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I 
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they 
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad 
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike
