Lisa, 

As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized 
that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal 
efforts.  I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize 
how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.  I could not read my 
notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on 
my notes just on me.

Thanks,
Mike
