Just received return phone call from Ito van Lanshot at Reliant.  I 
referenced earlier telecon between Bob Harvey and Mike McConell regarding 
possibilities on coal side.  Ito mentioned that he has an on-going dialog 
with John Sherriff regarding joint opportunities.  I explained nature of 
delivered coal deals we are doing in UK/Germany/Spain and expressed interest 
in similar arrangement in ARA ports - mentioned I had on-going dialog with 
Peter Davies.  He responded that they are evaluating continuing relationship 
with GKE on and on-going basis.  He would be interested in hearing more about 
nature of deals we are doing - he will get update from Peter Davies on status 
of GKE relationship and then would like to schedule a meeting in either 
London or Amsterdam to discuss possibilities.  Said he would touch base with 
John Sherriff (or directly with me) during the next 2 weeks.

Will keep everyone posted.
