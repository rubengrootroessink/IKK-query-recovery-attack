Julie,
thanks for the update.  a couple of items.
1.  take out IT compliance and we will make it 1 dot point under PB's area of 
technology update
2. metals - call it MG(plc)
3.  take out page 16 (initiatives under consideration)
4.  Change org chart;  Jay - add investments and New Mkt. identification;  
take S horn off
5. on agenda page add sub dots for project updates and accomplishments under 
technology update
6. Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well, give him a call for a 
draft.  It will go in the vision section put it toward the back of the vision 
section

On further emails, only send me change or new pages.  It takes forever to 
download this (EOL) when I replicate.

Thanks,
