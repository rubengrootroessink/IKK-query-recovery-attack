Subject: Enron At a Glance

Mike - I enjoyed your presentation  and comments about Enron Global Markets 
last week.
Your comment about being passionate about things which add value to the 
company is important for success at Enron was very helpful.

I am an originator in EIM for our pulp & paper businesses. I am starting 
business development effort in Asia for Pulp & Paper which I am very excited 
about. I will be in Asia visiting potential consumers and producers in major 
countries in Asia e.g., Japan, India, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Australia 
and others.
I would like to know if you recommend someone in Enron offices in these 
countries who may have originated businesses with major pulp & paper clients 
for other products e.g., energy or other commodities. 
Thanks for your help in advance.
