Jay/Allan,

FYI and evaluation, attached is a business plan from the CALME group.  Please 
let me know what you think.  They are trying to play ball and sent this to 
us.  Also they are beginning to call me.  

I had planned to send this to you while I was out but it wouldn't go thru 
properly from San Francisco.  Allan, please give her a call and let her know 
you received it and let her know your overall impression.

By the way, Karen is David Haug's new fiancee.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

As per David's request and our discussion on Friday evening, please take a 
look at the business plan submitted for the trading exchange. Let me know if 
you would like to pursue it so that I can facilitate an introduction if it is 
necessary. Alternatively, I can have the company call you directly.

Regards,
Karen

Shawn,

This came through to me through some contacts in the DR. I am not sure if you 
would be interested in seeing if the model applies in any other countries in 
your region. Additionally, who is the person who would be a counterpart for 
the Southern Cone. Let me know if it tickles you as I need to get back to 
them over the next week.

Thanks,
Karen
