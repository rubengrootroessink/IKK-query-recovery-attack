Cedric, =20

As a follow-up to our meeting,  below are a few comments and ideas regardin=
g=20
the Net Works piece of the analyst presentation. =20

I know I sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in=
=20
the various presentations that I think may be appropriate for the=20
presentation (or pieces of them) including:=20

? Why Enron?
? Recent Enron eCommerce Experience
? Lessons Learned
? Business Strategy
? Target Market Criteria
? Enron Today/Enron Tomorrow

Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.

We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20
(obvious).  Clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst=20
meetings.  This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm=20
(eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This=
=20
should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2=
=20
new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and=
=20
industries.  Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than=
=20
all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo=
r=20
matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of=20
transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $=
0=20
(we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pri=
cing=20
component (this piece will be free).  This piece will not be ready for July=
=20
25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should=
=20
be out by end of 3rd qtr.).  I believe that the link with Net Works with bo=
th=20
paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture th=
an=20
just metals alone.  Also for your information, we are working on 2=20
acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coul=
d=20
be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since =
we=20
will have access to physical pulp and paper.  Paper must be an important=20
piece of the presentation.  Greg Piper is the MD for Clickpaper and he can=
=20
answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c=
an=20
be reached at ext. 36635.

Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath=
=20
pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. =
=20
That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are=
=20
in "incubation" and examination stages.=20

Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest=
=20
version and I=01,ll add additional commentary.  I will be in all next week.

Thanks,
mike
