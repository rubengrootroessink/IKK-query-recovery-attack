Hi Angie -

Please pass along our thanks for the invitation.  I have confirmed that 
Saturday evening is the only time I will have an opportunity to see my 
brother, therefore I will be unable to attend.  In addition, Mike checked his 
calendar and found out that he and his wife have been committed for several 
weeks to attend a social engagement on that evening.

Again, thanks.

Cathy Phillips and 
Mike McConnell
