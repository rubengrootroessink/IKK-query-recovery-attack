Jeff,

 I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.  Your presence is 
needed more than I thought.  My gut told me that they really needed your help 
but its more than that.  Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of 
your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.  They 
will learn or they will be out.
