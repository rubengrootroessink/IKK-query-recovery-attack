I had a good interview with Andy yesterday.  He is a strong candidate and you 
may want to consider him for origination and mid-marketing opportunities.  
His resume is attached below.  I highly recommend Andy and if you are 
interested in talking with him, please contact Shanna Funkhouser to arrange 
an interview.

Thanks.
Mike

Mike,

Thanks again for meeting with me today.  It was a pleasure to finally meet 
you, I appreciate your help in my redeployment process.  Attached is my 
resume that should provide a snapshot of my background and skills for those 
you have in mind.

I will be in Houston meeting and interviewing until next Wednesday, April 
12th. Hopefully there will be the opportunity to meet with some your team 
before I return to London.  My contact phone is listed below, and I am 
sitting on 45 this week.  I'll update you with my progress before I leave 
next week.

Talk with you soon.

 Andy
