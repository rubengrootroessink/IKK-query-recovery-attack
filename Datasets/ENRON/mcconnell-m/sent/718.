Subject: Space Planning for Floo 27

Mike,

Previously, Fastow's group was scheduled to vacate floor 27 on the 24th of 
August.  There were a few unexpected construction problems and now the vacate 
date is September 8.

Of course we are not moving to floor 27 "as is".   I expect the rest of the 
month of September to be used for constructing floor 27 to our 
specifications.  We can probably start moving down the first weekend in 
October.  I'm requesting a very aggressive , around-the-clock, construction 
crew. 

I'll advise as necessary.

Many Thanks,

Liz
