Greg,

Listed below is a brief outline of some of the key items that I turned over=
=20
to McMahon.  I didn't attempt to put down anything but a reference point bu=
t=20
he has the files and we went through every point.  We didn't spend a lot of=
=20
time on the international activities because a great deal of it might not b=
e=20
part of the group after project Summer.  He attended my (his) Monday staff=
=20
meeting and he got a flavor of the group and what everyone does.  This is=
=20
going to be primarily Philippe's meeting now but he is going to attend to=
=20
provide needed commercial balance and if he does, I believe that is all the=
=20
time he has to spend on that side of the business.

I hope you are having a successful trip.

Mike
