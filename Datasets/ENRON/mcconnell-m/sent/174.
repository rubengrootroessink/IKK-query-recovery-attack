Joe,
Howdy from Houston.  I would really like to discuss.  I've been out the last 
2 Mondays and missed your calls. I know your were out yesterday.  How about 
5pm on thursday - Houston time.  Does that work?

Mike

Subject: Opportunities

Mike,

There are a number of opportunities that are presenting themselves in Japan 
that to prove successful will need some close cooperation between our group 
(also including metals) and global markets.  I am not implying that the 
relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these 
opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a 
concerted effort is put forward.  I have briefly alluded to some of these 
with Jeff and with Gary (as he was in Japan last week) and they both seem 
interested.

Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further?

Joe
