Cindy,
I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The 
company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his 
email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring 
it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do 
anything like this with our employees?

I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a 
total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate 
members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch.  
I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive 
customer list already.

Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.

Thanks,
Mike

 Mike,

 It was good to talk to you this weekend and hope you had a great
stay in Dallas. As we discussed, I am attaching a brief introduction to
Nexstar Financial and a copy of our latest press release. Nexstar is a
financial services company that is currently offering mortgage lending
products. We began the company in May 1999 and have spent the last 18 months
building a state of the art high tech (web) high touch (telephone) customer
communication/service center located in St. Louis Missouri.. We specialize
in working with Fortune 500 companies to provide superior mortgage products
to their relocating employees as well as to their  general employee
population.

 Our management team of industry leaders launched Nexstar after
holding senior positions with some of the most prominent mortgage companies
in the business today. Our Chairman, Marvin Moskowitz was Chairman of the
parent company of Prudential Home Mortgage while it grew to industry
prominence in  providing mortgage products to corporate America.  Rick
Thornberry, our CEO and President, most recently held the COO and President
positions at Citi Mortgage.  I serve as Managing Director of Business
Development at Nexstar and served as Managing Director of Sales at Citi
Mortgage responsible for the Corporate Relocation and Employee Program.
Previous to Citi I served in several executive positions with Prudential
Home Mortgage.  Helen Garrity is Managing Director of Sales and Marketing.
She joined Nexstar from her position as SVP of Norwest Mortgage, where she
led the corporate and affinity mortgage programs.  Our experienced and
visionary management team has been joined by some of the brightest
individuals in the mortgage industry.  Since May 1999, our collective team
has succeeded in designing and implementing the most advanced mortgage
program available to corporations and co-brand partners today, resulting in
an easier mortgage process with reduced customer expenses and savings to the
corporation.

 I'd love to have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate people
at Enron to demonstrate the benefits Nexstar offers for Enron's relocating
and general employee population.

 Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss
Nexstar and how we could bring value to Enron. Thank you.
