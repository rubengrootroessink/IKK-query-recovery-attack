John,
I talked with Janet last week and then I was out sick.  I left her a 
voicemail before lunch and am waiting on her reply.

Jannell grabbed me today to ask where we stand as I think she still has an 
interest in coming to our group. I asked her if she had been contacted by 
anyone in power marketing and she has not. Could you have Janet talk to her 
so we can either move forward or move on. thanks.
