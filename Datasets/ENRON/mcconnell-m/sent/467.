Mike-

I received your letter about the JDF just last week, although it was dated 
September 29th.  I would be proud to donate to this cause.  I have commited 
$200 to others for this already, so I will commit $300 to you.  I appreciate 
all of your help with my various fundraising activities, and am happy to help 
with yours.

All the best,

Jay
