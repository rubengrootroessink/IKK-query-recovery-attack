Subject: JDF Fund-raiser


Dear Mike:
I apologize for my tardy response to the JDF Fund-raiser.  The letter went
to my old office at EnergyEcomm.com.  Unfortunately, that office has closed,
and it took a bit of time for the mail service to forward the letter.
Anyway, as they say, "The check is in the mail."
Best of luck in raising funds for such a worthy cause.
Regards,

Bob Laughman
