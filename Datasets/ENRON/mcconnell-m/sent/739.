Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=
=20
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the=20
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new=20
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal=20
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent=20
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, pleas=
e=20
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=

federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=

our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,=20
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and=

track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track=20
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=
. =20
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=

about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =
they=20
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC=
=20
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today - and please=

Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions=

You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and=

Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of thei=

contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to=

the Enron PAC.  The maximum contribution is $5,000 per year per individual.=
