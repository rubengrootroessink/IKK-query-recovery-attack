Good Morning, Mike!

Mark Frevert has requested that we continue our efforts to profile the 
various officers of EA, EGM and EIM in the newsmagazine.  As the Editor of 
the ENSIDE,  I would like to schedule an appointment to interview you.  The 
next issue is set for publication in February and I need only 30 minutes of 
your time.  I have attached some possible topics for us to discuss.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Please call me if you have any questions.
