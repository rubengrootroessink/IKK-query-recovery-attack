Pup,

Mark and I are confirmed with flights.  Chris is not coming.  Where are you
staying, any good hotel ideas.  Mark had a room for 1 night by the stadium
but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around
Miami and therefor  may want to stay closer to the city.  Any thoughts?
When are you guys flying in?

mike
