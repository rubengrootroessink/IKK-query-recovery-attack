Cool,
This is a big deal and a deal we should highlight as an example of our vision 
of the future.  Congratulate the team.

Subject: Oman Spot cargo

FYI, the "Hanjin Muscat"  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake 
Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September

Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 
Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG 
than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an 
additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended.  
I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 thousand
