Attached for your reference and commentary is a first draft of a contact list 
to assist in communication of our key efforts globally.  Please make any 
additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and 
return to my office for update and distribution.  The goal is not to list out 
everyone working on a project or business but to include a couple of players 
if someone needs information about how this could apply to their business.

Thanks,
mike
