Bob,
Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but 
Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If 
they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.

Mike

Mike,

Who should we contact about getting Enron Broadband and Enron Online active
with Interactive Texas (see www.interactivetexas.com)?  With such a broad
cross-section of the state's senior leaders participating, including
Skilling, Interactive Texas is going to be a major event.  We need to make
certain Enron gets early access to exhibit or sponsorship opportunities.

~Bob
