Peter,

Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 
thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would 
suggest you contact 2 people:  Eric Gonzales for LNG activities and possible 
construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG.

Thanks and good luck.

Mike
