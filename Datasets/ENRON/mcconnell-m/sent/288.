Subject: Ongoing Dabhol Task Force calls, starting Wednesday, January 10

We will continue to have a daily Dabhol Task Force Call primarily aimed to 
update the working group team with participation by senior management as they 
deem appropriate. All of you are invited to participate. You may find that 
until major events occur, participating everyday is not useful. Thus, when 
major updates occur, we will send a separate e-mail requesting that all be on 
the phone call. However, all team members working directly on this project 
are expected to attend everyday.

On Wednesday, January 10, we will be discussing outcome of lender meetings in 
New York. 

To assist the India team with finishing our daily meetings and returning back 
to the office or perhaps even allowing time for people to get home before the 
call begins, I am changing the time of the ongoing calls, starting Wednesday, 
January 10, to 8:30pm India, 9:00am Houston.

If there are others to be added to the distribution list for this call, 
please communicate directly with Mrudula Gadade via e-mail.

The dial-in details remain the same: 

888-689-5736 (US)
847-944-7277 (International)
Passcode: 6530874#
