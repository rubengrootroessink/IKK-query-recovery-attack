Mark and David,

David I got your latest comments this morning.  I like them and added the 
correct Enron Net Works changes.  

I will send this to Greg and Jeff immediately to work on the ENW piece, I am 
sure they will add to it and change it.

Thanks,
Mike

PS;  Mark, I haven't seen your draft, what do you think about this one?
