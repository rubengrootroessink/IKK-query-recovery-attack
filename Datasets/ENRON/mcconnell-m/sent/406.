Rick:

I received a message from Mike McConnell yesterday about co-ordination in  
the middle east. I think ur experiences with EBS relate to some people who 
may have visited ur region before I took over. I do not think that u will 
have a problem working with Anil. He understands the sensitivities and has 
worked in the Middle East earlier for over 5 years. I have asked him to 
co-ordinate with ur team. Pls help him get started.

Sanjay

Subject: EBS business development in the Middle East

Dear Rick,

You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.

Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 

I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.

We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.

With best regards,   Anil

Subject: Conference call regarding Middle East EBS support

Mac,

You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;

Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.

I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 


With best regards,   Anil
