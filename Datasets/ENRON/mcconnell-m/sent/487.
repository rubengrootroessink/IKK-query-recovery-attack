Virginia,
Thanks for the email.  Go ahead and send it unframed.  I don't  remember what 
the frame looked like so it will probably be easier to send without.  For my 
later reference, how much do you charge for framing?
Mike

Dear Mike:

I wanted to let you know the status of your artwork, "The Blue Note."  We
should receive the artwork in-house latest Friday.  By the middle of this week
I should know the exact edition number for you.  I will keep you updated.  Do
you want us to frame the artwork here or ship it to you unframed?

Warmest regards,

Virginia Repasky
