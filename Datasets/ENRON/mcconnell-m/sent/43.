We did fall apart in baseball this year.  We are not a 1 sport team we are 
the sport team.  Football is just a tad more important then the others.  On 
last count our 7 national championships in "the" sport does add up.  By the 
way, we hold 2 national championships today, football and the mighty women's 
softball.

Stellar in the eyes of the WSU graduating class of '76.  I am not sure that 
Enron (or myself for that matter) hold the same opinion.

The Shockers current sports program sucks, but fortunately for Enron the WSU 
graduating class of '76 had some stellar students.

As I read the USA Today on the plane back to God's country last evening, I 
noticed something very surprising.  The mighty Bucks were the #2 seed in 
their region.  Mysteriously absent were the Shockers and Sooners.  Doug, I 
guess you can still look forward to bowling season.  Mike, it is down to a 
one sport school.  

Go Bucks!
