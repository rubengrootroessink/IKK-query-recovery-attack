Doug, other than the worst greens of all time, i was very impressed with the 
course.  The layout of the front nine was outstanding.  10,11,13 were long 
and hard.  We shot 6 under and had a great time.  I bought a new odyssey 
putter and love it.

You guys did a nice job on the course.

mike

I understand from Battaglia you played Memorial Park the other day. Other 
than the terrible greens, did you enjoy it?
