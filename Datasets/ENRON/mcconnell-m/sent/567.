Subject: EOL Trades - August

 August EOL EmissionsTrades exceeded projections and posted another record 
trade month. We continue to show signs of strong trade growth and gaining 
market share. I am hopeful that Arizona Public Service & Conectiv will use 
the system more heavily in the future (hedge option trades) and that we can 
obtain at least one new counterparty a month vis-.-vis EOL marketing/and or 
our own internal marketing.  Our gain in market share has not gone 
unchallenged. Bloombergs Powermatch system has been more active in the last 
month and bid/ask spreads continue to narrow. To combat this we continue to 
show (90% of the time) the tightest markets and obviously offer a cost 
advantage over the Broker market & Bloomberg.   The increase in EOL volume 
has increased liquidity in the whole market.  I am hopeful that overall 
market volumes continue to grow as we get closer to compliance.


Number of Trades: 77
Number of Allowances: 192,500
Approx. Notional Trade Value: $28,875,000
