Actually, I believe that may be correct.  I verified it in the new book by 
Tom Osborn,  How OU dominated my coaching career - my only losing record in 
Coaching.  It was a best seller.

Excuse me, but I can't remember who it was who handed Oklahoma their worst 
loss in history. Could it be the ............HUSKERS?

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.
