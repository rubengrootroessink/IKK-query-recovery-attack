Elise,

Thanks for the email.  In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron 
Global Markets.  I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed 
it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).  Please remove me 
from your email list for further HTC events.

Thanks and good luck,
mike
