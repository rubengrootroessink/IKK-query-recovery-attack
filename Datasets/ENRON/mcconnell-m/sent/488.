Doug,

Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during 
the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group 
doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are 
provided as a service to save money. By the way, saving money is real money 
to Enron.   Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can 
put it in context?

Thanks,
Mike
