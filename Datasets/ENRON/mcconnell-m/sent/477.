Subject: A little catch up

Mike,

This weekend, Cole, my thirteen year old, and I attended the birthday party 
for Dorothy's five year old daughter, Caitland. What ever happended to the 
saying " the more things change, the more they remain the same"?  Things have 
definitely not stayed the same.

Anyway, Dorothy asked about you and I encouraged her to call you, and I think 
she will.

JMoore
