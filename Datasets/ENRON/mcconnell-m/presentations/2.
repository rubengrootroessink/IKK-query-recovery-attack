FYI---attached is a copy of the slides I used for my recent speech in Saudi.  
Speech was well received by those pushing for privatization in Saudi (Crown 
Prince's office, Gas Initiative committee, etc) but met with resistance frome 
the entrenched monopolists (ARAMCO, Saudi Electric, Saudi Water etc.)  
Similar dynamics as japan.

Had a very good meeting with the Head of ARAMCO---Harvard educated, very 
competent executive but with some real constraints being imposed on him.  I 
will see him again soon now that I know him---there may be some cool 
service-related opportuniites for us within ARAMCO that could be big.  It 
won't cost us much in time or money to find out.
