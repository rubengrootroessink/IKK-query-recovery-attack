Attached is the update for today, which corresponds with my voicemail that I 
left this evening.  I should have more content gathered for tomorrow's 
update.  

Also as an FYI, I did email the draft of the New Orientation presentation (on 
a blue background) to Celeste for review first thing this AM.  

I will be in touch.
