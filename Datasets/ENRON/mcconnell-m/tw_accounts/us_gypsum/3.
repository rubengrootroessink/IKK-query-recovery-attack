Rob,

After reviewing the current status of United States Gypsum Company and Transwestern's status as a creditor of Administrative Claims, we will not proceed in seeking the additional $455,300 letter of credit (worth approximately 8 months of reservation charges).  The current letter of credit valued at $227,650 is sufficient.

Also, our timing for the completion of the Red Rock Expansion that will make this capacity available is still on schedule for June 1, 2002.  In our latest discussions with SOCAL, they have indicated that their expansion of the SOCAL Needles delivery point will be completed by that time.  It would probably be best for you to discuss this with them yourself to verify its availability completely and thoroughly.

Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Best regards,

      Mark
