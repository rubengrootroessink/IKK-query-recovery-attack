FYI.  Note that in spite of the positive report, the Dabho breakwater is 
still seriously behind schedule and, unless something changes radically, we 
will be entering the 2002 monsoon period with only about two-thirds of the 
breakwater complete.  DPC may not be able to take its 2002 volumes and will 
either face take-or-pay or (hopefully) force3 majuere relief if the 
breakwater delay can be attributed to construction force majeure.

This will be both a problem and an opportunity for us, because we may be able 
to get access to the DPC ship (if lenders permit it) and to cargoes to be 
remarketid on behalf of DPC.

Todd,

Thanks for the note. We are looking forward to seeing you when you visit
Muscat.

I was in Nagaski last week for the naming ceremony of Osaka Gas ship (LNG
Jamal. I managed also to see (from a distance) the Lakshmi under
construction. Quite impressive.

Please copy your messages to Mr. Sakaguchi (hiro.h.sakaguchi@olng.simis.com)
who is now looking after Sales section and will be in charge of ship shore
and implementation issues between OLNG and DPC. He is taking over from Toyo
Saito who is leaving us by end of the month.

Thanks


Harib Al Kitani
