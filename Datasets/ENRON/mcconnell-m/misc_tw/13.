=09Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing=20
=09Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price inde=
x for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based E=
nergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the William=
s uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, me=
asuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, nat=
ural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel an=
d jet fuel.=20
=09The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spo=
t uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly a=
nd monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feat=
ure Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of =
Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive sit=
e, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the ec=
onomy has on energy.=20
=09Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and W=
illiams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own marke=
t activity. It also has been reviewed by the Energy Information Administrat=
ion, said Williams. To view the site, visit www.williams-ue.com.=20
