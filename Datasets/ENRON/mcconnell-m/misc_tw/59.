The attached spreadsheet breaks out scheduled volumes West of Thoreau for the period May, 2000 through October, 2001.  
The first tab of the spreadsheet breaks out the volumes by month; the second tab is a summary for the reporting period.  

Please note, for the reporting period, there were some scheduled receipts.  These have been listed separately and can be easily removed if necessary.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Mark
