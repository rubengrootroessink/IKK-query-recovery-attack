Mark and Paul,  

I would be happy to call in with you on your first "on call" weekend if you would like.  Mark, your weekend comes up this next weekend, I will plan to call in on Sat and Sun with you.  Alma will send you an email with the total list of everyone calling in including the phone number to dial into.  Make sure you locate this list prior to the weekend.  Remember, call in about 5-7 minutes before 8:00am Sat and Sun.

Thanks, Kim.

I have updated the TW on call schedule to include Mark and Paul.  Please let me know if anyone has a conflict.  (I left the holiday weekends as they were.)
