Yes, although it's no big deal to leave it in.

Do you prefer that I take out the added language for future agreements?

Bill,

Attached is the confidentiality agreement that we are signing with Aquila.  It was originated out of our legal group but Aquila added:

	2. 	(iv)
	7.  	"for a period of two years."

I would like to use it for Reliant too.  Any problem with that?  Please let me know.

Mark
