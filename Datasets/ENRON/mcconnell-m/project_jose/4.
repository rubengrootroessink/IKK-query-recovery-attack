FYI.  

Do not get overly excited about these number as things are moving 
significantly on the back end of the curve (i.e. be very conservative given 
MTM issues, credit reserves, etc.).  As we have indicated this deal is a 
company maker.  We thoroughly understand the PDVSA reserve issue and this is 
our number one priority to resolve.

Thanks again for taking the time to join us on our trip to Ven.  As we are in 
a critical stage of the deal, we will begin providing you a weekly progress 
report on the deal.

Regards,
Eric
