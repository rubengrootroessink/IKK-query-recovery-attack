Mike,

Just wanted to close the loop with you on this topic.  Attached is a brief 
conclusion and recommendation memo that I prepared for Eric Gonzales that 
sets out the issues I have previously briefly discussed with you.  I have 
discussed this with Frevert who is fine with it and at his request I have 
verbally advised Duke LNG of our position.  There is also a meeting scheduled 
with them on June 7 that I will be attending with Mark, so I don't think the 
letter referenced in the memo will be necessary at this point.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call me at X-52709.

Neal
