Mike,

Enjoyed seeing you at the Masters and hope we can do it again in 2002.

I've taken the liberty to attach below the name of an individual who has a
distinguished business career and since leaving Pittston as an executive VP
in 1998, has started his on fund as well as developing other business
ventures.  He is very well connected and highly regarded in the Wall Street
financial community.

I don't know where it may lead but I am of the opinion it would be of
benefit for you both to at least have a discussion and explore
opportunities.

I look forward to your next visit to BMR and also hearing the outcome of
your discussion with Gary.

Regards, Ed Bolton
