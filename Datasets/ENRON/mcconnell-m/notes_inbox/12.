We had 425 registered attendees, and the overall feedback has been very
positive. We trust that you will share the same view after watching the

Finally, I remind you that i2 is offering significant discounts for any

PS For your information, here is the link to a press release published
yesterday, which describes the value that On Semiconductor (formerly
Motorola Semi) has obtained by deploying the "Intelligent SCM" course to
support their worldwide master planning and demand fulfillment optimization
program. It is a perfect illustration of the themes discussed during the
webcast.
