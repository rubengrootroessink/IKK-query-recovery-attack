Mike and Jeff:

1- I have been working with Chris Mahoney to secure some real estate on the 
Global Markets Floor in London. We will have 10 seats behind the crude team.
2- Alex McLeish will manage London and Singapore crude and products 
fundamentals. 
3- Brad Hitch will have responsibility for organizing  the London coal, 
petchems and lpg fundamentals teams.
4- We will be hiring 3 or 4 summer students (cheaper and more flexibility 
than full time.) Alex McLeish and Andrew Hill have identified several 
candidates from some British schools. Several schools in the UK have an 
energy (petroleum ) specialist program. Andrew will be interviewing some 
candidates  this week.
5- I have asked the following people to manage the following commoties and 
teams:

6- Our first pan-EGM commodity report will be published June 8th. It will 
provide a short term fundamental outlook on all of our commodities.

Jen
