I agree that George is well suited to origination, but he has also spent 
quite a bit of time looking at investment opportunities for Koch in a wide 
variety of industries that they are active in. If EGM is looking at several 
acquisitions, I could see him being the point person for EGM on transactions 
and thus able to relieve some of the burden on the folks focusing on trading. 
However, I know that George is happy at Koch, so it would have to take a very 
exciting opportunity for him to leave, i.e., something where he would feel 
the job was "tailor made" for his skill set. Maybe we don't have something 
like that for him right now.

I have known George since his Bp days. very bright guy would be most useful 
running an origination group don't think he would have any interest other 
than at that type level.

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil
