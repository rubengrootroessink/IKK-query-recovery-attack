EGM has the largest number of trading books in the company with over 500 
active books and despite this you guys do the best job getting worldwide 
information to us in a timely and accurate fashion. (I wish I could get the 
rest of the company to this point). I'm told that the people referenced below 
have contributed in a big way to this effort. Thanks for the effort. Rick

Rick,

Following up on our discussion this morning, Scott Earnest and his staff ( 
including Michelle Bruce) need to be recognized for their outstanding efforts 
in providing timely information to Risk.

Their initiative came along about the same time Jeff Shankman took over 
Global Markets; it enables them to run a same day VaR for worldwide trading ( 
Houston, London and Singapore books are all closed in Houston ) as well as 
for us to to get our "official " information reliably by the the opening of 
business next day.
