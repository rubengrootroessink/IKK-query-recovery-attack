Most of you are familiar with the Impact & Influence program that has been a 
requirement for VP's for the last several years.  This training has been now 
been modified for Manager and Director level employees who directly manage 
and lead teams.

We have many new Managers and Directors in EGM who could benefit from this 
training.  If you have someone that you would like to nominate for the 
program, please respond to me immediately.

Thanks,
Shanna
