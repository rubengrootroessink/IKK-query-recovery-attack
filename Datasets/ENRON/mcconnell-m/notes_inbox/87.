The above reference expense report has been resubmitted to you for changes.  
Please remove the Personal Expense icon from all personal expense entries and 
submit the expense report once again for payment.  Before final submission of 
the report, any line items for which you should be reimbursed should remain 
but all personal expenses should be removed.  Personal expenses do not need 
to be included on your expense report.  The Personal Expense icon is to be 
used only by employees with direct payment of their American Express 
Corporate card.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Thank you,
Kerry Harrington
