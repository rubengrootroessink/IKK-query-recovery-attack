A payment of approximately $9.5-10 mm was due today from GM

Spoke with their office but were told that no instructions for payments were 
made today. 

We have sent them a fax requesting immediate payment and we were told that 
the general manager will call us on Thursday to resolve this situation. 
(Wednesday is a national holiday in Spain).

Will keep you informed of any developments

Anastasia
