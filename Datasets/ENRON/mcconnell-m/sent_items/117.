Howdy Heidi,

Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.  I hope all is well with you and your hubby.

Awfully weird times here in the home office.  Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.  I guess it is the same or similar there too.

The pipeline group is working out.  I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.

Please respond and let me know what you are up to and how you are doing.  I'm so sorry we didn't hook up when you were in town last time.

Mark
