Kim, 

This is my first attempt at providing bullets.  Let me know if you want them in a different style/etc...


Agave hook up - Agreement and amendment letter created as blessed by legal.  Currently circulating through other key departments.  To be sent out early next week.

Trans Pecos - Economics and design being redrafted to look at a 350,000 MMBtu/d pipe.  After numbers are worked, we will reapproach PEMEX

Southern Trails - A nonbinding bid is being put together for ~$5-7million.  The bid letter is in legal and is due on Monday.  Are main push at this point is to get into the data room
