Christian,

How's it going in Brazil?  I know you are happy to be back.

I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business.  I'm working for the pipeline group.  The people here are very nice and I'm glad to be back in this industry.  Although, I must say that I will miss London and working with people like yourself.

I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day.  Do you happen to know his email address?  Please let me know.

I hope all is well down south.

Mark
