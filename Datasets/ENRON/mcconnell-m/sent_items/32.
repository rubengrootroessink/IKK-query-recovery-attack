Yeah,  Baylor this weekend and Nebraska next.  This Baylor game is coming at the right time.  Good luck with Colorado.

I think he is probably making the right call; however, y'all are rolling right now and haven't lost this year.  I'm not sure it is wise to tweak the machine now....then again, you can't argue with a coach on a 19 game winning streak.

Is the OU/NU game next weekend?

Man I hear you.  I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.  On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.  It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.

Be careful with this...I think you saw what can happen last year with us.
