Marissa,

Hey!  Just thinking about you.  I hope all is well out west.  Things here are sure interesting.  You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.  I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.  This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).  Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.  We should find out pretty soon.

I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.  He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.  It seems to be right up his ally.  He asked me to tell you hello.

Sarah and I took vacation last week.  I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.  It was fun.

Please write back and let me know how you are doing.  How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.

Mark
