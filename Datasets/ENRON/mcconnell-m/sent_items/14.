Pat,

Howdy!!!!

What is going on?  I heard from Erica that she may have some decisions to make soon.  Are you going through the same thing?  I'm interested to know.

I heard from Andy Maus last week.  He is doing some contract work for Enron.  He and his family are enjoying Denver.

Please call or email me.

I hope all is well.

Mark
