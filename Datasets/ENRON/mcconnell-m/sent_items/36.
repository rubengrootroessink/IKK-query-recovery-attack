Erica,

It sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation (I wouldn't have guessed otherwise).  The fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want.  Sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is.  I truly wish you the best and I certainly want to know where you place yourself.

Oh, I heard from Andy.  They have settled in Denver and he is still looking for a job but he may do some contract work for Enron.  I'm not sure how definite it is or what he'll be doing.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Mark
