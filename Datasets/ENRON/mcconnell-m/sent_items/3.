Mark,

I hope you have enjoyed your time working in Europe as much as I did.  I have recently made a switch and I left the broadband group and joined the Transwestern Pipeline Marketing team.

I'll talk to you later,

Mark

Subject: Resume Update


Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.
