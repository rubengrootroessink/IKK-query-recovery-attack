Martina,

Howdy from Texas.

I am writing to see if you know where Christian has landed since the reorg. of EBS.  I'm glad to see you still have an Enron address.  

I was telling a friend about our trip to Denmark and that museum that we saw there.  

Please let me know if you know where Christian is.

Hope all is well,

Mark
