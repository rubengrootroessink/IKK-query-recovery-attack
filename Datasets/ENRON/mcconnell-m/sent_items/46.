Greg,
 
Welcome to Enron!  
 
 
We will immediately start the "development" program to instill the Enron viewpoint....We are the best and brightest employees and we are better and smarter than any company in the world.  We are the elite.
 
Just kidding.  I look forward to seeing you in the elevator banks.
 
Mark
