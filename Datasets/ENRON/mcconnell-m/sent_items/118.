Pipeline: The proposed location would connect to TW's Leedy Lateral, this gas goes to Ivanhoe Dehy. then routes to Bushton processing.  All of our lines are mainlines; however, it is fair to say that the Leedy Lateral gas quality can be compared to that of gathering gas quality (dehydration is required).  The capacity at the Ivanhoe dehy needs to be checked to see if additional capacity would be available for the quantity that you have in mind.

Pressure:  MAOP of Leedy Lateral varies from 1125 to 1200 psi.  Operating pressures in the past year have been between 650 and 950 psig.

Cost: Approximate 4 on 16 hot tap costs would be between $60-75K.  We can price measuring/regulating facilities when expected volume is provided to Planning.

Questions

What would it cost?
Is it a Mainline or Gathering line that runs right by this well?
What is the TW line pressure?

Can I get an answer to the last 2 questions pretty quickly (by Wednesday Afternoon)?  The cost can come later.

Thanks, 

Mark
