Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.

Boomer Sooner,

Mark

Great game.  Until somebody beats y'all, you should be number one as far as I am concerned.  Great play by Roy Williams.  I couldn't believe how poorly both teams ran the football...and for that matter how poor both offenses looked.  I will say that both defenses looked tough.  It was tough to watch the collapse in the final two minutes.

I love our staff, but unfortunately, I think we were outcoached.  That being said, Bob Stoops could be the luckiest coach in the world....everything seems to fall his way.  He is a great coach.

Take care and I guess I am stuck waithing another 363 days.

GO HORNS!
Zac
