Thanks for the pics.  She is adorable!  I always enjoy getting them.

I'm heading to Norman to watch the OU/KSU game.  We finally get to see how good we are.

Mark

Here are some recent pictures of Isabella.  Can't see her teeth but she has
two on bottom and 1 1/2 on top.  She's walking/running everywhere.  Lots of
fun
