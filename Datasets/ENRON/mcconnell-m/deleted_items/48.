Politics this week
October 18th 2001
From The Economist print edition 



The war continues
	
		
	
	
	

 EPA <http://www.economist.com/images/20011020/4201WW1.jpg>America continued its military action against Afghanistan using bombers and AC-130 gunships which can be used against ground troops gathered in small numbers. Observers said that this suggested that use of America's own ground forces was imminent.

See article: Nation-bruising, nation-building <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31020_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_32>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The Taliban seized two UN warehouses with more than half the World Food Programme's aid for Afghanistan. One was restored to UN control the next day.

Panic swept America after a letter containing anthrax was sent to Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader of the Senate (the third confirmed incident of anthrax by post); more than 30 people in Mr Daschle's office tested positive for exposure to the bacterium. The House of Representatives will close for nearly a week for a security sweep. The FBI said it had had some 3,000 false anthrax alarms. Elsewhere, Kenya reported receipt of at least one letter contaminated with anthrax.

See article: Anthrax isn't contagious; anxiety is <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31019_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_3a>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Bayer undertook to triple production of Cipro, the only antibiotic approved for the treatment of anthrax. Tommy Thompson, America's health and human services secretary, declared that he would seek funds to lay in enough supplies to treat 12m people for 60 days.

The outcome of the Democratic primary in New York city was put in doubt after a recount was ordered. The race had appeared to be won by Mark Green, the city's public advocate. His rival for the nomination, Fernando Ferrer, has retracted his concession.

See article: To run is to lose <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31018_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_39>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Cuba reacted angrily to Russia's announcement that it will close its remaining spy-base on the Caribbean island, saying no agreement had been reached. The Cubans accused President Vladimir Putin of wanting to give "a special present" to George Bush, his new-found ally against terrorism.

Mike Harris, the powerful premier of Ontario, Canada's biggest province, resigned.

Fed up with a long recession and threats of budget-balancing austerity, Argentina's voters gave their Alliance government a walloping in congressional elections.

See article: Calling for change-but in which direction? <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31017_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_38> 

Australia said it would send 1,550 troops, along with military hardware, to join the American operation in Afghanistan.


Assassination in Israel

Rehavam Zeevi, Israel's far-right minister of tourism, was assassinated by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in revenge for the earlier killing of the group's leader. Ariel Sharon said he held Yasser Arafat responsible, though the Palestinian Authority was quick to condemn the killing and arrested several PFLP men. Six of Mr Zeevi's right-wing colleagues, who with him had been at the point of resigning from the governing coalition, said they would give Mr Sharon a chance to show toughness.

See article: Which way will Ariel Sharon go now? <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31016_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_37>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak ordered that 170 suspected Islamic militants, who had long been held without trial, should go before a military court at once.

Police in Malawi arrested a leading opposition politician on charges of treason relating to a failed coup. Brown Mpinganjira was a founding member of President Bakili Muluzi's ruling party, but formed his own party, the National Democratic Alliance, partly to oppose the president's efforts to win a third term in office.

A report on mortality rates revealing that AIDS is the biggest killer in South Africa was finally released. The government had delayed publication of the Medical Research Council's report, while the official statistics agency sought to pick holes in its findings.


Re-starting Europe's heart

Governments in both France and Germany started to revise plans to pep up their slowing economies. Leaks from Germany's finance ministry revealed that estimated GDP growth for next year is now 1.5%, down from a previous official guess of 2.25%. Laurent Fabius,France's finance minister, proposed a budget for next year that would double tax-credits for the low paid and give help to investors.

Tensions between France's Socialist-led government and its conservative president rose with the publication of a "tell all" book by Olivier Schrameck, the prime minister's closest aide.

In Italy, conflicting attitudes to America's bombing of Afghanistan threw the opposition on the left into disarray. The main ex-Communist party and the centre-left alliance's current leader, Francesco Rutelli, were in favour, but two still-Communist parties, the Greens and some centre-left Christian Democrats were against.

Tension rose in Georgia and its Russian-backed breakaway statelet, Abkhazia, where skirmishes continued and Chechens helped the Georgians. Meanwhile, over Chechnya itself, Russians and Chechens were said to be putting out peace feelers through intermediaries.

See article: Dangerous relations <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31022_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_34>

Greece's centre-left prime minister, Costas Simitis, was re-elected as leader of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, known as Pasok. 


Unco-operative

With hours to go before the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Shanghai, the host, China, still rejected Taiwan's plan to send former Vice-President Li Yuan-zu. But Presidents Bush and Putin were on their way. APEC's foreign ministers signed a declaration condemning terrorism.

See article: China's disappointment <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31021_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_33>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The Indian government approved legislation to combat terrorism, making it compulsory to pass information about terrorist activities to the authorities.

See article: Crossing the line <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31024_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_36>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

India shelled Pakistani positions across the line of control in Kashmir, the most serious outbreak of hostilities for almost a year. A visit by America's secretary of state, Colin Powell, did nothing to resolve tensions.

See article: Remember Kashmir <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31023_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_35>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Singapore's government called a general election for November 3rd. It could have waited until August next year.

The prime minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, offered a "heartfelt apology" to South Korea for his country's actions during the occupation of the peninsula and the second world war.
