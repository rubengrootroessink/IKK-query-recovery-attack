                      RECRUITING: JUCO LB says OU will be tough to beat
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001

                      The latest on San Francisco junior college linebacker
Lance Mitchell's visit to
                      Norman


                     LANCE MITCHELL, MLB, 6'3, 243, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C,
CALIFORNIA:

                     JH: How did your visit to OU this weekend go?

                     LM: Oklahoma was real good and I had a great time.
Oklahoma has a need for
                     linebackers and that is important to me. The people
were great and the town was
                     super. Being from LA, many people told me that I
wouldn't like a small town like
                     Norman, but that wasn't true. Norman seems to be a
great town and a great town
                     that I could live in. My host was Roy Williams and he
is a great guy. He showed us
                     a little Cali love!

                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?

                     LM: I loved the defensive scheme. I loved the people
that were on the field that
                     would be back if I went to Oklahoma. I liked the
coaches and how they went about
                     their business. I think I would fit in real well with
them.

                     JH: What did you think of the way OU plays it's middle
linebacker?

                     LM: It is designed for that player in the middle to
make the plays. Either you do or
                     you don't, but you have every opportunity to make the
plays.

                     JH: Roy Williams was the host, how did you enjoy our
visit with him?

                     LM: Roy was pretty depressed about the game, but I was
pretty mad to. We went
                     to a party that night and just hung out. We didn't do
all that much, but we had a
                     great time, because he was such a great guy and all the
players we met were
                     super. Roy is a super person and so are the rest of the
guys as well.

                     JH: Did you come close to committing to OU?

                     LM: I promised my mom I wouldn't commit and I didn't,
but I really enjoyed the
                     visit. However, if signing day was tomorrow I would
sign with OU. OU is out in front
                     of the schools that I have visited thus far. I was
supposed to visit Texas this
                     weekend, but that changed, because they will play for
the Big 12 title. However, I
                     don't know if I am going to visit Texas or not, because
I am finding out they have
                     a lot more depth and commitments than they have been
telling me about. I will
                     visit Florida on December 14th.

                     JH: What did you think of the game?

                     LM: Being a fellow football player I can tell when the
better team isn't winning. That
                     is what happened Saturday. The offense never really got
it going and that happens
                     sometimes. You can't leave your defense on the field
for the whole game. If OU
                     played them 10 times I am not sure OU wouldn't win the
next ten. I my opinion,
                     OU played a bunch of cheerleaders and lost, but it
won't happen again.

                     JH: What did you think of the atmosphere?

                     LM: It's was great and I would love to play in front of
that.

                     JH: Would it take a super visit from one of the teams
ahead for you not
                     to come to OU?

                     LM: I am a shy guy, yet I had so much fun there. The
people were just so nice to
                     me and made me relax and be myself. That is so
important to me and OU has that
                     naturally. can't see anybody beating OU at this point.

                      RECRUITING: Jackson enjoys visit to Norman
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001

                      Junior college linebacker Pasha Jackson talks about
his trip to Norman this
                      weekend


                     PASHA JACKSON, SLB, 6'3, 235, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C.,
CALIFORNIA:

                     JH: How was your trip to OU?

                     PJ: The trip was excellent, even though they had a
tough game. The chemistry
                     between players and coaches was excellent. I loved
everything about the trip,
                     except for the game, because I was wanting Oklahoma to
win. I really enjoyed
                     watching Coach (Brent) Venables because he is a very
intense, positive guy and I
                     like that. I could tell he is a great coach, which
means a lot to me, because I will
                     be spending most of my time with him.

                     JH: Did Lance like the trip as well?

                     PJ: Lance and I talked about the trip all the way back
on the plane. He had nothing
                     but positive things to say about OU as well. We both
feel that we both can see
                     nothing but positives about both us going to OU.

                     JH: Did you almost commit to OU on the trip?

                     PJ: OU made committing more tempting that any other
visit thus far. We were
                     close to committing, but I feel I need to take my other
visits so that I know for
                     sure who my best school is going to be. I am not
committing, but OU is looking
                     pretty good. Without question they are the best school
that we have visited thus
                     far.

                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?

                     PJ: I like OU's defense. I feel I would fit in at the
SLB position when they are in
                     their standard defense, but I can also play in their
nickel. Because I can play in the
                     nickel and have a linebacker type body on the field,
that would help their run
                     support, which is important in a conference like the
Big 12. It would enhance the
                     defense, because I am a bigger and stronger player, yet
I can easily help in pass
                     coverage.

                     JH: What did you think of Norman?

                     PJ: A lot of my people are from Louisiana and the
surrounding area, so I know
                     about that part of the country. Granted, Norman is not
like Los Angeles, but it is
                     not small town either. You can have a lot of fun in
Norman and have a good quality
                     of life. The people are real down to earth and are very
nice. When Lance and I
                     went to your radio show the people were so down to
earth that it touched us,
                     because they were so kind to two total strangers. I
could easily live in Norman.

                     JH: What is up next for you in recruiting?

                     PJ: I am going to visit my next two schools, which are
Arizona and South Carolina,
                     but going into those visits OU is way out in front.

                      BASKETBALL RECRUITING: Kevin Bookout update
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 25, 2001

                      The latest on six-foot-seven Stroud power forward
Kevin Bookout


                     KEVIN BOOKOUT, 6'7, STROUD, OKLAHOMA:

                     There is still nothing official to report on whether
Bookout signed with OU or not.
                     Bookout told me tonight he will make an official
statement on the subject
                     Wednesday or Thursday.

                     Here are my thoughts from what I have been able to
gather as facts.

                     1) I have no doubts that Bookout is going to be a
Sooner. The question is in which
                     sport ? basketball or track ? or both? I believe that
Bookout has singed with the
                     OU basketball program, but what I don't know is if OU
has turned in the papers or
                     not.

                     2) The reason that I am not sure if the papers are in
or not is because Bookout is
                     struggling with the question of just competing in track
or playing both basketball
                     and track in college. Plus, there has been no official
announcement. If OU never
                     turns in the papers, then it is just like he didn't
sign.

                     3) If Bookout just decides to pursue track and field at
OU then he needs to sign a
                     scholarship with the OU track program, because you must
participate with the
                     program you sign with your freshman season. If he is
going to play both sports at
                     OU then OU hoops will turn in those scholarship papers
if they can, or they will
                     resign him in the spring.

                     4) The U.S.A. Olympic committee is putting a lot of
pressure on Bookout to just
                     compete in track and field. They don't care if he goes
to OU or not, but they want
                     him to just concentrate on the shot and discus. They
certainly have Bookout's ear
                     at the moment. However, he has told the OU basketball
coaches several times
                     over the past few days that he wants to play basketball
and then he talks to U.S.A.
                     Track and gets confused.

                     5) I believe when this is all said and done that
Bookout will play both sports at OU.
                     It may mean that he has to resign with OU hoops again
in the spring, but then
                     again maybe the fact he has already signed in the fall
will count in some way. So,
                     this isn't totally in the books yet, except that I know
Bookout is going to OU. I just
                     don't know if it is to play both basketball and
track-and-field or just participate in
                     track.
