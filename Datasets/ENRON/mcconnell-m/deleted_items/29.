The following 2 scenarios were run and meet our return requirements.
The total volume of 306 comes from the 240 suggested starting volumes
and the additional volumes come from expiring El Paso/MGI transportation
agreements.

_______________________________

1)  306 total volume

*	240 @ $.2479 for yrs 1-15
*	26 @ $.2479 for yrs 3-15
*	40 @ $.2479 for yrs 4-15

2)  306 total volume

*	240 @ $.2600 for yrs 1-15
*	26 @ $.1883 for yrs 3-15
*	40 @ $.1883 for yrs 4-15
_______________________________


We would suggest Showing PEMEX either scenario but using the round
numbers of $.25 (instead of $.2479) for scenario 1 and $.19 (instead of
$.1883) for scenario 2.

Please let me know if you have a preference.  We would like to fax one
of these scenarios to Jorge @ 3:00 today so that they can digest it and
use it for a starting point for tomorrow's meeting.

Call me if you have any questions.
