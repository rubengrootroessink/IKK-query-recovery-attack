Hi, Mark!

We've improved the Classmates newsletter!

Now the Classmates newsletter is better than ever.
Every issue has a customized listing of all your
friends and classmates who have recently registered
with Classmates. That means finding your friends is
as easy as checking your email. Here's a sneak peek:

Westfield High School
166 new classmates have joined.
View these classmates now!
