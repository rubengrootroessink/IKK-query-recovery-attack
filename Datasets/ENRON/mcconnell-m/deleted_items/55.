St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 




This Sunday, October 14, volunteers for the Habitat Project will be recognized during each of the three services at St. Paul's.  Please be sure to attend, and show your support for Habitat for Humanity and for the Ministries of St. Paul's. 

If you are registered to drive the church vans and are willing to do so for one or more Saturdays during the build, please let Noel Chang know.  We have reserved the 15 passenger van for each work day.  It will leave the church parking lot at 8 AM on each Saturday morning.  Please note Noel's correct email (unless I get it wrong again) is "changang@swbell.net", or you can reach him at 281-461-4709 evenings. 

I received a number of changes to the October 20 schedule.  Attached you will find a revised schedule for the 20th as well as for the following week.  As always, let me know if additional changes are needed. 

See you Sunday!
