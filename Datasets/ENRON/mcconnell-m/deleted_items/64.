Sooner defense dominates, Longhorn comedy continues.

by AL ESCHBACH

What more can you say about this Oklahoma defense? It has gotten to the
point where onlookers are disappointed when the defense gives up a first
down. And when someone drives the field for a touchdown, people are almost
amazed.

"We played okay against Texas Tech. I think we can play better," said
co-defensive coordinator Mike Stoops. Come on, Mike! Your unit held the
high-powered Red Raider attack to single-digit first downs. That's two
straight games Stoops' defense has done it.

Roy Williams is the best college football player in the country. He is such
a disruptive force. Williams is the best defensive back ever to play at OU.
Just ask Barry Switzer. Williams keeps on coming up with big plays after big
play.

The OU coaching staff wasn't very happy the Texas players showed up in
Lubbock to give their support to the Red Raiders. And just how did they get
those tickets right behind the Sooner bench? The Sooners have said
repeatedly they haven't been shown any respect from the Longhorns.

There are stories coming out of Austin these days that Texas is the best
team in the country and they are being shafted by the BCS. Hey guys, did you
forget the teams played earlier this year in the Cotton Bowl?

The OU-Texas rivalry is now becoming a rivalry of hatred much like it was in
the Barry Switzer/Darrell Royal eras. Royal could never understand why Texas
high school players would go to Oklahoma. Maybe it was the fact Switzer was
a lot better recruiter.

And while on the subject of recruiting in Texas, the Longhorns may have
moved into the lead on Lancaster defensive end Larry Dibbles. This talented
player made an unofficial visit to Austin last week. For the first time OU
didn't get a good feel from Dibbles when they talked to him on the
telephone.

But a lot of things can change once OU gets these Texas recruits on campus.
The Longhorns have a big edge bringing them in for unofficial trips during
their home games.
