Hi all,
I currently have two rescue's I'm looking for homes for.

The most urgent situation is a dog in Dallas, Riley.
He is 4.5 years.  Must be the only pet, and go to a home
without children.  The ideal situation would be an older,
settled couple, or person.  Riley was abused and is a
terrified dog.  He needs to have a home with a yard, because
as of now, he can't go for a walk.  He shuts down if he
sees another dog, a person, a car... anything unfamiliar.
I'm sure the right person could build his confidence back,
but for now, he needs a very secure environment.  
I need to find Riley a home by this Sunday!  And, he can't
be shipped.  I do have a picture of him.

My other rescue is Jessie.  I still haven't found a home
for her.  But, she is not so urgent.  Jessie also needs to
be the only pet, she terrorized the other two dogs she 
used to live with.  It's possible she was abused, she
doesn't trust anyone, and will growl at you.  She needs
to go to a home without children, I can't take a chance 
with her actually being pushed to the point of biting.
She is getting along fine with Jazz and Shasta, but I keep
thinking she is going to start feeling comfortable one of
these days, and our smooth times will be over!  Jessie will
need someone with lot's of patience, and who has time to
work with her.  She needs rules, and someone to enforce them.
She is a pretty dominant little gal.  

If anyone has any suggestions, call me: 832-358-9842, or 
email me:  ccamp@pdq.net

Thanks,
Cindy
