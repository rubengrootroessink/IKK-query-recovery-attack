All - 

I have had a wonderful time working with each of you over the course of the last year on various projects here at EBS.  But it is time that I move on to the next phase of my business and personal life.  Today is my last day here in the office.  I wish all of you the best of luck in your endeavors.

I would love to keep in touch and hope that you feel the same.  My e-mail address is marksolana@yahoo.com.  As most of you know, my next career opportunity is most likely going to involve a relocation to the San Francisco area (I should know definitively by next Friday July 27th).  I'll forward additional contact information for out there once I am settled.

Hope to hear from you in the future.
