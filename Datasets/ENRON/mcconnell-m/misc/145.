Mark:  Greetings.  I'm glad to hear that you might make it to the Steve Couch Memorial Golf Tournament this Friday.  If you want to play, we have a place for you.  We will either put you with a team that needs a fourth, or simply put you on a foursome if other teams are filled.  I know that Brad Schick is in the same boat that your are, so I'm looking for a team for him also.  Whatever we do, we will find a place for you.  I hope you can get off work and join us.  Please let me know if Dial's team needs you or you find a spot on another team.  I look forward to seeing you Friday.   - Donnie
