Hey Mark,  (as they used to say in London)

You're right: i came down here in the beginning of the month and I am now slowly setting up shop down here in wonderful Rio de Janeiro.   Things are going well, but the jobsearch is not gonna be easy now that we are facing a worldwide recession.

I saw that Enron took a huge beating today after some SEC inquiry.  Nasty stuff, if you ask me.  From being the darling on Wall Street, we are now back to being the ugly duckling (old Danish fairytale, of course).
 
I can understand that your are happy about being out of EBS, ?cos it seemed like you were often stuck between a rock and a hard place.  Maybe the pipeline business is a little safer....maybe.   Anyway, I'd like to say that it was also a great pleasure to work with you: it's refreshing to work with somebody stable, smart and trustworthy.  

I did meet up with Martin briefly as he joined in for my goodbye party in London.  His e-mail address is mjoergensen@netlane.com <mailto:mjoergensen@netlane.com>     He also has quite an uphill struggle in front of him:  looking to start up a sort of recruiting company that exploits the differences in wages between eastern and western telecomengineers.   With wife and three kids waiting at home, it's not a position that I envy him, frankly.
 
Well, young man.  Take care with strange looking envelopes containing white sugar etc.   If you feel that it's getting too crazy up there, you know that you will always have a place to stay in calm (!) Rio de Janeiro.

Christian, 
How's it going in Brazil? I know you are happy to be back. 
I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business. I'm 
working for the pipeline group. The people here are very nice and I'm 
glad to be back in this industry. Although, I must say that I will miss 
London and working with people like yourself. 
I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day. Do you happen to 
know his email address? Please let me know. 
I hope all is well down south. 
Mark
