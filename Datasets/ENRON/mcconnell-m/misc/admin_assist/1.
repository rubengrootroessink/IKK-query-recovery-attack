Raquel - 

Please find attached the approved vacation rollover for the employees that were designated as "problems" at year end.

Thank you in advance for getting this straightened out.  

Note that all time is listed in hours assuming 8 hours is one work day and that 40 hours is one work week.




Thank you!
