 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE][IMAGE]=09    Sarah -   Wow! It's a good =
 thing we evaluated the diversification of your overall  investment portfol=
io. Withdrawing funds last fall really threw your  portfolio out of proper =
allocation. You currently have a large  portion of your portfolio in one as=
set class...U.S. large cap  stocks. No harm done in the short term, the lon=
g term could be a  different story, however.   We would like to see you  mo=
ve your Coopers account to TD Waterhouse. Is that  possible? As you know th=
e selection of funds is much broader, and we  could do a much better job of=
 allocating your funds. We're having a hard  time making the portfolio "wor=
k" with the limit selection Coopers has  available. It would make sense to =
move Mark's Duke account to TDW, as  well.   Let me know what you and Mark =
think  of the idea.    James R. Waters, CFP  PARTNERSINWEALTH  3400 Bissonn=
