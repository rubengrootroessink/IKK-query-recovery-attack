He might.  I am having trouble rounding up an engineer on MSN- they're all busy... imagine that.  I'll see if I can get something before the day is out.  In the meantime, here's the current EIN topology with some extra info you can ignore.  If you are going to reproduce this drawing, PLEASE remove the OSPF costs and circuit id's.  

You'll need Visio2000 to open this doc.

Thanks.

MSN architecture build-out will be a key.  Does McCartney have this?

Ben,

The best place to start is some documents and detailed illustrations of the EIN.  Give me a little time to gather this stuff for you (not that we have a whole lot documented...).  I'll also gather what I can on the upcoming MSN network build out as this appears to be a vital component of future product deployments.

I'll be out of the office this upcoming week but upon my return, I can have follow-up discussions with you to address questions and provide more detail.  I can also to arrange for you to sit with some of the primary architects of the EIN and go into as much detail as you can stomach.  :-) 

Thanks.

Michael:

I enjoyed meeting you yesterday and appreciated the time.  I don't know what your schedule is the next few days, but I need to learn more about our network.  I need to be an expert on what we have today, what we are building for tomorrow, and what we need for games.

We walked through a high level, but I would love the chance to get to the details.  Any ideas on the best way to do this?  I am not trying to throw this on you (well, I guess I actually am), but I figure you and Brad are the best people to ask for this.

I am not afraid of early/late meetings or just reading through some presentations.  I look forward to your response.

Ben




***Brad---any ideas on how to get more comfortable with the network and be the resource Michael needs me to be?
