Mark/Greg,

Attached is a detailed report on the status on completed performance reviews across EWS (excluding EEL - who had 95% of their completed by 7/31). In brief, here are the headlines:

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES					
 					
	Enron Americas	1078	432	40.1%	
	Enron Broadband Services, Inc	822	180	21.9%	
	Enron Canada Corp	107	38	35.5%	
	Enron Engineering & Operational Services	968	161	16.6%	
	Enron Global Markets	363	124	34.2%	
	Enron Industrial Markets	192	72	37.5%	
 	Enron Net Works	1560	680	43.6%	
	Enron Wholesale Services	13	1	7.7%	
	Wholesale EES	35	29	82.9%	
					
 	EWS - Consolidated	5138	1717	33.4%	


Our target was to have all evaluations completed by August 31 (we had hoped that all below VP's would be done by August 17). At year end we achieved close to 90% completion of written evaluations. The HR team are working hard to help their clients get these finalised, but I would appreciate all of your help in chasing this process to a successful conclusion.
