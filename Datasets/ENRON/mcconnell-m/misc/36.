I'm glad you can make it.  To get to the OU course from I-35, take State
Highway 9 East toward campus.  Exit left (North) on Jenkins.  Go past Lloyd
Noble Center and turn right (at signal light) on Constitution.  Go about 1/2
mile and turn left onto Par Drive.  They will start serving lunch about
11:30 and will put out range balls before then.  Some people start showing
up around 10:30 or earlier to hit balls before lunch.  I'll be there much
earlier.  We have a shotgun start at 1:00.
	FYI: The following Sig Eps (26) are currently signed up to play:
You, me, Chris Walker, Jon Armstrong, Craig Perkins, Scott Smith, David
Newman, Scott Weed, Greg Dial, Bruce Kennedy, Todd Skinner, Brian Cain,
Kevin Holland, Thomas Burleson, Rick Sheer, John Payne, Brad McNeese, Jeff
James, Bradley Watson, Bradford Watson, Joe Ong, Chip Long, Chris
Papasarantou, Brad Culver, Jeff Marley and Brad Schick.  Usually playing,
who I have yet to hear from, are Jeff Black, Brent McCutcheon, Daryl Deaton,
Russ Brudner, Craig Dean, Terry Mosslander and a couple of other younger
guys.
	See you Friday!

I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.  I
guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from
Weed and Dial.  If the teams are all full, put me on their team.
Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.  My game has gone down the tubes since
I started the international work.  I hope to take care of that problem
soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.

I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys,

Mark
