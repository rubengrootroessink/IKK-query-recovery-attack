St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 





Welcome Habitat Volunteers! 

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming response from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule volunteers for particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17. We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate without overcrowding the building site.  If I have scheduled you for a date you are unavailable, please let me know; there are plenty of people to step in!  The schedule for October 20 is attached.  Others will follow shortly. 

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide drinks, but you should bring water for yourself. 

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at the site. 

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.    

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He will provide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of the Saturdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to me.  You can contact him at "changing@swbell.net" or 281-461-4709. 

We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are qualified to be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize food/water/beverage, daily registration, clean up or tool management, please let me know. 

For additional information, contact me at: 713-748-3317; fax 713-741-6233; or email: lesliewmadams@aol.com. 

Peace and grace, 

Les
