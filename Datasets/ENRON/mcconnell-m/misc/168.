<html><div style='background-color:'><P>Hey Mark,&nbsp; (as they used to say in London)<BR><BR>You're right: i came down here in the beginning of the month and I am now slowly setting up shop down here in wonderful Rio de Janeiro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things are going well, but the jobsearch is not gonna be easy now that we are facing a worldwide recession.</P>
<DIV>I saw that Enron took a huge beating today after some SEC inquiry.&nbsp; Nasty stuff, if you ask me.&nbsp; From being the darling on Wall Street, we are now back to being the ugly duckling (old Danish fairytale, of course).</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I can understand that your are happy about being out of EBS, ?cos it seemed like you were often stuck between a rock and a hard place.&nbsp; Maybe the pipeline business is a little safer....maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I'd like to say that it was also a great pleasure to work with you: it's refreshing to work with somebody stable, smart and trustworthy.&nbsp; <BR><BR>I did meet up with Martin briefly as he joined in for my goodbye party in London.&nbsp; His e-mail address is <A href="mailto:mjoergensen@netlane.com">mjoergensen@netlane.com</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also has quite an uphill struggle in front of him:&nbsp; looking to start up a sort of recruiting company that exploits the differences in wages between eastern and western telecomengineers.&nbsp;&nbsp; With wife and three kids waiting at home, it's not a position that I envy him, frankly.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, young man.&nbsp; Take care with strange looking envelopes containing&nbsp;white sugar&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel that it's getting too crazy up there, you know that you will always have a place to stay in calm (!) Rio de Janeiro.<BR></DIV>

<DIV></DIV>Christian, 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>How's it going in Brazil? I know you are happy to be back. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business. I'm 
<DIV></DIV>working for the pipeline group. The people here are very nice and I'm 
<DIV></DIV>glad to be back in this industry. Although, I must say that I will miss 
<DIV></DIV>London and working with people like yourself. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day. Do you happen to 
<DIV></DIV>know his email address? Please let me know. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I hope all is well down south. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Mark
