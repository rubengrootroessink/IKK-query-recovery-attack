Hi Mark!
 How are things in Texas? Hope everything is going well. I am in LA
these days, and hopefully will be settled here soon. I?ve been looking
into a few positions at different studios, including Sony, Fox, Disney,
Paramount, and Universal. I would love to get some contacts so I can
send my resume directly to people in development, marketing, or
promotions, and I was hoping that you would be able to give me a few
names. I understand you are looking for a new job too. Best of luck! I
still think you should become a dance instructor though :)  Let me know
how it goes. 
Take care and I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks!

Stephanie
