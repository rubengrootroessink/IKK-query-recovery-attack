Dear Londoners,
 
Time has come for me to say goodbye to England and London and pursue my big dream of living in Brazil (again).  
 
While I will almost certainly not miss London itself, I will surely miss the great international community that exists in this town.  The sheer size, internationalism, diversity and at the same time homogeneity of this crowd is almost unparalleled and has made my stay in London quite enjoyable and interesting.
 
In order to celebrate my departure, I have set up two independent venues for us to get together.  In the unconventional style that you have come to expect, this will take place this Tuesday, the 2nd of October at the following places:
 
1) Winebar happyhour (for the busy City-people). From 6.30-9pm.  The winebar is located at 3 Kings Arms Yard, London, EC2 (nearest tube station is Bank).
 
2) Koha Bar (for East End boys and West End girls).  From 9pm to midnight. This bar/restaurant is located right behind Leicester Sq. tube at 11 St. Martins Ct., London, WC2N

 
I truly hope to see you there.  In the case you cannot make it, I have enclosed my Rio de Janeiro address below...
 
 
cK ;)
