Hi Mark, 
    Directions from I-90.....coming from Montana 
When you get to the Coeur d' Alene vicinity in Idaho, you will take  
EXIT 12- Hwy 95 Sandpoint /Moscow. 
Turn right, which will head you North on Hwy 95 towards Sandpoint.   I can  
either meet you, ( I am 1/3 on the way) or you can drive about 41 - 41.8   
miles......there will be a flashing yellow light on the right hand side of  
the road  and a "Greenwood St" sign (kind of far in on the right.  ) It is  
right before the parking lot for the "Long Bridge Grill"  you turn right on  
Greenwood.   
(If you have gone over the long bridge over the lake, you have gone too far)  
Drive to the first and only street.  (No sign, you cannot miss it)  turn  
right.  It is the 2nd house on the left....26 Harbor View.  I will leave the  
key under the door mat for you.  If you like, I will meet you, or you can  
follow me up.....or not. 
I am awaiting confirmation of availability from 1 or 2 masseuses.  I will get  
you the number of the one who can do it. 
Any questions you think of, let me know. 
I'll be in touch. 
Martina (877)890-2444 
P.S.  the last guest left my number a directions at home....don't forget them.
