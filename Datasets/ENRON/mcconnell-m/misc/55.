Hi Mark,
Thank you for your voice mail today and congratulations on your position with Transwestern. I'm sure we will have the opportunity to talk about some deals in the future.  We were in fact going after a large deal over the last several weeks.  We heard last week that we were runner up to a very strong bid from Duke's MLP, TEPCO.  Had we gotten it, we would have clearly needed additional commercial help.  I am now reassessing our needs. I did get a call today from Brian Kinsey and will follow-up with him.

Again, congratulations and I enjoyed our visit in Houston.


Brian
