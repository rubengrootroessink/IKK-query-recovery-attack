Hello,
So that your privacy can be respected I have blind copied each of you in this bulk email.  I am Brea Allen, a summer intern with the international group, I am assisting Thao Nguyen in reconciling the employee receivable accounts.  I have been asked to work with each of you to clear out the open items in your receivable account that were incurred prior to your employment with EBS.  I will be contacting you individually to discuss this matter.  Your cooperation is both needed and appreciated.  If you are aware of the balance in your account please contact me so that I will not waste time researching known issues. 

Thanks,
Brea
