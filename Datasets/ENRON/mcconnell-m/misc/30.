Subject:	mail stop and other changes impacted by your move

In response to your recent or upcoming move, following is some important information: 

Each employee will need to update their EB location in eHRonline for the info to show up in Peoplefinder/Expertfinder correctly.  

For mail stop changes (paycheck locations), an Admin in the group will need to forward a list with the correct mail stops to Janet Gregor (who works in the Churn group) via e-mail per the link below:

Please call with any questions-

Thanks,

Fran
