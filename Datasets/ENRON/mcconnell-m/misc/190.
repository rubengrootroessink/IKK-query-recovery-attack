Kim,

Thanks.  

Also, I need a favor.  I need your top 3 or 4 articles on investing post
age 60.  My dad has a broker who has been moving his money in and out of
stocks, and I need to show him something in black and white that says
that is not the thing to do.  This strategy has not worked well for
anyone except the broker, of course.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Sarah
