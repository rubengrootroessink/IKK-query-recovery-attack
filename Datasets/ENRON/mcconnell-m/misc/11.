St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 




The site for the construction of the Habitat house has changed!  Because of additional delays in pouring the concrete walls, our family, the Franco's, will take over another site where the walls have already been poured. 

The new address is 10223 Tangiers.  This is about eight blocks from the old location but is somewhat simpler to get to.  Directions: From Highway 290, take the 43rd Street exit and go west.  43rd Street turns into Clay Road.  Continue on Clay to Gessner.  Right on Gessner approximately ? mile to Tangiers, which is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

Alternate route: Take Interstate 10 to the Gessner exit and head north.  Tangiers is approximately ? mile past Clay Road and is the third street on the left.  Left on Tangiers to 10223 on the left. 

There is another Habitat home under construction on the site next to ours so the area will be crowded.  Parking will be tighter than the previous site, so car pool or take the van from the church if you can.  The site will need straightening before we can start constructing the interior walls.  Make sure you have heavy duty gloves.  We will also be staining the concrete walls.  The home next door has already been stained and it really looks like a brick home! 

There are plenty of fast food places on Gessner within 5-10 minutes of the site for those who want to get away for lunch. We will have coffee and donuts waiting for everyone Saturday morning. 

The tee shirts are in and look great.  They will be at the site Saturday. 

I have attached a schedule for all five weeks of the Project.  Please let me know if additional changes are needed by return email or 713-748-3317. 

See you Saturday!
