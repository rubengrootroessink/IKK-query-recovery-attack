Welcome to Mail!

To transfer mail from your desktop E-Mail application to your handheld computer, you must configure the HotSync
 feature on your desktop as follows:

1. Install Desktop software from the provided CD.
2. During install, click Yes when you're asked if you want to set up the handheld Mail application.
3. Follow the steps in the Mail Setup Wizard to set up Mail settings.

You can return to the Mail Setup Wizard anytime:  On the Windows95/98 or NT desktop, click the Start button.  Highlight Programs, the Desktop program group, and then Mail Setup.

When you press the HotSync button to synchronize your computer and your handheld, e-mail from your desktop E-Mail inbox appears in the handheld Mail application.  You can then read, reply to, forward, delete, and create new e-mail on your handheld.  The next time you synchronize, your actions are reflected both in your handheld and on your desktop E-Mail application.

Enjoy using Mail!
