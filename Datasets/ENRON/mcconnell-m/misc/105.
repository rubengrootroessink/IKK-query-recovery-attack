Hi Mark, 
    I didn't name her, but "Kitty" from "Absolute Heavenly Massage" will  
come out to the house the evening of the third.  I will give her directions.   
Here is her number: 
(208) 255-7170 
She sounds legitimate, nothing "sleazy"    Call her and alert her as to what  
time you guesstimate your arrival. 
Thanks, 
Martina
