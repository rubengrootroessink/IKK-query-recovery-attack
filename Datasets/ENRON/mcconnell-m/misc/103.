Mark,
Do you have copies of your March, April, and June 2000 expense reports?  You have an outstanding recievable balance with Enron totaling $10,962.03.  If you have copies of these reports your balance can be cleared.  There are also an oustanding items totaling $143.39 from 1998 &1999.  It looks like you may have only partially expensed a $500 dollar advance that was recieved in 1998.  If you can provide me with information to resolve these items it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Brea
