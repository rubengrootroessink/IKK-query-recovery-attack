FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,


John
