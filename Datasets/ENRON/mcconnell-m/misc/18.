Take a look at Jessie.  She is unbelievably cute.  Note that Cindy says
that: I've had Jessie
over a month now, she wagged her tail for the first time last
week. 

Poor little Jessie.

Hi Everyone,
I just returned from Montgomery.  While there, I attended the
WTCA dinner/meeting.    
TX WAG was awarded a very nice plaque, in appreciation, from WTCARES.
You can read a little blurb about it on the web site:
http://www.wtcares.org/

While you are there, take a look at Jessie.  She is a 6 y/o female
I am fostering right now.  I'm looking for someone with terrier 
experience for Jessie.  No kids, no other pets.  I've had Jessie
over a month now, she wagged her tail for the first time last
week.  If any of y'all know someone that might be interested, ask
them to contact me!

And, about the plaque; don't y'all think Jeff and Gigi should have
the plaque?  Since it's always their digs where we WAG?  
Cindy
