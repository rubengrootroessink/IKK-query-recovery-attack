	I am writing on behalf of Tim Thompson and the family of Meredith
(Fraker)
	Thompson,

	If you have received this message in error, or receive multiple
copies, I
	apologize in advance.

	Please forgive me for conveying this information through e-mail, we
just
	want to be sure that as many of Tim and Meredith's friends are
informed as
	possible.

	Meredith passed away Saturday evening due to trauma suffered from a
	lightning strike as she was working in her front yard.

	Tim wants everyone to know that Meredith had gone outside to
experience
	God's creation and to enjoy the sounds of the passing thunderstorm.

	For details on the incident, please see the Houston Chronicle story
dated
	7/09/01 online at www.chron.com.  The Chronicle will be running the
obituary
	Tuesday and Wednesday this week.

	There will be a visitation Tuesday evening at 6:00pm to  8:00pm at
Geo. H.
	Lewis and Sons Funeral Home
	1010 Bering Drive
	Houston
	713.789.3005

	The funeral will be Wednesday at 12:00 noon at Houston's First
Presbyterian
	church at the corner of Bissonnet and Main street across from the
Museum of
	Fine Arts.

	In lieu of flowers, the family is asking that donations be made to
the
	Leukemia Society.

	Please inform those of Tim and Meredith's friends that may not have
heard.

	Thank you and God Bless,
	George and Christie Thomas
