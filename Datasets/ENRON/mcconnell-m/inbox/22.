mark -

this is very surreal right now.  i am doing alot of dammage control in rac as you can imagine. it is an amazing learning experience, but it has been very stressful.  

erica is going to be done with enron by the end of december and then probably move back to d.c.  she is totally fine with this now expecially given the current environment at enron.

i am sure that andy is happy in denver.  it is a great place to live.

i'm doing ok.  i'm really looking forward to coming home for t-day and hangin' with the fam.

how are you doing at enron??

Pat,

Howdy!!!!

What is going on?  I heard from Erica that she may have some decisions to make soon.  Are you going through the same thing?  I'm interested to know.

I heard from Andy Maus last week.  He is doing some contract work for Enron.  He and his family are enjoying Denver.

Please call or email me.

I hope all is well.

Mark
