=09Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.  USGT requested a realignmen=
t of delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).  Th=
ey held onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returne=
d the amendment.  Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry =
Frazier but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this a=
mendment to them.  The changes have been activated in the TW contract syste=
m; however, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nom=
inated these changes.  Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and wo=
uld "probably" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was =
suggested by Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.  As you're =
aware, Michelle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was=
 tendered prior to our re-implemention of the routing process.  I'll get yo=
u the file and associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examin=
ation. Our Tariff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 =
days, is null and void.  Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we=
 could just say it "timed out"...  just a thought.
