The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.
