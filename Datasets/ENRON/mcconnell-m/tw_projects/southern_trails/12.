You should specify the transfer agreements (and accompanying documentation) from Arco to Questar and the documents which specify how Questar holds the asset (is there an SPV set up to own it?).  Additionally we should have the company or partnership agreements for the holding vehicle.  In terms of financial instruments, they should be related to the asset, its purchase and operation (if any) and the holding vehicle (if any) - in other words, how they paid for this puppy and whether we are inheriting those as ongoing obligations.

Call me on 57219 if you'd like to discuss further.

Please look at the attached.  If there are some things missing, please let me know.  If some things on the list are not applicable, please note that too. Just send your deletions/additions to me via email.  If you can get this to me by the end of the day Wednesday, that would allow us to proceed with Questar all the sooner.

Thanks,

Mark
