Mark,

FYI, per a subsequent email from Bob Guthrie ( tax) he has asked us to include Jim Curry on the due diligence team.  I have forwarded this email to Jim Curry.  Also, my error, I missed the Reg Affairs group when I gave you the invite list.  I have forwarded this email to Teb Lokey and left him a voice mail just incase he doesn't see his email prior to 10:00 am on Monday. 

Thanks, Kim.
