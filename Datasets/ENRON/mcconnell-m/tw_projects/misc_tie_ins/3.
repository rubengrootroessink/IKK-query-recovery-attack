In response to your request listed below: We have included a few questions related to your wells pressures and flow rates.
Please let us know if we can be of further service. Thanks Dennis Alters  

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.
Thank you for time,
Cathy Pittman

***************************************************************************************************************************

The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near the Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station. The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Would Beacon interested in building 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If so what are the expected pressure and maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile from the TW-Crawford 16" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig. Can this well meet TW's line pressure? What is the maximum flow rate on this well?
