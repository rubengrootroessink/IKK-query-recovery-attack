Subject: Pipeline Information


I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to
drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find
Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:

Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land

I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was
in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure
I get it right.

I would appreciate any help.

Thank you for time,

Cathy Pittman
