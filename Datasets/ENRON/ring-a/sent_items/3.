Hi!=20

         Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vac=
ation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of=
 us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading compa=
ny.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the =
company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  Th=
is is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something=
 would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible t=
hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on=
 I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit=
h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag=
edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad=
 for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been r=
etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo=
b will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is =
going well for you and your family.  Take care!
