I didn't see where Lucille sent this to you and I wanted to make sure you
knew about it.  Please tell everyone you can--especially my nieces.

 
Dont know if this is true...but with everything going on...its better to
be safe than sorry!!!!

 
I checked this out at an urban legend site and I found no evidence
of this being a hoax.. I pray it is.. However, just as a precaution. 
Be safe, 
Jessica

I received the following message and immediately contacted the
person that initiated it since I don't like to forward hoaxes. 
Laura lives near L.A. and tells me that to the best of her knowledge 
this is true; however, it could still be a hoax, it's up to you if 
you take it to heart or not.

All, My friend Megan here at work called the lady at the end of the
email who confirmed that this is a legit email....she's very skeptical
as well but decided to send it anyway.....SCARY, HUH....Mon 

 
I called and emailed the creator of this message and it is true.
Thanks,
Megan 
 
 
FYI - I was very skeptical of this e-mail so I called the telephone
number and it really was Laura Katsis at work.  She said that she did 
write and send the e-mail in reaction to what her girlfriend told her.
This could still be a hoax, but I am taking it a little more seriously 
knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the e-mail and 
who stands behind what she wrote. ----- Forwarded by Lisa Kent/US/Fabtech

Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path. This
one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough
credibility in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to
all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a
month ago.
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely
emptied.
On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he
wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it
had to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her
not to get on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls
on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called
the FBI and has since turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This
came from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last
night. 
 
I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings
being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the
second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same
information that I did.
