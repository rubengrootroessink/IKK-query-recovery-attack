Hi!

       It is so nice to hear from you!  I am trying not to think of all that is going on here - but it is not fun.  Seeing you next week,  however, will be.
Would you have any free time to go to lunch or dinner maybe on Wednesday?

                                                                                Let me know - sorry for the delay in responding I just opened your note.

Hey Andy,

How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked about
you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company the
focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out fine
you all there.

I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful fall
here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

Susan
