	Andy - I have not been willing to give up the wheel chair because I have been told twice in the past two (2) years that certain signs regarding my health could be early signs of M.S.  I do not accept this I think its stress but who knows.  I have not told the kids or Bob.  I would appreciate it you didn't either so please don't telling anyone else.  Love You - Mish
