Just concerned about you w/ the drop in ENE's stock price.  Are you okay?
Let me know if you need anything.  As much as I miss you guys, I'm sure glad
I left.  If you need anyone to yell to, call me up.  I know we joke around a
lot, but I really mean it.  If you need someone to bitch too, give me a
call.  You were always a good friend to me and hopefully I can repay to
favor.

Dan

Well smartypants, we were instructed to get as much done as possible early
on because this new internet virus has caused problems with scheduling
downloads.  I wanted to suspend but Scott would not let me.  Have you
talked to Scott H.?  I feel so bad - the circle of old timers on the east
desk is growing ever tighter.  How are you and your family coping with the
tragedy?  Are you ready to come back to the lone star state yet?  I need to
stop watching the news coverage because I am becoming to fearful of
everything and can't stop crying for the victims and their families.  The
passage of time is not making it easier.  Sorry it took me so long to
respond but I don't check my e-mail as often as I should. Write soon! Take
care!
