Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has exe=
cuted the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, =
I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a m=
ore detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the=
 deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can del=
iver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will giv=
e you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Stati=
on 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at =
an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving =
downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving ups=
tream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta =
65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check=
 with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that=
 this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to=
 clear up any issues with Trigen.

Frank
