Dear Andy and Dick, 
I think I just hit the wrong button and sent you an e-mail with nothing on it, if so, sorry. 
We were so glad to hear from you as we have been worried about your job situation. We got an e-mail from Michele saying she still has her job but doesn't know for how long. It's still hard to believe a company can get themselves in such a mess! We would love to have you visit anytime you can get away. (We are a lot closer than Omaha).I hate to think of you being in Houston without any family close by, especially during the holidays. 
The rain finally stopped today so Bob and I went out to finish up our Christmas shopping. Now I just have all the wrapping to do.  Britt said she would come over tomorrow and help get it done. Thank goodness for my granddaughter!         
Love and prayers, Aunt Mary Lou and Uncle Bob
