Due to the level of interest in Kosciusko and Holmesville capacity, Gulf
South will be holding an Open Season for FT capacity, pursuant to section
7.4 of the Gulf South Tariff.  The capacity becomes available April 1, 2002,
when the existing contracts expire.  Gulf South is selling the capacity for
a term of one year, expiring March 31, 2003.  The capacity available for
sale is:

Agua Dulce (8075) to Kosciusko (2471)		43,000 Dth/day
Agua Dulce (8075) to Holmesville (2690)		32,500 Dth/day
Carthage (664) to Kosciusko (2471)			70,000 Dth/day
Venice (464) to Kosciusko (2471)			20,000 Dth/day
Mobile Bay (15912) to Koscuisko (2471)		20,000 Dth/day
Bistineau (10402) to Koscuisko (2471)		  2,000 Dth/day
Carthage (664) to Holmesville (2690)			  5,000 Dth/day

The above capacity represents the capacity that is currently under contract
on a primary, firm basis.  The Open Season will be held on Tuesday, January
29th, at 2:00 P.M. CCT.  The auction will be held on Gulf South's web site.
Gulf South will post the minimum acceptable rate and supplemental rights the
day before the auction commences.  Each package will be auctioned
separately. Given the bidding history on capacity offered for auction Gulf
South is proposing to auction each package for an initial period of 15
minutes, with extensions if bids are received in the last 60 seconds rather
than the procedures set forth in Section 7.4.  The extensions will continue
until the bidding stops. Gulf South shall post on its Internet web site the
winning bid(s) and the winning bidder(s) within forty-eight hours after the
completion of the auction.  The interactive auction will eliminate the
requirement of section 7.4 to post the capacity for a bid period of 5
business days. Customers' bids shall be for demand fees only.

Gulf South will entertain negotiations for multiple-year FT deals on the
aforementioned capacity through Friday, January 25, 2002, pursuant to Gulf
South's current tariff provisions.  Any multiple-year contracts for the
above capacity will be communicated on Monday, January 28, 2002 via the Gulf
South web site, and will be subject to the posting requirements of section
7.4 of the Gulf South tariff.

If you need information on how to participate in the Gulf South auction,
please contact your account manager.

If you have questions about the capacity to be auctioned, please contact
Dwight Helms at 713-544-7603 or Patrick Howard at 713-544-5402.
