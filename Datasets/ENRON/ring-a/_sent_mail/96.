 ?IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND LIFE, JUST ASK THE KIDS 

A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, 3. The  
boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw  
the opportunity for a moral lesson. 
"If Jesus were sitting here, He would say, "Let my brother have the first  
pancake. I can ?wait." Kevin turned to his younger brother and said, "Ryan,  
you be Jesus.

A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year-old son ran  
up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay  
dead in the sand. 
"Daddy, what happened to him?" the son asked. "He died and went to Heaven,"  
the dad replied. 
The boy thought a moment and then said, ?"Did God throw him back down?"

After the church service a little boy told the pastor, "When I grow up, I'm  
going to give you some money." "Well, thank you," the pastor replied, "but  
why?" "Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever  
had."

A wife invited some people to dinner. At the table, she turned to their  
six-year-old daughter and said, Would you like to say the blessing?" "I  
wouldn't know what to say," ?the girl replied. "Just say what you hear Mommy  
say," the wife answered. 
The daughter bowed her head and said, "Lord, why on earth did I invite all  
these people to dinner?"

A mother was teaching her three-year-old The Lord's Prayer. For several  
evenings at bedtime, the child repeated it after the mother. Then one night  
the child was ready to solo. 
The mother listened with pride to the carefully enunciated words, right up  
to the end. 
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us some e-mail"...

A little boy opened the big and old family Bible with fascination, and  
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Suddenly, something fell out of  
the Bible, and he picked it up and looked at it ?closely. It was an old leaf  
from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,  
look what I found," the boy called out. "What have you got there, dear?" his  
mother asked. 
With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered: "I think it's  
Adam's suit!"

Six-year-old Angie and her four-year-old brother Joel were sitting together  
in church. 
Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud. ?Finally, his big sister had enough. 
"You're not supposed to talk out loud in church." "Why? Who's going to stop  
me?" Joel asked. 
Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, "See those two men  
standing by the door?  
They're hushers."

A father was reading Bible stories to his young son. He read, "The man named  
Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city, but his wife 
looked  
back and was turned to salt." 
His son asked, "What happened to the flea?"

A three-year-old boy went with his dad to see a litter of kittens. On  
returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother,"There were 2 boy 
kittens  
and ?2 girl kittens." 
"How did you know?" his mother asked. "Daddy picked them up and looked  
underneath," he replied. "I think it's printed on the bottom."

Another three-year-old put his shoes on by himself. His mother noticed that  
the left shoe ?was on the right foot. She said, "Son, your shoes are on the  
wrong feet." 
He looked up at her with a raised brow and said, "Don't kid me, Mom. They're  
the only ?feet I got!."

On the first day of school, about midmorning, the kindergarten teacher said,  
"If anyone has to go to the bathroom, hold up two fingers." A little voice  
from the back of the ?room asked, "How will that help?"

A mother and her young son returned from the grocery store and began putting  
away the groceries. The boy opened the box of animal crackers and spread 
them  
all over the table. 
"What are you doing?" his mother asked. "The box says not to eat them if the  
seal is broken" the boy explained. "I'm looking for the seal."
