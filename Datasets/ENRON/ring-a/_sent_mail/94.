Taking a break from their first day of work, George W Bush and Dick Cheney  
go out to a restaurant near the White House.  
The waitress comes over and asks them what they would like. 
Dick orders the "Heart-Healthy" salad. 
The waitress turns to Dubya and asks him, "What would you like, Mr.  
President?" 
"I'd like a quickie." 
The waitress is shocked and astonished. In a huff, she exclaims, "I thought 
you were going to bring a new era of moral rectitude to the White House! 
Now I see that you, like all politicians, were lying! I'm sorry I ever voted 
for you!" and storms off. 
Bush sits there, stunned for a moment. 
Then Cheney leans over and says, "George, I think it's pronounced QUICHE."
