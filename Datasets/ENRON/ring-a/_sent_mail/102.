Hi!

           Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to 
confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of 
Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place 
for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron 
and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current 
purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.


                                                                              
                                                                            
Thank you!
