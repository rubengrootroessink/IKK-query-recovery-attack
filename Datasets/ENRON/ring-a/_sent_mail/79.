>  Three women all worked in the same office with the same female boss.
>Each
>  day, they noticed the boss left work early. One day, the women decided
>  that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her.
>
>  The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening,
>  spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early.  The redhead was
>  elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a
>  dinner date.
>
>  The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when
>  she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside.  Slowly
>and
>  quietly, she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband
>in
>  bed with her boss! Gently, she closed the door and crept out of her
>house.
>
>  The next day, at their coffee break, the brunette and redhead planned to
>  leave early again, and they asked the blond if she was going to go with
>  them. "No way," the blonde exclaimed. "I almost got caught yesterday!"
