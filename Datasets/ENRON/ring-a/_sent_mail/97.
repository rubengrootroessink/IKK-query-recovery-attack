.
An elderly woman and her little grandson, whose face 
was sprinkled 
with bright freckles, spent the day at the zoo. ?Lots 
of children 
were waiting in line to get their cheeks painted by a 
local artist 
who was decorating them with tiger paws. 

"You've got so many freckles, there's no place to 
paint!" a girl in 
the line said to the little fella. 

Embarrassed, the little boy dropped his head. His 
grandmother knelt 
down next to him. "I love your freckles. When I was a 
little girl I 
always wanted freckles," she said, while tracing her 
finger across 
the child's cheek. "Freckles are beautiful." 

The boy looked up, "Really?" 

"Of course," said the grandmother. "Why just name me 
one thing that's 
prettier than freckles." 

The little boy thought for a moment, peered intensely 
into his 
grandma's face, and softly whispered, "Wrinkles."
