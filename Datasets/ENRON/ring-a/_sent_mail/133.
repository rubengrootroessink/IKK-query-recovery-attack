Hi!

                   Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new 
wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream 
gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee 
Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that 
we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long 
to get  back to you!
