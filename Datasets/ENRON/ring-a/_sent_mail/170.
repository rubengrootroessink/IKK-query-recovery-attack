Hi!

           I'm so glad everything is going well with the kids - what is Jay 
going to study?  I am worried about Dani driving too - just don't tell me - 
there's no need for both of us to worry (just kidding).  When do they start 
back to school?  Some kids in Houston started this week already.  I so enjoy 
the summer when the traffic is lighter.  I have started getting to work 
earlier between 7:00 - 7:15 so that helps some.  Dick told me his brothers 
Charles & Russell and families are planning to come to Houston for Christmas 
- I started sweating immediately.  What will we do with all these teenagers & 
ANDREW?  


                                                                              
                                                                              
    Love you & take care of yourself!
