I resubmitted the claim by mail and have not heard anything  -  the service I 
have received from the customer service department in the last six months has 
been terrible - one delay after another  - lost claims.  It is very 
frustrating.  I will let you know when I get a response.  

                                                                              
                                                                Thank you!
