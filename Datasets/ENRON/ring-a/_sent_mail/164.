Hi
     
     I guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for!  Since you 
helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the All 
Products
section of stack manager ,  I can no longer select a financial swap product 
as a link to my physical products.  For example, I would like to link my 
HEHUB physical 
rest of month product to the gas daily HEHUB swap product.  Can you help me 
once again or refer me to someone who can?  Sorry, I did not realize these 
options were connected.


                                                                              
                                      Thanks in advance for your help!
