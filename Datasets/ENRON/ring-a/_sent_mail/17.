Hi!

                  Yes,  we were discussing your lending habits and everyone was calling me a fricken mouch!  Your like a legend around here.
We still need to get together and share some of your previous comments with Craig.  How are you?  I miss you and get regular updates about how you are doing from you know who.  Been to any exciting ports lately.   Any baby news?  Not much new around here - John Craig keeps us laughing.  Take care!

                                                                                                                                                                                             Andy
