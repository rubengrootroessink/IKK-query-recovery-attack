Breaking News : Transco's Sundance Project Gets Green Light 
posted 10:11 AM (CST) Mar 28, 2001 

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's $134 million Sundance expansion project was 
approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today in a draft order 
issued at the Commission's regularly scheduled meeting. The looping and 
compression project will provide an additional 236,383 Dth/d of firm 
transportation capacity to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

About 38 miles of new pipeline along the company's existing mainline system 
will be installed along with modifications to existing compressor stations in 
Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, according to the project plans. The 
project will go in service in the spring of 2002.

Robust economic growth in the Southeast and development of significant new 
gas-fired power generation were the main forces driving the expansion. 
Southern Co. and Carolina Power and Light (CP&L) agreed to purchase most of 
the capacity of the project. Southern purchased 140,000 Dth/d. CP&L signed up 
for 75 MMcf/d. CP&L also is planning to build a $100 million, 82-mile 
intrastate lateral downstream of Sundance between Iredell and Richmond 
counties in North Carolina. The 30-inch-diameter lateral would have an 
initial capacity of 200 MMcf/d with expansion capability up to 700 MMcf/d.
