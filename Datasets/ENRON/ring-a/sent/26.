>The other night I was invited out for a night with "the boys". I told my 
wife that I would be home by midnight ..promise!

>Well, the hours passed and the beer was going down way too easy. At around   
2:30 a.m., drunk as a skunk, I headed for home. Just as I got in the door, 
the cuckoo clock in the hall started up and cuckooed 3 times. Quickly, I 
realized she'd probably wake up, so I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really 
proud of myself, having a quick-witted solution, even when smashed, to escape 
a possible conflict. 
> 
>The next morning my wife asked me what time I got in, and I told her twelve 
o'clock. She didn't seem disturbed at all. Whew! Got away with that one! 
> 
>She then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock. When I asked her why, 
she said, "Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said "oh 
shit," cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another 3 
times,giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then farted.
