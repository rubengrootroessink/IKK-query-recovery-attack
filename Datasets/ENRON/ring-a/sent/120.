  How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Not much going on here - I 
think I'll go see the new movie with Richard Gere on Friday - wish you were 
here so we could go and sob together.  Drop me a line if you get a chance.  
Say HELLO to the kids!

                                                                              
               Love you!
