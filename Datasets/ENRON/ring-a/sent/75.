this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.
