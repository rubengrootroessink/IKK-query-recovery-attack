Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!
Ann Mora

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
"total body conditioning class"  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the "total 
body conditioning class" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an "ab lab" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.
