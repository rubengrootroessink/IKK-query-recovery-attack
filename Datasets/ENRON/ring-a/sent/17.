ADVICE TO GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS

1.  Don't imagine you can change a man, unless he's in diapers.

2.  What do you do if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.

3.  If they put a man on the moon, they should be able to put them
all up there.

4.  Never let your man's mind wander, it's too little to be out alone.

5.  Go for younger men. You might as well, they never mature anyway.

6.  Men are all the same, they just have different faces, so that you
can tell them apart.

7.  Definition of a bachelor; a man who has missed the opportunity to
make some woman miserable.

8.  Women don't make fools of men, most of them are the do it
yourself types.

9.  Best way to get a man to do something is to suggest they are too
old for it.

10. Love is blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.

11. If you want a committed man, look in a mental hospital.

12. The children of Israel wandered around the desert for 40 years.
Even in biblical times, men       wouldn't ask for directions.

13. If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him
checkbooks.

14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes,
it means that you laugh at     his.

15. Sadly, all men are created equal.
