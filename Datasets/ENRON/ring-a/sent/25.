Hi!

        Your not going to believe this but I just opened your email from a 
month ago.  Apparently I had so many at one time I thought I was seeing them 
all  but I wasn't.  It is (was) so good to hear from you!  I'm sorry about 
all the problems PG&E has had but I hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to 
much.  It will all work out in the end.  Dick & I are still here.  We were 
not smart and only sold about a third of our Enron stock when the price was 
above eighty so we have just been riding it down.  I guess we will be here 
for awhile.  I'm glad you got your house done - that is such a good feeling.  
We only have a few things left to do inside.  Then we get to start on the 
backyard and patio.  It never ends!  We had a very mild winter and it is just 
starting to get warm - I'm already dreading the heat.  I hope you can find a 
place to do ceramics.  I used to go with my mom every Saturday when I lived 
in Omaha.  At first I just went to spend time with her but I ended up really 
enjoying it - very relaxing.  I was very slow - in the year I was there I 
only finished two projects.  I still display them proudly on the appropriate 
holiday.  Are you going home for Easter?  This Friday I am going to have 
nasal surgery - something I have been putting off for years.  I am not 
looking forward to it.  Once again this highly predictable market is moving 
so I better go!  Take care and I'll try to call you when I get back from R&R .
Sorry it took so long to write!
