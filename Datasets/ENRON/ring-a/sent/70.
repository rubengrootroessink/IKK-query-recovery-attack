Hi!

            You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and 
see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on 
the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on 
Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad 
you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling 
during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating 
the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a 
thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one 
of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for 
Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be 
coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to 
stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but 
let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas!
