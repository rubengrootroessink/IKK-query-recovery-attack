Elizabeth,

           Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices 
Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have 
found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct 
and this is not a large amount in question.

                                                                              
                                                             Thank You!
