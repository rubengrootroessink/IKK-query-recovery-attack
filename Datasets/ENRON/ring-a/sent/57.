?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop." 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, "I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel." 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, "How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, "Just try dem on, Saiheeb." 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????"YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!"
