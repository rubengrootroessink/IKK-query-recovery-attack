I had Lee ann Chance reallocate the volumes for Louis Dreyfus and we still 
could not come up with the $ totals Louis Dreyfus invoiced us for. So I had 
Carla McLaughlin of Louis Dreyfus fax me the files they used to calculate 
their invoice on these deals. Please review the attached files and let me 
know if this is the way this deal should be calculated. Thank you.
