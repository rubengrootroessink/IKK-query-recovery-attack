Hi!

          It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron.  
I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for 
me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we 
generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two 
can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday 
season!  Take care!

                                                                              
                                                      Andy
