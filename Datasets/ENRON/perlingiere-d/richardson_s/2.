Dear Debra,

The measurements for 005 are 16" for the necklace and 7 1/2" for the jacla,  
006
is 15 1/2" for the necklace and 5" for the jacla, and the internet necklace
measures 13" and 7" for the jacla.  Also included is a necklace that you might
be interested in.  It matches up very well and the jacla has spiny oster on 
the
tip.  It has a price of $425 and measures 15 1/2" and 7" for jacla.

003,004 (air 5)

Thank you,
Richardson's Trading Company
