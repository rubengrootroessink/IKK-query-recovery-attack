I did it!  I finally took a minute to e-mail you.  How are you?  Mom and Dad
just moved to Arkanshire (Retirement Village) this week.  Went over to help
and pick up a load of stuff.  It has been tuff to deal with but know it is a
good idea for them.  Jason is here for a visit, broken hip and all so
between two jobs and all this I am a little "fritzed" at the momment.  Heard
you and I both have a "Jeff" in our lives.  We will have to talk.  Maybe we
can begin communicating a little better. Love you! mb
