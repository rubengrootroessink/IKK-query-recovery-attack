Thanks  for your e-mail regarding a master with Reliant Energy Services
Canada, Ltd.  ENA has a Canadian form of contract we could work with which
will have most of your changes already contained.  If we use the U.S.
master there are problems with provisions regarding taxes, arbitration etc.
so I would like to suggest we use the Canadian form with your changes as
needed.  Please let me have your thoughts.
