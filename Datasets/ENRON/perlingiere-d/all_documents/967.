Debra,
Thank you for sending your GISB agreement.  I have forwarded it onto AK
Steel for them to review and sign.

However, in the meantime it has been brought my attention that there is a
master agreement in place between AK Steel and Enron North America.  If this
is the case then we can work off of the master agreement.  Please let me
know if you know of a master agreement already in existence.

Thank you,
Julie
