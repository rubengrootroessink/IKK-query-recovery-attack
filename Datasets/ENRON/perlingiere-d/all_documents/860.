RE: DEC. 6 LUNCHEON / ANNUAL MEETING
 



Ladies:
 



December 6 is not only our holiday luncheon but is also WEN's annual 
meeting.  Pursuant to our current by-laws, I appointed a Nominating Committee 
to assist in  selecting the WEN 2001 Board. The Committee has worked 
diligently to interview  the potential candidates from the final list 
submitted in accordance with the  Nov. 10 deadline. The Committee will submit 
its final recommendations for  officers and directors at our Dec. 6 luncheon, 
at which time the membership will  vote on whether to approve the new Board. 
Additionally, the WEN members will  vote on whether to approve by-laws 
revisions as approved earlier this week by  the Board. In summary, the 
by-laws reflect changes necessary for the continued  phenomenal growth of 
WEN: Dues were increased to $30; two Board positions were  added, the 
officer/director nomination process was clarified, among other  changes. 
Please feel free to review the by-laws before voting on Dec. 6.? I  hope that 
many of you will be able to attend the luncheon. It will be a great  program 
and a nice conclusion to another great year for WENH!
 



Robin
