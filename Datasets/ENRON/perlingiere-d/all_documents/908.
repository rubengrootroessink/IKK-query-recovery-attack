Hello Debra, I have not yet received any contracts from you to review.  I
understand that we have a large number of current Transactions with Enron
amounting to several million dollars.  I have been asked to make these
negotiations a priority and was wondering if you could get something to me
at your earliest convenience.
Thank you.
