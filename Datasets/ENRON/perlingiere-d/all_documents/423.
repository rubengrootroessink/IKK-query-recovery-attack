I have place the amendment with your revisions and ours with my attorney for 
review.  Hopefully  I will receive it back today.   In Section 4.2 we 
increased the event for Enron Corp. to 100m and Idacorp, Inc. to 50 m.  In 
addition to this I changed the date of the Amendment to July 1, 2000, changed 
the name to reflect Enron North America Corp. and finally to Section 4.6 the 
following: Collateral Requirement/Termination Threshold is hereby amended by 
the addition thereto after the last sentence: "For purposes of this Section 
4.6, the calculation of "Early Termination Payment" shall include all amounts 
owed but not yet paid by one Party whether or not such amounts are then due, 
for performance already provided pursuant to any and all Transactions."

These are the only changes we have made.  Pending my attorney's review we 
should be ready.  I will e-mail the new version as soon as I receive it.

Thanks for your assistance, and have a great weekend.
