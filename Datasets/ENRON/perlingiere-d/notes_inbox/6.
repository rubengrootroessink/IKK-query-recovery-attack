Debra,
The only exception that we would have to make to the GISB agreement you sent
would be the special provision regarding 3rd party arbitration.  As a public
entity in the state of Tennessee, arbitration is expressly not enforceable
against TEAC and the language would have to be excluded from the agreement.
Please give me your thoughts on this.  Thanks,
Rhonda Wall
