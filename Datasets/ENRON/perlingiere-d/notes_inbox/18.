Debra-
 I have filled in all of the necessary information under the contract
but would like to request that under Section 1.2, the Transaction Procedure
Type be "Written" rather than "Oral". Please let me know if this is not
possible. Also, you have indicated that Seller will be responsible for
initiating the Transaction Confirmation. When will Prairielands be receiving
the Confirmation for the term deal done by Paul Lucci for the time period of
12/01/2000 through 03/31/2001?
 Let me know if you need any further information from me. Please send
out two originals to my attention at the address noted on the contract and I
will return on fully-executed copy to your attention. Thank you and talk to
you soon.
