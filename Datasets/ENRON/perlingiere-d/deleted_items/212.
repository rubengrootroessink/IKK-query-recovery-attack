 I just got this from my cousin, don't know how true it is, but wanted to
 pass it on just in case.....
 
 Malls on 10/31
 
 This came from my sister Amy...she normally doesn't send forwards, so I
 felt like it was important to get the word out anyway. I think you all
 know
 that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the reactionary thing and send
 out anything that crosses my path. This one, however, is a friend of a
 friend and I've given it enough credibility in my mind that I'm writing it
 up and sending it out to all of you. 
 
 My friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. She had
 a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably upset
 and went to his home to find it completely emptied. On 9/10, she received
 a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could tell her
 why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that. The part
 worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
 airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As
 soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since
 turned over the letter.
 
 This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This came
 from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night.
 I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being
 correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second
 and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information
 that I did.
