Coming up this week at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology:

Thursday, January 31, 6:00 PM
EXPLORE AFGHANISTAN
 Learn about the landscape, history, people and ethnicities of Afghanistan
with former BBC journalist and translator Mr. Ahmad Shafi.  Originally,
this program was to present Mr. Abdullah Ayazi, "The Map Man", but he had
to cancel, and sends his apologies.  Mr. Shafi is his colleague and
co-presenter and is perhaps even better qualified to speak about the
current situation as well as the history.  He began working for the BBC at
age 15, translating, escorting correspondents to the front lines, and
arranging interviews with government officials.  He became a journalist in
his own right, and has also worked with Healthnet International on refugee
issues.  Maxwell Museum North Gallery.  Refreshments will be served.  Mr.
Ayazi's maps will be available.
