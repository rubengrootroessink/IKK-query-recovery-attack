I work in the Legal Department for Lisa Herrmann at RWE Trading Americas
Inc.  I am trying to find out the correct legal name of your company
that would enter into a natural gas purchase/sales contract and a power
purchase/sale contract.  Also, I am looking for the correct legal name
of the company, if any, that will provide a guaranty.

I am also trying to find out who within your company handles the
contract documentation for the power contracts.  I would like to get
their name, phone number, fax number and email address.  Is this
something you could help me with?

Thanks for your help.
