Thanks so much!  What about the assigment letter between Nicor Energy LLC/Kaztex/Enron?

 As an update, there is only one issue remaining concerning the agreement, that being Force Majeure.  Also I am waiting on a revision to Dynegy's Guaranty for Nicor.   I have left a message for Mr. Hunt and await his call.  I think we are there just a few minor adjustments.
