Dear Friends and Family,
We wanted to let you know that baby Rebekah Ruth Moats was born by cesarean
section on 10 January at 10:00 a.m.  She was 20.4 inches long and 7 lb. 15
oz in weight.  Both Mommy and baby are doing well.  No signs of jaundice
with this child.  Ruthie and Rebekah will stay in Kediri until after
Rebekah's two-week check-up.  Jeff and Naomi and Esther will head back to
Jember as soon as we receive the birth certificate so that we can register
the baby with the American Consulate.  We thank you for your prayers.

Grateful For the Gift of Life,
Jeff For All
