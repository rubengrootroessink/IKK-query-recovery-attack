Should be no snags, I reconfirmed yesterday with both the restaurant and the Enron Shuttle driver-"Sparky"
Irma's at 1314 Texas (713) 236-1166 expecting you on or before 12 noon for 7 persons under Jeff Hodge, and 
Enron Shuttle expecting you downstairs on Andrews Street at 11:40 am -don't be late- and will pick up at Irma's at 1:30 pm--ASK THE DRIVER IF HE IS PICKING YOU UP SAME PLACE HE DROPS YOU OFF.

DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK ALL TO MEET AT JEFF'S OFFICE AT 1125AM -TO GO DOWN TO SHUTTLE TO BE THERE AT 1140?

You are to
