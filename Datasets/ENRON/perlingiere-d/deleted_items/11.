Debra,
Attached is a word document showing the schedule of  high school events through the end of the year.  We will be working on the  spring schedule soon.
 
If your still interested in helping out (I hope you  haven't changed your mind after attending a few meetings) you'll need  to have the "At Risk" training.  This training is mandatory for any  adult wishing to work with our youth groups.  I'll check in the office and  see if you can still do this through video or if you have to attend a scheduled  class.
 
I hope that you will be as blessed by working with  the high school kids as I am.  
 
Nancy
