I assume your are refering to the deal where he bought back his position even though the deals looks like a sale.  I am not sure why he would need to sign.  This deals converted a fixed deal back to an index deal.

Subject:	Kenoil


 The confirmation for the July -Oct transaction with Kenoil has not been signed.   Mr. Flecher does not think he needs to sign this?  Are we purchasing gas? I will resend the confirm to him for signature unless you tell me otherwise.

Also, please remember to advise regarding volumes for the last agreements you sent.

Thanks
