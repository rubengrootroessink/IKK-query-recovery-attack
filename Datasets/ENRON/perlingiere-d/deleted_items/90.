>
> "Girls I have liked."
> I opened it and began flipping through the cards.  I
> quickly shut it, shocked to realize that I recognized
> the names written on each one.
>
> And then without being told, I knew exactly where I
> was.  This lifeless room with its small files was a
> crude catalog system for my life.  Here were written
> the actions of my every moment, big and small, in a
> detail my memory couldn't match.
>
> A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror,
> stirred within me as I began randomly opening files
> and exploring their content.  Some brought joy and
> sweet memories; others a sense of shame and regret so
> intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if
> anyone was  watching.
>
> A file named "Friends" was next to one marked
> "Friends I have betrayed." The titles ranged from the
> mundane to the outright weird. "Books I Have Read,"
> "Lies I Have Told," "Comfort I have Given,""Jokes I
> Have Laughed at."  Some were almost hilarious in their
> exactness:
>
> "Things I've yelled at my brothers".  Others I
> couldn't laugh at: "Things I Have Done in My Anger",
> "Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents."
>
> I never ceased to be surprised by the contents. Often

> fewer than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer
> volume of the life I had lived. Could it be possible that I had the time
in

cards
> were packed tightly, and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found the
> end of the file. I
> shut it, shamed, not so much by the quality of music,
> but more by the vast amount of time I knew that file
> represented.
>
> When I came to a file marked "Lustful Thoughts," I
> felt a chill run through my body. I pulled the file
> out only an inch, not willing to test its size, and
> drew out a card.  I shuddered at its detailed content.
> I felt sick to think! that such a moment had been
> recorded.
>
> An almost animal rage broke on me.
> One thought dominated my mind:  "No one must ever see
> these cards! No one must ever see this room! I have to
> destroy them!"  In insane frenzy I yanked the file
> out. Its size didn't mattered now. I had to empty it  and burn the cards.
> As I took it at one end and  began pounding it on the floor, I could not
> dislodge a  single card. I became desperate and pulled out a card, only to
> find it as strong as steel when I tried to tear it.  Defeated and utterly
> helpless, I returned the file to  its slot.  Leaning my forehead against
the
> wall, I let out a long, self-pitying sigh.
>
> Then I saw it.  The title bore "People I Have Shared the Gospel With."
> The handle was brighter than those around it, newer,
> almost unused. I pulled on its handle and a small box not more than three
> inches long fell into my hands. I  could count the cards it contained on
one
> hand.  Then the tears came.  I began to weep.  Sobs so  deep that the hurt
> started in my stomach! and shook  through me.  I fell on my knees and
cried.
> I cried out  of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all.  The rows of
> file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes.  No one must ever, ever know
of
> this room.  I must lock it up and hide the key.
>
> But then as I pushed away the tears, I saw Him.  No,
> please not Him.  Not here.  Oh, anyone but Jesus.  I
> watched helplessly as He began to open the files and
> read the cards.  I couldn't bear to watch His response.  In the moments I
> could bring myself to look at His face, I saw a sorrow deeper than my own.
> He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes.  Why  did He have to read
> every one?  Finally He turned and looked at me from across the  room.  He
> looked at me with pity in His eyes.  But  this was a pity that didn't
anger
> me.  I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry
> again.  He walked over and put His arm around me. He  could have said so
> many things.  But He didn't say a  word.  He just cried with me. Then He
got
> up and  walked back to the wall of files. Starting at one end  of the
room,
> He took out a file and, one by one, began  to sign His name over mine on
> each card.  "No!" I shouted rushing to Him. All I could find to say was
"No,
> no, " as I pulled the card from Him.  His name
> shouldn't be on these cards. But there it was, written
> in red so rich, so dark, so alive.
>
> The name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with
> His blood.  He gently took the card back. He smiled a
> sad smile and began to sign the cards.  I don't think
> I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but the

> and walk back to my side. He placed His hand on my

>
> I stood up, and He led me out of the room.  There was
