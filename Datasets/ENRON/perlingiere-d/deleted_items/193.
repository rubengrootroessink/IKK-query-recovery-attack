Dear WENH members,

Each year, WENH holds a holiday charity luncheon benefitting women or
children in the Greater Houston area.  This year's event will be held on
Friday, December 7, at 11:30 a.m. at the Houstonian.  We are excited to
announce that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will be the keynote speaker at
this year's event.  The Senator will discuss energy issues and provide an
update from Capitol Hill.  At the end of her speech, WENH will present her
with an award for her contribution to the energy industry.

This year's beneficiary is Girls Inc. of Greater Houston.  Girls Inc. is a
wonderful organization that helps girls from all walks of life become
strong, smart, and bold in order to achieve their full potential.  Proceeds
from the event will help fund such programs as Operation S.M.A.R.T., which
gives girls hands-on experience with math, science, and technological
applications.  Sixty percent of the girls that are served belong to racial
and ethnic minority groups; more than fifty percent of the girls come from
families living below the poverty level; and over half are from single
parent households, most of which are headed by women.

You will soon receive a fund-raising packet in the mail.  Please take a few
minutes and forward it to the partners in your firm, your charitable
contributions, governmental affairs, public affairs, and/or human resources
departments, or other  decision-makers as appropriate.

We will mail the event invitations in early November.  Individual ticket
prices are $60 for WENH members and $75 for guests.   We anticipate a
sell-out, so after you have received your invitation, please remit your
payment at your earliest convenience.  Due to the large number of people we
are expecting, walk-ins will not be accepted and any cancellations will be
considered donations to Girls Inc.

The Houstonian will be beautifully decorated for the holidays, and the
ballroom has recently been remodeled.  So, mark your calendars and join us
for our charity gala!  This is one event you won't want to miss!
