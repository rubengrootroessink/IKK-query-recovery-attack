debra,

Please see the attached 1st draft of pricing language for the Unimark deal # 1062624.  I am not sure about the NX 1 language, (you may want to ask Gerald?).

 

I have a total of 4 deals with Unimark which will use  similar language (with the  5 pricing tiers), so once you approve of this one, I can use it as a templete for the other deals.

thanks so much.  lisa
