Hi,
 
Got your message today, thanks.  I spent my gift certificate at Urban Retreat and now I am exhausted.  Too much beauty in one day!!  Tomorrow I have to go to MDA to my onocologist.  I am doing well except for the food issues.  I have lost 17 pounds because I still have alot of nausea.  I am sure it will pass soon and all the weight will come pouring back on!!!  Hope you are doing OK and not working yourself to death.  Take care and talk to you soon.

America's surefire plan to defeat the terrorists. 

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train 
us 
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, 
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - 
drop 
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let 
us 
do what comes naturally. 

Think about it.  Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard 
stuff 
like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make 
even 
armed men in turbans tremble. 

We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them 
and 
their future.  We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't 
left already.  And for those of us who are single, the prospect of 
finding 
a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by 

lightning.  We have nothing to lose. 

We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, 
and 
the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a 
pound.  We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of 
Afghanistan 
with no food at all! 

We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware 

stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no 
problem. 

Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?  Oh, 
please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and 
extended 
families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal 
warfare. 

Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is 
for 
how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources.  We 

know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or 
without 
the government's help! 

Let us go and fight.  The Taliban hates women.  Imagine their terror as 
we 
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. 

I'm going to write my Congresswoman.  You should, too!
