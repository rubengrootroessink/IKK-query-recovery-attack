Stacy-
We (Bryant Frihart) have a deal where we have a buy and a sell for the same price, volumes, etc.  Basically it is a wash. However, on the buy, the cp is wanting there receivable in 2002.  The comments in the system read ENA will pay Octagon on January 2, 2002 by wire.  My question is does this have to be worded a certain way on the confirm and if so can you please provide this to me.  Below is the buy for you to view.

 
Thanks 
Richard
