Jennifer,

per your discussion with myself and Debra Perlingiere, here are the sentences that we would like to add to the amendment you sent us.

"All capitalized terms used herein unless otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Base Agreement."

"This First Amendment may be executed in counterparts, each of which taken together shall consitute one and the same instrument."



Thanks so much for your patience and understanding on this matter,

Alisha
