Good Morning,
	Enclosed is a worksheet for both an omnibus and a master physical for Co-Steel Inc.  The omnibus pertains to a trade executed yesterday and perhaps other trades executed before a master is put in place.  Please forward the omnibus to Ellen and Richard in confirms with a copy to me.  

Thanks,

Max Sonnonstine
