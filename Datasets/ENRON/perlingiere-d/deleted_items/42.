Debra,

Kim Clausen has agreed, on behalf of the above referenced company, to have the GISB contract amended to designate ENA as confirming party.  Details are as follows:

Contract #: 96020382
E-mail:KClausen@mitchellgs.com
Phone: (713) 377-7090
Fax: (713) 377-6728

Please, if possible, give this amendment priority.  It is one of the "major problem counterparties" we discussed in the meeting.

Let me know if there is any way I can assist.

Thanks,

Ann
