Dear Debra,

What's on your wish list? You know that list of destinations you've 
been meaning to check out "someday." With airfares lower than they've 
been in a long time, and hotel deals abounding, now's a great time to 
try something a little different, whether that's a U.S. city you've 
never visited or someplace more exotic. So what are you waiting for? 
Try something new in 2002!

traditional attractions. But there's more to do than ever in the

free stopover on America West Airlines.)
