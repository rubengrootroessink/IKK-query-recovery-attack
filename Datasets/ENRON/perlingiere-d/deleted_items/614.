Ms. Osire,

The Amendment is not correct.  As I have told you repeatedly, Northern
States Power Company is still the contracting party, not Xcel Energy Inc.
Xcel Energy Inc. is the holding company which owns Northern States Power
Company, however the utility still contracts and operates in its own name as
an operating utility company.  We cannot execute the Amendment until it
correctly states the parties to the Agreement.
