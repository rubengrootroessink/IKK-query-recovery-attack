Debra, as we discussed, here is credit assurances language that Select
proposes to add to the Firm GTC, in addition to the other changes requested
by Select on 10/15/01.

Credit Assurances.  If either party (Party A) has reasonable grounds to
believe that the other party's (Party B) creditworthiness or performance
under this Firm GTC has become unsatisfactory, Party A will provide Party B
with written notice requesting Performance Assurance in an amount
determined by Party A in a commercially reasonable manner.  Upon receipt of
such notice Party B shall have three (3) Business Days to remedy the
situation by providing such Performance Assurance to Party A.  In the event
that Party B fails to provide such Performance Assurance, or a guaranty or
other credit assurance acceptable to Party A within three (3) Business Days
of receipt of notice, then an Event of Default  will be deemed to have
occurred and Party A will be entitled to the remedies set forth in Section
3 of this Firm GTC.
