 Below is the schedule that we discussed  Wednesday evening. (I've also attached a word copy if this one comes across  scrambled).  It is in the preliminary stage and still can be changed.   We really need to get a plan together for the "study" nights at church.   January looks like a great month for some kind of series.  The other 5 can  be some kind of stand alone topics.  Help!!!
