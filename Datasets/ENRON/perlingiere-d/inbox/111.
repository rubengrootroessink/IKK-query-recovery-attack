Good morning.  I just returned from a week and a half vacation and wanted to check the status of the request I had left with you on the 17th.  In regards to the sale of one of the Brewer wells, I had faxed you a copy of documentation filed with Enron back in 1997 for you to review and confirm that the documentation was sufficient to make the necessary change from W.E. or Mary Brewer Trust to Brewer Natural Gas LLC.  Mr. Brewer is awaiting notification from me that this issue is either resolved or more documentation is needed.

Please let me know if you have had a chance to look this documentation over or if I need to re-fax the information for your review.

Sincerely,

Ruby Kyser
