Debra,
 
Christy Finelli has directed me to your attention in connection with my  request to put in place a Gas Purchase and Sales Contract and Net Settlement  Agreement between Tenaska III Texas Partners and Enron North America Corp.   Would you be so kind as to provide me with the appropriate documentation to get  the ball rolling on these two contracts?  Please let me know if you have  any questions or require additional information from me at this point.   Thank you, Debra.

I am not the right person if you want a master agreement  with our sister
company, Enron North America, I handle matters for Enron  Energy Services.
I am copying Debra Perlingiere who is with ENA Legal and  hopefully can help
you with this request.
Thanks, Christy  Finelli

Christy,
Sharon Heck of our office has given me  your name as a contact to get a Gas
Purchase and Sale Contract in place  between Tenaska III Texas Partners and
Enron  North America Corp.   We would also be interested in executing a Net
Settlement Agreement between  these two parties as well.  Please provide me
with the appropriate  documentation to get the ball rolling on these two
contracts.  If you  are not the appropriate person to contact regarding
negotiation of these  documents, please either direct this e-mail to the
appropriate person or  contact me with the individual's name, number, e-mail
address, etc.   Alternatively, can these documents be executed
electronically via  EnronOnline?  Thank you for your help, Christy.
