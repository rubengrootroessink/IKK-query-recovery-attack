We already have an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with ENA, which continues on a month-to-month basis since the original one-year term expired on 11/1/01.  I assume that the Spot agreement would enable us to buy/sell interruptible gas, but it also seems to cover firm purchases.

Would the Spot agreement take the place of the Firm agreement?  If not, would having both agreements in place create any overlaps or conflicts?  How would we know which agreement applied to a particular transaction?  (For example, I don't see a netting provision in the Spot agreement, which is something that we would insist upon.)

Please let me know how the agreements would relate to one another.  In the meantime, I will begin to review the Spot agreement in greater detail.
