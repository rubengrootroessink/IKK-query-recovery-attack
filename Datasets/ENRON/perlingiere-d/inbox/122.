Jeff, 
Attached is the New Revised spreadsheet of Tenaska transactions which they want to assign to ECC.  Please note that the top two deals on the spreadsheet are booked as ENA to Tenaska Marketing Ventures....Tenaska wants those trades to be between ECC and Tenaska Marketing Canda as well.  
 
This new spreadsheet (attached at the bottom on the right) shows our Deal Info. as well Tenaskas Deal info.  Mark Soulliere at Tenaska would like to have this ASAP...He would like to have the executed copy fax to his attention at (402) 758-6142.  Please call with any questions.

Please see the attached assignment.  Kim, can someone on your staff/Peggy's staff please identify/confirm these ECC deals? I do not see a problem assigining the ENA deals to ECC as they are current month deals that will allow netting of the purchases and sales.  Should not affect the PMTM which has a threshold in the contract.  Would like to try to finish up quickly. Please advise if anything CRM can do to help.
 
Thanks,
Tanya
