Debra,
I faxed you part the contract I have on file.  If you look at the Commitment
Section 1.  it will give you the legal description.  It appears that there
has been at least a price amendment.  The gas purchase statement for Duke
Field Services, L.P indicates the contract number as:  BEN 0463-00-C.  My
phone and fax information is below.  Please call if you need any more
information.
