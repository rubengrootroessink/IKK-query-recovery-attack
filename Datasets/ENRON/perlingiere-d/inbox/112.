Debra and Alisha:
I apologize for the extended length of time it has taken for me to return this draft to you. I have tried to highlight the changes that resulted from my last communication with Debra and subsequent discussion with KU's legal counsel. Please review the addendum and the attached cover page. If you should have any questions, feel free to give me a call and I will be happy to discuss them with you. Please let me know if you are unable to open this attachment.
Again, I apologize for the delay.
