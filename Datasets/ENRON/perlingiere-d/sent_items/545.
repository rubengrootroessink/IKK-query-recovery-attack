Debra,

I spoke with Darlene Volker of Coast Energy.  She said she received the amendment but we left out "Propane" in the name.  She wants us to send her another amendment with the corrected name (See above for the full name).    You can forward me the corrected amendment and I will get it out to her.  Or if you prefer to do it, then her e-mail address is darlene-volker@coastenergy.com.

Thanks, 
Ann
