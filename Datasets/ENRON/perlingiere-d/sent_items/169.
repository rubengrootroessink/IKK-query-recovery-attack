Debra,
Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the "minus number" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
