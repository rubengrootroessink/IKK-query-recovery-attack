Judy -

I have went ahead and completed the Western side of your GISB.  In addition, I have sent your special provisions page to our legal for review.  Once I receive the same back from them, I will be in touch with Debra for further negotiations.

If it wouldn't be much trouble, I would appreciate it if you would see that this GISB is forwarded on to her.

Thank you.

Jennifer

Judy -

Received your phone call re GISB Contract with E&A Upstream Company LLC.

Why don't you go ahead and send me your GISB and I will review the same.

I took down your phone number as 713-853-4758 and got someone else's
voice mail.  Did I take the number down right?

I look forward to receiving the GISB for review.

Thanks - Jennifer
