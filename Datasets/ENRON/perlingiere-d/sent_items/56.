Stacy! 

This transaction is a one year deal with one of our Appalachian producers (C E Richner) done by John Singer.  The previous deals were done under contract # 96029815 ( assigned over from Columbia Energy Services), we would like this new deal and all subsequent deals to be done under the Enfolio Gas Purchase Agreement (the one you emailed to me on 10/9). 

Kindly provide Richard Deming with the appropriate documentation. 



Thanks
Rudwell
