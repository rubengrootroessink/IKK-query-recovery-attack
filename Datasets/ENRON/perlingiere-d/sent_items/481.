Dearest Debra,

I am so sorry that I did not say bye to you on my last day, but I had to
leave early for a school meeting. Anyway, I have been so busy with the law
review write on competition, so I have sort have been buried in books. How
is your new girl clerk? I know you miss having me around j/k. Please write
back and let me know how things are going. Also, we must have lunch sometime
this week or next. Drop me a line.

Best Regards Always,

Majed Nachawati
