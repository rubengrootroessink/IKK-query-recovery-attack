  Sarai,  at the risk of my head, I will agree to "Seller" as confirming party.  So pending netting language we are good to go.

Debra,
As discussed on 9/19, the e-mail below and attached documents reflect the
final status of the GISB/netting.  I'd like to get this wrapped up and
signed within the next 2 weeks, if humanly possible.  Let me know where we
stand.
Sarai

Debra,
Now that we have the Master Firm Agreement nearly signed off on, I'd like
to get the GISB and netting agreements in place as well.  Attached below
are the GISB cover page and Special Provisions that my records reflect we
last agreed to.  I'd like to see Enron's new netting agreement because the
netting agreement previously sent to MW is a year old.  If you have no
changes to the GISB cover page and SP, we should nearly be caught up.  I
look forward to receiving the netting agreement from you.  Thanks.
Sarai
