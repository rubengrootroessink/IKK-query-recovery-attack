At Ed's request I sent him  Select's draft for review on 7/30.  He requested the agreement not be sent prior to his review,  I await instruction.  Concerning South Jersey,  I sent the draft to you on 7/25 to be sent to the customer from which I have had no communication.  Also,  I am waiting on the gty.
