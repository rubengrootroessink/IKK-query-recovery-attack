Subject:	Master Netting Agreement

We are coordinating a project regarding the preparation of various master netting agreements.  This is a very time sensitive project and we are trying to solicit as much help as we can.  Please attend a meeting this afternoon at 4:30 in EB38C2 to help us coordinate this effort.
