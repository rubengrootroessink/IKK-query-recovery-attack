   On Saturday, Sept. 22, 2001 at approximately 1:47 a.m., I was awaken by
   the sounds of a car crash.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my
   bedroom window at Hwy 36, I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell
   asleep.  At approximately 2:45 a.m., I was awaken by the sounds of a man
   outside my bedroom window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up
   pretty bad.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window, I
   saw a police officer outside with a flash light.  I woke Keith up to
   tell him the police were in our yard.  Keith dressed and went out the
   front door.  The officer told Keith to get back inside because an armed
   suspect was running around our home.  Keith came back inside and told me
   what was going on.  After checking on Andrew, we went into Chasity's
   vacant bedroom and looked out the window into the backyard.  Men with
   flash lights, police cars with spot lights were all over our yard.
   Finally, the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree closes to our
   house.  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to
   surrender.  Since the suspect would not cooperate, an officer shouted
   several times that he was going to "shoot".  This was not something I
   wanted to witness, so I quit looking out the window.  Keith told me that
   he surrendered and that they had him in custody.  An officer starting
   knocking on our front door.  As I opened the door, I informed the
   officer that my husband would be right there.  Keith went outside to
   talk to the officer.  I looked out my living room window and saw my
   driveway full of police cars followed by an ambulance.  Hwy 36 and
   Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their spot lights pointed
   toward our house.  Keith came inside and informed me that Buccee's in
   Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted, the
   ambulance was for her and the suspect didn't have a gun, but was
   carrying a knife.  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that
   the truck they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side
   of our barn.  The police were outside video taping our front yard,
   treating it as a crime scene.  Once the police took off with the suspect
   and the ambulance transported the victim, Keith talked me into going
   outside and looking at the crash.  By this time, a wrecker was at the
   scene.  We watched the wrecker driver pull the truck back onto all four
   tires and haul it away.

   On Sunday morning at approximately 2:30 a.m., I woke up and started
   listening for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier.
   Once I realized that my home was safe, I went back to sleep.

   With a troubled mind, I realized that I did not know how to deal with
   "violence". I called my brother-in-law, Rev. Dale Frankum, for answers.
   Dale suggested I read the book of Psalm.  Gladys suggested particularly
   Chapter 91.  After reading Psalm 91:4 "He will cover you with his
   feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness
   will be your shield and rampart", I found peace of mind.  I now know
   that He put me back to bed, instead of me searching for an answer to the
   crash that woke me up which put a violent man outside my home.  And He
   kept my son in a deep sleep so that Andrew would not witness the horror
   that was going on right outside his bedroom window.  At this time, all
   Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in our front yard, I would like
   to spare him from the rest of the story.

   As our country heals from the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and as we
   continue to fear more terrorist attacks, I suggest you read the book of
   Psalm to find peace of mind because He is our refuge.

   My God Bless you, your family and America.

   Nancy Stephens
