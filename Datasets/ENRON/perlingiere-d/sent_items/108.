Here is the draft.  Prior to sending to customer, Jay please look at the MAC language and advise is it needs to be reworded.  Also, is this a political sub-division? If so, I will need to add a provision for same.

Debra,

A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.  I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.  I haven't received a copy of this draft.  Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience? 

Thanks,

Kim Ward
