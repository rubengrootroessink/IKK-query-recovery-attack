Thanks for the birthday wishes.  Its hot here but not as hot as your town.  Well, your age does not make me feel any better!!!!  Think about NM,  I am going to call about some air fares.  October would be great.
I am enjoying our deb/mary bag!!! Take care!!

If you get depressed today just remember you could be my age!
HaHaHa.....NOT FUNNY.  How are things in Houston and area?

Seriously, have happy thoughts today and celebrate!
