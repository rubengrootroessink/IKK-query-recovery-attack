 Here are the most frequently used agreements for physical gas trades.  I draft and negotiate both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement as well as ENA's Spot Agreement and GISB.  If you have any questions,  I can explain the process including credits part.  Finally,  the Master Agreement was last revised in September of 1998.  These were minor revisions and I doubt you would ever have occasion to visit the 1998 form.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
