Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.  
 
Thanks,
 
Max Sonnonstine
