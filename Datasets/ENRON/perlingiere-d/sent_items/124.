Thanks for your email.  The Assignment looks fine.  Regarding Exhibits "C" and "D", I have copies of executed parental guaranties  for both parties and will fax same to you.

 Many thanks for your help. Have a great weekend.
 
 Debra

Debra:

Attached for your consideration is a "red-lined" revised  draft of the Assignment Agreement reflecting our discussion earlier today.
Please let me know if the form of the Agreement as revised is acceptable.

Additionally, I have completed a review of the master agreement that you provided earlier today.  I do not anticipate that Nicor Energy will have many proposed revisions, but have yet to have an opportunity to discuss the agreement with my client.  Although Exhibit "C" and "D" were not attached to the master agreement that you provided, it is my understanding that Enron and Nicor Energy have already agreed to the terms of the parental guaranties associated with this Agreement.
