Is this a yearly contract or month to month? Do you want 30 day notice  or 60 day for year contract?

If you would, please send the confirm.  

Two additions:

1.  I think that the language for the pricing should include "less applaicable gathering and processing fees incurred by the Buyer, including those fees charged by Gatherco, Inc.".

2.  The Pipeline for Mtr 717457 is Gatherco, Inc.
