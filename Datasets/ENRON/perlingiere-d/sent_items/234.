Hey girl,

Here is another form of guarantee!.  This is the marketing arm of
Central Illinois Light Company.  Please let me know of your comments as
soon as you can.

P.S. I have forwarded the comments on the other two documents, Nicor and
Dynegy, earlier this morning.  I will contact you as soon a I receive
their feedback.

Thanks so much for your help!
