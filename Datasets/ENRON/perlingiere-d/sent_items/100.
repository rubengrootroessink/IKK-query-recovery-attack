 the contract form  for these customers is attached and can be found in Stacy Dickson's directory  under Appk's 
 
 
you only need to insert the company name on the front, signature, and info pages for each one.  please save these in Stacy's directory.  finally, some of these may need confirmations, if so I will show you how to do for these.  open any of the contracts in Stacy's appks directory and look at one as an example.

 thanks !
