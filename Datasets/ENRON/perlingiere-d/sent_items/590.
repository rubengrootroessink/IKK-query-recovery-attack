      Debra, 

James Lee at Midcoast Marketing agreed to amending the GISB Base Contract to make Enron the confirming party.  The customer has not been sending us confirmations in a timely manner.  Details are as follows:

Contract #:  96029313
Contact:  James Lee
e-mail: jlee@midcoastenergy.com
Phone #: (713) 821-2079
Fax #: (713) 653-6746

I will be more than glad to send him the amendment, if you can forward it to me.

Thanks,
Ann
