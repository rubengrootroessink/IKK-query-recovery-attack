 TXU has requested we replace a previous GISB with HPL now assigned to AEP.   Because they are an intrastate pipeline they require a warranty from us that gas sold has been produced, transported and used only in Texas.  As ENA is interstate this is problem.  Please advise how you would like to proceed with this customer.

 Thanks !!
