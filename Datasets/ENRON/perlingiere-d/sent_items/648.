I am attaching a revised form of the previous ENA Upstream GISB. Please send this version to your prospective customers. The FM language in the Special Provisions section has been removed.  Also, "DRAFT" and "For Discussion Purposes Only" should remain on the front page when sent to the customer.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.  


Thanks
DP

Judy -

Received your phone call re GISB Contract with E&A Upstream Company LLC.

Why don't you go ahead and send me your GISB and I will review the same.

I took down your phone number as 713-853-4758 and got someone else's voice mail.  Did I take the number down right?

I look forward to receiving the GISB for review.

Thanks - Jennifer
