Debra -

Attached is a worksheet for a Master Firm Purchase/Sale with TXU Gas Company.  Please prepare a draft at your earliest convenience, as we need to send out to the counterparty immediately to execute a term deal.  I will forward the email address of the contact at TXU Gas as soon as possible.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks,

JRW
