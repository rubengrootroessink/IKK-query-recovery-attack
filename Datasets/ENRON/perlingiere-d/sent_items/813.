Thank you for your email of 12,November,01.  In response to your questions, yes I intend for the Exhibits to be as sent for Exhibits A and B.  And second, I have amended the list to include as the last item Deal No. 1148026 of which is attached.

 Please sign two originals and return same to my attention for final execution.

 Many thanks,           
Debra

Debra, I have reviewed and I believe there are two items outstanding:

1) The new assignment refers to Exhibit A & B - did you mean to leave the
individual sheets marked Exhibit A and make the List Exhibit B? - if so the
list is marked A.

2) I believe there is a confirm missing from the individual prints as well
as the list.- #1148026  Nov-Dec 2001 - Could you check with Sylvia Pollen?


Thank You!  Connie
