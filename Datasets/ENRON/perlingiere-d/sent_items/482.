Hey Debra,

I have finished the revisions for the regular Masters as well as the EBTIDA agreements.  They are attached; they are also saved in your Contracts 2001 file.  If there are any problems just let me know.  

I also looked for the Hess file and I don't have it, nor do I have any notes for it.  I don't think that I worked on it although I may have looked over it for some reason.  Could you please check and see if you have something for them.

Thanks,

Alisha
