Debra,

Please work with Jan at AEP to establish a GISB contract between ENA Upstream and AEP.

Jan - I have attached a sample of our GISB with special provisions for your review as well.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Attached is our standard GISB with Special Provisions.  Our Special
Provisions add terms to permit netting, liquidation upon default, telephone
recording, confidentiality, and to refine force majeure, audit rights and
document priority.  Please review and let us know your comments.

Attached also is our company information form for you.

 We look forward to hearing from you.
