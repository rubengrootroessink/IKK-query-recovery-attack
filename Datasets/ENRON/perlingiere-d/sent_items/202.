Ann, 
Regarding your proposed Amendment to the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between Enron North America Corporation and Barrett Resources Corporation, it is our intention to assign the remaining Barrett transactions to the existing agreement between Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company.  Since this is the case,  do we need to execute this Amendment?  Please advise.
