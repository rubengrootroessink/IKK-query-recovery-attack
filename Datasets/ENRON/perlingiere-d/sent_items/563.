Jennifer,

Attached for your review and signature, is an Amendment to the current Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation.  The Amendment restates Section 2.4 and in so doing ENA becomes the confirming party for all transactions. 

Please print and execute two originals and forward same to my attention.  Upon final execution, I will forward an original for your records. Please do not hesitate to give me a call should you have any questions regarding the enclosed.

 
Regards,
