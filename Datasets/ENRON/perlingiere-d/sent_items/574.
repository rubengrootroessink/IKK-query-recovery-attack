Subject:	Enron Energy Services Gas Contracts

Good morning Debra,

Could you help me on the following questions that we have:

1.	Could you tell me who the contract administrator or Paralegal would
be for Enron Energy Services.  Maybe it is you?
2.	If it is you, could send me electronically the Master Gas Agreement
for Enron Energy Services in word format?
3.	If you handle Enron Energy Services can we can do a gas long confirm
until we have the Master fully executed?
4.	Once we have come to a final agreement with Enron North America's
could we rubber stamp the agreement for Enron Energy Services?

Sorry to shoot so many questions at you so early in the morning but if you
could let me know, I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,
