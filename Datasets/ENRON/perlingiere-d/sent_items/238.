Debra--

The attached contract has reciprocal $10MM thresholds.  I did not agree to that with the counteraparty when I spoke to them on Friday afternoon.  I went ahead and only agreed to raise Duke's threshold to $5MM (and to keep ours at $10MM).

Please send a revised contract draft to the counterparty.

Thanks,

Veronica
