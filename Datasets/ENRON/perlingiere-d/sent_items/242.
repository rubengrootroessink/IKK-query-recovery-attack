This is fine, but keep in mind we only use the GISB for 30 days firm and can use it indefinitely for interruptible. Let me know and I will draft a GISB for your customer.

Debra,
I plan on purchasing October gas from a new producer, CDX Gas, with offices in Dallas, TX.  The gas is on CGas in West Virginia.  I will be purchasing the gas at a CGas Interconnect.  Pricing will based on Gas Daily. 
Would a GISB contract work for this transaction?
John
