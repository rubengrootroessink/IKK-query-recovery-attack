Debra,
Were you going to send executable copies, as duly revised?

Thanks for your e-mail. Here is language I purpose of Article 8.2

 8.2. Transfer.  This Agreement, including, without limitation, each
indemnification, shall inure to and bind the permitted successors and
assigns of the Parties; provided, neither Party shall transfer this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed; Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party may, without the consent of the other Party (and
without relieving itself from liability hereunder)but upon written notice,
(i) transfer, sell,
pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement or the accounts, revenues or
proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or other financial
arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any Affiliate by
assignment, merger or otherwise, or (iii) transfer or assign this Agreement
to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the
assets of such Party; provided that any such succeeding entity or Affiliate
meets or exceeds the creditworthiness of the assigning Party and further
provided that such succeeding entity or Affiliate agrees in writing to be
bound by the terms and conditions hereof.  Any Party's transfer in
violation of this Section 8.2 shall be void.

Let me have your thoughts regarding the attached.

   Debra,
   A few corrections made -- corrected spelling of MarkWest, added company
   info for exhibits A & C.

   Still missing the language you wanted to add instead of mine in sect.
   8.2,
   subsections (ii) & (iii).  Please see my notes in the document.  Once we
   get the wording agreed upon for these two subsections, we should have an
   agreement.

   We'll also need to discuss the GISB, but let's first get the master firm
   agreement in place.  Any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at
   srenken@markwest.com or call me at 303-925-9275.

   Sarai

   Sara,

   Attached I hope,  is the correct redline version which exemplifies  the
   agreed to changes.  Please review and let me know if there are any
   additional corrections.
