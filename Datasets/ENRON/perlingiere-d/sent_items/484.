I did not get to go because of time.  How are your dogs?  My dogs need some socialization and I would like for them to meet your again sometime.

Yes.  I went on Sunday morning to see the last whippet judging, watch some
of the obstacle course action and shop for a collapsible dog cage.  Did you
go also?
