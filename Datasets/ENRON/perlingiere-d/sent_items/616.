Debra,

I am not sure who is handling the GISB's now. Please forward to the appropriate person if it is not you. 

Thanks,
Judy

Judy,

attached is the rider that Enron North America and I agreed to.  Please review and determine if this would be acceptable to ENA Upstream.  The changes are:

1.  Section 6 in the rider is deleted in entirety and Section 6 of the GISB stands.

2.  A new Section 7.5 has been added.

3.  Lastly, the last 2 sentences of Article 13.9 are additions.

All options selected on the cover of the GISB are acceptable to Sequent

thanks
Pat
