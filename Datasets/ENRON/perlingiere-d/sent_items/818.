Angela here is the draft of the Master for Aquila Dallas Marketing, L.P.  Since this is a limited partnership, the general partner will sign on behalf of the partner.  Please let me know the name of the proper entity. Finally, this draft mirrors the previous Master signed by Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation in all areas.
