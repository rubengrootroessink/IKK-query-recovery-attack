There is a company that will need to provide us with a guaranty prior to allowing access to trade on EOL.  The guaranty will cover physical NG and physical Power.  Through working with the financial legal team, a format has been discussed that covers multiple products for physical and financial business across multiple Enron entities.  Ideally, this is probably the best format to have a counterparty use.  Pursuant to instructions, I am not sending out a format to this company without having a member of the legal team give me the ok.  I was hoping that we could all coordinate on the multi-product, multi-entity format and possibly use it on a going forward basis.  Thanks for your help and please let me know if there are any questions.

Regards,
