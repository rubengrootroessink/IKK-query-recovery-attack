Debra,

Just spoke with Lupe Gonzales at Kinder Morgan who agreed to amending the GISB Base Contract to make Enron the confirming party.  The customer has not been sending us confirmations in a timely manner.  Details are as follows:

Contract #:  96039682
Contact:  Lupe Gonzales
e-mail: guadalupe_gonzales@kindermorgan.com
Phone #: (713) 369-9427
Fax #: (713) 369-9375

If you would like, you can send me the amendment and I will get it out to Lupe.

Thanks,
Ann
