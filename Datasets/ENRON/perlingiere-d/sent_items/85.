Thanks for your email.  However I need to know about volumes.  Is it 100% of production for these new contracts?  

 Thanks

I apologise for not listing  the pricing on my requests.  You are correct, the price is 100% of the TCo Appalachian Index.
Thanks,
John

Should I assume we are purchasing 100% of production for the last 6 you have sent me?
