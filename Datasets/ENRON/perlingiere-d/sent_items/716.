Sure.  I guess you didn't get my email about getting a table.  Well, I now have a phone, and hopefully you'll have one soon.  Let's definitely shoot for Thursday.  I may take Friday off if I get everything done this week.

Sorry too!

What do you think about Stacy's news????

I am so sorry,  a lesson on communication.  I called and left a message and waited by the elevators.  Lets try for Thurs or Fri?

Hey, lady,

I just got back from eating on 2.  I grabbed a table and looked for you the entire time, but didn't see you.  Then I got your message.  Where were you?

Let's try it again soon.
