Debra:  In addition to the above, the threshold language should be changed
to reflect $5M.  Once you have made the appropriate changes, duplicating the
AEM/ENA Enfolio Agreement for Aquila Dallas and ENA, forward an electronic
copy to me and I will print it in duplicate and obtain execution
expeditiously.

If you have any questions, please call me at 816/527-1325.

Thanks so much for attention to this matter.
