 With regards to the Master Agreement,  our respective credit departments will need to discuss credit terms.  Our contact here is Veronica Espinoza @  713-646-6002.   Upon receipt of information from our credit dept. a draft can be prepared.  Concerning the GISB, I can negotiate this agreement when you are ready.  

Debra
