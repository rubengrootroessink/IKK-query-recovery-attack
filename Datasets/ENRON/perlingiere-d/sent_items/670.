Debra,

Per our meeting this morning, I got a contact for the IGI Resources, Inc. GISB amendment:

Lisa Anderson
e-mail address: anderlm1@bp.com
Phone #:  (208) 395-0511

Lisa says she cannot find the proposed GISB contract we sent her and wants us to send her another one. 

Our trader for BTA Oil Producers is Randy Gay.  He is the one who requested an Enfolio Master Spot Purchase Sale Contract.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Ann
