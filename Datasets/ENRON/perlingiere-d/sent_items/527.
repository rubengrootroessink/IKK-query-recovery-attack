Are you worried that someone will intercept it, or you don't want me to have
it?

Did you have problems with someone bothering you and have to have it
changed?

   Have not gone yet, but planning to in October.  Jo Ellen and Bob are
   coming
   down and we are planning to drive out for about a week.  Should be fun.
   Charlotte and Bill are going to visit in September but we probably will
   not
   go much further than San Antonio.  How about you?  Are you going or have
   you
   been?

   I did not understand your message about your phone number.  You will or
   will
   not email it?

      You can give me your home phone too if you would like in case there
   is a
      good chance with short notice, OK?

      I am not playing the game this year,  thanks anyway.  Regarding the
      dogs,
      why don't you email someday that is good for you and we can meet.
   Tiz
      cannot take the heat and I will leave him behind, but Gen desperately
      needs
      to get out.
