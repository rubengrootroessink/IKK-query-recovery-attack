Did you ever receive a signed copy back from Dick Forrest from last November?
If so, no need to send out a new contract.  Just send a copy to Dick Forrest.
This came about when Dick Forrest called me last week stating that he could not find a copy of our contract, that's why I had Terry request another copy be sent.
