 Yes,  the agreement was under ENA.  The confirmation / contracts are on Stacy's desk for signature. The customer signed the contract/confirm with ENA !!  I question if this is really suppose to be ENA Upstream?    This deal was done with John Singer??  Can you speak with these guys?  Let me know as the contract and confrim has been signed.

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Regards,
Ellen
