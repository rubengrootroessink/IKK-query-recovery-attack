Good morning,

My name is Barbara Hammack and I am a new contract analyst at Reliant
Energy, I am assuming the responsibilities of the desk that is handling the
negotiations of the GISB with ENA Upstream.  From what I can gather in the
pending file left at this desk, it does not appear that you were sent
Reliant's Special Provisions to the GISB.  I have attached these Special
Provisions, as well as, the comments our legal group has made regarding
ENA's Special Provisions.

If you have any questions or require further information, please feel free
to call or email.
