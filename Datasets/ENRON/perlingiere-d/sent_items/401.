Hi Debra,

I am the new law clerk taking over for Majed.  I hope that you had nice vacation.  I am working on some of the GISBs that Majed had been assigned before he left.  However, I have not been able to get very far due to the fact that I don't have all of the necessary information.  I hope that if you have a spare moment today, you can give me a little guidance as to what I should be doing.  I know the first day back is always very busy, so just let me know.

Alisha Mahabir
