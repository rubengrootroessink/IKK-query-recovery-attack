Stacy and Debra--

Attached below is a credit worksheet for a term physical deal executed 8/29/01 with Interconn Resources, Inc.  Please prepare an Omnibus confirmation for the referenced trade.

Also, please forward me a copy of the document for the credit file once completed.  Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again,

Veronica
