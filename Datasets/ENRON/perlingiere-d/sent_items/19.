Debra,
Do you mind if we make the effective date December 1, 2001?  We've done quite a
few deals under this contract in October and I don't want to have to process new
confirms for this past business.  Additionally, by the time we route the
amendment through our organization, get it signed and back to you, and then
Enron does the same thing, we could be looking at the same problem in November.
Using a 12/1/01 effective date should allow sufficient time for execution by
both sides and getting our systems updated.
Thanks,
Jim
