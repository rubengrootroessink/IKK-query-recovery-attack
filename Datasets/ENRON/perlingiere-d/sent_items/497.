 Veronica I have sent Alan Griffin with Texican a redline version (attached) regarding Threshold changes, to which he does not agree.  In addition, he is insisting language regarding LC's "On a Monthly basis" be retained.  Please talk to him regarding credit issues and let me know.  We did not discuss the MAC.  These are the only issues remaining.  Thanks for your help.

 

AGL Energy Services, LLC as you know has become Sequent Energy Management, L.P.  They are ready to sign our Master however,  I need your input concerning the credit worksheet sent 4/01.  Do you want to change this?  If not, I will proceed with final negotiations.  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!
