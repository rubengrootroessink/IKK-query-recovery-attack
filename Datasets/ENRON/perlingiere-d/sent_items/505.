Debra - I originally sent the request for a Master Gas Physical Agreement back in April with updated credit terms.  Please make sure that the new terms get in this contract.  There was an attachment in my last email with the cws.

Yes, a Master Gas Physical Agreement is part of this request.  If you need additional information, please let me know.
