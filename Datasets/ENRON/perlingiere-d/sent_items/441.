Brenda,
 	
 In response to your phone call,  our Master is for firm delivery only
and as such will not accommodate interruptible service.  If you wish to
put a Master in place, our credit department will need some information.
Our contact in credit is Veronica Espinoza @ 713-646-6002 or Jason
Williams @ (713) 345-3923. 

Finally,  I will be happy to send our GISB with special provisions if
you so desire. 

 
Regards,
Debra Perlingiere
