Judy,

I just received back a response from our Legal Dept. on your Special
Provisions you sent me as follows:

1.    Section 1.3		This assumes that the Oral Transaction
			Procedure is selected.

2.     Section 6:		This requires Seller to pay the applicable
taxes,
			etc. levied before and at the Delivery Point.  
			Applicable taxes, etc. levied after that point
			should be paid by Buyer..This is provided for
			in the language deleted, and should be stated.

3.       Section 11.1	References to "Party" should be "party".  This
			substantially limits the application of force
majeure
			situations with respect to third party problems.
			This revision should be rejected.


Judy, please review the above comments and get back with me as to your
comments.

Thanks!
