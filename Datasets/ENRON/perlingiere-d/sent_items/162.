Dear WENH Members:

Elections for the new Board of Directors for 2002 are coming up. This is a
reminder of what was announced to the membership at our luncheon on October
10th:

Please remember to e-mail Leesa Foster, President of WENH,  at lfoster@kmg.com by November 6, 2001
if you wish to be considered for either (1) serving on the Nominating
Committee (we have two member slots available from the general membership),
or (2) serving on the Board of Directors for 2002.  See further information
for both, including available Board positions below:


NOMINATING COMMITTEE:

If you wish to self-nominate to serve on the Nominating Committee for
purposes of establishing a slate of potential Board members for the upcoming
election, please e-mail Leesa Foster at lfoster@kmg.com by November 6, 2001.  The Nominating
Committee will consist of the Outgoing President, Immediate Past President,
