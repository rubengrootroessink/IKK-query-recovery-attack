      Have not gone yet, but planning to in October.  Jo Ellen and Bob are
      coming
      down and we are planning to drive out for about a week.  Should be
   fun.
      Charlotte and Bill are going to visit in September but we probably
   will
      not
      go much further than San Antonio.  How about you?  Are you going or
   have
      you
      been?

      I did not understand your message about your phone number.  You will
   or
      will
      not email it?

      Are you going to N Mexico this year?  I will not give my number out
   over
      the net.  So email

         You can give me your home phone too if you would like in case
   there
      is a
         good chance with short notice, OK?

         I am not playing the game this year,  thanks anyway.  Regarding
   the
         dogs,
         why don't you email someday that is good for you and we can meet.

         cannot take the heat and I will leave him behind, but Gen

         needs
         to get out.
