Brenda,
 	 
 In response to your phone call,  our Master is for firm delivery only and as such will not accommodate interruptible service.  If you wish to put a Master in place, our credit department will need some information.  Our contact in credit is Veronica Espinoza @ 713-646-6002 or Jason Williams @ (713) 345-3923.  

Finally,  I will be happy to send our GISB with special provisions if you so desire.  


Regards,
