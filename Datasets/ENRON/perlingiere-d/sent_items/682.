Debra, partially executed copies have been sent to you already.  Also, the
attached document is for PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation, not PG&E
Energy Trading, Canada Corporation.  An amendment for the PG&E Gas
agreements (please amend both Firm and IT agreements) can be sent to Tanya
Murphy - tanya.murphy@neg.pge.com  I gave Tanya's name to Ann as well.

 Kathy attached is a revised amendment concerning "counterparty".  If
you have not  revised and executed the amendment, please have the
attached signed.  As you know, PG&E is defined as "Company" in Section
2.4.  Please send the executed amendments to my attention at the address
below and upon ENA's signature I will forward an original for your
records.
