	Debra,
	
	Do you have any deal numbers that I can research so that I can answer your question below?

Can you please help Debra with this request?  I assume she's referring to Tractebel as the parent.  I'm not sure how much business we do with Distrigas.  I would run the contracts for this CP, then run the deals for the contracts, and spot check most of the recent/current ones.

Thanks!
SBR

 Can you tell me whom the trader / or business person is for this company? They are a sub of Tracebel.

 Thanks
