 Attached is the draft incorporating issues as agreed.  You should also be aware of changes I have redlined to sections 4.2, 4.6, and the Material Adverse Change in the Appendix.  These revisions concern credit terms.  As the original draft in its inception was created for  Enerchange Energy, L.L.C. the credit terms differ slightly from those for Nicor Energy, L.L.C. Finally,  I  await a response from Dynegy regarding the guaranty.
