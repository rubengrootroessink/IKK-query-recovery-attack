Enclosed is a worksheet for Mountaineer Gas Company.  If possible please forward electronically to Brian Wagner of Allegheny Energy.  I'd still like to get a guaranty in place ASAP to cover a deal recently executed.  Please advise on the format I forwarded to you a couple of days ago.  

Thanks,
Max
