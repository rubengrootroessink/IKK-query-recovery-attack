Great,

I drive a 93 Honda Accord that is sort of Purple, so be on the lookout. I
will pick both of you up at 12:00 on Friday the 17th for lunch at Irma's on
me. I will pick you up in front of Enron where they usually have that lunch
party event, or in other words, the side street that has the cathedral on
the opposite side facing the Enron building.

Looking forward to lunch,

Majed

    Dear Debra and Gerald,

   Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could
   pick
   you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in
   downtown(they
   have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch,
so
   if
   your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
   Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.

   Best Regards,

   Majed Nachawati

       Dear Debra,

      I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for
   lunch.
      I
      feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was
      interviewing
      for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town
on
      Thursday
      of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me
know.
   I
      want
      you to fill me in on how you have been.

      Your law clerk,

      Majed Nachawati
