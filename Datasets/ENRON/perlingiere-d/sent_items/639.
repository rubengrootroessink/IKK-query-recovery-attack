The second draft is correct.  Section 4.7 should be in the agreement. Sorry for the confusion.

I am confused!  The first document did NOT have 4.7.  The second
e-mail HAS 4.7 included.  Is it supposed to be in or out?

Thanks

Janie K.

 I inadvertently sent a draft a draft with Section 4.7.  Please see the
attached and disregard the previous.
