 Further to our conversation, with regards to the contracts, ENA prefers  two separate agreements one for each enitity. For accounting and legal reasons two agreements are necessary.  I will prepare a draft   for Kentucky Utilities Company if you wish to move forward.  Let me have your thoughts regarding this issue.
