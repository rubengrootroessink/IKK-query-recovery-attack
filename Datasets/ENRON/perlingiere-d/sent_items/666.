Debra - At your request (sorry for the delay) attached are two files.  The
ENAUPSTRAM.doc file contains the original Special Provisions that ENA
prevously provided attached to your GISB contract.  The BP Legal Department
has appproved the use of your Special Provisions provided that you include a
proper definition of "Committed Gas" to same.  The GISBSpecProv2.doc file
contains additional Special Provisions requested by the BP Legal Department.
Please review and advise if these are acceptable.  Thank you for your
assistance in this matter.
