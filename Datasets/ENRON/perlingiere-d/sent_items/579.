How much fun!!!!!!!  If I were younger I would  try technical climbing.  It requires lots of upper body strength as you know.  I envy you that sounds like great fun.  Let me know when you do Longs Peak!!

That is good news.  Now we have the GISB to finish off.

As for your question, I have been hiking, but not as much as I would like.
Actually, I'm hoping to pick up a weekend of intense instruction in
technical rock climbing near Estes Park in the near future.  The brother of
a friend is a serious climber and instructor who gives private lessons to
fund his ever-expanding collection of climbing toys.
