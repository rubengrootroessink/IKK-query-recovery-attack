On Saturday, Sept. 22, 2001 at approximately 1:47 a.m., I was awaken by the=
 sounds of a car crash.  As I jumped out of bed and looked out my bedroom w=
indow at Hwy 36, I saw nothing and went back to bed and fell asleep.  At ap=
proximately 2:45 a.m., I was awaken by the sounds of a man outside my bedro=
om window requesting an ambulance for someone cut up pretty bad.  As I jump=
ed out of bed and looked out my bathroom window, I saw a police officer out=
side with a flash light.  I woke Keith up to tell him the police were in ou=
r yard.  Keith dressed and went out the front door.  The officer told Keith=
 to get back inside because an armed suspect was running around our home.  =
Keith came back inside and told me what was going on.  After checking on An=
drew, we went into Chasity's vacant bedroom and looked out the window into =
the backyard.  Men with flash lights, police cars with spot lights were all=
 over our yard.  Finally, the suspect was spotted behind the pecan tree clo=
ses to our house.  The officers drew their guns and ordered the suspect to =
surrender.  Since the suspect would not cooperate, an officer shouted sever=
al times that he was going to "shoot".  This was not something I wanted to =
witness, so I quit looking out the window.  Keith told me that he surrender=
ed and that they had him in custody.  An officer starting knocking on our f=
ront door.  As I opened the door, I informed the officer that my husband wo=
uld be right there.  Keith went outside to talk to the officer.  I looked o=
ut my living room window and saw my driveway full of police cars followed b=
y an ambulance.  Hwy 36 and Meadow Lane were full of police cars with their=
 spot lights pointed toward our house.  Keith came inside and informed me t=
hat Buccee's in Brazoria had been robbed and a young lady had been abducted=
, the ambulance was for her and the suspect didn't have a gun, but was carr=
ying a knife.  Keith informed me that I did hear a crash and that the truck=
 they were in is laying on its passenger side on the other side of our barn=
.  The police were outside video taping our front yard, treating it as a cr=
ime scene.  Once the police took off with the suspect and the ambulance tra=
nsported the victim, Keith talked me into going outside and looking at the =
crash.  By this time, a wrecker was at the scene.  We watched the wrecker d=
river pull the truck back onto all four tires and haul it away.

On Sunday morning at approximately 2:30 a.m., I woke up and started listeni=
ng for a re-run of the events that took place 24 hours earlier.  Once I rea=
lized that my home was safe, I went back to sleep. =20

With a troubled mind, I realized that I did not know how to deal with "viol=
ence". I called my brother-in-law, Rev. Dale Frankum, for answers.  Dale su=
ggested I read the book of Psalm.  Gladys suggested particularly Chapter 91=
.  After reading Psalm 91:4 "He will cover you with his feathers, and under=
 his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and r=
ampart", I found peace of mind.  I now know that He put me back to bed, ins=
tead of me searching for an answer to the crash that woke me up which put a=
 violent man outside my home.  And He kept my son in a deep sleep so that A=
ndrew would not witness the horror that was going on right outside his bedr=
oom window.  At this time, all Andrew knows is that someone had a wreck in =
our front yard, I would like to spare him from the rest of the story.

As our country heals from the events of Sept. 11, 2001 and as we continue t=
o fear more terrorist attacks, I suggest you read the book of Psalm to find=
 peace of mind because He is our refuge.

My God Bless you, your family and America.
