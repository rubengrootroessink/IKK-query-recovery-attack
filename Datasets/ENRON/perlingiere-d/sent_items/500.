The draft of the GAS Master was sent to Select in November of 2000.  As I am preparing to negotiate this do you want to change the credit terms?

Credit worksheets were sent out some time back for the preparation of an EEI, ISDA and Master Gas.  Since the ISDA and EEI have now been fully negotiated and executed, it would be a good place to start by reviewing these contracts. I believe the attys working on these were Carol St. Claire and Bob Bruce.  Please send a copy to credit for review prior to sending out to Select.

  Select is ready to negotiate the attached agreement prepared in 11/2000.  Do you have any changes to the credit section?  Please advise.
