Debra - 

We've been tasked with creating a customer database and cultivating some new 
clients.  I will be covering the state of Wisconsin.  I need to know if the 
attached companies have Master Physicals or GISBs with ENA.

Sorry to be a pain and I don't need it this afternoon - but if you could fill 
it in as whenever you get a chance, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks - 
Deirdre
