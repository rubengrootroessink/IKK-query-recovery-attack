I have reviewed suggested revisions to Greene's agreement.   We will not 
agree to suggested changes to section 3.3 regarding purchase obligations 
because of capacity constraints.  The remainder of Greene's requests are ok.  
I have not discussed  these issues with Greene.   Do you want me to talk to 
them?
