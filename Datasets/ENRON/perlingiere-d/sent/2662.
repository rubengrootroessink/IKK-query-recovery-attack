Bad news.  Even though I was able to get the Tagg numbers (NE2988 and NE3039, 
respectively), the only things in Livelink were the deal tickets.  Please 
call Ellen Wallumrod at x54099 - she may be able to pull something for you.  
I'm going to try and play around in Tagg and see if I can somewhere print the 
confirms, but Ellen's your best bet there.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
SBR x30569
