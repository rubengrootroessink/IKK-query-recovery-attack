Welcome back from your vacation.

We've got our GISB agreement in place, and gas is flowing.   However,
Metromedia Energy is still waiting on a Master Agreement so we can do some
term deals.  We've got the form of parent guaranty, and that's been
approved, so once we can fill in the dollar figure we'll have that taken
care of.

I have not yet seen a sample master agreement, so if you can email that to
me, it would speed things up a bit.

Thanks

Scott
