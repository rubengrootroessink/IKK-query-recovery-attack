Dear Debra:

As promised, here is a redraft of the language on the force majeure point:

"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery or transport gas from the Delivery Point(s) as a result of
an event of force majeure.  The parties further agree that the term
"Transporter" when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in
Sections 4.1. and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of
a transporter for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract
will apply to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received
from such Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."

Hopefully this reflects our discussions of yesterday and today.  Best
regards, Beth
