Pursuant to Carey Mendes' request, attached for your review and comments
please find the recently negociated form of  guarantee between Engage Energy
America and Enron Power Marketing. If this form is acceptable, we will
modify it to reflect your agreement with Engage (i.e. gas transactions as
opposed to power transactions).

Please contact Carey or me with any comments or revisions you may have.

Regards,

Robert Low
