It is great to hear from you!  Yes,  I was sad to see them move, but know it 
will be better for both.  We have a lot catch up on.  I think you could give 
me some much need coaching  in a few areas.  As for the  "J" men,  well I 
think you have the better deal as I think mine as taken off.  Sorry to hear 
about Jason.  Would like to come for a visit, or meet you somewhere, say 
Santa Fe,  when time permits.
