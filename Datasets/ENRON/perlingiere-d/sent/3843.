EE prefers a neutral state for choice of law...NY law. You will see some
changes marked to the special provisions. Please review & reply.  Please
make any additional comments, if necessary.  Attached, you will find EE's
special provisions.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact myself at
412-395-2623 or via e-mail.

Thanks,
Lachon R. Ellman

Henry:

Will you review the special provisions?  I've already noted the State Choice
of Law...Texas, which I will propose a neutral state.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Lachon
