I am preparing a re-draft of a previous agreement for this Canadian company.  
Credit terms default for Duke Guarantor is 25M/ 50M for Enron.  Triggering 
event for both parties is 10M w/ 250 multiples.  Do you want to change 
these?  It is my understanding we have guaranties in place.    Please advise 
asap.

Thanks!
