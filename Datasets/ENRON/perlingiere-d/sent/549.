Bernadette,

Given the amount of time that has expired sense we started working on this, I 
thought it would be a good idea for you to review the agreement again with 
regards to our agreed changes and respective guaranties.   Please let me know 
if I failed to incorporate any revisions.  I will forward originals for 
execution upon approval from  your.



Best Regards,
