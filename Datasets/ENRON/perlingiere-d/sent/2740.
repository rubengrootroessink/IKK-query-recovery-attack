Debra,

I have filled in the customer information on this GISB.  Could you please 
make the correction to the "number" that you mentioned that I had wrong this 
morning.  Once that change is made, if you would forward it back to me, and I 
will send it to the customer, or you can send it to him at 
dlittle@samedan.com and copy me.



Thanks,
Judy Thorne
