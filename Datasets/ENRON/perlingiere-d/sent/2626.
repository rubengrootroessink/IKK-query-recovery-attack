Ms. Perlingiere:

Gloria Salazar and Greg Hall asked that I let you know that we received the
Gas Purchase Agreement for our PA facility today.  Before it is executed,
Gloria has asked our legal group to review it.  They are doing that now;
however, it will be Monday before she will have their comments.  The plant
in PA will not be ready to sell gas until Tuesday, possibly Wednesday, and
we anticipate that the agreement will be in place by then.  Although Greg
will be out of town next week, Gloria will be able to talk with you.  If you
have questions, please contact her on Monday.
