Deb,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding the guaranty.  This form of guaranty 
appears to be fine however,  Enron North America Corp. needs to be 
incorporated as well as  references to physical gas transactions.  

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere
