H.L. Jacobson
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company

Further to our discussion Friday, concerning certain confirmations for 
ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company, I have determined the following: first, 
ExxonMobil  or HPL may confirm transactions as agreed at the time of the 
trade; second, in the event HPL confirms,  we have made changes to our system 
which should prevent the  issuance of  GTCs for Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing 
Company trades, with the exception of "online" trades, therefore causing  
future trades relating to these agreements to attach to one of two contracts 
under discussion  Friday.   Please bear in mind these changes may not be in 
effect until the end of next week.  With regards to confidentiality language 
contained in the confirm, we are unable to amend this at this time.

Finally, concerning the August 8th letter (confirmation) provided by you in 
the meeting, we are in agreement with same.

We trust the foregoing meets with your approval.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact me with any questions you may have regarding this matter.
