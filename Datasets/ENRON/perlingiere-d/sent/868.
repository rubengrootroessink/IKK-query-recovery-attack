Thanks  for your e-mail regarding a master with Reliant Energy Services 
Canada, Ltd.  ENA has a Canadian form of contract we could work with which 
will have most of your changes already contained.  If we use the U.S. master 
there are problems with provisions regarding taxes, arbitration etc.  so I 
would like to suggest we use the Canadian form with your changes as needed.  
Please let me have your thoughts.
