Debra,

Attached below is a slightly revised Mac language for the Aquila Master.  
After speaking to Aquila today, we should execute both HPL and ENA Masters 
simultaneously (as both documents were sent over for their review at the same 
time--especially since we do so much business w/ENA & Aquila and the Master 
is so old).

Please confirm the above for me and let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks and I apologize for the delay in getting back to you,

Veronica

Debra,

I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.

This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
from our "approved" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
standard language in case the "bandwidth" version is not acceptable to
Enron's gas Credit people.

We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
appreciate all of your assistance!
