Debra -- The delay from my side was due to a change in the approach where the 
LNG people now do not want to use an offshore company.  Therefore we should 
use the following as the counterparty:

Enron LNG Marketing, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

The address would be the Three Allen Center address on Clay St., 18th floor.

Thanks -- David
