Debra,
 I am not showing that we have a file on New Gaskom. We are showing a PMTM 
loss of approx ($150,000) for physical forwards/swaps that were done on 
12/22/99. As of now, the answer from Credit, is that we would like to see 
financial statments to set an appropriate line. Please call if you have any 
questions.

-Darren

Do you have  any credit issues w/ NW?   They would like to have a GISB.   
Previously we had a GISB in place, but has "trade suspended".   Please advise.

Thanks!
