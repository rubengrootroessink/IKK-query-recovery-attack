Paul,

A fully executed agreement will be placed in the mail today  for your 
records.  However,  Enron Corp.'s guaranty  has not been included as I await 
signature from the corporate office.  Upon receipt of same,  I will send an 
original for your records.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions or I can 
be of further assistance.

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere
