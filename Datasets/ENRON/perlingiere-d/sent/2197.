Marcia,

I have completed my review of the revised Special Revisions my remarks are as 
follows:

We do not agree to the first paragraph.

1. Agreed
2. Agreed
3. Agreed
4. Agreed
5. Agreed
6. Agreed with change in wording.'
7. Agreed
8. Agreed to with exception of (ii).

We do not agree to suggested addition of Sections 10.3 and 10.4.

9 and 10.  Agreed
11. Agreed
12. Agreed
13. We do not agree to this language.

Because the Special Provisions are part of the agreement there is no need for 
additional signature.

Finally,  Enron perfers to be confirming party of all transactions.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
