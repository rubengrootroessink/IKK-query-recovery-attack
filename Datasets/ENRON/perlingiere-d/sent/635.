Please forgive my slow response.  We don't have a problem with the
confirmation itself.  It was the general terms and conditions that we didn't
want to agree to without review.  It would be best to execute a master gas
agreement that would accommodate longer term deals.  Attached is our Master
Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement.
