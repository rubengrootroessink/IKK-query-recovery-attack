Debra,

Ok, we're getting there.  Please see comments below.

1. Good, please prepare the draft Master Agreement and send it to my 
attention.
 We've been doing business with Enron since 1996, so the credit review
shouldn't be a problem.  You can probably find everything you need on our home
page (www.pplweb.com) or call Alan Babp at (610) 774-6129 { 
aababp@pplweb.com}.

2. We're at a stalemate on the confirmations.  I have checked with out
electrical side and their negotiated contract with Enron uses "Seller
Confirms".  For Gas GISB contracts while we prefer "PPL Confirms", we 
recognize
that almost everyone wants to be the confirming party so we have been 
accepting
"Both".  But if you can't accept either of them, I suppose we can live with
"Seller Confirms", since our electrical side has accepted it.  Those are our
choices, in order of preference.

3. Good, I'm pleased you agree to the "redundant" language.  I know it will
help my Trading Controls people.

Please advise...again, I think we're close.
Gary  Shay

Gary,

Thank you for your e-mail of 15 March,  my comments  are as follows:

1. PPL EnergyPlus, LLC:    we will be happy to prepare a draft of a Master
Agreement for your consideration pending ENA credit review;

2. Confirmations:  ENA will NOT agree to both parties confirming,  unless
ENA's confirm is controlling.  If agreed  PPL may also send a confirm with
this understanding;

3, Disclaimer:  we will agree to included  verbiage as requested in the
