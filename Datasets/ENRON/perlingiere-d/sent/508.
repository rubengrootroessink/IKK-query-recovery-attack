Debra,

Craig Taylor  would like to have a GISB executed with Houston Energy Services 
Company LLC.  The contact there is Carol Wood 713-463-5040.  They are not set 
up in the system yet; I'm working on that at the moment.  All I have on them 
thus far is a D&B report.

Their address is 10497 Town & Country Way, #150  Houston, TX  77024.

If you need any other info, give me a call and I'll try to get it for you.

Thanks,

Veronica
