The Master Sale Spot  with Southern Union Company is still active on our 
system and thus has not been terminated.   Because this is old paper, we can 
replace  same with a new Master Sale Spot terminate it,  issue a newer 
version or prepare a GISB.    Does Southern no longer wish to trade under the 
Spot? .

Let me know how you want to trade (i.e. short or long term, firm etc. and I 
will prepare the agreement.  I need the exact name of the company and a 
contact, phone number.
