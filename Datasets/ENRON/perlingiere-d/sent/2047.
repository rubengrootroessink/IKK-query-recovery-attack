No,  I was waiting for you to tell me if Cutter  agreed  to the revisions, 
and  I needed to  discuss revisions w/ Jeff Hodge for approval.   I will send 
the agreement today pending your reply. Also,  there needs to be included 
into Article 1. the following: 

(after "Term") provided this Agreement shall continue to apply to all 
Transactions then in effect until all Transactions are completed.  

Article3.  delete "Exclusive Commitment and Representations and Warranties".

Please advise.

Thanks!
