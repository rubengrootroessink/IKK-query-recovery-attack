Hello Debra:

Regarding your comments to Jeff Mayer of MxEnergy:

I spoke directly with Veronica and she never asked that the GISB be
co-signed.  Aquila will not co-sign GISB's.  Further, Veronica told me that
she would accept a guarantee from Aquila.  She had the format of the
guarantee in hand at the time we had the discussion.  Please contact me if
you have any further questions on this matter.  My number is 203-356-1318.

Thank you for your help in this matter.  We appreciate it and look forward to
expanding our relationship with Enron.
