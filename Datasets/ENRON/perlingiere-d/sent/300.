I have determined the GISBs referred to earlier were acquired by ENA through 
Columbia Energy Services.  I will be faxing those to you soon.  They are 
executed but in the name of 
CES.   Regarding those agreements, we have Consent Agreements for assignment 
from MarkWest.

Concerning the Master Sale Spot Agreement dated 5-1-90,  I have located same 
and will send you a fax of it as well.

I agree, with your suggestion to terminate the previous agreements and we can 
begin with a new GISB.   I have not yet determined , do you know if there are 
any trades booked under any of these contracts?   If so, we can move them to 
the new agreement,
