I pulled Dan in to listen to the voice mail.  Dan says, to go ahead and write 
a new Master under the new name w/ whom ever the guarantor is as long as you 
are comfortable with this.  After the new agreement is executed, we can move 
the old transactions over to the new Master as necessary.

With regards to Heartland's legal stauts, I will do the due diligence. 

Have a good time!!!!
