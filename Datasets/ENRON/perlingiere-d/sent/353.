I have completed my review of  International Paper's Natural Gas Sales and 
Purchase Agreement as requested.  As constructed, there are numerous 
revisions that would need to be made for this agreement to be acceptable.  

Having said that, are you aware we currently have in place a Master Sale Firm 
Agreement  with IP dated May 5, 1995?   

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
