I don't think so.  I bought the gas based on Index, no fixed price.

Subject: Shanner


I have sent a Gas Purchase Agreement as requested to Jim Shanner for 
signature.  Are there any transactions which need to be confirmed under the 
new agreement??  

Mr. Shanner is curious as to price etc.  Could you contact him regarding this 
issue and let me know.

Thanks!
