I have been in contact with your customer Greely regarding a GISB and or 
Master.   It is my understanding they wish to trade firm long term  (1 year 
or greater)   I have related to them ENA will not go past 30 days on firm 
delivery with a GISB and suggest consideration of a Master.

Please advise how you want to proceed.
