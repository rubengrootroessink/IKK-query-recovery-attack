I have some questions regarding Jennifer's e-mail attached below.  

Is this interruptible?
Is this a CES contract?

Here is the information regarding the John Singer deal we talked about.

Buyer - ENA
Seller - Questa Petroleum Company 

1,588 MMBtu per day at Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. for October 01, 2000 
through October 31, 2000.
Price is equal to US Dollars $3.15710 per MMBtu.
Interruptible Gas
Contract - Master Purch Wellhead

This deal was originally confirmed as an Oct-Dec delivery of firm gas....on a 
GTC-Firm...so revised language might want to be included in your confirm(??)

Also, there are only two active trades with Oasis Pipeline Company which are 
October Transportation deals...and I don't confirm.

Please let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks
