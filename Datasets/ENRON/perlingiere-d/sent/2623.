One of them had diarrhea on Monday night / Tuesday morning.  I took her to
the vet and they gave me pills for her.  After that she has been fine.
Sounds like yours really had it bad.  Mine may not have had a virus though.
It may just have been coincidental.  I hope that Tizzer and Geronimo are
better now.  Hope that things are going well.  Our business, hence our
department also, announced that we will be cutting a few positions/people
very soon.  We are all laying low.  Oh well, we shall see.

Take care of you!
