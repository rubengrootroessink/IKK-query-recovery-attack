I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your 
provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last 
sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these 
recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are 
founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a 
provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these 
recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.

 
Best regards,
