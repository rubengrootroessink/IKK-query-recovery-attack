We cannot assign this agreement to HPL.  Although the billing was in error, 
the transaction was confirmed under, and rightfully so Enron North America.  
We of course will correct our records and future billing statements.

We are sorry for any inconvenience.  Please let me know if I can be of 
further assistance.
