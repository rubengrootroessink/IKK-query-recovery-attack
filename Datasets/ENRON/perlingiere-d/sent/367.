Yes, I have heard about the changes in your life.  I  will make some inquires 
and get back with you.      Did you look at Enron.com in the job bank?   My 
CD player has cost the price of a VERY good bottle of something to have 2 
extracted!  NOT my fault.  It is working only as a single player, the changer 
cannot be trusted.

  
Have a great weekend,  I  will be in touch!
