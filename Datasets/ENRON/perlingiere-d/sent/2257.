Beth,

My last e-mail should have read as follows ending with "volumes". =20

Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is=20
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the =01&Repurchasers=018=
) to=20
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).    The parti=
es=20
further agree that the term =01&Transporter=018 when used in this Contract,=
=20
including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any=20
company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agr=
ee=20
that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such=20
Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the=
=20
same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any su=
ch=20
Repurchaser, Enron and NEGM  scheduled and nominated the same volumes.  =20

In the event this is not acceptable, please let me know how you would like=
=20
this Section to read.  With regards to imbalances,  I would direct you to=
=20
section 4.3.  As an example, if  Enron nominates 10MMbtus and only 8 are=20
placed in the line,  2 will be made up by the transporter  the cost is=20
Enrons, and 10 would be delivered to NEGM.   And so the  opposite holds for=
=20
NEGM.  If 10 could not be accepted by NEGM, its transporter would respond=
=20
accordingly, and NEGM would be responsible for the cost.

Enron's  concern is with NEGM's desire to claim force majeure as a result o=
f=20
an event by its customer downstream.  Force majeure must  take place at the=
=20
delivery point..=20

Hope this helps!  Have a great weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
