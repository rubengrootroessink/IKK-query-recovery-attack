Dear WEN Members-2000:

We have not received your 2001 membership applications.  You are in danger of 
being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving 
monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see 
attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon
meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular
mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by
regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future
meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for
whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their
notices by regular mail.

Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached
meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon
since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you
approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would
be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward
the attached luncheon notice to them.

Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter
on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending
you your next newsletter in April.

For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future
to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We
value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly
appreciated.

Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN
members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900)
beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!

Leesa Foster
President of Women's Energy Network - 2001
