Debra - Attached is a bank copy of the format letter submitted back in April
regarding the changes.
I know that you forwarded to me a copy of an agreement initially between ENA
and BNG (the CES predecessor) but unfortunately, all of our files are in
boxes (just moved office areas)so I can not locate immediately.  If you want
to, we can re-generate a copy for ENA with the applicable terms of the
referenced agreement (title of the agreement and effective date is all I
need), and forward to you.

Let me know if you can help me with this new request ----then we can take
care of it right away.

Thanks- Vangie
