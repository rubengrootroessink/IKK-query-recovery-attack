Have you talked to Kurt re Sat?  I will talk to him tonight.  Can we start at 
5:00?   Are you sure we want to use that   "Jen Air"   I have certain 
memories  that thing.  Have you used it?  

I thought we might grill some vegetables on it.  I will bring stuff for 
cheese dip and what ever else.   How many of us will be there?
