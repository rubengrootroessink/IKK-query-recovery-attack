Attached are the Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement for JM Huber.
    
Revisions are as follows:
No changes were made to the Transaction Agreement.  However,  on page two the 
sixth line in the section "Condition Precedent" please fill in the correct 
date and have Huber initial.

Concerning the Master: Page1-3; Line 7 beginning with "Customer" [or its 
Guarantor] has been deleted.  On the signature page "JW" has been changed to 
J.M.  In Appendix 1: "EBITDA Coverage Ratio" has been deleted and  "Net 
Income" has been moved and placed in alpha order.  Finally, please fill in 
the name of the state in the blank on the first page in the first paragraph.

For execution:  print two of each  document and have Huber sign and return 
same to my attention.  I will forward a set of originals for their records 
upon final execution.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.
