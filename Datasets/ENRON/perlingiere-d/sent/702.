Cary,

Thanks for your e-mail.   Your suggestion to rephrase the second sentence of 
number 6 is acceptable with one change.  Could we change "may be used" to 
"shall be used" in the sentence beginning with "Each".

Finally, my attorney insists  Enron be the confirming party in Section 2.5. 

Pending these changes, we are ready to finalize.

Thanks!
