Please see the attached Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.

We are in receipt of signed faxes of the Transaction Agreement and Master 
Agreement however,  we also need signed originals.  To that end,  "DRAFT" has 
been removed from the attached documents for execution.  Please note, on the 
first page of the Master Agreement  and Exhibit "C"  the blank  after "a".  
Determine  the state of  incorporation for Huber, and file in the name of the 
state.

Finally,  print two of each document,  have signed and send both to my 
attention. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.
