In preparing for our meeting with Exxon, I have hit a dead end with regards 
to the "Agreement"  he cites in his fax to us.  I have searched and others as 
well to no avail.    Therefore,  would you ask Jacobson to fax  you/me  the 
entire agreement he is referring too because it does not exist in our world.  

Thanks!
