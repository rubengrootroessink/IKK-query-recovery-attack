Debra,
The attached is a Parent Guaranty which we need to have completed for
Pioneer's continuance of spot sales with ENA Upstream Company, LLC. Please
have it signed by an officer of Enron Corp. and include the company
Secretary Certificate evidencing the authority of the officer signing on
behalf of Enron. Thank you for a prompt turnaround, and if you have any
questions, please email or call me at 972-969-3667.
