Dear Debra,

It is great to hear from you.  I just took a practice
exam.  I consisted of 3 essays from 9-12, then a one
hour lunch break, then a 3 hour performance test.  I
think I did well on the essays, but not the
performance exam.    I pretty much spend most of my
time sudying.  this whole bar thing is quite an
undertaking.  I do not know how people pass it, but
they do.  It is a lot of work and sometimes you just
hit these walls, but I have rebounded prety quick.

BErkely is quite an interresting place.  I have seen
more Freaks here than in Austin during college easily.
 It is like they bread them here.  At first, it was
funny and I liked it, but now it has become so normal
for me to see a guy with a nose ring, and a tattoo
over his adam apple(Ouch!), that they are just another
person.  I have met some people, but I do not hand out
with people here very much.  I knew that coming here,
but at times it does get lonely.

The women here are quite average.  I think I was very
spoiled in Texas.  Texas women are beautiful.

I am house sitting for my uncle in San Francisco for
the 4th of July weekend.  So it is a nice break from
bar reviewing, bt I did bring all my books.

I still think of you guys a lot.  Please tell everyone
that I say hello.

So has the new parking garage been built yet ot what.

Take care....Yaron Shaham

Finally, because I know you would want to know, I do
not have a BOYfriend, yet there was this one guy I
met, oops, uh nevermind.
