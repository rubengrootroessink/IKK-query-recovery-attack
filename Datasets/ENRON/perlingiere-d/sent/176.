Bernadette,

In response to your fax of May 15th, attached is a draft of a GISB between 
Enron and Delmarva.  

Please review and me your comments and or questions and I will complete the 
draft.  Also, as you can tell I need information billing, invoice, 
information etc.

Very truly yours,
Debra Perlingiere
