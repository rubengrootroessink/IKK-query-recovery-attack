Bernadette,

I have been advised by our people that the error regarding online trading has 
been corrected.  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.  Also, 
I have placed in overnight delivery a fully executed GISB for your records.

Finally,  please let me know if you have any questions regarding the Master 
agreement.  We will need to put a Master in place for any transactions in 
excess of 30 days.

Regards,
