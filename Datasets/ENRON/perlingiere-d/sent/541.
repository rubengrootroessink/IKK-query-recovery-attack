As an update, it is my understanding negotiations are still on going 
regarding Connective's Guaranty to Enron.

Please let me know if my information is incorrect.  If acceptable to you, I 
will proceed with the changes to the agreement as agreed and forward same to 
you for final review in anticipation of a draft of the guaranty.

Best Regards,
