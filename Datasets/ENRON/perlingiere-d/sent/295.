FYI,
In reference to your memo of May 5th,  I prepared and sent a new Master to 
Pan on May 1st.  Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at 
Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker 
(713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one 
in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new 
agreement when he had time.
