Paramy,

I did receive your e-mails and apologize for my late response.  Yes, I will 
be the negotiating person for the agreement with the exception of credit 
terms and issues, but will also be involved in the background with credit.  

I hope to  e-mail you my comments by the end of next week.

Regards,
