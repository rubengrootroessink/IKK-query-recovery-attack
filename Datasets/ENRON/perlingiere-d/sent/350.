Rob, 
 
I have completed revisions to the attached GISB as discussed.  We agree to 
your Special Provisions.  Please note this version will not show your special 
provisions as I am in the process of integrating same.  

Please review the GISB and let me know if you have any questions or 
comments.  I will prepare execution documents.

Best regards,
