Please see below.   Katalin Kiss of TransAlta has requested  an electronic 
copy of our final draft?  Are you OK with this?  If so,  the only version I 
have is the original draft without revisions.

Could we get a soft copy of the Eneron Contract that was executed in
January of this year.  I have soft copy of the Draft however not the final
executed version (this was negotiated by Barry Tyholoz of your office and
Tom Coyle of TransAlta). Thanks, Katalin Kiss
