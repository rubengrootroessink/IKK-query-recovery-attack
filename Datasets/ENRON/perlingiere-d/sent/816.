Nancy,

Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral 
Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a 
"writing" and to have been "signed".  For all transactions under the GISB, a 
written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  "Oral" 
on the first page.   

I am checking on the status of the term deal. 

Regards,
