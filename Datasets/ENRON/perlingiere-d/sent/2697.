Jim,

Attached is an Amendment to the Base Contract for Short-Term Sale and 
Purchase of Natural Gas (GISB) changing Section 2.5 to Enron as the 
Confirming Party.   If in agreement, please print and sign two originals and 
send same to my attention at the address below.  Upon final signature I will 
forward an original for your records.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call with any questions you may have 
concerning this matter.
