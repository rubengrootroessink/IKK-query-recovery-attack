Victoria,

Now it is my turn to apologize for a late response.  Having said that, I have 
reviewed your remarks regarding the GISB my comments are as  follows:

Section 1.2   Transactions may be negotiated orally or online.  In either 
case Enron will  send a written confirmation via fax or electronic for  the 
trade.  I hope this helps in clearing any confusion regarding the oral 
designation in Section1.2.

Section 7.2 With regards ACH, I am waiting on a response from my accounting 
dept.

Section 13.5 Concerning jurisdiction we will agree to  New York.


Please let me have your thoughts regards these issues.

Regards,
