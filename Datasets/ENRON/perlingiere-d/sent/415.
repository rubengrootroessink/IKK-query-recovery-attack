	Office: Save As... responds very slowly when naming the file
Mike Hernandez on 06/12 at 10:04 AM
Category: Applications 


Problem: When a document is created or renamed using the Save As option under 
the File menu, the system responds very slowly when typing in a file name.

Cause: Office keeps a directory full of shortcuts to recently opened files.  
As this directory gets larger, the problem starts to occur.

Resolution: Delete the h:\application data\microsoft\office\recent 
directory.  It will be re-created when the next file is saved.  Note: This is 
a workaround, as this directory will re-populate itself over time and the 
problem will resurface.  A long-term solution is being researched.
