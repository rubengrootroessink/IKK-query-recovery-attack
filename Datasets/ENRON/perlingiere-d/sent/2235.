Gary,

Thanks for your e-mail,  attached is a sample of our Master.  I notice we 
currently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?

In response to your previous e-mail my comments  are as follows:

We cannot agree to both parties confirming.  ENA prefers to be the confirming 
party.

Section 13.5  NY law is fine.

Our netting language is a stated below:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

Your suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract is 
not necessary as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first page in 
the disclaimer.  With regards to limitation, we do not limit transactions to 
one year.



Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need to speak 
to someone in your office for credit information.
