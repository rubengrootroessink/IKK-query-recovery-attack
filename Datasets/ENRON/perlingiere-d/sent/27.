Debra:
I need a confidentiality for Ball Corporation.
I believe the same one we used for Battle Mountain Gold would suffice. I 
would be looking at their physical supply contracts in order to:
a) supply them centrally physically
and b) offer risk managment services.
Can I have this today?
Thanks
Jen
