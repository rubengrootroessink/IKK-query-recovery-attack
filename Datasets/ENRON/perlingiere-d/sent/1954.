John,

The only remaining points at issue concerning the GISB are as follows:

Section 1.2   change to "Oral".  As you may recall in our previous 
discussion,  Enron will always send a written confirm.   

Section 10.1 supplement:  Agree to purposed language save "two day",  please 
revise to "5 business days".

If in agreement with changes above, please prepare final document and send 
for our execution.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
