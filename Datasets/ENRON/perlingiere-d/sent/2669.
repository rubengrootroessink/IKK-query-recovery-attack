Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
SBR
