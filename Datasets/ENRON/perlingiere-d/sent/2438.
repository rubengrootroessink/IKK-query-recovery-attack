Since you were inquiring of his number, I thought you might want to know this!

I received a voicemail from Will this morning.  Kimberly had 4 baby girls.  
Will did not leave any information on the babies, just that they are very 
small.  He will be out of the office for a few days but will be checking 
voicemail.  I will send flowers from the department.
