Debra,

I think this just takes us back to your Feb. 22 proposal.  Since the second
sentence seems to be somewhat problematic for Enron, we will withdraw our
request for that sentence.  My only other change would be that the ".1"
appearing after the "4" and the "11" in the last sentence should also be
deleted.

Hopefully this will resolve the issue.

Best regards,  Beth

Beth,

We will agree to this version with the following changes:

"Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is
purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the "Repurchasers") to
whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).  In addition
to any other circumstances for which NEGM is entitled to claim force
majeure
pursuant to this Contarct, Enron agrees that NEGM as Buyer shall be
entitled
to claim force majeure if a Repurchaser purchasing gas from NEGM is unable
to take delivery of gas as a result of an event of force majeure at such
Delivery Point)s).  The parties further agree that the term "Transporter"
when used in this Contract, including, but not limited to, in Sections 4.1.
and 11.1, shall include any company acting in the capacity of a transporter
for any Repurchaser and agree that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply
to invoices from such Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such
Transporters to the same extent as if such invoices were received
by NEGM, provided that any such Repurchaser scheduled and nominated the
same
volumes as Enron and NEGM scheduled and nominated on behalf of such
Repurchaser at the Delivery Point(s)."


Please let me have your thoughts.
