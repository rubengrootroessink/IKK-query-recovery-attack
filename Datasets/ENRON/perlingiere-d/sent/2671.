Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.
