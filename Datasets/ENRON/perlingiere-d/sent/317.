Sorry for the confusion.  Yes, you did send special provisions and the GISB.  
My comments to each of these are as follows.

GISB

Section 2.5 We would like for ENA or "Seller" to confirm.

Section 2.24 Gas Daily --Midpoint

Section 13.5 We will agree to Texas or New York  jurisdictions.


Special Provisions

Section 1.2, Oral Transaction Procedure:

In third line of  the suggested paragraph, delete  "for purposes of Section 
2.201(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code".

Section 7.5

We suggest the following language:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the 
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be 
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through 
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount 
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.


Please do not hesitate to contact me with you questions or comments.  
Attached is our information sheet for the GISB.
