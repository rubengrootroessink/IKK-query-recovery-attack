Although the Clark County gas deal is moving slower than I'd like it to, it 
is very much a live deal.  Thanks to all of you for your patients and 
assistance thus far.  Its being held up by the Master Agreement which their 
credit representative (Reid Grossmann) will be working on it AGAIN tomorrow.  
He will be in Houston and asked if he might meet with Debra and Jay in 
person.  He has assured me that our issues are being taken care of today.  
Since they still have some of their own issues, he is of the opinion that 
nothing can happen before Friday.  I intend to keep the heat on them and 
fully anticipate they will - at some point - transact.

Thanks Again,

Dave Fuller
