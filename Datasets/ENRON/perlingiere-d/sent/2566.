Alan,

In response to your phone call,  I too had to refresh my mind its 
MONDAY!!.    I will e-mail   later today a final version of the redline for 
execution.  You can print two originals, sign both and send same to my 
attention at the address below.   I will return a fully executed original for 
your records.  Should need to trade prior to full execution of the GISB,  
send me a fax with  signature.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or comments.

Best regards,
Debra Perlingiere
