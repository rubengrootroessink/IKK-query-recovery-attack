My friends and I would like to buy a table for the banquet April 9th and 
request that Bobby Reynolds #21 be at our table.  If this is not possible,  
we would like to see the list and pick another player.  Please let me know as 
soon as possible the cost for table and in additional single tickets.

Thanks
