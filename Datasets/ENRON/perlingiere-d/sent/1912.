Steve,

The necessary information for ENA has been placed in the attached draft as 
well as a few modifications to the front page.  In addition,  I have 
included  at the end of the GISB a list of Special Provisions for your 
review.  

Finally,  with regards to "agent",  would you fax me a copy of the Agency 
Agreement,  or is it possible for the agreement to be in the name of Murphy 
Exploration & Production Company.
