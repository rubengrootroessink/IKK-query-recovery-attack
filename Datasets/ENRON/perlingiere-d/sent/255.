Debra,
 Hey, I'm hoping maybe you can help me out. I know this is a stretch, but
I'm desperate.I'm working on a story for Image Magazine. It's about people
from around the world who have moved to Brazoria County and their
experiences here. I've done four stories from England to Australia, but
cannot locate anyone from Latin America. Do you know if Enron would have
someone from Central or South American and they now live in B.C.?
Susan
