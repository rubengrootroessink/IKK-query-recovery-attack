In a conversation with Randy Miller of Texla, the following credit issues 
were raised:

1.  Texla would like to raise their threshold to $200,000;
2.   In place of a LC  Texla would offer furture trades  within 24 hours.

As previously discussed, I can write the language, the decision is a credit  
call.
