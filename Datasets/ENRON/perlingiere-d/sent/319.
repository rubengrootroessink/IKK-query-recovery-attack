FYI, John Grass and  I spoke to Curt Hribernik  this morning regarding 
various issues in the Master.  There has been a change in their corporate 
structure such that it appears they may  have stronger financial backing or 
at the very least a change.    I requested they send documents reflecting 
ownership and name change.   Curt  indicated they would be able to provide a 
LC.   I told him he and or his credit dept. would need to discuss these 
issues with you before we could continue.

I will send you information when I receive same.
