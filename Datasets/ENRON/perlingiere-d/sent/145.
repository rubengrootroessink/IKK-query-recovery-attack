Sorry to hear about your car, been there.  Are we doing anything tonight?  I 
have not heard from anyone?   I would like to check things out at the church 
in Bz, but confess I would want someone to drive, and knowing that area it 
might not be the target rich environment we are looking for.  But, you never 
know!  

 I have plans to help you move next weekend if  you are still going on Sat.   
I am anxious to see the changes in your new home.  If  I do not see you this 
weekend, let me what time and where for Sat.
