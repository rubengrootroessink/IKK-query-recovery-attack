To whom it may concern:

For HE 14 through HE 16 we recieved a call from frontier to market their power on a real time basis.  The amount we were instructed to market for them was 8 mw.  During the phone conversation I instructed the dispatcher @ frontier to let us know if anything changes with regard to output or the unit status.  Close to the end of HE 17 we received a call informing us that the unit had just come on line and had 6mw to market.  I immediately called BPA and informed them of the situation and spoke at length with Mary in transmission.  She instructed me to revise our generation numbers with the BPA numbers desk and that we basically bought power from the imbalance.  If you have any questions please feel free to call me.

I believe there may be deals in enpower that have frontier selling to various counterparties since there was no price agreed upon by BPA and myself.  Please make sure that we pass on any liquidated damages or resupply costs to Frontier.

Sorry for the inconvenience...

Bert Meyers
