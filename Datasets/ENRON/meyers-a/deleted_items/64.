Bert,
I'll see you there. If you would rather meet downtown, we can meet at Leo's
on 11th and Taylor behind the Library. What works for you?
Tom

Tom:

Earlier I wrote that it would be easier for me to meet downtown because I
don't have my car.  However, Molly has made an unexpected trip to PA so I
have her car.  Meeting @ the Buffalo Gap is not a problem anymore.

Bert
