Virginia,

I think for HE 09, El Paso would have taken over the phones.  There may not be a deal in anyones log for that hour...although there should be.  I checked the El Paso log and it shows a sell to PNM for the amount specified.  Maybe someone bought it in the hour...that is the only reason the price would be that high as far as I can tell.  
Furthermore, I am sure we didn't do that much on the 11th anyway.  We basically bought everything we needed for EES from Wesco and left the office as it was the day of the terrorist attacks.  Maybe we should call EPE and check to see who they sold it to.
