Hi Bert!

Per AT&T, you have been authorized to take over this cell phone number; however, there is a deposit or 6 month pay history that needs to be provided. (Current balance is $0.00.) Please contact AT&T directly to complete the process (800.298.2158 or 800.888.7600). You will need to provide them with billing information (address, phone, SSN, DOB, etc.). If you have any problems, please let me know!

Thanks,
Grace

I was told by Kathryn @ AT&T to inform you of my wishes to keep the current number and contract for my cell phone...of course once I give them a call.

If you have any questions please feel free to call.

Thanks,

Bert
