Hey Bert,

I'm sure you knew that the Clintons were total dirtbags, but Hillary may ha=
ve hit a new low.  Apparently, Hillary said that Chelsea was endangered by =
the attack.  But Chelsea gave a contradictory interview, saying that she wa=
tched the attack from a friend's apartment.

Later,

David.

Though, as usual, the elite media ignores it, some (Drudge, Wash Times, NY =
Post, Fox) are highlighting the contradiction in stories between Hillary an=
d Chelsea as to Chelsea's 9/11 experience. Just after 9/11, Hillary told Ja=
ne Pauley that Chelsea "had gone on what she thought would be a great jog. =
She was going down to the Battery Park; she was going to go around the towe=
rs. She went to get a cup of coffee and - that's when the plane hit." Hilla=
ry said Chelsea heard the plane hit the WTC and saw the smoke in person. Ho=
wever, Chelsea penned a piece for Talk magazine that stated, "On the mornin=
g it happened I was at my friend Nicole Davison's apartment, near Union Squ=
are in Manhattan. That morning we had gotten up and grabbed coffee, and the=
n she took the subway to work while I bought a paper and headed back to her=
 apartment. I had just walked in when she called from work. A plane had jus=
t crashed into the World Trade Center, she said. I should stay put and she'=
d call me back when she knew more. I turned on the television and watched a=
s the second plane hit." Chelsea writes she "spent the nightmarish day of t=
he Twin Towers attacks in complete mental chaos -- roaming the city, obsess=
ing over" W's tax cut while singing Humpty Dumpty to herself. Where did she=
 learn how to personalize national tragedy and inject partisan politics at =
