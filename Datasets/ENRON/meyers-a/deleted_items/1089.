BILL,

I RECIEVED A CALL FROM MPC ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON.  THE PERSON THERE INFORMED ME THAT IPC MAY TAKE UP TO 60 MW OF GENERATION ON MONDAY FROM MPC.  I THINK I REMEMBER THIS AS BEING ONE OF THE MPC CONTRACT OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE ONGOING WITH IPC.  REGARDLESS I FEEL THIS IS IMPORTANT INFO AS WE MAY NOT HAVE MPC ONPEAK FOR MONDAY AS IT SOMETIMES RELATES TO ENRON ONLINE TRADING.

CALL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS.

BERT MEYERS
