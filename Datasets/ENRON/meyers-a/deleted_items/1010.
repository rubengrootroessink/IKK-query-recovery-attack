Group,
Enron is attempting to reconcile the daily activities of each counterparty with us. This includes when each counterparty cut us, and schedules that were moved. To facilitate these efforts please put all cuts and scheduling sheets in the accordion file on the RT overflow desk (where Kate used to sit).

Also, stay tuned for new information on EPE. Apparently the information communicated by Tony was not completely correct.

Thanks,

Bill
