Please make sure to check the new schedule for real time for the rest of the month of August.  Due to Ryan becomming the EOL trader for real time...we had to make some adjustments to the schedule.  I tried to make as fair for all as possible.  If you have any concerns please see me to see if there is anything I can do to help.

Also please give me any requests for Sept as I am going to be making it soon.
