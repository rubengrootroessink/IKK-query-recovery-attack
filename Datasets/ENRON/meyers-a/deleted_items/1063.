FYI -

All trades done on behalf of El Paso will now be directly billed by El Paso. This means three things for us:

1. Format of the model stays the same. 
2. Deals do not go into Enpower.
3. "Counterparty" in the model must show the billing counterparty only (to simplify Kathy's settlement process).

*Per El Paso, please try to market their power through SRP, PNM, PAC, and LADWP only.* These are the counterparties El Paso has contacted regarding our new arrangement. 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
