Ryan,

I made two styles of inc sheets for our future use.  One of them is an inc sheet, position manager, and profit/loss sheet in one...please note that the colors are a little busy and it may be simplified.  The other is broken out with the inc sheet similar to yours with a few additions and then the position manager and profit/loss sheet on a different worksheet.  See what you can do to improve them...Obviously neither are fully integrated yet as I am a bit rusty on my excel skills.  Especially when it comes to macros.

If you want I can come in later today and we can work on them together.

Bert Meyers
