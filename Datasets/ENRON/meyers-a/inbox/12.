**For New UBS employees***

I am going to send all of our File Migration compliance forms in one batch, so give them to me when you have signed the Document Migration Certificate. I will be sending this the evening of the 8th.

If you don't know who I am or what this is about, ask Dave Steiner or any of the Admins.

Thanks,

Cara Freeland
