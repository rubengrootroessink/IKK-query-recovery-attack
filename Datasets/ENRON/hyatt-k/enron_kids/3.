> Gordon Elementary School which is located in Bellaire, is an HISD school
> which is used solely as a relief school for the overcrowded and capped
> schools in Southwest Houston. Everyone of the 500+ students who attend
> Gordon is bused to the school from the Gulfton, Fondren Southwest and
> Westbury areas. These children who attend classes from kindergarten to
> fifth grade come from families that are primarily immigrants, refugees,
> and first generation Americans. They represent every inhabited continent
> except Australia (so far). All of Latin America has been represented at
> our school including the Caribbean, as are most of the major Asian nations
> such as India, Pakistan, Vietnam and Mainland China. European and Middle
> Eastern countries such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have also
> been represented. At last count, we have enrolled children from more than
> ten Africa countries including Rwanda, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sierra Leone,
> and Nigeria. We also have American born inner city children as well.
> However, our school is overwhelming Hispanic which at last count was 77
> per cent.  In term of needs, although most of our families have one or
> more parents working, the number of students receiving free or reduced
> lunch this year was 98. 2 per cent which is down from last years figures
> of 99 per cent. We have had 100 per cent in years pass as well. These
> numbers indicate the percentage of families below the poverty level. As a
> result, we provide students with free or reduced lunch and breakfast each
> day. We also provide a free extended day program. What that means is that
> some of our children get on buses as early as 6:15 a.m. and don't return
> home until almost 6:00 p.m. What we have discovered over the years is that
> the needs don't stop there. We have learned to stock or attempt to supply
> all sorts of items. We try to stock RID over the counter head lice
> treatment as well as underwear and socks for little ones who have
> accidents. We have an on going need for school supplies, children's'
> shirts, blouses, slacks and jumpers, as well as sweaters and jackets for
> Houston's short winter. We try to give each student one gift at Christmas
> because we discovered that many families don't have the money to provide
> their children with more than the basics. We try to collect used bicycles
> to give away as door prizes for our family math and family reading nights
> to encourage parents to get involve in school. Both our library and
> classrooms are in need of literature books both in English and in Spanish.
> We do not have a PTO, so we have to find other sources to provide treats
> for field day or field trips or special day activities. We are always in
> need of tutors. We struggle to support our own home grown soccer league.
> We take the funds we collect from our Fall Festival (Halloween Carnival)
> to pay for a school wide field trip to the Oil Ranch which gives children
> an opportunity to see cows and chickens and cattle and to paddleboat on a
> lake. We pay for those children who cannot afford the $5 admission fee and
> we pay for the bus transportation. We try to underwrite the cost of buses
> for field trips and we raise funds for cultural performances such as
> plays, or musical performances because we realize this is the only
> exposure most of our children experience. We have been slowly
> incorporating MacIntosh computers into classrooms and are always in need
> of assistance in that area especially for the upper grades. We have wanted
> for a long time to plant bushes around our 9 t-buildings to make our
> campus more attractive for our children because so many of them stare at
> concrete apartment surroundings. On a personal level, I wish I could
> provide my teachers with tokens of appreciation that PTOs so often give to
> teachers but I have only sporadically been able to accomplish this. Most
> of all, I sincerely believe that we need the support of caring people like
> the wonderful folks at Temple Emanu El whose kindness we can never repay.
