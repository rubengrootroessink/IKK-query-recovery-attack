Hi Kevin,

It's Ruth.  I left you a voicemail this morning, but it was on y cell and it 
might not be very clear.  I am posting an event announcement on 1400smith and 
enronx.org regarding Enron Kids.  What I need from you is your extension (I 
always call voice prompt directory!) and the dates and times for the drop-off.

Thanks,  Ruth
