As you may know, today was the fifth day that Enron Kids board has setup on 2nd floor of the Enron bldg asking employees to adopt a child from Gordon Elementary.  This school is 98% minority, free lunch and breakfast, showed improvements in their test scores over last year, and the students are 100% bused from low income arears thoughout Houston.  The total roster for 2001 is 468 students.  As of 4pm today 11/16/01, we have only had 214 students choosen.  We also emailed all participants from last year and gave them the opportunity to choose Monday before the other employees had a chance. 
We on the Enron Kids board realise the problems everyone is facing at Enron, put fell we could get 3/4's of the students chosen if we could send an email across the system.  Most of the people who have participated said they didn't know about it but saw us on the 2nd floor, or they said they never read Enron in Action.  
To help cut down and try to give employees the opportunity to adopt additional children, the Enron Kids board have decided to eliminate the shoes and coat, previously purchased in the prior years, thus reducing the price per child to $100.  If we can get the majority chosen that remain, we could use the money left from last year to purchase gift certificates for every student at a discount from Pay Less.  Also the board thinks that we can complete a low number of unchoosen students for $80 if we shop wisely and in a number that the retailer will give us a discount.
Please, Enron Kids board is only asking that a memo simular to what Misha received this week go out accross Enron, but realizing we need to specify the days (Tues 11/27 thru 11/30 on level 2 of the Enron Bldg), from 11am til 1pm.  Also we have plans of selling excess Enron Kids T-shirts for $10 each the week the students gifts are turned in 12/10 thru 12/14.  This money would either help adopt the remaining children, or if excess, use to purchase library books for their school as was done in the past years. 
If you need to talk to someone next week, please call Kevin Hyatt, Vice President of Enron Kids, or Lesli Campbell X 35983.  I will be on vacation, put will call in Tuesday and Wednesday to check the status because we have a lot of co-ordinating to do if we do this again 11/27 thru 11/30.
Thank you for taking the time to consider oursituation and hopfully allowing Enron Kids to be visable in an email to hope that more students will be chosen.
