Hey guys, I called Grodan Elementary and Ms. Brenner is esstatic, she said her day had been disasterous until she called me back at 7 last night.  We have setup a meeting with her and two other persons at 10AM 5/16/01 Wednesday.  I will be going from home because its on the way, but if anyone needs a ride back to the office I would be glad to take them.  Please let me
know who plans to attend.  The actual address is 6300 Avenue B, Bellaire.  Thanks for everyone's participation.
