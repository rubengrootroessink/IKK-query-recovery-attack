El Paso Proposes System-Wide Re-Allocation of Receipt Point Rights=20
With the FERC-ordered capacity re-assignments at the Topock, AZ, delivery p=
oints barely off the ground, El Paso Natural Gas has proposed a plan to re-=
allocate shippers' receipt point rights across its entire pipeline system i=
n an attempt to improve delivery and scheduling.=20
El Paso seeks to re-allocate shippers' receipt rights in a manner similar t=
o the approach that FERC ordered in late February for the re-distribution o=
f firm delivery rights at the Topock delivery points. In that order, the Co=
mmission directed El Paso to re-assign the delivery rights of the pipeline'=
s shippers to more evenly match the design capacity of each Topock delivery=
 point on the system.=20
The latest proposal calls for El Paso to replace the 141 individual receipt=
 points on its system with 20 pooling areas. With this move, contract deman=
d (CD) and full-requirements (FR) customers would continue to have system-w=
ide access to the supply basins (San Juan, Permian and Anadarko) that are c=
onnected to the El Paso pipeline; it just wouldn't be through a 141 differe=
nt points [RP00-336-002]. "We found it would have been virtually impossible=
 to divide all of those [receipt points] up in a meaningful fashion," said =
Robert T. Tomlinson, El Paso's director of regulatory affairs.=20
Rate schedule FT-2 shippers, whose loads are "so small," would be served "r=
ight off the top...they would get their gas first" under El Paso's proposal=
, he said. Rate Schedule FT-1 FR customers would be served next, Tomlinson =
noted. They would be required to assign their primary receipt rights to spe=
cific locations on El Paso's system, but they would retain system-wide acce=
ss to alternate points.=20
Under the proposal, shippers would be allowed to choose their receipt point=
 right preferences based on their contract rights, El Paso told FERC. El Pa=
so then would use the "sameiterative process" --- the one it employed in as=
signing capacity to the Topock points --- to award receipt point capacity a=
t the pooling areas. El Paso's re-allocation of delivery rights at the Topo=
ck points took effect April 1. In a sampling of opinion from several trader=
s at the Southern California border, they indicated that the new allocation=
 rules have improved deliveries at Topock-SoCal but at the cost of degraded=
 service elsewhere. "We're still seeing some nominations cuts at Topock-SoC=
al, but they're not as bad as before," said one marketer, adding that out o=
f 12 MMcf/d he had nominated there for Thursday, he had lost only about 1 M=
Mcf/d. However, the marketer and others agreed that as traders have shifted=
 volumes to other border points, it is creating the same kind of allocation=
 problems that had been plaguing Topock-SoCal. Ehrenberg is starting to exp=
erience over-nominations, they said, and Wheeler Ridge "is really a mess no=
w," according to one source.=20
The allocation changes have had no impact on border gas prices, the traders=
 said. This week's spike in border quotes has been a reflection of high Cal=
ifornia power prices that are being enhanced by the continuing loss of 3,00=
0 MWs due to Tuesday's downing of a line on the 500-kilovolt Pacific DC Int=
ertie.=20
With respect to the new proposal, "shippers with receipt rights in a single=
 basin will be allocated primary receipt rights to each pooling area within=
 that basin based on the proportion of each pooling areas's design receipt =
capacity to the total receipt capacity within that basin," El Paso said, "A=
ll other shippers will be asked to provide an election that specifies a rec=
eipt pool where primary rights are desired, a quantity of rights desired at=
 that location, and the location to which those receipt rights are to be de=
livered." CD shippers' primary receipt rights would equal their individual =
CDs, while FT-1 FR shippers' share of primary rights would be based on thei=
r billing determinants (BD), the pipeline said=20
It noted that shipper elections that exceed the available capacity at a spe=
cific point will be allocated pro rata. "After processing is complete, each=
 shipper will be notified what portion of its election was successfully all=
ocated. This election and allocation process will be repeated until each sh=
ipper's defined volumetric entitlements (full BD or CD) have been assigned =
to primary receipt locations."=20
In order to provide "greater scheduling certainty" and to "minimize the pot=
ential for capacity constraints," El Paso seeks to expand the number of poo=
ling points on its system to 20 from six. "Although some poolers previously=
 have objected to enlargement of the number of pools, saying that fewer poo=
ls preserve liquidity in the gas sales market, El Paso has also been asked =
by its shippers to provide greater certainty within the gas transportation =
marketplace. This proposal recognizes the pipeline's overriding obligation =
to its shippers."=20
To carry out the system-wide allocation process, El Paso said it will provi=
de its shippers with a "list of the receipt points within each new pooling =
area, the design capacity of each point, and the maximum quantity scheduled=
 through that point during the past year." The pipeline believes its propos=
al will "allow all shippers an opportunity to make their preferences known =
at the outset while providing a mechanism for resolving the inevitable conf=
licts among those preferences."=20
