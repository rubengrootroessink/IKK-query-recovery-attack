Since we miss each other on the phone, thought I'd drop you an e-mail.  Our
open season was oversubscribed.  We plan to expand the project to about 60
MMcfd from the 42 MMcfd quoted in the open season.  Please advise what, if
any, paperwork you believe we need to put in place for Natural to deliver
about 60 MMcfd to TW at the existing Eddy County interconnect.  Our plan is
to replace the existing measurement facilities with a new ultra sonic meter.
Dampening facilities would be installed due to compression being installed
at the point.  Let me know what other thoughts you might have.
