Kevin or Lindy, would one of you take a final look at the attached letter from Laura Lantefield.  She would like to send these out tomorrow morning.  Would like to get the go ahead from Steve's area.

Please review and let me know if it sounds okay to you.

Thanks for taking a few minutes out of your busy schedule.
