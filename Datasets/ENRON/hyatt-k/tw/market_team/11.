I spoke with Perry Frazier this afternoon.  I have a copy in my file of the unsubscribed capacity on our EBB prior to the sale of TW space to Mavrix and a copy of the sheet post-Mavrix [ yes the space was posted ] .  Perry is printing the capacity sheets daily (sometimes).  

As a backup, Michelle Lokay will also do a daily print for years 2001,2002, and 2003.  The pages will be kept in a log book on the TW marketing desk for future reference.

Let me know if you have questions.

thanks
