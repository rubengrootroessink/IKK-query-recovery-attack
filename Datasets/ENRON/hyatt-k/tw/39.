Kevin,

I have set your group up with inquiry access to the new TW CAS system.  You can access the system by going to www.ets.enron.com.  CAS is a selection under the applications heading.

The 'What if Evaluation' feature was migrated to production and is now available for your use.

Please let me know if you have any questions or problems logging onto the system.

Thanks

Linda
