I just had a good conversation with Sempra's regulatory person who is worki=
ng on the data responses for Stephanie Katz.  Her name is Gillian Wright, a=
nd she is a "regulatory case manager" whatever that is.  She was pleased to=
 hear about the extension til Wed 12:00 for her responses.  The best news i=
s that she was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts =
on the questions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confi=
rm that the recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to =
be and it is always "offered."  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a l=
ittle different and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the d=
aily markets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to =
index deals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumst=
ances.  She took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactl=
y that--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that=
 index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar t=
o questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she th=
ought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she vie=
wed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra =
may have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have yo=
u seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC q=
uestions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

Gillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as =
soon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.=
  She said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push fo=
r a draft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.  =20

As for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow=
 morning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott =
was appreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned=
 to meet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all t=
hat much about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF
