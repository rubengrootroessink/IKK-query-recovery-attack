All
We have worked through the missed materials issues the last few days. The one item that could cause problems is the reinforcing sleeve for the hot tap. It is supposed to ship 3/28 via hot shot directly to La Plata. We (construction and inspectors) will be contacting Steel Forgings periodically in the next couple of weeks to make sure they understand we cannot let that item slip.

The control valve should be received to be installed during the outage. I talked to Darrell Schoolcraft today and he is uncomfortable with flowing through the bypass with no control. I told him we would have SCADA to gas control prior to flowing. I spoke to the control valve vendor today and he indicated 2 - 3 weeks to shipment. I also talked to the La Plata team about initiating the work of getting a new point set up in SCADA. They are working on that and some communications issues with the Controls Specialist.

The meter tube should be received the week before the outage and we will have the opportunity to witness the tube / fitting inspection at the shop. That opportunity will be communicated to Red Cedar. This is another vendor we'll be maintaining close contact with.

My heads up to folks earlier in the week was intended to alert everyone that a major issue had come up and the outage dates could be in jeopardy. When I discovered that the Materials group hadn't ordered any pipe, valves, fittings, meter, etc., I felt that people needed to know.

We are back on track now to complete the installation 4/3 - 5 and be ready for service morning of 4/6.

Thanks
Mike
