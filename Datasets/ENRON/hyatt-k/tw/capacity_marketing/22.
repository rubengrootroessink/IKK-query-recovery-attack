Statement Regarding Transwestern Draft Order on Negotiated Rate Agreements 

Transwestern has fully complied with FERC regulations and its tariff and is confident that the proceeding will bear this out.  Under FERC rules, pipelines are permitted to negotiate rate formulas with its shippers in lieu of the cost-based rate structures if the shippers so chose. Here, the shippers elected to enter into negotiated rates based on certain published indices.   

Transwestern posts all available capacity.  The capacity at issue was posted and was available to all shippers under the cost-based recourse rate on the same terms available to negotiated rate shippers.
