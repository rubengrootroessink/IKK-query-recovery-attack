Kevin, this is okay for now.  Facility Planning will be rolling out a form and procedures in the very near future that we will all use.  Attached is just a sample of the form and general functionality (select enable macros when opening).  I am currently revising it.

I thought we agreed all project requests would be submitted in writing to Facility Planning on the Project Sheet we developed.  The Sheet is important in that it highlights certain requirements for a particular project (including due date, contact names, phone numbers, etc.).  You can fill out the sheet on-line and attach it as an email to Eric.  Let me know if you have questions/concerns.
 
thanks
kh

Eric - Could you please provide me with a Level A cost estimate to make the Ft. Wingate delivery point in McKinley County, NM a bi-directional point?  PNM would like to deliver up to 15,000 MMBtu/d to TW if the price is right.  Thank you.
