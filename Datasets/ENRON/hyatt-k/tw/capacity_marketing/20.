At Drew's request I've drafted the attached language to address the possibility that FERC might change its negotiated rate policy statement or otherwise invalidate the negotiated rate in the contract.  Stan brought this idea up at this morning's staff meeting (for those of you who, like me, weren't in attendance).  Please comment.
