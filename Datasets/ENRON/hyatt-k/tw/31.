When TW's Unsubscribed is migrated to the new CAS system, have the following areas been accounted for:

TK, Kevin, Kim,

What will the new report be formated? i.e.,

Monthly for 10 years?
Monthly for 5 years?
Daily for ? 


Theresa,

GISB states that we should have daily postings. Is the interpretation that we currently do today for TW (10 years by month which are posted daily) good enough? http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap_unsub.html   We might want to revisit this one.

Theresa, Jeanie

New Cap Indicator: (see NNG Unsubscribed for New Cap example http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_avcap_unsub.html )

GISB states that Unsubscribed should have this indicator included in the posting (TW Unsubscribed does not have this indicator at this time) Are we allowing the capability for the new CAS system follow the GISB New Cap Standard?

We have recently created a file that is accessible to pull current Unsubscribed postings (10 year / by month) that will be archived 4 times daily.  REMINDER! This is only a temporary solution until the new CAS system can be put in place!


Thanks,
	Toby
