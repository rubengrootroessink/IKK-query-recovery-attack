Attached is a draft of procedures for the handling of TW PNR. At the bottom of the 1st page are a few issues that need a decision on how TW will handle each issue in the future. Please take a few minutes and review this draft and return your thoughts and comments to me. I would like to get your comments by the end of Wednesday January 31st.  Also, if you think I left anyone off the above distribution, please forward a copy to them. 
If needed we can meet Thursday immediately following the Morning meeting(s) to finalize any outstanding issues. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
