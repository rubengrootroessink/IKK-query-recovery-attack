The Pre filing meeting was held and went favorable.  They did request for us to prepare the draft EA in order for the timing of the certificate to be issued by August 1st.  They also requested that this draft be submitted within 30 days of filing.  We committed that we would have this done.   Keith has been in contact with Larry and John to get this started.  We did get them to agree that processing of the application continue while this is being prepared.  This was the only real issue that arose related to the processing of the application and they did not indicate any concern with the data we have for the filing.  

In addition, they indicated that they "hoped we did not have any spillage of the Indicated Shipper issues related to the open season" similar to what they just filed in TW.   We indicated that we did not feel  there should be any protests.  I would like to get a copy of the "Open Season" posting to have available for any response if they do protest.  They also asked whether we would be filing the agreements when they are entered into.  It became apparent, that in order for them to expedite as related to California, we need to have contracts showing that a market in Calif or Arizona does desire the capacity.

  A question arose on what we were doing with the current units and whether they were old- we indicated they would be placed in salvage at the station, cut and capped.  We did request the ability to place each unit in service as they were completed and we didn't get any objection, in fact they referred to this being done on NBPL.  

As a high note, Bob Arveland, asked when TW became part of Enron----  we said since there was an Enron.  I guess this was news to him,  
Thanks to everyone on helping get this done, now we just need to finish the reports, get them filed and keep the protestors at bay.
