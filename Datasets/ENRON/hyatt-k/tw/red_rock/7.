I think its ok because its not a unilateral termination right--its a termin=
ation right triggered by a changed circumstance that upsets the basic barga=
in of the parties.  If I'm wrong let me know.  Per Steve Harris, it may be =
pretty tough to get anyone to agree to such a term in the first place, so i=
t might not matter.  DF=20

I thought a pipeline having unilateral termination rights was a problem und=

I like the new language, but have added a couple of changes in the redlined=
 version attached hereto (I think mine are in blue).  One of the changes is=
 for clarity and one is to make the contract terminable at our option inste=
ad of automatically terminated if the neg. rate is invalidated and our max =
rate is lower than the Rate  [we may want to preserve the contract in that =
scenario if the market value is even lower than the max. rate!!]   On MKM's=
 point, I think the only contract we have sent out is to CalPine, right??? =
 I think we explain it to them as a mechanism that is designed to preserve =
our benefit of the bargain if FERC changes the rules in the middle of the g=
ame.  If they choke on it, we probably have to take the risk with them sinc=
e they are are our baseload tenant.  As to other shippers that we haven't s=
ent the contract to, we ought to push very hard to get language like this. =
 I'm sending to Shelley and Dot to get their insight.  Dot--have you guys d=
one anything analogous in your precedent agreements on the many Florida pro=
jects?  Not necessarily on neg. rates,  but FERC-outs in general?    DF=20

These changes look good to me, but how are we going to communicate this wit=
hout raising a big flag that we are concerned with negotiated rate deals?  =

At Drew's request I've drafted the attached language to address the possibi=
lity that FERC might change its negotiated rate policy statement or otherwi=
se invalidate the negotiated rate in the contract.  Stan brought this idea =
up at this morning's staff meeting (for those of you who, like me, weren't =
in attendance).  Please comment.
