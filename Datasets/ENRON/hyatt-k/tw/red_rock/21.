The attached analysis was preformed on a 15 year project life.  The current contracts bids provide a cash flow discount at 7.5% of $85.117MM.  The cash flow requirement to cover the capital cost is $94.316MM.  The remaining 15 years on the 20,000 MMBtu/day at an average rate of $.375 bid from PPL was not factor in to the analysis, because it is difficult to calculate the associated O&M and other cost that would be incurred to provide the service in years 16 through 30.  The NPV of the contract discount at 7.5% is $8.896MM.  To cover the remaining capital cost and not factoring in the value of the remaining value of the PPL contract and additional 10,000 MMBtu/d at a rate of $.297 would be required to cover the remaining $9.199 MM.

If you want to print the analysis, you will only need to print the first eleven pages of the workbook for TW150EXP15Yr.xls.  You can execute the print function from the page that open in the DATA1GRAPH.xls file.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks
James
