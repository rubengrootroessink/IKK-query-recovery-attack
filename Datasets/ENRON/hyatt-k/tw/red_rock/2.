1.	ACTIVITIES:

	A. Discussions with TW on critical items in order to finalize FERC application:

			Navajo Environmental has requested a Threatened & Endangered Species (T&E) and Archeological studies on stations 3 and 4.   The reviewing agency has 30 days to make determination from submittal (completed).  Regulatory is calling FERC to determine importance of "missing" data for the application and make a determination.

			The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.  Station Two is on U.S. Forest Service land.  The Special Use Permit dated 18 August, 1959 contains the following clause:  "3.  Devolpment plans; lay-out plans; construction, reconstruction, or alteration of improvements; or revision of lay-out or construction plans for this area must be approved in advance and in writing by the forest supervisor.  Trees or shrubbery on the permitted area may be removed or destroyed only after the forest supervisor in charge has approved, and has marked or otherwise designated that which may be removed or destroyed."

			ECS submitted a proposal for electric compression at Station 1.  This needs to be evaluated quickly if any interest exists.  This proposal should have a $5 mm decrease to project capital with increased operational flexibility.  FERC Project description will require amendment if interested.

			Turbine Compressor selection evaluation is underway with proposalsreview with both Rolls Royce and GE/NP.  Project Team and GSS will complete recommendation ASAP!

			Existing Noise Survey results have been received.  Recommendations for new facilities are being revised to accurately reflect Nearest Sensitive Receptor's (NSR) at individual stations.

			Plot Plans and Scope of Work are being revised based on site visit.  These will be available by Friday afternoon.


c.		Station Scrubbers, 	Electrical Generation and Station recycle valves will be included in the overall project funding.
