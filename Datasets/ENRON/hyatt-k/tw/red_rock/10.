Dot is right with regard to the termination provision.
It was a Natural case.
But it was more than a year or two ago.
(Time flys when you are having fun.)

It was the contracting practices order issued October 16, 1996.  77 FERC 61=
,028.
The order on rehearing was issued March 26, 1998.  82 FERC 61,298.

In both orders the Commission said that the unilateral right to terminate i=
s like a
"semi-firm" rate and a separate rate schedule is required.  Specifically, t=
he Commission said:

=09Under Natural's currently effective tariff provisions governing firm
=09service, it may offer day-to-day, week-to-week, or month-to-month
=09rollovers if it so chooses: but the length of the term must be selected

=20
=09However, Natural cannot provide such a service without a rate schedule
=09for that service on file.  [Footnotes omitted.]  82 FERC at 62,178.

Not sure about the rest of the wording of the proposed provision.
The attached language did not come across to me as a part of Dot's e-mail.

I like the new language, but have added a couple of changes in the redlined=
 version attached hereto (I think mine are in blue).  One of the changes is=
 for clarity and one is to make the contract terminable at our option inste=
ad of automatically terminated if the neg. rate is invalidated and our max =
rate is lower than the Rate [we may want to preserve the contract in that s=
cenario if the market value is even lower than the max. rate!!]   On MKM's =
point, I think the only contract we have sent out is to CalPine, right???  =
I think we explain it to them as a mechanism that is designed to preserve o=
ur benefit of the bargain if FERC changes the rules in the middle of the ga=
me.  If they choke on it, we probably have to take the risk with them since=
 they are are our baseload tenant.  As to other shippers that we haven't se=
nt the contract to, we ought to push very hard to get language like this.  =
I'm sending to Shelley and Dot to get their insight.  Dot--have you guys do=
ne anything analogous in your precedent agreements on the many Florida proj=
ects?  Not necessarily on neg. rates,  but FERC-outs in general?    DF=20

These changes look good to me, but how are we going to communicate this wit=

At Drew's request I've drafted the attached language to address the possibi=
lity that FERC might change its negotiated rate policy statement or otherwi=
se invalidate the negotiated rate in the contract.  Stan brought this idea =
up at this morning's staff meeting (for those of you who, like me, weren't =
in attendance).  Please comment.
