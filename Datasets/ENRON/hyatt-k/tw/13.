One of the projects suggested by Fac. Planning was a replacement of the coolers at WT-2.  The replacement would get TW an additional 50mm day capacity thru the compressor station.  The coolers that are used now are old and were originally transferred from an NNG Iowa station; they were not built for Texas heat.  

Anyway, Ken Chow was the original proponent of this and he has since left Enron.  If you're interested in pursuing, see me and we can get with Ron Matthews or Morgan G.
We already ran some cost and economic scenarios.  The difficulty was not have any delivery point capacity to move the extra 50mm to.

If Marketing is willing to front the risk and allow materials to be purchased, drawing developed and project engineered while waiting for the approval on the FERC 7C Filing (for the additional 50 MMscfd of capacity), then this project should have construction completed within 3 months of the receipt of the approved FERC Filing (also given that this approval will not occur during the TW Tariff months).

If Marketing is not willing to front the risk, then it will take 7 months to complete the construction on this project once FERC approval is received.
