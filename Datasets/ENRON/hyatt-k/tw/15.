Suggested changes to the announcement:
ONEOK WesTex can only offer interruptible 311 transportation to and from the
TW interconnect. I am not suggesting this be included in the announcement
but I wanted to clarify with you the contractual arrangement ONEOK can offer
shippers on our pipeline to and from the interconnect.  
Please include in your announcement the following contact names for ONEOK-
Butch Cheatham(918)588-7876 for gas transportation on ONEOK WesTex and
Hayley Nealis(918)588-7667 for gas storage opportunities on the ONEOK WesTex
system.
