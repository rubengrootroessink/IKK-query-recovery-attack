Subject:	SoCal Tour Update Meeting

My intent is to discuss the results of So Cal tour last week within our department, marketing and gas control, and present some analysis as to what might be realized if So Cal optimizes the operation of their facilities based on our preliminary findings.

I have committed to Mike Middleton that we can begin the HP comparison tests the week of May 7-11,  Mike has agreed to pick up the expenses, hotel, meals.  Colleen Raker is putting an agreement together to cover our liability.  Ken I think we need Matt and a Div person to do the testing.  Matt can make arrangements with Dink.

Gary, I hope you will be able to share modeling data of the pipeline and compression and what might be accepted if full utilization of their HP is achieved.

Ken, will we be able to share any of the testing results for stations 2, 3 or 4, resulting from the compressor work.  If we can, that would be great.
If you wish to visit before the call, lets do, otherwise I look forward to visiting with you Wednesday.
GM
