Kevin,
The project request below is for the Gas Cromatograph for Bitter Lakes, since they've increased flow.  At one time you indicated that marketing might fund this project.  Please give it you're consideration and let me know.  
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The cost is on the tab marked (CAPPROJREQ).  It's $35,600.  Bob Powell will do the project himself, including the completion report and as built.  This way we can save $10,000 or so by not including C&E.  I spoke with Darrell about this and he said rather than spend the extra money, he could do without the flow control valve.  
I guess all I'm needing is to have the work order below approved. 

Kevin,
We've spoken about this before, but will marketing still fund this Chromatograph?

Thanks,  Arnie

I must be looking at this wrong but can't find any costs. Arnie are you working with everyone on this project which includes a control valve. Give me an update. We need to get a project on this asap.
Thanks
