After reviewing the data and circumstances of events after the TW line was repaired post-Burlington, we determined that the reduced volume flow was probably more attributable to our own TW maintenance than anything else.  We knew flow would be down for November and Operations took advantage of the situation and did some work on the pipe.  

At this point I would not claim any damages beyond what we have already prepared.  Let me know if you have questions.
