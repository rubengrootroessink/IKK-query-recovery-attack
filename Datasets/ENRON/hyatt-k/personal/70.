Hello Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee Members:


 

I wanted to take a quick poll and see how your calendars are looking for the third week of September.  Since there are several committee members that are located in Houston, TX., we would like to schedule a meeting in Houston the third week of September for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee.  This meeting will probably be a lunch meeting, from 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. at a hotel in the Galleria area.  

Please reply back indicating your preference for one of these meeting dates:

Tuesday, September 18

Wednesday, September 19

Thursday, September 20 

If you have any suggestions or know anyone that may be interested in participating on the Natural Gas Infrastructure committee, please email or call me at (713) 463-9595 x 307. I'll be happy to send an invitation on your behalf.  

For your review, please see the minutes and worksheets for NGI attached to this email.  

Thanks for your participation on the committee.  We will be getting back with you soon as to the exact date, time and location of the next meeting scheduled for September in Houston.  Have a nice day!
