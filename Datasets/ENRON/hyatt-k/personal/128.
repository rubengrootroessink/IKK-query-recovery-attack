>  The boss of a small company called a spontaneous staff meeting in the
>  Middle of a particularly stressful week. When everyone gathered, the
>  employer, who understood the benefits of having fun, told the burnt-out
>  staff the purpose of the meeting was to have a quick contest, whose
>theme  was "Viagra advertising slogans."
>
>  Dividing into 10 groups of three, the only rule was they had to use
>past  ad  slogans that captured the essence of Viagra.
>
>  About 7 minutes later, they turned in their suggestions, and created a
>  "Top Ten List." After all the laughter and camaraderie, the rest of the 
>week
>  went very well for everyone.
>
>  10. Viagra, It's "Whaazzzzz Up!"
>  9. Viagra, The quicker pecker upper
>  8. Viagra, Like a rock!
>  7. Viagra, When it absolutely, positively has to be there tonight.
>  6. Viagra, Be all that you can be.
>  5. Viagra, Reach out and touch someone.
>  4. Viagra, Strong enough for a [woman], but made for a [man].
>  3. Viagra, Tastes great!........More filling!
>  2. Viagra, We bring goodthings to life!
>
>  And the unanimous number one slogan:
>
>  1.This is your penis. This is your penis on drugs. Any questions
