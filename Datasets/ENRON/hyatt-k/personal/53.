	Hey Kevin,
	Here is my resume......somewhat updated.  I would like to have an
	opportunity to meet and provide a more detail discussion about my
	background and accomplishments that may be a really good fit for
	what ET&S is working towards.  

	Overall I've been with Enron since September of 1989.  My resume
	doesn't go back that far, but I started with Enron Gas Pipeline Operating
	Company (EGPOC) working with Transwestern and then Northern Natural.
	
	I'd like to see Enron grow and develop the asset part of our business
	and I truly believe that I can help accomplish that.  I have a strong history
	of getting things accomplished and I'm a firm believer in the win-win 
	business perspective. I also know how to work through the Enron
	organization to help get pricing, information, etc..

	I would like to establish an interview/meeting as soon as possible in
	order to be able to fully evaluate the opportunity.
	
	I would also appreciate that we keep this correspondence between
	us and the appropriate people within ET&S.

	Thanks,
	mk
