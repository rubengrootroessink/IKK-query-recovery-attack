Keeping Your Mailbox Clean
Since we have a 100MB limit on the size of our mailbox, it's important to practice good housekeeping and keep it as clean as possible. If you don't, you'll eventually receive the following message: 
You have exceeded the storage limit on your mailbox.  Delete some mail from your mailbox or contact your system administrator to adjust your storage limit. 

You'll then be unable to send messages until you get below the 100MB limit. Ouch!  (note:  mailbox limits will only be adjusted for specific business reasons)
So how do we practice good housekeeping and keep our mailbox clean? There are several tools to help you do this:
Use Your Inbox as a To-do List
Gone are the days when we could just read the new messages in our Inbox and then leave them there for future reference. You'll now need to keep that Inbox "lean-n-clean" to avoid the dreaded message above. When a new message comes in, deal with it right way. If it's just for your information, read it, then delete. If it's got information that you'd like to reference later, move it to a "save" folder that you've created. If it's someone asking for information, reply, then delete it. If a new message requires action on your part, leave it in the Inbox until you can then deal with it - Reply, forward, move, delete!. An empty Inbox is a happy one!
How Big are Those Messages?
When you were migrated, a column called "Size" was added to your Inbox, Deleted Items, and Sent Items folder views. This field shows exactly how much space each message is taking up (including any attachments). To quickly see the messages that are taking up the most space in each of those folders, simply click on the column header "Size" and the message list will be sorted based on the size of each message. The biggest messages will then be displayed first, and you can determine what to do with them. Should you just delete a message? Save the attachment to your H: drive?...etc.
If you'd like to add the Size column to any folders you've created, click the link below to access the instructions for modifying your columns.  
How Big is Your Mailbox?
To check on the total size of your mailbox, right-click on Outlook Today (at the top of the Outlook Bar or Folder List), and select Properties. Then click the Folder Size... button. The total size of your mailbox is then displayed, along with a breakout of each of the individual folder sizes. Now you know where to concentrate your attention when cleaning up.
