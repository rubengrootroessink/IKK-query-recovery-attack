Hi Kevin:  My sister, Michelle Otteman, suggested I forward my resume' to you for Enron's consideration.  As you can tell from the document my primary interest/background is Finance; however, in keeping with Enron's reputation for innovation, I am "open".
 
I appreciate your help.  Recently the temp in Michigan has been in the 90's; I think I could get used to Houston.
Thanks again,
Gene
