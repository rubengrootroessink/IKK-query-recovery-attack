Please read the e-mail below. Let's take advantage of the many politicians etc. trying to grab some attention from our terrible situation. We need our severance packages of some sort.
It cannot hurt to log on and get some attention to our plight......severance. It takes about 2 minutes tops and automatically faxes for you!

Dear Michelle Foust, 

You and other e-Activists helped bring laid-off Enron
workers closer to justice this week. On Feb. 27, a
bankruptcy court judge ordered Enron to create a fund
for laid-off workers' emergency expenses and told creditors
to negotiate a fair severance settlement. 

After you and other e-Activists sent thousands of faxes
to Enron and its creditors, the bankruptcy court asked
for three things. First, Enron should provide immediately
a $5 million fund to pay emergency expenses for laid-off
workers. Second, Enron and its corporate creditors--including
CitiGroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and the Bank
of New York--must negotiate with laid-off Enron workers
to reach a fair severance settlement. The workers,
Enron and the corporate creditors must report back
to the bankruptcy judge on the progress of their talks
by Tuesday, March 5. 

Those workers walked into bankruptcy court with the
support of e-Activists like you--but now they need
your help again. Please take one minute to send a new
fax with a new message to Enron and its corporate creditors.
Negotiations are going on today. Click on the link
below now to take action:

Then, click on the link below now to tell your friends,
family and co-workers to send a message to Enron's
creditors urging them to agree to a fair severance
package with Enron workers.
