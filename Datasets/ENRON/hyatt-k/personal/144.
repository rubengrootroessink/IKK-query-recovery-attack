Kevin:  I'm glad to hear you're still working (I think?).  At least in the 
pipeline group you have some hard assets to support the business.  I have 
been thinking about everyone we used to work with since this whole thing hit 
the fan.  I have a number of clients and friends who have been hit hard by 
the stock price meltdown.  One fellow I fly with is in his 60's, retired, and 
has lost so much he is having to go back to work.  All of the retirees are 
wondering about their pension payouts.  How's your retirement plan holding 
up?  

Greet Lou and the kids and anyone else from the old days who is still around. 
 Let me know how things are going.  And, DON'T shred this e-mail:)
