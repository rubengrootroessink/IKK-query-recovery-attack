IT Purchasing Procedures

The memo below showing the IBuyit logo and the rollout schedule was sent out today. ETS IS NOT scheduled for rollout until July. Please see the attached document for current procedures on how to purchase ETS IT (Pc's and software) equipment. If you have any questions, please call Larry Steward @ 713-853-7149.

 


 


By now you have probably seen Rick Causey's announcement of the iBuyit initiative.  iBuyit is Enron's new procurement and payment tool and is now live for those who previously requested IT hardware from IT Central.  For others, iBuyit will be coming your way during the year.  To learn more, visit http://ibuyit.enron.com.

The iBuyit team will continue to work with your business unit to customize the tool to meet your needs and to prepare for its phased roll-out:
May 2001:  iBuyit Payables for those organizations supported by the Houston-based accounts payable processing center
July 2001:  iBuyit eProcurement for ETS, Corporate, and EWS
