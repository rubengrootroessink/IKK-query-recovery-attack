<P>Subject: Your Internet Purchase Request 
<P>To:&nbsp; Kevin&nbsp;Hyatt 
<P>Kevin, 
<P>My online records indicate a while ago you were interested in a 2001 Toyota 7828 Tundra listed on TejasToyota.com.&nbsp; Our inventory and factory incentives has changed since then and I realize your needs may have changed as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are still interested in this vehicle, or if you would prefer me to find a different vehicle for you, please let me know.&nbsp; I would be happy to assist with your vehicle search in any way possible.</P>
<P>I can be reached either by replying to this e-mail or by phone at (888)308-3527.&nbsp; Please contact me if you wish to be removed from our&nbsp;Internet follow-up system.</P>
<P>Thanks for your interest.&nbsp; I look forward to speaking with you soon!<BR></P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
