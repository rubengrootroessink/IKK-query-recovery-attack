Dear Kevin Hyatt,
                 
     We want to thank you for your Internet purchase request.  Our customers using the Internet are telling us that they are enjoying the experience.  Our commitment to you, is that we will provide you all the information you need to make an informed decision, including pricing that is clear and direct.  We hope that this is the purchase process your expecting.  We look forward to earning your business.  
     We want you to know that we have an unlimited inventory available to us.  Most of our Internet customers tell us that they like it when we save them time by pricing the correct vehicle.  We're currently checking your request against our available inventory.  We'll contact you before the end of business today.  Often times because of packaging and equipment options we have similar vehicles that have similar equipment that can be less expensive.  If you would like we can let you know about those as well.  Again our commitment is to give you all the information you need to make an informed and comfortable decision.  
     We have a pricing philosophy in place that is aggressive and strives to show you the lowest cost possible.  Perhaps a little lease or financing information would be helpful?  We can help you with that as well.  Often times when you take advantage of program rates you can really save compared to conventional lending institutions.  Either way it's important your Internet price reflects your lowest cost of driving.  
If you have any questions that you would like to ask please feel free to call me directly at 888.308.3527.  
Thanks for your time,
