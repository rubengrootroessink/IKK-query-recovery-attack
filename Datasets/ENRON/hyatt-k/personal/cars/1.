Kevin,
     Thank you for your patience in this matter.  We always make sure to email you the best price on the right car.  Unfortunately in the past we have been guilty of quick quotes, and the price was given immediately.  However we found it isn't very helpful to quote our customers on the wrong car.  That's why we just want to make sure you get the right price, so you can come buy the car without the hassle and avoid any confusion. 
     As I let you know earlier.  We have a pricing philosophy in place to save you money and time.  Depending on the vehicle you choose when you arrive on the lot our pricing is between 1% to 9% over wholesale.  On a vehicle like the one you selected a 2001 Toyota Tundra AccessCab V8 4x4, you can purchase for $28272.35 (including $500 rebate good till 04/02/01) plus any taxes and applicable fees.  This one includes the following options:
-4-WHEEL ANTI LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM W/ DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS
-ALL WEATHER GUARD PACKAGE HEAVY DUTY BATTERY, STARTER & HEATER
-CONVENIENCE PKG: PWR WINDOWS LOCKS/MIRRORS, LIGHTING PKG, SLIDING RR WINDOW W/PRIVACY GLASS, DRIVER & PASSENGER SUNVISOR W/MIRROR
-DLX 3-IN-1ETR/CASS/CD COMBO W/6 SPEAKERS
-FOG LAMPS
-WHEEL AND TIRE UPGRADE #1: P265/70R16 RADIAL TIRES & WHEEL ARCH MOULDINGS
 
-SECURIKEY PLUS
-SIDE SIGNAL MIRROR UPGRADE
-CHROME TUBE STEP BARS
-RECEIVER HITCH/WIRE HARNESS
-FLOOR MATS (CARPET-4)
     We can complete as much of the paperwork as you would like online or by phone.  Either way it is important your Internet price reflects your lowest cost of driving.  Again any lease or financing information can be obtained by emailing me at mailto:Rwells@tejastoyota.com  
     When we talk we can set aside some time for you to drive your new Toyota.  That would also be a good time to appraise your trade in.  If you need any more information to make an informed decision, please don't hesitate to call me directly at 888.308.3527 or email mailto:Rwells@tejastoyota.com  .  I look forward to earning your business.  
By the way I'll call you tomorrow, if I don't hear from you by 2pm.  
Sincerely,
