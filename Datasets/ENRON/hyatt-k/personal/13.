GREAT picture!!

> Through the viewfinder of his camera,  Ensign John Gay could see the
fighter
> plane drop from the sky heading  toward the port side of the aircraft
carrier
> Constellation.  At  1,000 feet, the pilot drops the F/A-18C Hornet to
increase
> his speed  to 750 mph, vapor flickering off the curved surfaces of the
plane.
> In  the precise moment a cloud in the shape of a farm-fresh egg  forms
around
> the Hornet 200 yards from the carrier,its engines  rippling the Pacific
Ocean
> just 75 feet below, Gay hears an explosion  and snaps his camera shutter
once.
>  "I clicked the same time I  heard the boom, and I knew I had it", Gay
said.
> What he had was a  technically meticulous depiction of the sound barrier
being
> broken  July7,1999, somewhere on the Pacific between Hawaii and Japan.
> Sports  Illustrated, Brills Content, and Life ran the photo.  The photo

World

> A naval veteran of 12 years, Gay, 38, manages a crew of eight  assigned to
> take intelligence photographs from the high-tech belly of an  F-14Tomcat,a

> Gay selected his Nikon 90 S, one of the five 35 mm cameras he  owns.  He
set
> his
> 80-300 mm zoom lens on 300 mm, set his  shutter speed at 1/1000 of a second
> with an aperture setting of  F5.6.  "I put it on full manual, focus and

>  everything, you aren't going to get that shot on auto.  The plane is  too

> At sea level a plane  must exceed 741 mph to break the sound barrier, or
the

> all of  the pressure and sound waves in front of it is heard on the ground
as
>  an explosion or sonic boom.  The pressure change condenses the water  in
the
> air as the jet passes these waves.  Altitude, wind  speed,humidity, the
shape
> and trajectory of the plane - all of these  affect the breaking of this
> barrier.  The slightest drag or  atmospheric pull on the plane shatters the
> vapor oval like fireworks as  the plane passes through,he said everything
on
> July 7 was  perfect.  "You see this vapor flicker around the plane that
gets
>  bigger and bigger.  You get this loud boom, and it's instantaneous.   The
> vapor cloud is there, and then it's not there.
> It's the  coolest thing you have ever seen."
