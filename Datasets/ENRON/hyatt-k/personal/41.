Hey Lyndon--
	how's it going?  I went looking for the your Beretta Silversmith
shotgun again the other day and no one had heard of it.  Beretta does
make a Silver Hawk double-barrel side-by-side and also a Silver Pigeon
over/under shotgun, but no Silversmith.

Let's get together and have lunch soon, I may be looking to make some
career changes.

talk with you soon.
