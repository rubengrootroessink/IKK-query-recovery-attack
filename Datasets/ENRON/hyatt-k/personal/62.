What are flags?
You can flag a message or contact to remind yourself to follow up on an issue, or you can flag an outgoing message with a request for someone else. You can also set a reminder for the message or contact.
When a message or contact is flagged, one of the following appears in the Flag Status column .
 
When the recipient receives a message with a flag, a comment on the purpose of the flag appears at the top of the message. If you set a reminder, this date will also appear.
