Kevin - 

Thanks for the referral.  Hope all is well with you.  

I agree with Billy on Michelle.  We are really focused on candidates with strong quantitative backgrounds and don't think that Michelle would be a fit for the program.  However, I will forward her resume on to Elyse if you would like. 

Also, just wanted to see if you wanted us to formally communicate our decision to Michelle or if you would be relaying this message to her.

Let me know

Traci

Kevin,

Thanks for the referral.  I've also copied Traci who leads Recruiting.  I don't really see Michelle as a fit in the Program.  A couple of years ago, the Program experimented with a Marketing track, but we've moved away from that concept.  We're now focused on trying to find people who can be successful in the Program at large.

You can try Community Relations (Elyse Kalmans) to see if there is any interest there.  Please let Traci know if her team needs to formally respond to Michelle.

I hope all is well with you, and thanks again for the referral.

Best regards,
Billy

Billy, attached is the resume of Michelle Norton.  She is a recent graduate of the Univ. of Houston and is pursuing a career in community / public relations.  

I was wondering if we could get her in the next analyst candidate pool or look at placing her direct into something like community affairs if she was qualified?

thanks for the help

Kevin Hyatt
