Dear Kevin Hyatt,

For those of you who have been comparing SEC filing services, we've been
busy in the last eight weeks adding new features most requested from our
users.

 New! Client Tracking and Reporting Option - Helpful for those who need to
monitor time and activities for re-billing.

 New! Online Group Enrollment and Invoicing Option - It's easier than ever
to setup a corporate account with two or more people.

 New! Private Domains and Group Administrative Tools  - Gives more control
and customized access to large groups.

 New! No Advertising on 10K Wizard - no annoying banner ads to intrude on
your search activities.

*       Real time SEC Filings - No embargoes, SEC filings are posted as soon
as they are filed with the SEC.
*       Unlimited Usage - Search and download SEC EDGAR documents and
attachments. No limits on the number of downloaded documents, no additional
charges.
*       Full Text Searching - 10K Wizard provides you with the ability to
search the full text of the documents, including the metadata, with keywords
or use advanced Boolean operators to retrieve documents with specific
language. Each hit is highlighted within the documents for easier
recognition.
*       Multi-parameter Searching - Searching by ticker or company name, or
industry or SIC,  and full text search, and by form group or a specific
form, and by date range.
*       Unlimited Personal Alerts - Use the 10K Wizard to set up an
unlimited number of alerts. Send time sensitive alerts on new SEC filings to
your Email. You can be alerted not only on company symbols, but full text
searches as well.  For example, you can set up an alert to notify you when
the words "Warren Buffett" appear in any Insider Trading form.
*       RTF - Rich Text Format Document Downloads - 10K Wizard converts all
text and HTML documents into MS-Word compatible documents for storage on
your computer.
*       Download Tables as Excel Spreadsheets - Manipulate the data, compare
company's financials, graph or chart data.
