It's not a problem.  I called the warehouse and since it hadn't shipped yet, they cancelled the order.  FYI, the new price on those went up to $960!!  I about crapped.

Hey Kevin...

You keeping busy over there??  (ok...  that was a bad joke)

I was wondering since it's taken these guys so long to ship, if it's too
late to just cancel the order.

At this point, I may want to do something different.

I appreciate your diligence in this process.

Let me know if this presents a problem.

Thanks again!

Abe
