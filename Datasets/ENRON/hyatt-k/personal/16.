			Announcing     for ETS staff!

We are pleased to announce that ETS employees can now use the eRequest system.  This is the first step in our plan to migrate our security processing to eRequest.  eRequest is an electronic way to request access to applications/software, security, space allocation, XMS expense report set up, and access to conference rooms.  eRequest will take the place of submitting your request to the ETS Solution Center or the Omaha Helpdesk mailboxes.

There are a number of issues remaining to be addressed, specifically licensing costs for new software and the potential impact of the upcoming implementation of iBuyit.  However, we want to provide you with the opportunity to begin using the tool.

The steps are as follows:

Go to http://www.ets.enron.com ; select the Solution Center page; and then click on the   icon.
If you have a Corp id, click on the CORP LOGON button.  If you do not have a Corp id, select the NON-CORP login.  You will have to input your email id or select SEARCH and select your email address from a pick list.
If you have not used the system before, you will be prompted to set up a New Logon Profile.  You must provide your company number, cost center, social security number, location and phone number.
Select the button that represents the type of request you want to make (i.e., Update Account Access, New Account, etc.).
Confirm who the request is for; you may have to do a SEARCH to find your id.  Click OK when it's confirmed.
Select the service you desire (i.e., APPLICATIONS).
It is very important that you select ETS-GPG for your Region.  If you do not, your request will not be processed.
At the applications blank, select SHOW ALL.  The applications that will be of the most interest to you immediately are XMS, Corp Terminal Server, ETS Remedy, and Global Messaging (to request additional space for your Outlook mailbox).
If you are unable to locate the service you want, please contact us:
