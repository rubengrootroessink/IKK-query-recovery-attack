Since Outlook doesn't have an All Documents folder as Lotus Notes did, how do you find a message that you've "misplaced"?  Use the Advanced Find feature!  
Just right click on your top folder (Mailbox-) in the Folder List view and select Advanced Find.  Fill in what words you want to search for and what fields to seach in (subject, message body, etc) and click Find Now.  This searches through ALL the folders in your mailbox.... Enjoy!
