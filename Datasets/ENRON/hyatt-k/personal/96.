Dear Kevin,

If you're like us, you've been looking forward to cooler
weather, falling snow ... and opening day for skiing and
snowboarding! This year, planning that ski trip with family
or friends is easier than ever, with Expedia Ski Vacations. 
Not only will you get low prices, but you can get everything
you need for the perfect trip online -- yes, even your 
rental skis or board and lift tickets! Plus, if you book by
October 22, you can get a free ski lift ticket with your 
ski vacation. Get the snowy scoop:

Thinking snow? Nothing gets you in the mood for the slopes
like a Warren Miller movie. Expedia.com is a proud sponsor 
of the latest thriller from this master of the mountains -- 
see it in a town near you!
