Kevin,

It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, =
following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd =
appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.  =
=20
As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the re=
cent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler a=
nd Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to=
 ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employ=
ees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to =
ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would=
 be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for b=
asic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or ut=
ilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance. =
 I've already started getting e-mails at eerfarequest@surfmk.com requesting=
 assistance.  We've set up guidelines on how we'll be distributing the fund=
s. This week, we've been working with an attorney and a local bank. An acco=
unt has been set up where people can make contributions. All the money will=
 be given back to ex-Enron employees that need assistance with basic necess=
ities, such as money for food, rent/mortgage payments, and utilities. We've=
 contacted the local media with the information so that the community can b=
e made aware of what we're doing. Our ability to provide assistance will be=
 based on the response we receive.  As you can see, we're using our values =
from Enron to help others, and would appreciate your assistance with commun=
icating this information to the current Enron employees. =20

Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron=
 employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.=
  If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at 2=
81-812-2466. =20
