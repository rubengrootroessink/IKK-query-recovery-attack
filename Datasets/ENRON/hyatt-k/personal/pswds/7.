Kevin - We're no longer holding regularly scheduled training classes.
However, there is an online tutorial and a New User's Guide; both are very
helpful in gatting you familiar with ClickTrip.

Here's the information you need to get started:

Use company name: enron

Your ClickTrip Login ID is:  hyattk			(last name first
initial)

The first time you log-in leave the password blank.  You can choose your own
password on the following screen.  Please be sure to check your profile
information for accuracy; you'll also need to add your credit card
information in that section.

The New User Guide is on the first screen of
https://www.resassist.com/enron/ 

If you have any questions, just let us know.
