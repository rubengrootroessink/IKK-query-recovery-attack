Subject: words of wisdom...


there's alot to be said for some straight-forward, plain-spoken wisdom right

This is ABSOLUTELY the Quote of the Day from Bush when
asked what is taking so long:

"When I take action I'm not going to fire a $2 million missile at a
$10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt."


President of the United States,
  George W. Bush
