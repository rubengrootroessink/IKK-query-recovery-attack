Electricity Deregulation is coming to Texas!
What a great way to start off the New Year - to be able to choose your electricity provider, which could mean potential savings for you and your family on your electric bill.  As you know, Enron has been a leader in lobbying for deregulation and a consumer's right to choose energy providers.

For the first time in our state's history, 5 percent of Texas households will have this golden opportunity.  The NewPower Company (NewPower), which is approximately 45 percent owned by Enron, was recently formed to provide energy and energy-related services to residential customers in deregulating energy markets across America, including Texas.  For a limited time, Houston-based employees will be eligible to participate in NewPower's pilot program offering their deregulated electric service.

Be Among the First to Participate:
Enrollment with NewPower begins March 12.  Also, watch for a special Enron Employees Exclusive offer on your desk March 12.  If you would like more information about NewPower, visit the company's web site at www.newpower.com

Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, or any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.
