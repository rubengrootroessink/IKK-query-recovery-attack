Hi Kevin,

Thanks for your email.

Only Referrals that were initiated on the Referral Station would have tracking information available online.  My company, Referral Networks, hosts Enron's Referral Station website.

For Referrals that were made prior to the online system being live (May 18th), you would need to contact the Employee Referral Manager at Enron to answer your questions.

Whatever avenue you used before to check on your Referrals, I would still use for this particular one, since it was made in the past, prior to our live date.

If you have questions, you might try the Enron Recruitment Technology Help Desk at 713-345-3254, select option #2.

I hope this answers your question.  If you have any future questions about using the online Referral Station, please let us know.

Thanks,

Referral Networks Customer Support

In April 2001 I submitted a candidate (Ms. Stacy Fitzgerald) for two
jobs (#107960 and #108040).  I also spoke with the hiring supervisor,
Mr. Derryl Cleaveland regarding the candidate and the positions.  Stacy
was subsequently interviewed for 108040 and began working for Enron on
May 7, 2001.

My referral submission was on paper, not electronically.  Am I eligible
for the finders fee?  I could not find anything on the Tracking part of
the web site.

thanks for the help.
