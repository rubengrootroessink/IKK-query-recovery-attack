I am going to have to take our system down on Thursday, November 8th to pack it.  We may not have email for a couple of months, until we get a phone line and until I can get re-set up.  Everyone's is in Denver, only and I don't know yet if I can access the new Denver area code from ours of 303 without it being long distance.  I will email all of  you when I have email up again.

Take care.

  Our new address will be:

                                          347 County Road 122
                                          Elizabeth, CO  80107

  Temporarily we will be using my cell phone (until we have a wall up to put the phone line into in the barn).  My cell phone is:  281-701-5863

  Take care.  We are going on a new adventure and are excited.  It's finally become a reality.
