Hi Kevin:  I understand the challenges of re-organizations.  I have attached
an updated (shorter) version of my resume' that you can share with your
recruiter friend or any one else.
Thanks, Gene.

Hi Gene, I just wanted to let you know, things here at Enron have been a
little hectic.  With the restructuring of our Broadband Services unit,
several hundred folks are looking to be "re-deployed" in the
organization.  This may make things a little difficult for outside
parties to gain entry; but I'm trying.

Also, I have a good friend who is a principal in a local head hunting
firm.  If you want, I can also forward your resume on to him.  Just let
me know if that's OK.
Best regards,
kh

Hi Kevin:  My sister, Michelle Otteman, suggested I forward my resume'
to you for Enron's consideration.  As you can tell from the document my
primary interest/background is Finance; however, in keeping with Enron's
reputation for innovation, I am "open".

I appreciate your help.  Recently the temp in Michigan has been in the
90's; I think I could get used to Houston.
Thanks again,
Gene
