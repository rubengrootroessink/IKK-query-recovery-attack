Ms. Lisa Norwood, Manager, Fuels Acquisition

Dear Ms. Norwood:

Following my recent conversation with Mr. Kevin Hyatt, Enron Transportation Services, I would like to confirm our invitation for you to participate as a panelist in the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE Conference, co-located with ELECTRIC POWER 2002 for the session titled "Power Plant Fuel Delivery Issues."   This session will take place on Wednesday, March 20, 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m., at the America's Center in St. Louis, MO.  

We have you scheduled to present on the subject of Transportation Scheduling - Firm vs. Interruptible vs. other Transportation.  We plan to hold a conference call in January or February, 2002 with the Chair and the other presenters participating.  You will be notified with the date and time for the conference call.  For now, plan to present for about 15 -20 minutes on the subject.  Time should be allotted at the end for a question & answer session.  

By November 1, please submit a one or two paragraph abstract on the subject.  Around January 15, 2002 we will need your final paper/presentation for publishing on the CD Rom proceedings that will be distributed to every delegate attending the conference.  In addition, your presentation will be available on the ELECTRIC POWER website at www.electricpowerexpo.com <http://www.electricpowerexpo.com/>.   

Enclosed are the preliminary conference brochures for the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE and ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Conference.  Also in your package is a list of confirmed and prospective panelists for the session you have agreed to participate in.

The NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE and ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Conference & Exhibition is sponsored by POWER Magazine and is committed to providing a valuable and meaningful forum for operating companies in the changing power generation industry. Whether their roots are in a traditional electric utility or an independent power producer, these companies face the challenge of generating clean, reliable power in a competitive market. An industry-based Advisory Committee has programmed the Conference, with input from the ELECTRIC POWER GenCo Alliance Members that own/operate more than 250,000 mega-watts of generating capacity. 

Thank you for agreeing to participate.  A formal confirmation package will be sent by mid-November or December with complete details on the conference call, hotel & travel information and other items to prepare you for the conference.  Take care. 

Best regards,
