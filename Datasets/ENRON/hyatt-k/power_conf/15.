Here you go. Let me know if any of them come back rejected.  We will work on
redoing our reports so that it does not do that anymore.  Here is the
manually revised version for email addresses.

Carrie, thanks for the list.  On the "Accepted" page, some of the emails
were truncated.  Can you get someone to fix this and resend me the page?
thanks

Kevin, here is a list of folkes I invited for NGI. They are either
invited,
accepted or declined. That was as of 8.10.01.  I attached the latest
accepted only committee list as well. 

Let me know if you need additional info. Thanks Kevin!

You gave me a copy of a page with all the names, addresses, phones etc.
of folks interested in the NGI committee.  It looks like it was set up
on an excel spreadsheet.  Can you please email me the spreadsheet?

thanks
