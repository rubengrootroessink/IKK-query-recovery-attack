Hi Kevin, this is great.  Is this for the session on "Power Plant Fuel
Delivery Issues" and if so, I guess he is confirmed, correct?

Let me know. Thanks Kevin!

Kevin,
Attached is an abstract of a paper submitted for your consideration for
presentation at the March Electric Power 2002 Conference in St. Louis.
Also
included is a brief biography.

I have also been asked to submit the paper to the Southern Gas
Association
Management Meeting in April following the Electric Power 2002
conference.
Do you know if there any issues with copyright of the published paper as
long as the Electric Power Conference is properly referenced?
