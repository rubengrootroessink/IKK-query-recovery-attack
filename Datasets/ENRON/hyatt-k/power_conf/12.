Alternative Power Committee Members:

By now you should have received information from Carrie Shapiro at Trade
Fair summarizing organizational session #2.  The attached spreadsheet
contains information relevant to follow-ups from that meeting, as well as
contact info for our committee and session chair information.

Please review the attachment for your name and make initial contacts with
prospective speakers as discussed at the last session.  Once a verbal
commitment is made, please return information to me regarding the Speaker's
name, title, company, phone number, and a status (tentative, committed,
etc.).

I will coordinate and compile all the information and forward to Trade Fair
so formal invitations can be sent.  Our third and final organizational
session is Tuesday, October 9th.  Please try to firm up as many folks as
possible prior to that session so we can conclude the program layout, and
allow the session chairs to follow-up prior to year-end holiday vacations.

Thanks again for your participation amidst your busy schedules!
