Jeff--
	per our conversation this morning, attached is the original project open season announcement from August 2001.  A couple of current changes are:

Volume to Phoenix market - 750,000 MMBtu/d
Volume to Cal Border     -  30,000
San Juan receipts		 - 780,000

Projected rate to Phoenix - $0.45/MMBtu

We are also offering 16 hour peaking capability (max daily quantity available in 16 hours, not 24)
and pressure guarantees to those FT customers directly connected to the system (which doesn't help Bowie but may help you somewhere else).

Please don't hesitate to call me with any questions.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt
