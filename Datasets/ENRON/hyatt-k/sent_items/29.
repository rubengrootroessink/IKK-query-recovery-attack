I got this information out a little late last year so here is a heads up.  The Needles 38th annual golf tournament is scheduled for the 5th and 6th of April.  The tournament involves Transwestern, SoCal, El Paso, PG&E, Soutwest etc....

Randy Williams (team leader for the Kingman team) can be contacted for additional information.  Also, Randy, would you please put Steve, Kim and Kevin on your distribution list for the golf registration flyers once they become available.  

Oh yea, if dollars are available we could use about 60 dozen golf balls or any items that you might like distributed during the tournament.  If you or someone from your group would like to tie the golf tournament into a quick tour of the Red Rock facilities let me know and I will coordinate those details.  Thanks
