	that was fast!  Received the agreement from you and am awaiting signature from my V.P. (he is out of the office till Wed. 2/27).  In the meantime, I'm having field ops start pulling maintenance files and easement records.  I'll let you know timing when I get it.  If you think of anything else you'd like to review, please let me know.

best regards,
talk with you soon.
