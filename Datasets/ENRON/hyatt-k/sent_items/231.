Bonnie White is the attorney.  I have already called her to find out what our collection process is (if any).  I know some guys named Guido and Mario who'll be happy to do it for 50% of the money.  I'll let you know what I find out.

Kevin,

Who in legal have you been working with?  Tracy was wondering when we thought we would receive the money.

Thanks, Kim.

Any idea when or if we will receive the money?

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.
