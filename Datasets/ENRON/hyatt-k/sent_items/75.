You will soon receive the following documents to complete your vehicle financing:

maximum amounts and loan to value limits) and present it to the dealer as
payment along with the Dealer Agreement.

2.  Note and Security Agreements for both new and used vehicles stating your
maximum allowable loan amount.  Please review carfeully the one that pertains
to your vehicle purchase before signing the Check Draft.
