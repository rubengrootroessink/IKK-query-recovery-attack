A saleswoman is driving through the Reservation toward home when she
sees an Indian woman thumbing for a ride on the side of the road.

As the trip had been long and quiet, she stops the car and the Indian
woman gets in.  After a bit of small talk, the Indian woman notices a
brown bag on the front seat.

"What's in the bag?" asks the Indian woman.

"It's a bottle of wine.  I got it for my husband,"
says the saleswoman.

The Indian woman is silent for a moment then says, "Good trade."
