Celebrate 45 years?  Drown my sorrows is more like it!!!
 
The Last Concert Cafe is in the far northeast section of downtown in the warehouse district just south of I-10.  They have decent Tex-Mex if you want to grab a bite earlier.  Carolyn Wonderland is a young singer/songwriter who singing style is kind of a cross between Marcia Ball and Janice Joplin.  Expect an eclectic crowd and dress warm if it is cool that evening, it's a semi-outdoor event.

Tomorrow is Rick's 45th Birthday and to celebrate, we are going to the Last Concert Cafe at 1403 Nance Street and listen to Carolyn Wonderland.  I think the show starts about 10:00 p.m., so if any of you night owls are looking for somewhere to go tomorrow night, please come join us!
