>>crotch when I ask where the bathroom is?  I didn't think so.
>>
>>2.  The Pillsbury Doughboy is way too happy, considering that he doesn't
>>have a penis.
>>
>>3.  People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room
>>for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change it
>>manually.
>>
>>4.  When people say, "Oh, you just want to have your cake and eat it to
>>Back off, spanky!!!  What good is a piece of cake if you can't eat it?
>>What should I do ... eat someone else's piece of cake instead?
>>
>>5.  When people say, "It's always the last place you look. " No shit,
>>Sherlock.  Why the hell would you keep looking for it after you've already
>>found it?  Do people do this?  Who and where are they?  Why aren't they in
>>treatment?
>>
>>6.  When people say, while watching a movie, "Did you see that?" No, I

>>not my fault you can't figure out the radar.
>>
>>And here's the tenth thing that really can drive a person nuts ...
>>
>>10.  Chain letters!  Who the hell thinks that by annoying other people 
>>with
>>stupid mail with no meaning, that you will be granted a wish, or make your
>>long-lost love fall into your arms, or have your significant  other 
>>perform
>>sex on demand.  It's all bull!  I'm so sure that by breaking a stupid 
>>chain
>>letter that the computer gods are going to curse me.  Oh, the terror and
>>horror.  What a crock.
>>
>>By the way, if you send this to ten people, shit won't happen, and that
>>person you're in love with won't come crawling to you.  So if you feel

>>return!!!
