Dean, 
	based on your schedule, how does Tues March 26 in the morning look for you to review the maintenance records for the Gomez lateral with Phil Allard from Pioneer?  How long do you think it will take, including a drive following the lateral route?

I would plan to fly out to Midland from Houston that Monday night, and be at the office for the meeting on Tuesday morning.  

Let me know as soon as you can please.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt
