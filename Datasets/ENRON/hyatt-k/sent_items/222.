Subject:	Updating your information in the HR site

I've just had a call from HR who was putting together a list for STAN HORTON (wondering why I wasn't on 13 with the rest of the team).  If you haven't already updated your information from the move, please do that.

Reminder that our fax number is 713/646-1700.

Thank you.
