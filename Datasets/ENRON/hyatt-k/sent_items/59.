The Sun Devil model is pretty big, over 2000kb, I'm not sure how well it will email but we can try it.  We may want to send a backup on a 100mb zip drive disk.  Do they have the ability to read the zip disk?

Kim and Eric:
Could we send to ArcLight the models for TransPecos and Sun Devil that reflect what we had in today's presentation? You can either send directly to him (and cc me) or send to me and I will forward on to them.  Everyone did a great job today.  Thanks again.
