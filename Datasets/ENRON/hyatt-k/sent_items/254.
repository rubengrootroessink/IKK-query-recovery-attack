>(Someone pulled this off the Air Force Academy's {very
>unofficial}message board. Written by a '96 grad who apparently flies
>A-10s. What we all are REALLY thinking, but a HOG driver says it.)

>"Make no mistake about it... this war is gonna be a Hawgdriver's dream...no
>more of this sending GPS guided bombs from the ionosphere... I want to camp
>out on the enemy's border... I want to yell across the border, in the
>immortal words of Wyatt Earp (as portrayed by Kurt Russell), "You tell 'em
>I'm coming! AND HELL'S COMING WITH ME!!"
>
>I wanna punch Bin Laden in the face and say, 'You gonna do something?  Or
>just stand there and bleed?' And then,  I wanna laugh maniacally, as my 30mm
>shells decimate his camps.
>
>I ain't talking about the Armor Piercing shells this time, although the
>thought of poisoning their lungs (if, in the unlikely event, they survived
>my attack) with the dirty dust of spent uranium is quite refreshing... that
>would make the cloud over New York seem like pure Oxygen.
>
>I want High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) rounds...1150 of them, fired 2 or 3
>hundred at a time... like 3 hundred grenades exploding all at once... and
>that's just my jet... the three coming with me brings that total to 16 cans
>of CBU-87...that's 3,232 individual submunitions for them...that's what I

>
>I want 4 Maverick missiles per jet...that's 16 of those things...and if we

>at just over 1000 feet per second...there might not be enough deceleration
>to detonate the thing but at that speed... I don't think it would be

>
>And I want 2 pods of rockets, hanging from my wings. Seven white phosphorous
>and seven HEI... I want the 'Willie Petes' to put a cloud of smoke, to climb
>into the sky, to let everyone following know...that's where the gettin' is
>good...
>
>And the HEI... well, I just want FRAG in the air, tearing apart their
>greasy, scumbag bodies the same way they tore into our nation... and then
>we'll start cleaning up with the almighty General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger
>cannon... what a perfect name... AVENGER CANNON!!!
>
>If that's all I had, that's all I'd want... four hawgs, with 4600 of our
>little friends... lock and load, hammer down!!!!!
>
>But that's just my personal end... here's what else I want...I want John
>Madden, Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long, to take over CNN, NBC, ABC and every
>other news network, to provide coverage of this war...
>
>I want Madden, with his electronic chalkboard, out there describing what's
>going on... "You see here, across the top of the screen, that ridge line is
>exactly where the attack is gonna come from... you'll see the Warthawgs come
>popping over them and unleash a fury that we haven't seen since Lawrence
>Taylor was on the prowl...Speaking of that, here they come and BAM!!!  These
>guys are great!... they remind me of linemen... they don't get much press
>coverage, but when they hit you,man do you know it!"

>I want Hank Williams, Jr. and Lee Greenwood belting out, "I'M PROUD TO BE AN

>THE DAY":..."Today's strike comes from a flight of two A-10 Warthogs..
>You'll see here that some terrorist got

>the wild idea that he could shoot at these guys...you can see the missile
>come up and totally miss the two jets... and here, you see, as they roll in
>and unleash that awesome gun on the point of origin,...nothing left there
>now!  And that's our, PLAY OF THE DAY!!"
>
>I want Mills Lane, in the field, giving play by play descriptions.
>
>I want "Flight of the Valkaries" playing at full bore, from every
>mountainside, as we run in at 100 feet....
>
>I want "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE," playing after the first bomb hits, and when
>I'm WINCHESTER ammunition, I wanna land on Bin Laden's personal airstrip,
>grab him by his twisted, dead neck and poke him in the eyes and say,  "YOU
>JUST GOT KNOCKED OUT!"
>
>I want the NFL cheerleaders to send us off to war, and the XFL cheerleaders
>to welcome us home. And while we're at it? I don't just want to beat the
>crap outta these scumbags, I want to humiliate them, too.
>
>I want to see Schwartzkopf come outta retirement, to start kicking some

>I want STUKA terror sirens, mounted to the wings of my Hawg...although the
