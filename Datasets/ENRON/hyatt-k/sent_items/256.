Subject: speaker for Electric Power 2002 conference


Hi Jose--
	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html

One of our proposed speaking topics is "Changing Gas Quality Specs"  and
the impact to today's turbines which are supposedly much more sensitive
to gas specs than older generation units.  Another potential topic is
"Pressure Reliability" dealing with the impact to gen units with varying
fuel pressures.

I'm looking for an expert at GE Power Systems who would be willing to
give a 15-30 minute presentation on either of these topics on the
afternoon of March 20, 2002.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other
presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

If you have someone who may be interested, please let me know and I can
send them a formal invitation or just have them call me direct.  Thanks
for the help!
