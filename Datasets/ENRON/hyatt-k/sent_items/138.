I saw this too.  Is this just more stumping by "concerned" politicians in a congressional election year ( I can't remember what party Brady is with).  Is it going to be a meaningful meeting or just an "open mic" bitch session.  I'd pass and read the results in the paper (media is invited) or the web site.
