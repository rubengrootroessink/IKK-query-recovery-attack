Per our conversation today, when you folks get a chance, I need someone to verify the current pressure of the Gomez lateral and do a linepack calculation for me.  We are evaluating a potential sale of the lateral and need to know how much sweet gas is in the system.  Please let me know if an answer by Friday 2/22 is not possible.

thanks for the help
