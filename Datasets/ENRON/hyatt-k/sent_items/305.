Didn't David's son play baseball with Austin?  I think I saw him last night with his son at Austin's basketball practice.

This is a Russian built Antonov-12   (Russian equiv.of the C-130 Herc).  I brought it in this afternoon, put 12 tons of pipe on it for Barcelona, Venz. You might recognize David Howser in a cpl of them.
BRgds,

Here are some pictures of the Kvaerner charter. The plane was a Antonov 12. 
Also, Ron Porter wanted me to thank you for the Rockets game.
Thanks,
