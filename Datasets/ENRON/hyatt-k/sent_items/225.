It was nice meeting you too!  Please feel free to email or call anytime with questions or concerns regarding Austin.  I was impressed by the Study Skills program explained last night.  If this class was made a 6th grade requirement, I think it would go a long way in better preparing the kids for when they get to your class.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

Mr. Hyatt:
I'm just making sure I have your name in my address book correctly. It was certainly nice to meet you in person last night, and I hope things continue to look up for Austin.
I look forward to reading his research paper, as you obviously had him working extra hard on it over Spring Break. Thanks for your involvement and support.
Have a great weekend! Crescida McCue
