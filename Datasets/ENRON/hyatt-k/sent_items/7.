>>Well, here is a "friendship" poem that really speaks
>>to true friendship!
>>Friend,
>>When you are sad, ...I will get you drunk and help you
>>plot revenge against the sorry bastard who made you
>>sad.
>>When you are blue, ...I'll try to dislodge whatever is
>>choking you.
>>When you smile, ...I'll know you finally got laid.
>>When you are scared, ...I will rag you about it every
>>chance I get.
>>When you are worried, ...I will tell you horrible
>>stories about how much worse it could be and to quit
>>whining.
>>When you are confused, ...I will use little words to
>>explain.
>>When you are sick, ...stay the hell away from me
>>until you're well again I don't want whatever you
>>have.
>>When you fall, ...I will point and laugh at your
>>clumsy ass.
>>This is my oath, ...I pledge 'til the end. Why you may
>>ask? Because you're my friend!
>>Send this poem to ten of your closest friends and get
>>depressed because you realize you only have 2 friends,
>>and one of them is not speaking to you right now
>>anyway.
>>Remember: A friend will help you move. A really good
>>friend will help you move a body
