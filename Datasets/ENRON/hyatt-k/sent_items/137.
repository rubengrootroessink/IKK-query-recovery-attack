Bill, I need a confidentiality agrmt for a proposed pipe sale transaction.

We are evaluating possibly selling a lateral piece of TW pipe to Pioneer.  They are interested in purchasing approx. 35 miles of pipe that TW took out of service in 2000.  The pipe in located in Ward and Pecos County, Texas.  

Once the C.A. is executed, we would let Pioneer begin due diligence covering information such as easements, maintenance records, physical location, etc.

Pioneer is an owner/operator of gas gathering & intrastate pipe transmission assets.  Their info is as follows:

Pioneer Gas Pipeline, Inc.
Mr. Philip R. Allard, President
502 S. Koenigheim, Suite 3A
San Angelo, Texas 76903
ph 915-655-3300
fax 915-655-3315

let me know if you need any further info.

thx
Kevin Hyatt
