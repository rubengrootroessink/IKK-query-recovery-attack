Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.  They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks for the help!
