I have it penciled in for 3pm on thurs 10/25.  Wednesday afternoon looks ok too.  Friday I may be travelling.  Just let me know if you need to move it.  Susan can view everyone's calendar and locate a time that works for everyone.

FYI, attached is a spreadsheet compiled by the Calif Energy Commission of electric power plants proposed for the WSCC (all fuels).  Just some fun facts to know and trade.
