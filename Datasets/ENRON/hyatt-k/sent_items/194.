I will be leaving the company next Friday, March 15.

Dennis Lee will be the new contact person for all new POI setups and questions related to Transwestern POI's.

Elizabeth Brown will be his backup.

Please direct all future communications regarding TW POI's to Dennis and Elizabeth. 

Thanks

Karen Brostad
