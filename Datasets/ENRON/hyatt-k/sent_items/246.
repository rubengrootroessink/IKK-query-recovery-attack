Is that "instant bam" an offer or just a suggestion?  I hear a mattress comes standard with every new truck purchase.

Yep....and all the medical. He stopped smoking pot like 3-4 months ago. As you might remember he had several head injuries and was on a medication(s) to level out the ol brain waves. He quit those. Apparently, he is operating well on no meds and no pot. 

Who knew Todd might get a life! 

You know if you get one of those Ford 250s you could have instant bam anywhere you go in that flatbed!!
