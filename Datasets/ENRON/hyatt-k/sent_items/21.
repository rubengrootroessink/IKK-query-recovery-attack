spoke with Bill Morgan.  At this point, he only has Mon - Tues 1/14-15 open.  He may have other openings if there are cancellations, we just have to let him know so he can call us.  The rut just started, they've taken some bucks off the place.  If we wanted to hunt an extra day, because we were there before, he would charge $150 per shooter.  If you wanted to bring a 3rd party, price would be the full $500 for a 2 day hunt.

Let me know what you want to do.  I'm flexible.
