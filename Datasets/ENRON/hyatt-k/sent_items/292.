Subject: Electric Power Conference 2002
Importance: High


Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are
electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment
suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is "LNG - a new role in North
American supply." A concern among power generators has been the lack of
domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing
gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and
will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30
minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.
They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in
a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested
in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks
for the help!
