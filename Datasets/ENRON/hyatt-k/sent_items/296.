Dear Mr. Nelson:
I am happy to confirm your participation as a panelist in the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE Conference, co-located with ELECTRIC POWER 2002 for the session titled "The New Reality of the Gas Fueled Power Industry."

We have you scheduled to present on the subject of Pipeline Infrastructure Security.  We plan to hold a conference call in January or February 2002 with the Chair and the other presenters participating.  You will be notified with the date and time for the conference call.  For now, plan to present for about 15 -20 minutes on the subject.  Time should be allotted at the end for a question & answer session.  
By November 15, please submit a one to two paragraph abstract on the subject.  Around January 15, 2002 we will need your final paper/presentation for publishing with the CD Rom proceedings that will bed istributed to every delegate attending the conference.
