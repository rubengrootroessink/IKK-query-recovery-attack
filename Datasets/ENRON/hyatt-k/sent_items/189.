sorry, I was thinking bi-directional and wrote unilateral.  The CA with Panda should be bi-lateral.

Bill,
	Attached is a Conf Agrmt from Panda Energy.  They have requested we sign this so they can send TW confidential info related to the financing and cash waterfall covenants of their debt for the power plants.  I have not reviewed this yet, but I would like to make the agreement unilateral if it's not already.  Can we discuss this afternoon?

thanks
Kevin Hyatt
