life is good, work sucks.  Things are a little tough, we judge the day by how many news trucks are parked outside.  We need a good natural disaster somewhere in the world to take the media heat off Enron.  Supposedly, the lead singer from Twisted Sister was in front of the building doing some kind of rap video.  Oh the depths we sunk to.....
