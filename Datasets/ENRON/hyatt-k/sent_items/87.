David, 
	glad to hear you're hanging in there.  I sent your resume over to Gaye Lyn Schaffart at Northern Border.  They were looking for an analyst.  Did anyone contact you?

It's been tough with Sun Devil.  We've changed the scope somewhat and lowered the overall cost, but the current financial situation still makes it tough.

stay in touch and I'll keep my eyes and ears open for you.
Kevin

Kevin,

This is David. How are you doing? Hope everything goes
well with you. How's Sun Devil going?

I still have not had any luck in job searching.
Hopefully, there's something coming up pretty soon.
I'll definitely update you regarding my situation.

All the best,

David Junus
