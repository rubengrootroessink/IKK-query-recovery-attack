Russ--
	Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.  As we discussed, it includes a 20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery capability to Cal Border.  

After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address any questions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you later this week.  

Hope you are enjoying the snow!!!

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt
