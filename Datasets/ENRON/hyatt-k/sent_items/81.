A couple drove several miles down a country road, not saying a word.

  An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither wanted to concede
  their position.

  As they passed a barnyard full of mules and pigs, the husband
sarcastically
  asked, "Relatives of yours?"

  "Yep," the wife replied, "in-laws."



How the hell you been doing Kevin?  Someone told me that the new name for EnronOnLine was going to be UB SOL.
