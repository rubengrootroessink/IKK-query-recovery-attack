 Can I get an instruction booklet for a model 1560 (serial 1650338)? 

Please send to:

Kevin Hyatt
18715 Hickory Ashe Dr
Humble, TX  77346

Also, my unit keeps flashing "L" and beeping after being plugged in for only a few minutes and I can't get it to quit.  Do I need to reset the unit?  I'm assuming the "L" means Laser detected.

thanks
