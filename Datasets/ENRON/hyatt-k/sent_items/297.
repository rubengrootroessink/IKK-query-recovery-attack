I saw Scott last year at a Rockets game.  Remember Steve Dickerson, he's working with us now on a consulting basis.

I'll continue to stick this out for awhile, maybe ride this wave back
up.  I'm working on a new pipeline project to serve Phoenix growth.
Maybe the new owners will take a greater interest in assets than the
previous ones.

What a meltdown.  As for me, I'm the new boy - creating a new job.  Not
sure what my needs will be, but I'd say probably 3-6 months, close a
deal before my domain expands.  Do you know Jessica Landis?  or Jim
Easter?  they're both here and could probably be of more assistance.

take care - good luck - hope you sold all at$75 or above!
