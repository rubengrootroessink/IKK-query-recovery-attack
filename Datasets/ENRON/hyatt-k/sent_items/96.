Dear Curt--
	thanks for your phone call this morning.  In light of our conversation, I have prepared the attached document, with help from our VP of Finance Kevin Howard, in order to help APS better understand the current and projected Transwestern credit situation.  

After you and Tom Carlson have had a chance to review, please feel free to contact us with any questions.
