Sure.  Probably the best method is for us to overnight them to you -- we can email filings made at the Commission if you can use an Image reading program -- I'll work with my assistant on it and may do a test with you.

Will let you know.

Hi Nancy--
	yesterday the Full Requirements shipper responses were due at FERC.  If it's not too voluminous, can I get a copy emailed or faxed?

I'm travelling till Monday but if you need to talk, page me at 888-582-7421.

thx
