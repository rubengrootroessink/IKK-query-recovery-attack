Kevin,
 
Thank you for referring me to Kevin Howard.  I have talked with him and sent him a description of the types of assets we would be interested in acquiring.  
 
I have another request.  Would you please see if Brad Petzold is still with Enron?  I think he runs a company in Pittsburgh that sells franchises for improving operations of commercial heating and air conditioning.  Could you please get me the name of the company and the telephone number?
 
Thanks for everything and take care.
Steve
