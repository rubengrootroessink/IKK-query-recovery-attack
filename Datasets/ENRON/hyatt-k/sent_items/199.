Dear ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Participant, 
 
Our records show that we have not yet received a bio from you for the ELECTRIC POWER 2002 Conference.  We need this information to give to the Chairperson for introductions at the Conference. 
 
If you are Chairing a session, we would still like to have your bio for our records.  We post this information on our website at www.electricpowerexpo.com <http://www.electricpowerexpo.com> for the delegates to view information about each Speaker, as well as the Chairperson.  
 
Please forward a one paragraph bio no later than Tuesday, March 12.  You may reply to this e-mail with your bio included. 
 
Once again, Thank you for participating in ELECTRIC POWER.  We look forward to seeing you very soon!
 
Have a great weekend!
