Hi everyone!!

	For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.  You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  

Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.

Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  

I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  

If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    

Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!
