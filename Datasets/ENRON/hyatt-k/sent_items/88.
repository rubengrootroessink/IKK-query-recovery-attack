It just keeps getting uglier and uglier around here.  How are you?  You making any money off getting former Enron folks hired out or are they being treated like lepers?

I've got a resume I'd like to send you if you're interested on a kid who was our business development analyst.  He came from EES and has a good risk management and modeling background.

Let me know if you'd like to see it.

Hope you and Daphne are doing well.

take care,
Kevin Hyatt
