Kevin, I did your time today since I will be out until Tuesday of next week.  What I did was go ahead and put you away on Friday (I can always go back in and change that when I return if you decide you can't take that day).  The important aspect to tell you about this is that I didn't put it as Vacation, rather as your Discretionary Holiday.  If worse comes....you will be compensated for untaken vacation days but not for that discretionary day.  So...................
