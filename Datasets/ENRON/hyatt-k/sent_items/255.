Also, when you, me and Dave met at the P.O. DoubleTree, Dave mentioned an article he saw dealing with LNG gas specs and their impact to gen units.  He was going to try and get me a copy of the article and check into whether or not the author would want to present at the conference (at least that's my recollection).  Can you follow up with Dave to see if he's had any success?

thanks
