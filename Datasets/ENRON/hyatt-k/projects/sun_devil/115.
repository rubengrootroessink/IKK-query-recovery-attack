Sorry I left the above out of the first email.  Attached is the latest and greatest taken from Winflow.  There is a possibility of elimianting Bloomfield unit #5 but don't have time to consider now.  Time crunch!  Will look at later.  If this flies as is then any cost cut later is gravy.  Will run a transient later to look at swings.
