We will probably be making some briefing presentations after the open season ends on August 30th.  Based on the high level of customer interest expressed thus far we expect to receive strong support for our proposed project.  At this point in time we have not yet scheduled any particular meetings however are there any specific dates in Sept. that would work on the Governor's office schedule?  Should you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail or call me at (402) 398-7419.

Glen,

	Thanks for the info.  It sure looks good on paper.  We need the
capacity.  Are you planning a face-to-face briefing with the ACC; if so, it
would be good to brief the Governor's office as well.
