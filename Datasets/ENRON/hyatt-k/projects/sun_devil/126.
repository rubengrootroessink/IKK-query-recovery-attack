Attached is an Excel spreadsheet showing horsepower requirements and fuel use for a variety of scenarios.  One sheet swings the mainline flow west and the second sheet swings the Sun Devil flow.  To keep both sheets consistent, the volume reduction in any case was 124 MMcf/d per 10% which is based on Red Rock fully loaded with all for stations modified.

Let me know if you have any questions.
