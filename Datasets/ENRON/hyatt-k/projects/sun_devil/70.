Scott,
Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with.  (Caveat: Scott, you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing - so keep good notes).  John

I spoke with Eric this afternoon.  We'd like a list of who ENSR is talking with.  We recognize the need to be as open as we can with stakeholders and consultees and concur with John's comment below.  We're comfortable with Scott being able to show regulators a map of the preliminary route.

thanks
kh

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."  Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott
