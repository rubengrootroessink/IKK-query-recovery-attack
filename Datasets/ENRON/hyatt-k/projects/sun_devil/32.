For right now, consider the info below as the likely terminus for the Phoenix lateral.  This was taken from the APS press release announcing their gas storage project.  Let me know if you have questions.

As part of the study, a 30-acre site, located on a thick, naturally occurring salt deposit, is being evaluated to determine if it has the potential to support an underground cavern storage facility. The property is located in an industrial area near the intersection of Dysart Road and Glendale Avenue, near Luke Air Force Base. SunCor Development Company, a sister company of Pinnacle West Energy, is the property's current owner and has applied for the necessary permits to conduct the study.

Kevin, the aerial is here.  Is there a specific or general "Point B" or
"Area B" that we should be considering as the terminus?  Let me know.
Thanks,  Scott
