Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of=
 touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him =
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public=
 support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up =
and bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there =
is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and =
there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their a=
genda to keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from =
David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found p=
roviding the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagst=
aff area.  Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled=
 the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservat=
ion Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flag=
staff and Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but =
will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if the=
re  appears to be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded =
thoughts on this project and we would  like to take a more proactive approa=
ch  "up front" with regard to public participation and input prior to break=
ing ground.  Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is under=
way.=20

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming=
 that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will=
 require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our constructi=
on activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaf=
f to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once =
the pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be com=
pleted for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, a=
rcheology surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should th=
is portion of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC wil=
l require an EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report =
to be conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issue=
s but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past c=
onsttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this grea=
tly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to the=
 rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix m=
akes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for =
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entir=
e proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need t=
o be walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we c=
an identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of =
the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure. =
  However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I =
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline environmen=
tal work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identif=
y something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a W=
AG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at thi=
s time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assi=
st in the environmental budgeting for this project.

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no en=
vironmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not fr=
om a 30,000 foot high level survey. =20

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order aut=
horization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. s=
coped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost t=
o move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am m=
ostly concerned about the "greenfield" portion of the line that would run f=
rom Flagstaff to Phoenix. =20

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

thanks
