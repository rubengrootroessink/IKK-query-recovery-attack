Eric,

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.  

Ron M.

The COMPLETE mainline loop from SJ tie-in to takeoff point between stations 1 and 2 was always about 222 miles.  Then add 16.5 miles downstream of station 1 for pressure support and the total is 238.61.   Some of the previous cases you have  seen did not include FULL looping, starting the Phoenix lateral at Station 2 and relied on more compression.

The Red Hawk lateral new length is based on starting at the end of the Panda Lateral to Red Hawk paralleling and existing line.

Arnold,

Why has the mainline estimate gone from 174.61 miles to 238.6 miles?

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.
