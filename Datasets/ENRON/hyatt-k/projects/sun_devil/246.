Scott,
I received your attached letter reflecting your "out-of-scope" expenditure for the fatal flaw analysis.  I am amazed that you spent $10,000.00 more than you were authorized (authorized amount $8,500.00).  I have passed along your invoice for the contracted $8,500.00 to our development group and at present have no authorization to approve any amount over that commitment.  When the Commercial guys have contracts with shippers and we are ready to move ahead on the environmental resource reports for the FERC filing, we can talk about the overage at that time.  However, I am not sure recovery will be possible.  Until then, I'm afraid I have no further authorization.  John Shafer
