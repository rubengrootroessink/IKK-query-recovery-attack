This company produces very detailed aerial coverage used by the city and developers in Phoeniz and Arizona. We cuurently have the city of Phoenix mapping
Since they are local, they may have, or be able to produce good areail coverage for our proposed routes for Sun Devil.
Thanks, and let me know how your inital contacts go.

This company is pushing digital and space imagery for pipeline aerial photography.  May be worth investigating as this is likely where we are headed in the near future and in fact, may be a more 'efficient' product now for some projects.
 
Based on the moving of technology toward digitally interfaced mapping, if we have knowledgeable people available, this might be a good investment.
For Phase VI aerial photography, we checked this out and found:
    The turn around time for aerial digital photography was much, much better than for film photography.
    Costs seem to be lower although not of significant magnitude.
    Overlay onto drawing system files would be much easier & faster especially if system is laid out in this format - which I understand Enron is headed towards.
    Shortcoming was the fine detail or ROW objects - telephone pole shadows, etc. that show up on film but not on current digital technology.
 
For Phase VI, we wound up sticking with film to be sure we got what we needed.  We did not have time to do it twice and there was risk plus it seemed sure we would eventually have to do the film later for the detail. 
These shortcomings will probably go away in the next generation of digital cameras.  In addition, in a short FERC filing deadline, these details do not appear necessary for FERC, only for later detail engineering design.  I do not know time constraints if any, but Doug might consider for Sun Devil.

Phil:
 
Thank you very much for taking the time out of your schedule to meet with me and my colleagues concerning mapping, information technology, and imagery.  I am getting in contact with Mike Crump to discuss the logistics of a demonstration project for the Minnesota area.
 
As I mentioned to you, we will be at the GITA GIS for Oil and Gas Conference demonstrating our "e-maps" internet delivery solution.  Conference dates are September 17, 18 and 19th at the JW Marriott Hotel by the Galleria (713) 961-1500.  We would like to meet as many Enron folks as possible at this meeting, so it you would be kind enough to circulate this email to the appropriate individuals.  They may call me at 407-718-3880 for trade show times or arrange for a hands on demonstration.
 
Thank you again for your time and I look forward to working with you in the future.
