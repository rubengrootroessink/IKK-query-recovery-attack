Attached is a Level B request for the Sun Devil project.  Keep in mind that this should include only right of way at this time.  Details on the compression will probably change based on the responses during the open season.

Kevin,

I will let you send this to Doug for tomorrow's meeting as we discussed.  Any future Planning correspondence to Engineering  will be sent directly from the Planning team with a copy to Asset Management and Marketing.  Arnold E.wanted a copy now to get started on reviewing existing compression.  He's fully aware it will probably change later.

Ron M.
