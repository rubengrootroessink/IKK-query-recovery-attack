Gentlemen,

I just got off the phone with John Shafer and Jon Schmidt (ENSR
Tallahassee).  John Shafer has asked us to get started on a fatal flaw
analysis for routing of the Sun Devil project.  He suggested that I contact
all three of you.  He said that you, Larry, have done some initial routing;
you, Kevin, have an aerial photo of the Phoenix area that we can look at,
and should ask you to send; and that you, Doug, are the Project Director.  I
will be calling each of you within the next day or two to start gathering up
as much information as I can.  We have been advised to begin moving ASAP.
Thanks,  Scott
