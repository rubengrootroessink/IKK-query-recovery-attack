Kevin,

Great start!  Thanks for the list, it makes the process more transparent.  How would you rate each prospects?  It would be helpful to develop some kind of scoring system based on potential load to be connected, credit quality, and El Paso-RQ tariff barrier.  Any other relevant attributes?

Hey gang, I need your help.  The address below will take you to a spreadsheet of marketing contacts for the Sun Devil Project.  I need you to update the spreadsheet as you add customers and discuss the project.  I have added the first dozen that I know about.  Michelle, there is a new contact for Cook Inlet and I gave the lady your name and number after I walked her through the project.  

Please keep the spreadsheet current as you talk with customers.  Kim, Steve, Eric, and I will be reviewing the sheet regularly to view progress.  Let me know if you'd like to see it formatted differently or to have other info added.  You can also write out your notes and give them to Susan Wadle and she will input the info for you.

thanks for the help.
kh

P.S.  If you'd like to set up a shortcut on your PC desk top to take you directly to the sheet, let me know and I will set it up for you.
