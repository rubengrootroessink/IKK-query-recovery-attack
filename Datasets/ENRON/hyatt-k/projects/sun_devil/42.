I've arranged a breakfast meeting with Dick Ingersoll next Thursday at 7:30a.m.  Dick is a retired Enron hand living in Phoenix and is on retainer to ETS for consulting services.  He is extremely knowledgeable about electricity markets, transmission infra-structure, counterparties, regulatory development, etc., etc., etc.  I plan to task him to help us improve our market knowledge.  My thoughts are outlined below.  Please advise if you would like him to provide additional studies/analyses.

Transmission capacity opportunities + constraints from AZ to CA and Pacific Northwest
Assessment of merchant power plant developments in AZ, Gulf Coast, and FL
Large scale power plant site developments along ETS pipeline corridors
Power marketing, eg selling electricity produced from waste heat recovery concepts
