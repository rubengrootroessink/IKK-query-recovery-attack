I am out west the rest of this week and have some commitments for the
majority of next week.  From our discussion your open season doesn't close
until the end of the month and you needed that to gauge the interest in your
project.  Additionally, I have my people running some preliminary numbers on
our capability to transport volume to your kickoff point.  Given that how
does the 5th or 6th of September look?

Scott,

We discussed having a meeting to consider ways + means that Transwestern
and Kinder Morgan could work together on the Sun Devil and Sonoran
expansion projects.  I'm available in Houston later this week (24th or
25th) or next week (28th, 30th, or 31st).  How would you like to
proceed?

Regards,

Eric Gadd
