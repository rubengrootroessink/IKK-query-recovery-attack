We have gone through and added environmental tasks and costs for seeing the
project through the construction phase (see attached).  The previous
estimate I sent only provided estimated costs through to receipt of the FERC
Certificate.  These costs are based primarily on prorating tasks from other
similar projects on which we have worked, including both of Northern
Border's most recent projects, Southern Trails, Gulfstream, and SoNat's
Caballero.  Please call with any questions or concerns.  We can continue to
refine these costs and provide greater detail, should that prove to be
necessary.  Please let us know.  Thanks, 

Scott
