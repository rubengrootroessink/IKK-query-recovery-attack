Enron Corp.'s subsidiary Transwestern Pipeline Co. says it received request=
s for more than 1.3 Bcf/d of capacity for its proposed Sun Devil Pipeline e=
xpansion project that would transport San Juan Basin natural gas production=
 to market areas in Phoenix and California by January 2004.=20
Transwestern's Sun Devil Pipeline was announced as another of several new w=
estern states' gas transportation options. A Transwestern official said the=
 gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona is the second largest grow=
th market in the U.S. The company is working with shippers to finalize tran=
sportation agreements and expects to file its Sun Devil application with th=
e FERC early next year. Shippers needing additional information can contact=
 Project Director Kevin Hyatt at 713-853-5559 or email at Kevin.hyatt@enron=
.com.=20
Transwestern announced its plans on August 8. The proposed project will inc=
lude new compression and pipeline looping plus a new lateral, the Flagstaff=
 - Phoenix, Arizona lateral, which would add approximately 175 miles to Tra=
nswestern's existing system. The project's estimated in-service date is Jan=
uary 2004. The proposed facility modifications will enable Transwestern to =
deliver an incremental 780,000 dth/d from the Blanco Hub located in San Jua=
n County, New Mexico to the Thoreau area, an incremental 90,000 dth/d from =
Thoreau to the California border, and an incremental 450,000 dth/d from Tho=
reau to Phoenix. Potential supply receipt points from the San Juan Basin at=
 the Blanco Hub are BRT/Val Verde Plant, WFS/Milagro Plant, WFS/Kutz Plant,=
 and TransColorado/Blanco. Transwestern will consider interconnecting with =
other upstream and downstream pipelines, subject to the mutual agreement of=
 the pipelines. The estimated maximum one-part reservation rates, exclusive=
 of fuel and all surcharges, for firm service through the capacity describe=
d in this open season are as follows: San Juan to Thoreau -$.0985 dth/d; Th=
oreau to California -- $.240 dth/d; and Thoreau to Phoenix -- $0.454 dth/d.=
 (See REPORT NO. 2348, pp6-7.)=20
Transwestern's Red Rock Project (CP01-115), approved by FERC earlier this s=
ummer and under construction, will add 150 MMcf/d of new capacity for deliv=
eries to the California border in mid-2002.
