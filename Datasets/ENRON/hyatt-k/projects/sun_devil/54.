Kevin,

Ron pointed out an error to me in my spreadsheet.  The revised one is attached.  The error was in the second case, high end cost estimate number (it was too low).  It shouldn't be material since you most likely will be using Case 1 to compare to our TW Sun Devil Project and Case 3 as a different route (Waha source) alternative.


Bryan
