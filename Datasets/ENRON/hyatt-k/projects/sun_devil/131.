Eric,

What we have done was use meteorological data from the internet but have fo=
und that to be incorrect for remote locations.  The internet in some places=
 reads low compared to the actuals at the stations.  I try to go by what th=
e locals have versus the internet.  I think the internet data is more of an=
 average versus the spots throughout the day even though they call them dai=
ly highs.  Go example is Station #1 were the internet data is about 5 - 8 d=
egrees low compared to actuals at the station.  Same is with San Juan were =
I have seen temperatures in the summer hit high temps as early as 9:00 a.m.=
  Other factors to consider is not only the ambient temps but what the comp=
ressor unit can stand (ie; shutdowns or limit switches).  If the nightly ex=
haust temperature does not cool down enough at Bloomfield, the unit can be =
limited in power as early as 8:00 a.m. when it reaches 1400 F.  It appears =
that thre is plenty of power left to run but the unit can't get there.  I h=
ave seen power levels peak at 4000 Hp when the unit is site rated at 4500 H=
p. =20

As time goes on, I'll either help you understand more or confuse you.  Let =
me know which direction I'm headed from time to time.  You can't hurt my fe=
elings.  I'm copying Kevin to keep him up to speed.  Planning is not an exa=
ct science but we use experience and whatever REAL data is available.=20

Ron,=20

Yes, thanks very much.  I'm trying to move up the pipeline engineering + de=
sign learning curve. =20

I get the impression that having different design basis conditions for each=
 compressor station introduces a lot of complexity for calculating interrup=
tible capacity arising from lower ambient temperatures.  It might be 75 deg=
rees at one station and 95 degrees at another, which would act as a bottlen=
eck.  Do we meteorological data for each station? =20

Each station has a different temperature based on location and elevation.  =
Station #2 is far less than Station #1 based on elevation.  Station #1 is 9=
5 F and Station #2 is 90 F.  Station #2 is over 7000 feet while Station #1 =
is around 5000 feet.  The drop is quick because Needles is around 500 feet.=
  There is a 2000 feet swing between stations starting from Station #4 west=
. =20

Does this help?

Was I correct on the 95 degree F set point?

in general you have an additional 3% HP available for every 10 deg F below =
95 deg at each station.  During the summer Stations 1, 3, and 4 are already=
 at MAOP and would not matter.  At station 2 the 10 deg would gain 5 mmscfd=
 to Phoenix and mayby 3 mmscfd to Ca.   We will have run additional models =
to verify offcases.

Arnold,

I understand that pipeline design is based on hot (95 degrees F) ambient te=
mperature conditions.  Is this true?  If so, assuming a normal weather patt=
ern, how much additional capacity is "created" when temperature conditions =
are off design basis?  I'd like to quantify the potential upside assuming t=
hat this incremental capacity would be available for interruptible transpor=
tation sales.
