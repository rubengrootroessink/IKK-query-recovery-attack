Ron, this is very large project.  I would recommend soliciting contributions from the team on various parts where possible.  I can provide San Juan Lateral models with correct elevation profiles used for DRA analysis and the models from SJ Junction to Flagstaff used for Redrock expansion.  Come see what I have and lets discus further.  One thing for sure, we will need to do a presentation to the team for checks and balances before submitting to Commercial.
