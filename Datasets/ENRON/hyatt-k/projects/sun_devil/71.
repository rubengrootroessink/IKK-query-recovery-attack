Doug,

You're right!!  Pipe size can swing the costs substantially. May be able to go down to a 20" or 24" depending on flow.  Once I have a volume,  I can size the line in a matter of minutes.  100 vs 450 MMcf/d makes a BIG difference.  I'll leave the guess work of flow up to Kevin.

Ron M.

Kevin
Do you want a cost estimate for the Panda Energy extension for the Cavern to the tie-in point.
It is 35.4 miles long , and we need to rethink/confirm the 36" size based on volume, as every inch in diameter adds substantial cost.
Thanks
