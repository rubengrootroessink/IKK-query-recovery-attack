Kevin,
I am still working with the Arizona Chapter of TNC to get the information I=
 was looking for.  However, preliminary talks is that there are no show-sto=
ppers from the environmental community at this point.  There will be some s=
ensitive issues, but we can work through them.  On a project of this magnit=
ude (400 miles, with about 200 of it greenfield) an environmental strategy =
should be developed which would probably include some early scoping meeting=
s to assess public and landowner input.  I would suggest that you consider =
having a Third Party do the EIS for the FERC Staff (it is much faster that =
way as the FERC does not have to dedicate staff to a major filing).  Also, =
have you thought about whether or not we would want to go to the FERC early=
 and solicit their involvement up-front to expedite and streamline the proc=
essing?  I am assuming that Rob Kilmer will be in charge of putting the app=
lication together since he has assumed the TW work from Mark Kay Miller (at=
 least that is what I have been told)?  I would also suggest that you think=
 about enlisting the input from the Public Relations folks (i.e., Gina Tayl=
or). =20

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no en=
vironmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not fr=
om a 30,000 foot high level survey. =20

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order aut=
horization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. s=
coped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost t=
o move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am m=
ostly concerned about the "greenfield" portion of the line that would run f=
rom Flagstaff to Phoenix. =20

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt
