I am scrambling to get the correct quad maps so I can find the locations and route from the cavern to the El Paso MP 619. Without them, it will be very difficult from the air to figure out where we are and what we're looking for/at.
No luck yet, but will try to get before I depart Monday noon.

Doug--
	The Panda Energy Plant is to be located 3 miles NE of the Town of Gila Bend, AZ.  Panda proposes to lay approx. 18 miles of line to reach the El Paso southern system.  The Panda lateral to El Paso would parallel Hwy 85 and interconnect with El Paso at mile post 619.  The El Paso southern system lies approx. 15 miles south of Interstate 10.  You can click on the map below (look for the green dot) to locate the plant.

My question is what does the ROW look like from the proposed salt storage south and west to where Panda will interconnect with El Paso?

The coordinate is a green circle in Section 20.

Let us know if this is OK, or if you'd like us to plot more points.
