To All
I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies contacted, and 2 significant itmes leap out.

#1 New Mexico BLM Permitting - Cultural Resources
David Simmons - Archeologist - Farmington BLM office quoted " Navajo ROW costs usually approximately $1MM/mile". THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL PROJECT FROM DAY 1

#2 Longest permit times are 1 year, which means that with a tentative schedule as follows:
FERC Filing - Sept/01 to March 30/02
FERC Approval - April 1/02 - April 1/03 - 1 year
Construction - April 1/03 - Jan 1/04 - 9 mos 

In order to start construction by April 1/03 to achieve an in service in early 2004, application for specific long lead permits will need to be made April 1/02. This will require significant field work and design details prior to April 1/02. I doubt we will be ready to commit to such an undertaking this early in the process.

I suggest after the ENSR fatal flaw analysis is complete, a very comprehensive review of all permits and their relation to the critical path is undertaken.

We have already been in contact primarily with most of the state and
Federal
level agencies that exist in both AZ and NM as well as the Navajo
agencies.
I could get you a complete list of agencies we've contacted if you'd
like,
but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in both
states
has been contacted.

Scott,
Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with.  (Caveat: Scott,
you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes
of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing -
so keep good notes).  John

I spoke with Eric this afternoon.  We'd like a list of who ENSR is
talking with.  We recognize the need to be as open as we can with
stakeholders and consultees and concur with John's comment below.  We're
comfortable with Scott being able to show regulators a map of the
preliminary route.

thanks

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the
landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are
you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a
preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott
