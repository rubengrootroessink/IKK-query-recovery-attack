Jim-
	We plan to file with FERC Q1 2002 for the pipe certificate.  Doug Cebryk and Larry Campbell plan to fly the proposed ROW from Flagstaff, AZ to Phoenix, AZ on 9/11.  We plan to loop the existing San Juan lateral and mainline segments as far west as Flagstaff.  Attached is a copy of the open season (which closed Thurs 8/30).  Please don't hesitate to call with any questions.

louie, thanks for the info. do we have a certificate
yet? if so would you please send or have someone send
a copy of the text and any maps showing location on
the nn reservation? did we have any interventions from
the nn utility whatever or the bia--any relevant
interventions? if we haven't filed, i continue to
think that we should put some maps or language in the
application that will give us leverage. i think that
there is little or no risk that the navajos would
intervene. i'm back from ba, rio and sao
paulo--interesting trip re brazil and argentina
litigation.  jim
