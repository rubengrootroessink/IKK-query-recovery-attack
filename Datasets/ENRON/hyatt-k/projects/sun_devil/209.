Hi, Kevin. 

The attached documents are the revised custom map proposal for natural gas pipelines and electric power lines in the State of Arizona and a bitmap image of the data. 

Delma is out of the office this week on vacation. I'll be managing your account in her absence. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or if you need additional information.

Best regards,
