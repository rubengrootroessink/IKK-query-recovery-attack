Kevin,

That is the scenario where we installed all 36" pipe and added two new stations (Station #1.5 & Kingman).  The pressure to Panda will be greater than 600 psig.  The lateral is off the discharge of Station #1.5 which keeps the pressure profile up.  Looking at a minimum of 750 psig with and upside of 900 psig.  Hope this helps.

Ron Matthews

Ron, 
	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.

thanks
