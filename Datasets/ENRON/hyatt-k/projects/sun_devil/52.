Instead of being specific about the route, I will communicate that we are studying alternative routes and it's premature to communicate which route the pipeline might take.  We will consider community and environmental input to determine the pipeline route.

As an FYI - To release any information to the public at this early stage related to a proposed corridor (prior to making personal contact with key environmental groups, key agencies and political types) would be premature and offer opportunities for groups or individual landowners to polarize and organize opposition against Sun Devil.  We have found that in most cases the environmental community is very negative towards a new project if they are called for a quote from the media prior to having a heads-up on the project from the project sponsor.  We are setting a strategy to accomplish this and roll out the project in the best way.  John

The preliminary concept for the Phoenix lateral was to follow the I-17 interstate highway.  We have not advertised that existing ROW is under consideration (because the existing ROW belongs to El Paso).

See minor attached comments.      What are the sources for the data such as the reserve margin information in the Q&A?
