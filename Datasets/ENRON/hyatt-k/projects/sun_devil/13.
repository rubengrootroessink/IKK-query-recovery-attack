Ladies and Gentlemen:

In some part due to my influence, Transwestern is currently holding an 
open season to gauge the level of interest in new pipeline capacity to the 
Phoenix AZ delivery area.  I assume by now you have seen this news in 
industry press.  I encourage each of you to consider the possibility of 
alternative capacity and the advantages of not being a captive customer to 
a single pipeline company.

If you wish to speak directly with the Enron representative or would like 
to obtain more information, please feel free to call Kevin Hyatt at 
713-853-5559.

Best,
Jim
