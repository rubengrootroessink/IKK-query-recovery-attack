Memo to the  Natural Gas Infrastructure Sub-Committee:

As requested by the committee members, the next meeting for the Natural Gas Infrastructure sub-committee will be held on September 19 in Houston, TX.  We have arranged a meeting at the DoubleTree Hotel Post Oak, 2001 Post Oak Boulevard in the Galleria Area, 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  Lunch will be provided and the meeting will take place in the Galleria C meeting room.

This will be a meeting for you to finalize the program for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Track for next March and identify any problem areas needing special attention.  We hope to go on press with the program in late October.  

The worksheets that were completed at the last meeting for the Natural Gas Infrastructure track and an updated conference outline are attached to this email.  Please let me know if you need additional information or have questions. 

Please RSVP by September 7.  Email carries@tradefairgroup.com <mailto:carries@tradefairgroup.com> or call me at (713) 463-9595 x 307.

Thank you for your participation on the Natural Gas Infrastructure Program Committee.  We appreciate your support!
