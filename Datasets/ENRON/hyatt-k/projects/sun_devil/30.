Call Joanna Scruggs 602-417-9300

ask for the overlay statewide digital index map ($18.50).  They recently updated it to 1996 vintage.  The scale is 1:750,000.  From this map you can order the 1:100,000 scale BLM maps ($4 each).  Checks can be sent to:

Arizona Public Land Information Center
222 North Central Ave.
Suite 101
Phoenix, AZ  85004

I don't know if they take credit cards, but if they do, it might speed up processing.  You may just want to order the big scale map and all the smaller ones and save some time.
