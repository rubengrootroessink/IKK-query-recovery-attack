Eric,
As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeli=
ne for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports t=
o satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filin=
g requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of =
the application.  The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC "=
Collaborative Approach" will be implemented throughout the processing of th=
e application.  Even with the "Collaborative Approach" and all of the upfro=
nt work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing,=
 the schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting iss=
ues will be resolved quickly and the processing continue. =20

I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost e=
stimate, by quarters in two phases.  The first part of the estimate would b=
e to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resour=
ce Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to=
 an FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected.  T=
he second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field wor=
k and permitting phases during the processing of the application.  This inc=
ludes participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as require=
d.  This would include assisting the third party environmental contractor i=
n working on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.  It would also incl=
ude mitigation packages to satisfy agency requirements.  The third and fina=
l component would be to budget for a Third Party Environmental Contractor t=
o write the EIS document during the time that the field work is being devel=
oped and to process the same with the FERC Staff.  Once we get the "White P=
aper" Fatal Flaw analysis that ENSR is preparing for this project we will h=
ave enough information along with the budget to get us to the FERC filing t=
o make some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those t=
o the commercial advantages that you are developing.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John Shafer
