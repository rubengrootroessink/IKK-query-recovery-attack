Eric,
Of course, the answer is yes.  The consideration of potential impacts to "C=
ultural Resources" is taken into account within the National Environmental =
Protection Act (NEPA); therefore, to say TW is "commited" to environmental =
stewardship would include that resource (although it is not generally under=
stood that NEPA would include it).  On the other hand, you make a great poi=
nt.  If you want to expand the TW's sensitive consideration with another se=
ntence to include other interests at this point (e.g., interested parties, =
landowners, regualtory bodies, etc.) that would be more reflective of the o=
pen concept we want to portray with the Sun Devil Project.  As a suggestion=
 you could probably say something to the effect that: "TW will consider sug=
gestions and comments made by interested parties (e.g., environmental group=
s, landowners, agencies and others) in the development of a potential route=
 for the pipeline. This includes TW's commitment to develop the route in an=
 environmentally sensitive manner."   John

I'm with John in spirit.  My concern is that you might be "excluding" other=
 stakeholders by highlighting environmental stewardship (and not preservati=
on of cultural heritage, etc.)  Can you generalize to "TW will initiate stu=
dies to carefully consider routes/corridors in consultation with relevant p=
arties, eg landowners, regulatory bodies, etc." ?=20

Being that about half of this project includes "greenfield" area that cross=
 several sensitive watersheds, I have taken the liberty to offer a sentence=
 that reflects the environmental stewardship commitment that TW is includin=
g in its planning of the route for this line.  John Shafer
