Kevin Hyatt, Greetings from eSource:
 
Pursuant to your request for gas production reports for the Rocky Mountain/San Juan/Four Corners region, and the effects of the San Juan tax credit expiration.  The Energy Information Administration reported in 1994 that production should continue its upward trend even though the section 29 tax credit expired.  I have attached the Inside FERC article that speaks to the EIA's postion.  The EIA did not report forecasted data by state or region, but did provide a graph of the projected production data.  Please see the results of our research below.  Should you have any further questions, or additional tasking, please do not hesitate to contact us.
 
 
 
 
Thank you for using eSource <http://esource.enron.com/>.  We look forward to assisting you in the future.
 
Regards,
Cynthia Boseman-Harris
