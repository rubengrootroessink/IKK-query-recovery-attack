Jon, I was referring to the actual monument site, not all lands dedicated to the monument by BLM, which occur for several miles on both sides of I-17.   I was under the impression that the information I had given to you and Scott indicated that the existing right of way passed throught the actual monument itself.  Sorry about the miscommunication.  In your discussions with the BLM, you may want to mention that there is an existing ROW through the Monument  and see if this makes any difference in the difficulity or delays......to cross.

Larry, based on my review of the maps that I received from you today, the
proposed Phoenix Lateral does cross approximately 8.8 miles of the Agua Fria
National Monument (i.e., Black Mesa area on the Joes Hill and Bumble Bee
USGS topographic quads). This portion of the alignment is located east of
Interstate 17. According to the Bradshaw Mountain BLM Land Status map that I
have reviewed, the national monument boundary is located immediately east of
Interstate 17.  Please let me know if you have another map that illustrates
a different alignment that is located west of Interstate 17.  Thanks!

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way,
which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located
west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which
occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to
the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I
was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the
proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and
have the potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced
to deal with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I
mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott
