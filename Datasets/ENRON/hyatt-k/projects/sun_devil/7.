Kevin, the document looks good.  I did forward to Ranelle Paladino in Steve Kirk's group to look at it from a tariff perspective.

Michele and Keith,
	Drew asked that I send this to you to help backstop Rob Kilmer and Teb Lokey.  I have incorporated their changes.  We're still waiting on final rate numbers to fill in the blanks, but we're close.  I'd like to get this in the trade press and on TW's website on Monday 8/6.  Please call me at 853-5559 if you have any comments or concerns.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt
