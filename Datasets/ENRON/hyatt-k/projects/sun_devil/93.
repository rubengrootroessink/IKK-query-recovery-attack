I have attached our revised Cash Flow Estimate for the Sun Devil Pipeline
Project.  I have increased the overall estimate from $5.0 to $7.5 million
based on increases to the cultural resources survey/report, cultural
resources testing and mitigation, agency/public meetings, coordination
meetings, project management, environmental inspector management, and
environmental inspector subcontract tasks.  Substantial budget increases
were made to the cultural resources and environmental inspection tasks.  I
assumed that 4 environmental inspectors would be required for each spread
instead of the 2 inspectors per spread that were assumed in the previous
cost spreadsheet that Scott provided to you.

I also have attached the alternative analysis text and associated table for
the Compressor Station 2 to Cordes Junction, AZ alternative (i.e., I-17
alternative), and a telecommunication report regarding the complications
associated with the potential crossing of the Agua Fria National Monument.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this information.
Thanks!
