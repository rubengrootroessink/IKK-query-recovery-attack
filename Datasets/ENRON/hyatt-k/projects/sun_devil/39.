Kevin:

Thanks for the system map.  As we discussed previously, Crystal Gas Storage
is pursuing the possible development of a natural gas storage facility near
Phoenix on the Luke salt deposit.  We would like to discuss in more detail
the possible expansion of the Transwestern system and a possible
interconnect with the storage facility.  We are in Houston almost weekly and
would like to schedule a meeting at your convenience.  If you would like to
pursue these discussions could you check your calendar and suggest some
possible dates.  You can contact me via e-mail or by phone at (318)
677-5511.  If I am not available, please contact Jeff Ballew at (318)
677-5512.

Thanks,

David Hayden
Crystal Gas Storage
