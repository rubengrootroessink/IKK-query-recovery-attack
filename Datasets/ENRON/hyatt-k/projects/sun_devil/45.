We have performed an initial review of the proposed shippers ( highlighted ) and indicated our findings on the Credit Rankings Section. This review was of a general nature due to an absence of either price or volume. The following are the explanations of the comments:

OK - This customer has an acceptable S & P rating.

Need F. S. - We would need updated financial information in order to provide an opinion.

Amend - An amendment to an existing guaranty would be needed.

OK????? - The approval would be based upon the volume requested and the financial position.

After reviewing, give me a call and we can discuss further.

Regards.

Paul, attached is the current list of potential bidders for the Sun Devil project.  The customers in red are the ones most likely to send in bids.  Can your group please review the likely bidders and let me know of any potential credit issues we will need to deal with early on?

thanks
