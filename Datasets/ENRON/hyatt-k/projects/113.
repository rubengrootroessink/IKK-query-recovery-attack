Kevin,

Here are the rates that we came up with.  Please keep in mind that we may not have 200,000/d available capacity at certain interconnects.  Also, because of the California problems, we have been able to extract additional value for volumes delivered to El Paso Waha.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Kevin,

Jo Williams said that you needed a quote for transportation from Mid 4 to Mid 3 in the Waha area.  On a firm basis we would be would in the $.02 to $.03 demand range plus minimum commodity.  For a TI rate use between $.035 and $.045.  If you would like primary to El Paso Waha, that rate would be a little higher.  We have been able to get additional value out of that interconnect because of the gas prices in California.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.
