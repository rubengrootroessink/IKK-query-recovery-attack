Thanks Rick and Larry,

It seems to me that a crucial next step is to receive tentative approval for injection of BTUs into PG&E, Mojave and SoCal gas pipelines.  This site is ideal in terms of the required investment needed to implement the strategy.  Additionally, our commercial relationship with Paramount could expedite the necessary agreements.  When is our next status meeting ?  Kevin, any word from Enron about the long term spread between Henry Hub and Cal border ?  Does Enron have a preferred consultant that can give us a long term look ?

This is summarizing the tour of the Mohave facility on that Larry Garrett and I attended yesterday. 

The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary. 

As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal.  

If any or all the company's who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service.

Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West.

Gang,

Just spoke to a representative from Paramount Refining about setting up a tour to look at their Mojave facility.  They are very receptive and flexible about timing.  Please give me the most convenient date for this tour and I'll set it up.

For your information:  on their property PG&E has two 34" gas lines and Mojave has a 42" gas line.  Can anyone estimate the total flow through these 3 lines ?  My contact indicates that Paramount has unused rail capacity and plenty of space to construct tanks.
