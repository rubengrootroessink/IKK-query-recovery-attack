Phil--
	Enron is currently evaluating the possibility of installing an NGL peaking facility with appurtenant storage and rail facilities near Needles, California.  Ideally, the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system.

Current gas pipeline specs are as follows:
	Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig, worst case 750, normal range 800-900
	Gas Volume - 650,000 - 750,000 MMBtu/day
	
	Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450,000 gallons/day (18,750 gal/ per hour)


My questions are:

1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so, where?

2)  Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane?

3)  At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls?

4)  Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so, at what price (ball park here, don't go way out of your way)?  (If it's not, what would your suggestion be for a design).

I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number).

As always, we're on a pretty tight time frame.  After you've had a chance to review the above, I'd like to get together and discuss this with you.  I can meet you in Ohio if it fits your schedule better, just let me know.  Thanks for the help and I look forward to talking with you soon.
