This is looking better all the time. Looks like a chance to help the State =
of California as well as ourselves and make a few dollars. Other comments i=

Rick/Scott:

Thanks for the info.

I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project.  I have met with sever=
al groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching facili=
ty is attracting a lot of attention.  They initially considered the 20 MW p=
ortable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50 MW unit=
.  The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage caught t=
heir eye.  The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman plant, =
provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the electricity,=
 and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.  This has the advantage =
of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the revenue strea=
m, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.  The downside would be lack of cont=
rol of the merchant power activity, and it would be a permanent facility. W=
hat does this mean about lack of control? I'm not sure what I'm talking abo=
ut but wouldn't we sign customers up long term?  I am also assuming permitt=
ing and emissions compliance issues would not be extraordinary.

There will be a longer construction time, but I stressed to ENA that a new =
boiler would need to be built first in anticipation of the generator, and t=
hen it could be incorporated when available. If the smaller unit is skid mo=
unted couldn't we set it while filing for a permit for the larger unit and =
let our customers know there's a larger unit to be installed later? I'm not=
 sure how the emission credit would work out. Maybe the State would agree o=
n something like this? This would be working outside of the nine dots.=20

There were some more questions regarding the plant's energy profile.  I gav=
e them the information showing historic, and anticipated energy needs, both=
 for power and gas.  They do need to understand what the daily heat require=
ments would be; i.e.  hours of operation at the plant, 8 hr operations Vs 2=
4 hr operation, temperature requirements for your processes, are there peak=
 requirements, are there any pressure requirements for steam or just heat, =
does the plant shut down operations routinely, etc.  I passed along you nam=
es (Rick & Scott only) as plant contacts as questions come up.

Thanks for your help, and I'll let you know how things progress.

Bob
