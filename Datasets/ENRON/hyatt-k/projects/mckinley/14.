Kevin:

Per you request I left a phone message on 5/7/01 covering the vaporization
and pumping system to direct inject Butane into natural gas line.  The
estimated cost would be $1,150,000 installed.  This is providing backup
capacity.  If you need a detail proposal we would be happy to provide one.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Donald

Don--
	Based on our earlier conversations, I would appreciate you
assembling for Enron a preliminary cost estimate to build an NGL peaking
facility located in California near the Arizona border.

Ideally, the unit would vaporize and inject GPA spec Nc4 (normal butane)
at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour.  At 102,913 btu/gal, this equals
1.93 Billion Btu/hr.  The vapor would be injected into a natural gas
pipeline with a nominal operating pressure of 750 - 1000 psig (normal
range is 800-900).

We are looking at several sites that contain storage tanks and rail
siding so storage at this point is not an issue.

Let me know if you need more information and also you're expected time
to reply.  I look forward to working with you on this project.

Best Regard,
J. Kevin Hyatt
