Gang,

Just spoke to a representative from Paramount Refining about setting up a tour to look at their Mojave facility.  They are very receptive and flexible about timing.  Please give me the most convenient date for this tour and I'll set it up.

For your information:  on their property PG&E has two 34" gas lines and Mojave has a 42" gas line.  Can anyone estimate the total flow through these 3 lines ?  My contact indicates that Paramount has unused rail capacity and plenty of space to construct tanks.
