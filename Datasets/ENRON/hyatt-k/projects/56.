Alan,

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet with historical pressures at two points.  The column titled south of Kingman will be the closes point off TW's mainline to the Red Lake Storage facility.  You can see that the pressures are above 900 psig at least 90% of the time.  The pressures for Sept 10-14 are bad readings for Kingman which you can tell by looking at the CS1 discharge pressures.  Must have been a bad transmitter.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance on supplying data for you analysis.  If you need help in my absence, please contact Kevin Hyatt who is the Business Development.  Kevin's number is 713-853-5559.

Ron M.
