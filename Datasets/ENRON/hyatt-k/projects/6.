1000 LF of 10" pipeline from measuring facilities/EPNG tie-in to proposed plant site boundry

Measuring Facilities - $550,000
Ultrasonic Measuring facilities and regulating facilities for TW and EPNG pipelines

EPNG Hot-tap and Monitoring Facilities - $200,000
30"x8" hot tap and flow regulation and monitoring equipment
