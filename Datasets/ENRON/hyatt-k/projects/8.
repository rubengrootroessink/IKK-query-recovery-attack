Steve,
In addition to Eric's questions below, I have an even more fundamental question, are the two scenarios (3 frame 6's, 2 frame 7's) additive or cummulative?  In other words, are we looking at planning on 130,000 lb/hr or 190,000 lb/hr?  Obviously, all these considerations make a difference in terms of design/cost.

Regarding the information that was provided from Steve Rutherford/API, please answer or have answered the following questions that are presented below:

RE: Maximum pressure and volume ".... initially 3xGE 6B - 60,000 lb/h (aprx. =31MMcfd) @ 350 psig." 
-  is 60,000 lb/h for each unit or times 3 for total of 180,000 lb/h?
-  is 60,000 lb/h rate the sum of 3 GE 6B volumes and is this maximum the hourly rate not a sum divided by 24 hr?
-  what is minimum turndown flow rate?

RE: Maximum pressure and volume ".... future possible 2xGE 7FA - 130,000 lb/h (aprx. =68MMcfd) @ 500 psig." 
-  is the 130,000 lb/h incremental to the 60,000 lb/hr for 3xGE6B or is 130,000lb/hr the new total?
-  is 130,000 lb/h for each unit  or times 2 for total of 260,000 lb/h?
-  is 130,000 lb/h rate the sum of 2 GE 7FA volumes and is this maximum the hourly rate not a sum divided by 24 hr?
-  what is minimum turndown flow rate?
