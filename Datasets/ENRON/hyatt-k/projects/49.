Kevin,
Please fill in the following cells:

	Title
	Estimated Start Date
	Estimated Finish Date
	Region (where the location is - such as Mid, Alb, Ama, etc.)
	Team (where the location is - Kingman, Flagstaff, Laguna, etc.)
	Requesting Cost Center (the TW Cost Center for your Marketing Group)
	Project Type (Use the little drop down box for the selections)
	Location (This is the legal description - Section, Block, Range, etc. - Planning should be able to help with this.)
	County or Parish in which the site is located
	Zip Code of the nearest town, village, city
	State
	Line or Plant Number (Again, Planning should have access to this information)
	City Name
	Project in City (Usually "N" for No)
	Check one of the boxes for New Facility, Existing Facility, Removing Facility
	Describe what is to be done (Study for . . . . . )
	Anticipated Benefit
	Facility Planner (who, I believe, is the person who should be preparing workorders of this type - according to the process flow discussed at a meeting with Marketing 	that I attended some time back in the Spring)
	Construction Coordinator (if there is to be one)
	Capital Budget Code (Talk to Palu Goradia)
	On the back, input however many dollars you want to be posted for this project - into the correct category - usually under Engineering

	E-Mail the completed form to me and I will have it input into SAP before anything else can be done with it.

	Once a number is assigned, the PA will be returned to Marketing for signatures.

	Kevin, I believe you will find that getting the Planners to "gin up" the initial study PA's might speed things up in the future.  

	Here is the form - save a clean copy of it for future use - okay?  And, each time, the above must be completed.
