Kevin,

I want to take a few minutes to say that it was a pleasure to meet you last
week in Bloomfield and to thank you for taking the time from your busy
schedule to attend the meeting.  I sincerely appreciate your support at the
meeting and your comments helped a great deal in clarifying some of the
concerns.

I know you and Rick Moore are working together and trust that you can
finalize issues as soon as possible.

Thank you again for your time and support and I look forward to seeing you
again (in a better atmosphere).
