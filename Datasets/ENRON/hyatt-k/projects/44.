I have reviewed the interconnect (K#7033) and transport agreements (K#20822) with Citizens Utility.  Under the interconnect agreement, Citizens has to be able to take a min. and max pressure of 600-1000 psig from TW.  The good news is as follows:

	Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point (poi# 500134) to 2,000/MMBtu/d effective 6/01 - 10/01 and only 5,000/d from 11/01 - 2/07.  This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct '00 thru Mar'01.  

What this means to TW/ENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES.  So any volume TW delivers for EES, up to the capacity max on the lateral (25,000/d), should not impare deliveries to Citizens.  

I have a question for Fac. Planning: does the Flagstaff N.E. POI# 500046 lie on the same lateral?  If it does, then Citizens has 1,990 MMBtu/d for 6/01 - 10/01 and 2,950 MMBtu/d for 11/01 - 2/07 also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need.  

Let me know if you have questions.

Gale, here is the information that I have available about the subject interconnect.  The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don't believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.  
 
The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below:
 << File: MN9213_daily_vol.xls >> 

   


Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral?

Subject:	Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect

Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. 

The following are the details as I understand it:
The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  

We have approximately 7 miles of 6" lateral from Transwesterns 30" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  

I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  

Flow Capacity Info for a 4" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:

Pressure               Max Flow Rate
600#                                  19,920 mscfd     
700#                                  23,540 mscfd
800#                                  27,310 mscfd
900#                                  31,200 mscfd
The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated

I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........
