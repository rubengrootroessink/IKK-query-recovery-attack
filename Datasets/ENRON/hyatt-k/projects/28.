Kirk,
This is really dangerous... having a marketing guy talk to you about engineering matters.  However, since we've recently worked with our other power plants to get them up and running, the data is still pretty fresh.  If I'm speaking out of school here, my operations and/or engineering buddies will be quick to correct me.

At the proposed take-off point to your Big Sandy Project, flowing gas on TW is in the range of 850 - 900 psig.  We provide a minimum of 800 psig to the LDC's connected with us at the California border. 

Therefore, for purposes of your take-away lateral pipeline design, I'd say that 800 psig is probably a pretty good target number.  However, I must stress that the 800 psig is a flowing gas number, and would surely be impacted by how the gas is taken.  That is to say that TW may provide the 800 psig pressure if and only if all of the downstream operators folllow their schedules for delivery.  For example, none of our new power plants can simply ramp-up without giving TW ample notice of start-up and scheduling an appropriate quantity of gas.

We can get into more detail regarding the requirements for operating the Big Sandy delivery point and scheduling gas on TW to meet the plant's requirements at a later date.  Suffice it to say that a plant the size of the Big Sandy project presents some unique operating challenges to TW.   TW has but 1.1 Bcf/d of gas flowing westward.  Directly-connected gas turbines can quickly deplete TW's linepack.  However, that being said, we will do our best to work with Big Sandy as well as our other power plant partners to try and meet the loading requirements of the facilities.

My gas control coordinator is about go on his honeymoon during the middle 2 weeks of May.  We should think about having our meeting after he returns (after May 25?) so that we have not only our engineers, but the proper operations and gas control personnel present also.  Check you calendar and let me know what dates might work for you guys.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,
As a follow-up to my phone mail message of last Friday, I wanted to
verify for Tim's work, what the expected minimum inlet pressure would be
off of your pipeline, delivered into our proposed Project line (at the
proposed interconnect).

This information plays directly into the current engineering work that
he is leading.

Per your good suggestion, I also want to schedule a meeting to be held
in the next couple of weeks, in efforts to further our Project
interconnect discussion.

Thank you.
Kirk
