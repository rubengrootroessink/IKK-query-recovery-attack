As we discussed, please pass this to Tony.  The following points included with confidentiality language should fit the bill.  Thanks.


NNG/NBPL Confidentiality Agreement and MOU

Describe project and BP pipelines (SSL, Woodriver - LaPlata).

Conversion of oil and product lines to natural gas service.

Targeting new markets - be general.

Anticipate interconnect with Midwestern PL as well as other pipelines.

Cooperate in the development of target markets, although each party is responsible for its respective pipeline.

NNG intends to purchase the BP pipelines.

A separate rate structure will be established for the purchased assets.

After conversion and service commencement, and for a period of 6 months, NNG agrees to negotiate exclusively with NBPL for the sale of NNG's pipeline system to NBPL.  Neither party is obligated to complete a transaction.
