Hi John,

We spoke earlier this morning about obtaining the value of storage assets owned by ETS/NNG.  Specifically, I would like to have information on the:

Original cost of the assets
Cost as in the rate base
Replacement cost
Current Value
Depreciation (schedule, method, etc.)
Cost Allocation
Rate Design
Age of the Asset 
Expected remaining life of the assets

and if possible the cost and revenue by location.  As far as the time frame, we would like to have the information by the end of the week, however considering your move to Three Allen Center on Friday that may not be feasible.  Instead, after initially looking into this, maybe you can give me an estimated time frame as to when you can gather this information.

I will contact Bob Chandler this afternoon and see if he can assist me in obtaining NNG financial statements and any other infomation on ETS/NNG's storage assets.

Thank you,
