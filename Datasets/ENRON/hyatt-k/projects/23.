Thanks Jeff - we would definitely like to meet with your team or
representatives on site as soon as possible.  I'd like to put you in touch
with Brett Hurlbut, our Senior Project Manager in the Four Corners.  He is
officed in Durango but lives in Farmington and could meet someone this week
with no problem.  He's already been over the pipeline route with Brett
Foutz, and of course we know the Blanco Hub area quite well.  Would someone
from your team be able to meet Brett this week in Bloomfield?  You can reach
Brett at the following:

Brett Hurlbut
Senior Project Manager
970-385-9100 ext 33
970-759-3572 (cell)
bhurlbut@trigon-sheehan.com

I've copied Brett on this message.  Brett - you can reach Jeff in Houston at
713-853-1521 or by email at jfawcet@enron.com.

Thanks everyone!

Information Request


Stu,
It was nice to meet you by telephone on Tuesday.  I don't have answers
to all your questions at this standing, but working with our Facility
Planners and Engineers, we should be able to get you the necessary
information pretty quickly.

I am the principal commercial contact for this project.  As a process
matter, Transwestern usually prefers to have the commercial
representative remain the primary point of contact for the project.
However, for matters relating to engineering and specifications of
facilities, that will be handled through our Facility Planners and
Engineers.  I don't know who will be your principal engineering contact
at this point, but we'll let you know as soon as possible.

As I mentioned over the telephone, we've done some preliminary work
relative to location of the proposed interconnect.  I'll have to check
with our San Juan team to see what was discussed.  It might be of some
value for our San Juan operations team and our engineers to meet you up
at the site location to kick this process off.  Let me know if you're
amenable to the idea, and what dates might work for you.

I look forward to working with you.

Jeff
