Kirk Ketcherside with IGI Resources, Inc. (see website for info on company http://www.igires.com/index.html) called to say that IGI was taking over the gas procurement side of the Caithness Big Sandy Project.  The project has now decided to own and separately contract for the construction of the 40 mile lateral pipeline to connect TW (and others) to the project site near Wickieup, AZ.

Kirk has requested that TW provide an estimate for the cost of the interconnect and meter station only (with appropriate control devices, flow, pressure, etc.).  When I reminded Kirk that EPNG probably delivers at a pressure 150 psig lower than TW's, he asked that we include a pressure letdown device in our estimate in order to be able to commingle with EPNG.

Eric, since we have the vast majority of this work has already been done by Earl and Ron, I told him we could probably get back to him with an estimate by early-mid next week.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
