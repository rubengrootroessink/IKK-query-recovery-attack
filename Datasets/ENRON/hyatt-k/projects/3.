Subject:	TW Expansion OH Rate

Attached are the revised economics for the TW Expansion based on the revised cost per the email and splitting the transport rate between a demand and commodity rate based on a 85% load factor.  The project of choice per todays meeting is the 150 expansion.

Thanks,
James

Subject:	TW Expansion OH Rate

Based on conversations between Earl Chanley and Jim Saunders, the Overhead rates for major projects to be applied to the TW expansion estimates are to be 2% of the capital estimate in lieu of the 11% in the current estimates or 15% in the current procedure for 2001.

This in mind, the NEW estimate totals are:

Option 1

Utilize GT Compressors iso rated at 38,000 hp to supplant the existing TW plants 1 thru 4.
Rolls Royce RB 211 or GE LM 2500

Original Cost per unit $24.9 MM including $2.1 MM for overhead allowance

New Cost per unit is $23.3 including 0.5 MM for overhead allowance

	TOTAL FOR 4 STATIONS IS 	$93.3 MM




Option 2

Utilize GT Compressors iso rated at 15,000 hp to augment the existing TW hp at stations 1 thru 4
Solar Mars T100 or GE/NP PGT 10B

Original Cost per unit  $15.2  MM including $1.27 MM for overhead allowance

New Cost per unit is $14.25 including 0.3 MM for overhead allowance

EXISTING UNIT OVERHAUL COSTS FOR EXPANSION		$2.0 MM PER STATION

EMISSIONS RETROFIT						$0.6 MM PER STATION			

	TOTAL FOR 4 STATIONS IS 	$67.4 MM



PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT AND SHOULD BE USED FOR THIS PROJECT and we will then change the FERC schedule k to be filed
