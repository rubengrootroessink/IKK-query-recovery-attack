Canadian Arctic Exploration Moves Full Steam Ahead=20
Undaunted by gyrating prices or Alaskan competition, the next big steps in =
reviving natural-gas exploration in the Canadian Arctic have begun on sched=
ule.=20
Anderson Exploration Ltd. and Akita Drilling Ltd. christened a new, purpose=
-built, C$20-million (US$13-million) northern drilling rig. At the same tim=
e, an ice-strengthened seismic survey vessel arrived at Tuktoyaktuk on the =
coast of the Beaufort Sea to work for the Calgary company, Canada's fifth-r=
anked gas producer with output in the 800-million-cubic-feet-daily range.=
=20
Both pieces of equipment will make a prompt start on a C$370-million explor=
ation campaign on 1.9 million acres (2,970 square miles) of northern resour=
ce properties held by Anderson. The ship, the GECO Snapper, was scheduled t=
o start a C$70-million (US$47-million), three-dimensional seismic survey pr=
ogram in shallow waters of the Beaufort as soon as the Inuvialuit natives o=
f the Mackenzie Delta (also known as the Eskimos of the western Arctic) wra=
pped up their annual beluga whale hunt (usually by Aug. 1). The rig will sh=
ortly be on its way from the fabrication yard that built it in Edmonton, th=
e Alberta capital and oilfield operational center also known as "gateway ci=
ty to the North," to the Delta by truck and Mackenzie River barge. It will =
start its first well for Anderson about 10 miles southeast of Tuktoyaktuk a=
s soon as the tundra freezes hard enough to support an ice road and heavy e=
quipment.=20
The new rig and associated work camp were built as high-rise units with a "=
small footprint" or to operate in confined space by Canadian industry stand=
ards. The layout, with drilling gear stacked vertically in the 175-feet-tal=
l rig and the hands living in a three-story barracks built from portable tr=
ailers, is designed to let drillers venture out into the Beaufort on ice is=
lands after the ship nails down new targets. "Nothing has changed really," =
said company founder J.C. Anderson in explaining the market outlook driving=
 commencement of one of Canada's most ambitious gas exploration campaigns e=
ver. He described the drop in gas prices into the US$3-per-MMBtu range this=
 summer from the winter peak near $10 as just confirming that the continent=
al market is in "delicate balance" and easily moved.=20
Anderson said that, put in the longer perspective a senior gas producer nee=
ds, the price movement was generated by "a little bit of an excess supply" =
largely owed to reactions to the winter spike among industrial consumers th=
at could switch fuels or suspend operations while it lasted. In the view of=
 Anderson and other top Canadian producers such as Alberta Energy Co., the =
supply-demand balance is close enough that a modest increase in gas use cou=
ld generate another spike. In the Arctic, "we're talking about not producin=
g for another five to six years," Anderson said.=20
In the meantime, "there's going to be a lot of gas burned." Even at current=
 annual consumption rates - 22-23 trillion cubic feet in the United States =
and six to eight Tcf in Canada - "seven years out we will have burned 180 T=
cf of gas or so." With reserves in the lower-48 U.S. states estimated at 16=
6 Tcf and Canada's connected inventory down to 60 Tcf, prices in high enoug=
h ranges to justify expanding the industry into the north are "almost a giv=
en," Anderson predicted. "When we started doing this everybody thought I ha=
d a size two hat and a 54-inch belt. Now everybody wants to be there."=20
He took no sides in the continuing debate over construction of an Alaska or=
 Mackenzie Valley pipeline. The market outlook indicates that both will be =
needed and the only questions center on timing, he suggested. On the Canadi=
an side, native communities in the Northwest Territories are pressing ahead=
 on coming up with a plan for participation in a Mackenzie line, including =
ownership interests as well as political and environmental support. Nellie =
Cournoyea, an Inuvialuit leader and chair of the territorial aboriginal pip=
eline working group, said the next step will be an August meeting to thrash=
 out a native proposal to put before the principal owners of established Ar=
ctic gas reserves: Imperial Oil, Gulf Canada and Shell Canada.=20
Anderson set a target time of 2005-10 for starting production when it launc=
hed its northern campaign in mid-1999, rapidly becoming the biggest single =
owner of drilling rights in the Canadian north. "We don't think that's chan=
ged," the company's founder said. "It works even if Alaska goes ahead." But=
 the transplanted Nebraskan, who arrived in Canada with the old Amoco organ=
ization in the 1960s, added "we in Canada should beat them to the punch and=
 get ours (the Mackenzie pipeline) approved first." Cournoyea acknowledged =
that there are divisions within the native community. The Inuvialuit, armed=
 with a land-claim settlement that includes ownership of mineral rights whe=
re Anderson is hunting, are already partners in the drilling, through a joi=
nt venture with Akita as the principal contractor. Among the Dene farther s=
outh, land claims remain under negotiation for some groups and they remain =
reluctant to make any commitments that might affect potential settlements. =
But any eventual deal with the gas producers on a pipeline does not have to=
 be unanimous on the native side, said Cournoyea, a former territorial prem=
ier.=20
"We're progressing very nicely," Cournoyea said. "One way or another, we'll=
 be moving ahead and working with the exploration companies."=20
