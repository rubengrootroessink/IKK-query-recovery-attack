Eric,

FYI--One of the Iowa congresswomen told us BP was out in her district buying r-o-w in her district in northeastern Iowa.  This appears to answer the question of what is going on.  What is our status of involvement in the Alaskan Gas scene?

Here is some additional information that we picked up regarding the pipeline right-of-way acquisition or discussion activities said to be going on in Iowa and it seems to fit the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group project.   This is prompting some talk by legislators to try again in the next session of the Iowa Legislature to toughen up Iowa's condemnation laws.   Should this in anyway influence what we contemplating in regard to the Iowa land restoration rules?

--It would not be an oil line
--Prudhoe Bay would be the source of supply
--It could involve a partnership of BP, Phillips and Exxon
--Its route would be to the northeast of Alliance pipeline
--It could be as large as a 50" line
--Its could be about a $10B project

This seems to fit this project:

AlasCan Group Wins Conceptual
Engineering Work for Alaska Pipeline

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2001--The North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group (NANGPG), a consortium of ExxonMobil, BP and Phillips, has awarded a conceptual engineering contract for a multi-billion dollar pipeline that will stretch from Alberta to Chicago, Illinois, to a five-company joint venture called The AlasCan Group. The group includes Kellogg Brown & Root, Colt Engineering Corporation, Natchiq, NANA/Colt Engineering, and Michael Baker Corp.

This pipeline is part of NANGPG's plan to deliver natural gas from Prudhoe Bay to the lower 48 states and is a continuation of the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Alberta. The project will consist of a large diameter pipeline with compressor stations and related facilities.

The work will be executed in Colt's offices in Calgary, Canada, with participation of specialists from the five organizations.
