Here is the presentation given to the North Slope Producer group on Feb 22 in Anchorage.  It was originally put together by the El Paso pipeline strategy group with input from us.

I have a call in to Byron Wright to briefly discuss how it will be used in the meeting Friday with Stan and John Somerhalder, et al.
As of now, I know of no significant changes that would be necessary.
