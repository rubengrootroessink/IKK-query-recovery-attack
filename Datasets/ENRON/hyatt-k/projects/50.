Eric and Kevin,

Sarabeth keeps me in the loop on various things and I thought this would be of interest to you.  FYI.

Kim,
Below is a report generated by an analyst with ENA's West Power Desk in Portland that details the new generation projects for WSCC.
I plan to use this list as a target list for service clients.  Thought you might also want a copy for reference.
