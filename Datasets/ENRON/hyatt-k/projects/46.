Kevin, per our phone conversation this morning...  this is the info I sent to Eric a couple of weeks ago.   With regards on the meter station capcity requirements as changed per any amendments to the Operating Agreements, I would sure be interested in getting a copy if you have a chane to provide one.    I would assume a 50 MW facility would require approximately 12 to 15 mmcfd.....  Depending on fuel rates.....

Eric, I'm going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. 

The following are the details as I understand it:
The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  

We have approximately 7 miles of 6" lateral from Transwesterns 30" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediatily on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  

I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  

Flow Capacity Info for a 4" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:

Pressure               Max Flow Rate
600#                                  19,920 mscfd     
700#                                  23,540 mscfd
800#                                  27,310 mscfd
900#                                  31,200 mscfd
The flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolated

I hope this answered some of your questions.  It might be a good idea to have a quick conference call with representatives from Planning, System Ops, Marketing, Engineering and Operations to discuss the details........
