LIPPMAN CONSULTING PIPELINE REPORTS


Attached for your information is a map showing all the pipelines that Lippman 
Consulting, Inc. currently publishes monthly reports. As the map shows, we 
currently track all the pipe's in the west and our intention is to expand our 
coverage east. Over the next few months we will be adding several new 
pipelines to our coverage. In addition, as our pipeline coverage expands, we 
will be able to expand our regional movement reports to new areas. We will 
keep you updated with future announcements.  

If you would like additional information or to order the report, please feel 
free to contact me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.
