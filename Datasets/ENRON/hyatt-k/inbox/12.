Kevin,

We need to start actively pinging other shippers (Duke, SW Gas, Salt River Project, Sempra) to lock down Sun Devil transport agreements.  Also, we should organize a communication plan for the San Juan producers + plant operators and organize a roll-out.  Let's form a strategy and then recruit Kim W and company to help promote.
