Kevin:

I think these are the numbers you are looking for.  If not, please let me know.  

The 2002 Plan numbers include only the first three hedges as the last hedge was not done when we completed the Plan.
We are at risk for $8Mil for the hedges done in 2002.

Kevin needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI Kevin, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.)
