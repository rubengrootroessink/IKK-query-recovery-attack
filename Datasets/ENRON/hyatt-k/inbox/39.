Kevin, this presentation has been revised (we explained to her that the
other one was too much about what they are doing and their exclusive
license, and that it needs to be more practical and topical to apply to the
audience that will be in attendance.  They have a client as well that could
participate. Please review the information and let me know what you think.  

Thanks Kevin!

Good afternoon Mike,

As discussed, below please find a revised idea of the presentation we would
like to give at the Gas Infrastructure show. We would like to do a dual
presentation where Ted Fiala, our director of new technology, presents the
starline process and then is followed by a presentation by Mike Beezak of
Philadelphia Gas Works, who has used the starline process many times. Mike's
presentation would be a high-level case study of how PGW arrived at the idea
of using the technology and how it worked out.

We are currently working out the details with Mike and will be able to
provide you with the presentation prior to the show in march to ensure it is
suitable. 

We are extremely interested in introducing this new technology to the gas
leaders that will be present at the Gas Infrastructure Conference and
sharing our utility experience.

Thank you,
