 Dear Kevin: 

Attached to this email is a current program of speakers/chairs that have agreed or have been invited to participate in the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE Conference, co-located with ELECTRIC POWER 2002.  

The invitation/confirmation letters have been issued on a case-by-case basis as Conference Management has received the information from you.  We will be sending out a formal confirmation kit to all those participating in the Natural Gas Infrastructure Conference.  The kit will be mailed during the first week of December that will include: conference call information, hotel & travel details, instructions for submitting final papers, complementary registration information, etc).  Presenters are asked to turn in an abstract for publishing on the web at www.electricpowerexpo.com <http://www.electricpowerexpo.com/>.  Abstracts are due November 30.  Presenters should email a one to three paragraph abstract to carries@tradefairgroup.com <mailto:carries@tradefairgroup.com>.    Final papers will be due January 15, 2002.  

If you have not already done so, please send a description of your session for the conference brochure.  A brief, two - three sentence description will be sufficient.  Please email the session descriptions by Tuesday, November 20.  Email carries@tradefairgroup.com <mailto:carries@tradefairgroup.com>.  

P.S. The conference brochure is scheduled to print on November 26!  If you have any new information that needs to be updated regarding your session, please notify me now, and I will make sure it gets printed correctly in the conference brochure.  Please review the attached program for the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE Conference (as indicated in the above paragraph)

We have enjoyed working with you on the NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE Conference and appreciate all of your hard work and time dedicated to making this conference a success!  We will keep in touch with you over the coming months and look forward to seeing you at the conference next March!

Take care!
