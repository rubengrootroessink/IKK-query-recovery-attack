Kevin, Here is an abstract I received for the Natural Gas Infrastructure track. Please let me know if you would like to include it in one of the sessions.  Also, let me know if the abstract does not fit, but if he is a good candidate, perhaps he could moderate a session or modify his abstract so that it will fit in the program.  
 
Thanks Kevin.
