Kevin,

Thank you for your reply. To answer, the service is designed for multiple
users over an intranet connetion. The more users, the lower the cost per
user.  If it's just for you, we can work out a price that's reasonable for
your budget.

Let's discuss this. My phone number is 713 349 8281. Please call or reply by
email to set up a conference call. Thank you.

Regards
Will Thurmond
