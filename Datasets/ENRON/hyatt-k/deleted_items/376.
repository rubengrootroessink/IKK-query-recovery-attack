I found these numbers in a file, Loc Code 14039, 14225, 24008

I'm not sure what assets they are in reference to.

FYI.

As I indicated in my phone message we are not finding these assets using the description provided. Judy Beck is or was the facilitiy
person for ETS. She is now Dynegy, therefore, we may get a referral instead of an answer.

Judy,

I need to provide a NBV for a Gomez Laterial (35miles of 20" pipe), to Kevin Hyatt. Frank says it should be in company 0060 (TW).
I ran the following locations numbers: 44*094, 44*095, 44*149 44*34037, but found nothing in co. 0060.  Can you help?

Thanks,

Mary
