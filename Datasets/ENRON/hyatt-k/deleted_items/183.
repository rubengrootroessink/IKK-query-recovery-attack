This had most of the state of Michigan laughing for 2 days and a very embarrassed female news anchor who will, in the future, likely think before she speaks. 

What happens when you predict snow but don't get any.... 

True story...we had a female news anchor who, the day after it was supposed to have snowed and didn't, turned to the weatherman and asked "So Bob, where's that 8 inches you promised me last night?" 

Not only did HE have to leave the set, but half the crew did too they were laughing so hard!
