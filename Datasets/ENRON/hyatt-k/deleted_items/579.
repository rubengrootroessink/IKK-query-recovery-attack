I likely won't have the project cost estimate until the end of June, so early to mid-July works for the market research.  Also, you can always send to me what you have by the end of June and supplement it with the data that comes in later.
thx

This is just the type of information we have been putting together for the other markets.  The hardest information to get is the information behind the utilities.  The end of June may be pushing it a little just because of the other projects we have going.  Would the middle of July work for you?  If not, we can reprioritize and put the resources on it.  Let me know.

Here is an abbreviated project scope of what I'm looking for regarding the Phoenix market.  The objective is to assemble a market-based case to justify building a new gas line from the San Juan Basin south to Phoenix.  If you have questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to call me at 713-853-5559.  Also, please reply with a projected completion date (is the end of June too soon?)

thanks for the help.
Kevin
