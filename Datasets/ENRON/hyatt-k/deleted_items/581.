With reference to our meeting that we had on Monday morning (4/2) regarding competing suppliers for capacity on the Crawford Lateral (Duke and EPFS), Planning has determined that the capacity of the Crawford lateral is 86 MMcfd with current facility configurations.  The pipeline capacity is based upon several conditions: 1) WT-1 max suction is 640 psig to allow receipts from Maljamar, Zia, and Attoka on low pressure line to MLV 109, 2) Maximum operating discharge pressure at Crawford CS discharge is 720 psig, 3) All receipts enter pipeline at end of lateral either through Crawford CS or into discharge, and 4) 720 psig max operating discharge pressure is based upon Crawford CS being online.  The maximum capacity through Crawford compressor station as limited by current staging, differential pressure, and horsepower at 720 psig discharge pressure is 60 MMcfd (typical suction pressure is about 450 psig.)

Having stated the above and regarding your request for a new EPFS interconnect, EPFS crosses the Crawford lateral near the end of the lateral.  Therefore, based on current firm obligations with Duke through Crawford CS at 20 MMcfd and actual volumes of 54 MMcfd, TW could physically take EPFS volumes of 32 MMcfd.  EPFS would need to have approximately 740 to 750 psig to get into TW line pressures anticipated near 720 psig.  Or if EPFS chooses to firm up all 50 MMcfd then Duke will be limited to 36 MMcfd physical capacity through Crawford CS.  It is a battle of firm, so however you slice it (volumes) is purely a commercial issue.  

As promised, the Level "A" cost estimate for connecting EPFS to the Crawford Lateral is $400,000.  Tax gross ups are not included.  This proposal includes the major items listed below.  The proposed facilities should be designed so that TW Gas Control has telemetry and full remote control of volumes or pressures. 
Hot tap - 8" on 16"
Orifice measurement w/EFM, SCADA and control - single 8" tube, Bristol 3330
Flow/Pressure control valving - 6" Fisher, ED body, Linear (control and monitor)
Chromatograph sampling
Surface easements
Soft Costs

As I understand, Bob is currently drafting agreements with Duke for firm capacity on the Crawford system that is pending Level B estimates for system modifications.  Current flows on the Crawford Lateral are around 54 MMcfd.  The following modifications are proposed for Duke:
Add 6 MM through Crawford Compressor for a total throughput of 60 MMcfd (no piping mods, 20 MMcfd of total is firm)
New connection is proposed for 8 MMcfd on Crawford CS discharge for total Crawford Lateral flow of 68 MMcfd
New connection is proposed at 16"-12" junction for Duke receipt of 14 MMcfd into Crawford Lateral for total Crawford Lateral flow of 82 MMcfd (this meets maximum flow conditions on Crawford Lateral due to pressure constraints to allow Duke to get in because of their available pressure at Crawford CS.)
New connection for Duke into WT-1 discharge for 63 MMcfd.  Duke to provide its own compression and utilize parallel 8" line to new connection.  
Total Duke is proposing as supply to system via Crawford - 145 MMcfd.

Facility Planning does not provide Level B estimates; we can, however, facilitate a Level B request from Engineering/Construction which will take at least 10 to 20 days at this time.  Since this is just an "interest" at this point for EPFS Management consideration, I strongly recommend that you let us provide a Level "A" cost estimate for your needs, and we can get this to you before 4/4.  But it will only be an estimate for a tap and facilities.  Without further studies that will require additional time, I assume that a 50 MMcfd rate will probably back out volumes from Duke Crawford as related in note 3 above.  

As for a May 2001 initial delivery requested, that would be highly unlikely due to the estimate/approval process and a number of purchase items on a facility this size that will have delivery expectations of at least eight weeks; for example, control valves, chromatograph, measurement device(s).

The additional 50 MM from EPFS and the Duke additions will require system modifications that may be extensive; therefore, we should all get together to get some clarifications and set objectives because one project will adversly effect the other regarding capacity constraints.  EF, 713/853-3395

Subject:	EPFS Cost Estimate

As you know, TW recently interconnected with El Paso Field Services in Eddy County, NM.  The current size of the interconnect is 40,000 MMBtu/d.  Facility Planning has already provided Marketing with a Level B cost estimate to increase the size of this meter to accommodate up to 90,000 MMBtu/d.

EPFS is now interested in a new interconnect with TW on the Crawford Lateral.  Please provide me with a cost estimate for a new receipt point meter for up to 50,000 MMBtu/d between EPFS and TW in Eddy County, NM.  EPFS's facilities cross TW's on the Crawford Lateral and would like to flow 50,000 MMBtu to TW starting in May, 2001.  I need this estimate ASAP.  When will it be possible for Facility Planning to provide me with a Level B estimate?  EPFS wants it by 4/4 to take to their management.  Thanks.
