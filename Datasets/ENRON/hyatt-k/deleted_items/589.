Hey man--
	How's it goin'?  Hope the kids and Carol are doing OK.  Mom and Marv finally sold their house here in Houston (they've been trying since early this year) and are moving back to Colorado.  I'm driving one of their trucks up from Houston on Saturday 11/10.  It will take 2 days to get there.  We'll stop in Amarillo to board the horses (they have two).  I figure we'll get to Parker, Colorado the afternoon of Sun 11/11 and unload the truck on Monday.  

If you're still looking to rack up some flight miles, would you want to meet me in Parker (just south of Denver) and fly me back to Houston.  We could have dinner and go bar hopping and you could come back and spend the night in Houston and take off Tuesday or something.

Let me know, it was just a thought.  Talk with you soon

Yattman

GO BIG RED!!!!

What a great game against OU Saturday.
