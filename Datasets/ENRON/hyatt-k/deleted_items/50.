Thank you for the instructions!  I'll be there.

I just got my TV in my office hooked up and watched the story today.  It was great!  I'll bring the tape with me.

From downtown Houston: Take Hwy 59 Southwest Frwy south to 610 loop.  Get on 610 going south, stay in right lane and exit Beechnut.  Go left under the frwy (heading east) approx. 5 blocks, school is on the right at the corner of Avenue B and Beechnut.
