Thanks Stephen, I'll give Harvey a call later this week.  I hope he can do it, I hate using all Enron guys for this thing.

Kevin,

Harvey Harmon can be reached at 713-420-7252.  I am not sure if he is
willing to speak at the LNG conference, but it is worth a shot.  As
indicated before, my schedule is such that I could not commit to a speaking
engagement.

Hope all is well,


Stephen
