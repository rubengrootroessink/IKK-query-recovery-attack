3 buddies die in a car crash, and they find themselves at an 
 orientation to enter heaven. 

 They are all asked, "When you are in your casket and friends and 
 family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say 
 about you? 

 The first guy says, "I would like to hear them say that I was a 
 great doctor of my time, and a great family man." 

 The second guy says, "I would like to hear that I was a wonderful 
 husband and school teacher who made a huge difference in our 
 children of tomorrow." 

 The last guy replies, 
 "I would like to hear them say...... LOOK!!! HE'S MOVING!!!!!"
