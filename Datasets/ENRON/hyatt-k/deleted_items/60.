Pursuant to our conversation, please review the attachment.  As I mentioned, I do Excel full-time now; I no longer practice law.  That gives me the time to work with new representatives to make sure their businesses get off to solid starts.  My office number is (713)737-3158, and my mobile is (281)989-0498.  I look forward to speaking with you soon.
