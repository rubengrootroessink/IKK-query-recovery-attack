I can't wait to see your shiner!!
 
I'm making some progress with Steve Dickerson's invoices.  I told Danny that Steve's November invoice was passed and paid but that his December invoice was outstanding.  Also, I told Danny that I'm going to make sure that Steve gets full payment for December.  I can't locate the original invoice (apparently Julie gave it to Danny and it has since disappearred).  I'm going to process the one you provided - - - I just don't know how to do the processing.  HELP!

Hey,  just got back from the doctor.  He is very pleased with the results.  I have very blury vision right now but he said it would begin to clear over the next couple of days.  Guess I can't drive today after all.  I now have 3 drops to put in the eye 4 times a day over a three week period.  There is no pain, just a bit of tenderness, redness and swelling.  Also, I have a black eye!  He wants to see me again in 2 1/2 weeks and then is ready to do the other eye.  I am going to shoot for the 14th because if gives me an extra Monday to recover and not miss work.  There is no pain, just twinges when I blink.  That will go away as I blink.  Since my eye was closed and bandaged for 24 hours, I have some to catch up on.  Anyway, just wanted to keep you informed.  See you, better than ever, on Tuesday.
 
Cheers.
