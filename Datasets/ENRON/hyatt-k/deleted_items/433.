 I am still slated to be the panel chairperson for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Committee at the Electric Power Conference in St. Louis March 19-21, 2002.  As chairperson, my conference registration is free ($525 value), I only have to pay air/hotel/meals.  

Is it still OK to attend this conference?
