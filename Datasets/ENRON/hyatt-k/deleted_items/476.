         Who Has Room For Cash?

Dear Jess,

Shopping lists, checks, credit cards, PINs, user 
names, passwords, photos of your little ones. With 
all the stuff you carry in your wallet, who's got 
room for cash? 

For a solution to the overstuffed wallet syndrome, we 
happily point you to SplashWallet Suite 2.0. This 
virtual wallet for your Palm(tm) handheld is actually 
four applications in one.  

SplashShopper keeps lists of groceries to buy, movies 
to rent, CDs to buy, books to read and more. SplashID 
keeps all your user names, passwords and other ID info 
in one secure place. SplashMoney records your checking 
and credit card transactions and tracks your account
balances. And SplashPhoto makes an excellent digital 
brag book for your wallet-size photos.

Purchase the entire SplashWallet Suite versus one app 
at a time and you'll save a bundle.
