Paul's birthday is on Saturday, March 2nd.  We will celebrate this great occasion with a surprise donut hour on tomorrow morning at 8:30a in our open area near me.

Please plan on eating a few donuts with Paul on tomorrow morning.

Remember, this is a surprise....  A card will be circulating this afternoon.
