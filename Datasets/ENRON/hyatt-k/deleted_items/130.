Lippman Consulting, Inc. is proud to announce that we will start publishing a 
quarterly production report for the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basins. The 
data contained in this report will cover the period 1990 through the third 
quarter of 2001. This report will contain the same level of detail that our 
clients have experienced from our other quarterly production reports. The 
report will analyze the historical wellhead production, well completion's and 
rig activity. The data will be presented in both test and charts and graphs. 
Historical data will be separate out by each of the three-production 
providence's and will be reported on an annual basis, a quarterly basis and 
in some cases on a monthly basis. 

The cost for the report is $300 on a quarterly subscription or the report can 
be purchased on a one-time basis for $450.  If you would like additional 
information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me by e-mail 
at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

George Lippman,
 President 
Lippman Consulting, Inc.
