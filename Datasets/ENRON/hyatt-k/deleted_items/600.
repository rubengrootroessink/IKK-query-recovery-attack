Kevin,
	We are looking for the following information on the compressor stations in Arizona and New Mexico. 
1. GPS location (latitude/longitude) or general directions
2. General Arrangement of the Site
3. On-line diagram
4. Electric utility provider and contact
5. Is Gas being burned?
6. Is the site permitted for emissions? what are the details?

Per our discussion only Kingman, Bloomfield, Gallup, and Bisti have economical access to power lines. I think you mentioned a possibility in West Texas, please include that one if it has access to power lines.

Thanks for the help!

Marc
