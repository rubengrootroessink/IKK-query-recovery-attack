I got your message from the 1400smith web site.  I'm still working (for now).  I've been in the gas pipeline group since late '99 doing marketing and now business development.  I'm the lead developer on a new gas line project going to Phoenix but it's pretty tough to develop new business when you don't have any money!

Anyway, Lou hit the panic button over Thanksgiving and got herself 2 part-time jobs (every little bit helps).  Everyone is doing fine otherwise.  

Hope you, Dorothy, and the kids are all fine.  Write when you get a chance.

Warmest Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

P.S.  I just had the FBI in my office asking questions and looking for "documents".  This is so much fun :-(
