just $449 plus tax, you can stay in touch, 24/7, with your work 
needs. As a valued Palm(tm) user, you'll get FREE overnight

So let's get down to the nuts and bolts of this new handsome, 
super-light handheld. Constantly monitoring the wireless network
to download your messages is just one way your new friend keeps 
you in touch with your world. Here are a few more:
 
* Stay connected with secure instant access to business email 
  (from Microsoft Outlook on your computer desktop), and personal
  email such as Earthlink, Mindspring, AOL(r), and Compuserve. 
* With just a few taps, access your favorite web content using 
  Web Clipping Applications and the MyPalm portal. 
* Spur of the moment communication with AOL Instant Messenger(sm)
  service - even if you do not subscribe to AOL. 
* Inexpensive, unlimited-usage wireless pricing with Palm.Net(tm)
  service that won't empty your wallet. 
* Customizable message notification feature (it buzzes, vibrates,
  flashes, beeps...) 
   
All this means you'll be the first to be completely connected-
sending and receiving secure email, AOL Instant Messages and 
getting one-button Internet access.** But the most interesting 
feature of the new "always on" Palm(tm) i705 handheld is how it 
automatically downloads your email and AIM messages as they 
arrive, and lets you know when you've been contacted. Just push 
the dedicated Email button and your email is already there!** 

              ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

And along with all the great Palm(tm) organization features 
you're used to, the new Palm(tm) i705 handheld has a bunch of 
other ones that make life on the go even easier: 

* The rechargeable lithium polymer battery lasts a full week 
  with normal use before it needs recharging. 
* Ready to operate out-of-the-box means no need for 
  complicated hardware modems, plug-ins or extra add-ons. 
* The SD/MMC expansion card slot lets you add memory, 
  applications, games and even content like your favorite book. 
* Over $100 of free software lets you view and edit Microsoft 
  Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, view photographs and 
  even play video clips.
