>Annual Nymphomaniac Convention...
>
>A man boarded an airplane and took his seat. As he settled in, he
>glanced  up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane. He
>soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat. Lo and behold,
>she took the seat right beside his.
>
>Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, "Business trip or
>vacation?"
>
>She turned, smiled and said, "Business. I'm going to the Annual
>Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."
>
>He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen
>sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!
>
>Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly
>asked, "What's your  business  role at this convention?"
>
>"Lecturer," she responded. "I use my experience to debunk some of the
>popular myths about sexuality."
>
>"Really," he smiled. "What myths are those?"
>
>"Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men
>are the most well endowed when, in fact, it's the Native American Indian
>who
>is most likely to possess that trait. Another popular myth is that the
>French men are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish
>descent.
>We have found that the best potential lovers in all categories is the
>Southern Redneck."
>
>Suddenly the woman became uncomfortable and blushed.
>"I'm sorry," she said. "I really shouldn't be discussing this with you;
>I don't even know your  name."
>
>"Tonto", the man said. "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba".
