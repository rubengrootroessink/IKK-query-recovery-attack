          Hologram Doubles Your Protection

Dear Jess,

Your Palm(tm) handheld, quite smartly, lets you to 
share your data when, where and with whomever you wish. 
So doesn't it drive you crazy when a perfect stranger 
insists on staring over your shoulder to read your 
private information?  

Rest assured. With ttools' new SOLOvision(tm) 
holographic Security Screen, onlookers will get no 
further than the hologram.  

SOLOvision adds two measures of protection, one for your 
data; the other for your handheld screen. The thin film 
is imprinted with a clever holographic pattern that 
prevents prying eyes from discerning your data while you 
work. It fits neatly on your handheld screen and features 
the Holox(tm) lock and chain pattern. SOLOvision also acts 
as a protective layer to prevent any nicks and scratches 
from damaging your screen.  

SOLOvision comes in handy packs of four.
