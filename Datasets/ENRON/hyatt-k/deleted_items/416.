              You Can Take It With You 

Dear Jess,

You can take it with you...your office files that is.  

Quickoffice puts Microsoft Word and Excel files 
on your Palm(tm) handheld for on-the-go, 
at-your-fingertips access to your Word documents 
and Excel spreadsheets. Discover the wonders of 
Quickword, with its built-in Spellcheck and Thesaurus 
for fast, quality document creation and editing.  

Then work up the numbers in Quicksheet and then turn 
them into a chart using Quickchart. With all these 
great features, small wonder Quickoffice won Best 
Office Suite in Handheld Computing Magazine's Best 
Product 2001 awards.      

Cutting Edge has a special Quickoffice offer for 
Palm's InSync Online members.
