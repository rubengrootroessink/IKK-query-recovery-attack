Morris, I was talking to Cindy Stark earlier today about the cost of doing =
research and how it will impact our cost centers.  She suggested that I tou=
ch base with you so you are aware we are attempting to retain our access to=
 RDI and to Lexis-Nexis and make sure we are getting the best cost structur=
e possible.  Kevin Hyatt was contacted by Paula Corey earlier about RDI and=
 when I tried to get to my Lexis-Nexis this morning, I was blocked out.  I =
am waiting to hear from Paula on that issue to see what the cost of adding =
me back in will be.  Would you prefer we handle this differently?  I just w=
ant to make sure we are getting as much for our $$ as we possibly can.  We =
are planning to get just one license to share among our group.

Thank you for any input. =20
