The attached documenst constitute the commercial proposal that the ANGTS consortium will present to ANS producers on Tuesday.  This is the product of many hours of discussion and review inside the ANGTS consortium and is highly confidential.  I thought you might find it a useful template for describing Sun Devil.  It would be particularly helpful to pull together a similar presentation for key Sun Devil shippers (APS, Panda, etc.).
