See, all along it's been the women who were trying to get the men drunk...  I 
knew I had the wrong approach; I was always trying to get the women drunk.  
So now you're telling me if I had just sat back and let the women come to me, 
they would actually bring me beer?  What a revelation!  Gosh, if I had only 
known that in college... could of saved a lot of money...

We obviously have too much time on our hands.  Who's ready for another happy 
hour gathering of ex-account managers???  Let me know.
