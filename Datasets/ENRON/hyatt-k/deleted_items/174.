Dear Jess,

Now we can tell you what you've been waiting to hear. 
It's handsome. It's wireless. It's lightweight. And 
when it arrives - soon - the newest Palm(tm) handheld 
will give you some very impressive professional 
communication features. So when you're out of the 
office, you'll stay connected. 

As a valued Palm(tm) handheld user, you can stake your
claim now through the Palm Store. Of course no payment 
is required until you purchase. But supplies are limited 
and it's first come, first served so be sure to click 
below and we'll set one aside for you. You can have it 
in your hands 24 hours after the launch. So stay tuned!
