RE: ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN SUPPLY MOVEMENT


Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has completed the 
Annual North American Supply Movement report. This reports shows 
schematically the annual average supply movements between regions for 2000 
and 2001. The report also shows schematically the net change in volumes 
transported between the regions during the past two years. LCI has divided 
North American into 16 regional separate regions including Canada and Mexico. 
At this time we have complete data on over half of the regions.    

The cost for this report is $250. If you would like additional information or 
to order the report, please feel free to contact me by e-mail at
