Subject:	another new western gas storage project

Aquila informed us they are about to announce an open season in the next day or so with their partner Southwest Gas on a new storage project near Vegas.  They propose to have 12 Bcf total, 6 B in first phase.  Location is in the same salt formation as Desert Crossing.  They do not have a pipeline attached and look to be hooked into TW and El Paso's north system.  

I am supposed to talk with their development person on thurs about a pipe option.
