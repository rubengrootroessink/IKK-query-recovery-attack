It can buy a House...............But not a Home 

It can buy a Bed..................But not Sleep 

It can buy a Clock................But not Time 

It can buy you a Book..........But not knowledge 

It can buy you a Position......But not Respect 

It can buy you Medicine.......But not Health 

It can buy you Blood............But not Life 

It can buy you Sex..............But not Love 

So you see money isn't everything. 

And it often causes pain and suffering. 

I tell you all this because........... 

I am your Friend, and as your Friend I want to take away your pain
and  suffering.............. 

So send me all your money.......... 

And I will suffer for you. 

CASH ONLY PLEASE 

Thought this was gonna be one of those "inspirational" ones, didn't 
you????
