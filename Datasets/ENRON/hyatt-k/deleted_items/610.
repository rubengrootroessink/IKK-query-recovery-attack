Russ--
           Attached for your review is the confidential proposed Term Sheet
for Transwestern's Sun Devil Project.  As we discussed, it includes a
20% swing capability for Duke within a 24 hour period plus delivery
capability to Cal Border.

After you've had a chance to review, please call me and we can address
any questions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you later
this week.

Hope you are enjoying the snow!!!

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt
