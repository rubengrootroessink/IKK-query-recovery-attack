John I have a quote from Randy on looking at our Atoka system in Artesia, New Mexico. At this time we'removng 160 mmbtu but I believe there's an opportunity to do better. What will it take to get Randy's group to take a look at this system for us? I appreciate your and Gary's help. Agave energy has the gas if we can figure out how to move more on our system.
Thanks
Rich

Rich,

Attached is a quotation to conduct an equipment enhancement analysis for
four facilities in the Atoka System.  As you will note, the available dates
are pretty slim.  As such, please let me know as soon as you can confirm a
date.

I have also sent a hard copy of this document for your records.

Thanks.
