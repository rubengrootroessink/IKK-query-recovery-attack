Bob- see if you can make sense of this. We will put a hard copy in the
mail.

The white lines are your Atoka lateral.
We have 20-25 MMcfd available at 1000# where the purple line from Logan
Draw Booster crosses your Atoka lines. (I think Atoka #1 is about 1 mile
east of this crossover, please verify).

We have 20-25 MMcfd available at 1000# at our Pecos Booster also available.
