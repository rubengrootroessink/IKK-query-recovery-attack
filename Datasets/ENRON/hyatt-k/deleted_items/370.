>>BIG 5 Joke 
>> 
>>It was the first day of school and a new student named 
>>Suzuki, the son of a Japanese businessman, entered the 
>>fourth grade. 
>> 
>>The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history. 
>>Who said "Give me Liberty, or give me Death?" She saw a sea of 
>>blank faces, except for Suzuki, "Patrick Henry, 1775." He said. 
>> 
>>"Very good! Who said 'Government of the people, by the 
>>people, for the people, shall not perish from the 
>>earth'?" Again, no response except from Suzuki: 
>>"Abraham Lincoln, 1863.", said Suzuki 
>> 
>>The teacher snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed. 
>>Suzuki, who is new to our country, knows moreabout its history than 
>>you do.She heard a loud whisper: "Screw the Japs 
>> 
>>"Who said that?" she demanded 
>> 
>>Suzuki put his hand up. "Lee Iacocca, 1982 
>> 
>>At that point, a student in the back said, "I'm gonna 
>>puke." The teacher glares and asks "All right! Now, who said that?" 
>> 
>>Again, Suzuki says, "George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 
>>1991." 
>> 
>>Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!" 
>> 
>>Suzuki jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the 
>>teacher, "Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!" 
>> 
>>Now with almost a mob hysteria someone said, "You little shit. If 
>>you say anything else, I'll kill you." 
>> 
>>Suzuki frantically yells at the top of his voice, "Gary Condit to 
>>Chandra Levy 2001." 
>> 
>>The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around 
>>the teacher on the floor, someone said, "Oh shit, we're in BIG 
>>trouble!" and Suzuki said, "Arthur Andersen, 2001."
