Subject:	Recommended flow for drag reducer application

Below are two scenarios for gas flow of 7 mph (10.267 fps) for the drag reducer application.  Because of the numerous elevation changes, it will be very difficult to maintain a consistent speed.  The speed has been calculated for each line segment between valves.

If it is necessary for every segment of the line to have a gas velocity less than 7 mph, then the flow should be 334 mmscfd.  Otherwise, we may be able to flow around 345 mmscfd.

Assumptions: The application will be done in February.  These models were run under historical February conditions for ground temperature and gas temperature.  Bloomfield after cooler temperature was assumed to be 85F.  Bloomfield discharge is assumed to be 1100 psig.   

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.
Thanks,
Ken
