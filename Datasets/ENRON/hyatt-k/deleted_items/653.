READ IMMEDIATELY AND PASS ON TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW

Someone is sending out a very cute screensaver of the Budweiser Frogs.

If you download it, you will lose everything! Your hard drive will crash
and someone from the Internet will get your screen name and password! DO
NOT DOWNLOAD IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!
It just went into circulation yesterday. Please distribute this
message. This is a new, very malicious virus and not many people know about
it. This information was announced yesterday morning from Microsoft.
Please share it with everyone that might access the Internet. Once again,
Pass This Along To EVERYONE in your address book so that this
may be stopped. AOL has said that this is a very dangerous virus and that
there is NO remedy for it at this time.

This is VERY important. If you receive a screen saver from a friend or
anyone you may not know with the Budweiser Frogs in it, DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT
OR OPEN THE FILE! Press the forward button on your email program and send
this notice to EVERYONE you know. Let's keep our email safe for everyone.

This is a service to all of our affiliates to help them keep their email
and computer files safe.
