Here is an abbreviated project scope of what I'm looking for regarding the Phoenix market.  The objective is to assemble a market-based case to justify building a new gas line from the San Juan Basin south to Phoenix.  If you have questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to call me at 713-853-5559.  Also, please reply with a projected completion date (is the end of June too soon?)

thanks for the help.
Kevin

Pipeline maps:
	1. Interstate lines serving SW quadrant of U.S. 
	2. Gas lines serving Phoenix (60 mi. radius) and any capacity info
	3. Overlay of 115kv and above electric transmission lines (statewide)
	4. Utility service territories (APS, Salt River, Citizens, others?)

Market Facts:
	1. Phoenix market facts, population, historical growth rates, per capita income, etc.
	2. natural gas and power rate case decisions at state level
	3. Public Service Commission gas & electric utility statistics
	4. List of industrial gas users, location, annual or daily consumption, etc.
	5. List of power plants, location, capacity, etc. (currently operating, those that are proposed, approved, or under construction)

Index of Customers:
	1. Gas pipeline (and LDC's if available) customers and available volume and contract expiration information

Miscellaneous:
	1. Any available gas storage in the state of AZ
	2. 10 years of monthly gas prices based on a local index compared to Nymex compared to San Juan Basin   
	3. Any other info you think may be relevant
	4. Any LDC tariff schedules that penalize customers trying to bypass the LDC
	5. Anything else you can think of that helps or hurts our case
