Dear Friend, 

I love being home for the holidays. But this year, I?ll be traveling. The whole travel industry is offering great deals ? cheap airfare, cut-rate cruises, discounted hotels, and bargain basement car rentals. President Bush said, "Fly and enjoy America's great destination spots," and that?s just what I?m going to do. 

Thinking about refinancing? Check your Credit Score and approach lenders with confidence!

Friday after Thanksgiving just might be the busiest day for plumbers. Garbage disposals in particular, succumb to a holiday carnage of turkey bones and silverware. A shortage of trained help may have you thankful for a plumber.

ASK THE EXPERT 

Q: We love to tailgate at football games but we don't want to buy special equipment just for a few outings. Anything we can use at home and away? ? P.A.W. Jersey City, NJ 

A: Guess the gas powered Daiquiri blender and the jet-powered beer cooler aren't what you had in mind. Now there's a whole range of products that are convenient and safe to use both at home and at your next tailgater.

I recently went to my first tailgate party. WOW! It was a cross between a food festival and a gadget guru convention. Everybody had the "best" way to prepare something with perfect implements for the task ? be it a blow torch or converted weed whacker. See our expert advice for a more sane approach to tailgating.
