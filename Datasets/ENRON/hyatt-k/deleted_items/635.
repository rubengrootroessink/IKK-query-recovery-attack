The following item has been added to this week's Corporate Change Control....

Nov. 16		
From 9:45 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., the Messaging team will relocate EI-Notes Server EITXHOU1NML01 to Admore.  This change will cause a total disruption of Notes for users assigned to that server.  There may be impact to a few ETS users who may still reside on that server.
