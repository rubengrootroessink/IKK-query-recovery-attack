Kevin,
Sorry to be a pest about this but my wife is being insistent that we are off base on the sizes.
My adopted child is 4 years old and she is listing sizes of 7 shirt/8 pants and 12 shoes.
My wife says that she buys clothes for our nieces:  one of which is six years old and wears
a size 7 and shoe size 2.
Our adopted child is two years younger and asking for the same size in clothes and asking for shoe size 12?

I don't want to be a pest but my wife is concerned on the sizes and we don't want to goof up when we give the clothes to Rocio.
Is there a way to see what other 4 year olds are asking for in sizes?
