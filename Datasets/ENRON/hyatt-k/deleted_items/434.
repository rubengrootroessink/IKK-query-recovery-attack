February 28, 2002

Dear Jess,

The scent of cherry blossoms, a warm breeze, the 
crack of the bat against the ball. Ah...spring, 
so near, yet so far. 

No need to wait to celebrate the rites of spring. 
The new Palm i705 handheld is ready for a stroll now. 
With its hip ergonomic design and wireless email and 
web capabilities, the two of you will be inseparable. 

Purchase the i705 by itself, or as a Palm Store 
Special Deal. The Mobile Bundle will quickly become 
your don't-leave-home-without-it companion. 

Then find a nice bench in the shade and tap open 
"Murder in Havana." Politics, money, power and 
romance intersect in this latest eBook spy novel 
from Margaret Truman. 

See you in March!
