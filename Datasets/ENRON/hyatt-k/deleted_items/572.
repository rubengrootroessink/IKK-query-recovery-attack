Hows its hangin'????????
Jay will be 16 next week and he can't wait to drive that car, he has been 
working really hard so he can drive it.  My Mother bought him a new stereo 
for his birthday and he had it installed last night.  He is soooo excited, 
I wish I could get that worked up over a stereo!  Must be a guy thing!
I am thinking about all my buddies at Enron, I know it must be tough!
Take care,
