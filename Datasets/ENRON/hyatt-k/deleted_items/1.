   Call in Your Email Messages, To-Do's and More

Dear Jess,

Finally, the signed contract is in your hot little 
hand. Now for the real work--starting with half a 
dozen emails and a mental to-do list as long as your 
arm.

Of course none of it will wait until you get back to 
the office...

Say hello to Copytalk! Just call the toll-free Copytalk 
number from any phone to dictate email messages, to-do's, 
appointments, contacts, and expense items. It's like 
leaving a voicemail for a trusted assistant to handle. 
Except it's a lot less expensive...

With Copytalk, email messages arrive in the recipient's 
inbox as if sent from your desktop. Items appear in the 
appropriate application on your Palm(tm) IIIx handheld. 
Just hit the HotSync(r) button, or connect via wireless 
modem.

You don't need special instructions to use Copytalk. Or 
to train it to recognize your voice. Copytalk's human 
editors proof every item you call in.

To get one FREE month of Copytalk and your special Palm 
customer rate, go to:
