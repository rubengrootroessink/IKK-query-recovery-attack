Eric - Please provide me with a cost estimate to increase the meter facilities from 40,000 MMBtu/d to 60,000 MMBtu/d at the new receipt point with El Paso Field Services in Eddy County, NM.  I would like a "good to go with" cost estimate so that I may request full reimbursement from EPFS.  EPFS has indicated they will be in a position to send this incremental gas to TW in a couple of months.  Please let me know the estimated time you need to develop this cost estimate.  Thanks.

Lorraine
