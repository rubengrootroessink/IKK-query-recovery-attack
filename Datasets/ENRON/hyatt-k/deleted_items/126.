Biz School Blindness
Sank Enron=20


By JOHN LEBOUTILLIER=20

 arvard Business School: It's called the West Point of capitalism. In fact,=
 the school's bottom-line-only philosophy has had a poisonous effect on Ame=
rican business practices. The Enron disaster is the most recent - and spect=
acular - manifestation.

To illustrate my point, let me take you back to a classroom at the school i=
n the late winter of 1978. The course was productions and operation managem=
ent, taught by Chip Bupp, a thoughtful and serious man.

On this particular day, the case study involved a company that manufactured=
 a product that might be harmful, even fatal, to the consumer. The question=
 was, what should you do, if you were the company's CEO, in such an ambiguo=
us but potentially dangerous situation?

Several students offered suggestions, none of which galvanized the class. T=
hen a hand shot up, and Bupp said, "Jeff, what would you do?"

Jeff, with his thinning blond hair, wire-rim spectacles and slight Southern=
 drawl, was one of the brightest members of the class and a natural leader.=
 When he talked, as the commercial used to say, everyone listened.

"I'd keep making and selling the product," Jeff said. "My job as a business=
man is to be a profit center and to maximize return to the shareholders. It=
's the government's job to step in if a product is dangerous." Several head=
s nodded.

Neither Jeff nor those who agreed with him seemed to care about the potenti=
al effects of their cavalier attitude. What if the product really did harm =
consumers? How about the company's employees? Were they in danger during th=
e manufacture of the product? What would happen to the company if the CEO's=
 decision was wrong?

Few in the classroom that day dared to raise these questions. At Harvard Bu=
siness School - and business schools nationwide - you're considered soft, a=
 wuss, if you dwell on morality or scruples.

As the years went by, Jeff had a meteoric career. He became a partner in th=
e McKinsey consulting firm. From there he joined Enron and was soon promote=
d to president and chief executive officer.

Jeff is Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned under unexplained circumstances in A=
ugust after only six months on the job.

In two stock sales before and after his departure, he cashed out $30.6 mill=
ion worth of Enron stock.

Skilling and other senior managers encouraged employees to buy and keep Enr=
on stock, even when things started to sour, while they were hurriedly selli=
ng huge blocks of their own stock. And now Enron has collapsed, "the larges=
t bankruptcy case in American history," according to Sen. John McCain (R-Ar=
iz.).

One analyst told CNBC, "It's the biggest insider trading scandal ever." Ano=
ther observer said, "Enron was run to benefit the top executives. They lite=
rally looted the company."

Yet Skilling proclaims total ignorance of any problems. "I had no idea the =
company was in anything but excellent shape," he has said.

Articles about Skilling written since the demise of his company cite his ar=
rogance and cold-heartedness. But as I witnessed sitting in that Harvard Bu=
siness School classroom nearly 24 years ago, the seeds of his destruction g=
rew out of a gross misunderstanding about the role of a business leader in =
our society. In his view, it is to be "a profit center" and to "maximize re=
turn for the shareholder," no matter the peril to consumers or employees.

Harvard and other business schools must pay more than lip service to the gr=
oss ethical blind spots that the Enron case has exposed. Starting with an a=
dmissions policy that selects potential students for ethics and character a=
s well as brains, these institutions need to return to the goal of teaching=
 their students to be good citizens first and moneymakers second.

America can't afford many more Enrons - or Jeffrey Skilling-like CEOs.

LeBoutillier graduated from Harvard Business School in 1979.
