As I indicated in my phone message we are not finding these assets using the description provided. Judy Beck is or was the facilitiy

Judy,

I need to provide a NBV for a Gomez Laterial (35miles of 20" pipe), to Kevin Hyatt. Frank says it should be in company 0060 (TW).
I ran the following locations numbers: 44*094, 44*095, 44*149 44*34037, but found nothing in co. 0060.  Can you help?

Thanks,

Mary
