Unfortunately, this is too far in the other direction! The earnings page has no formulas at all.  Maybe we should go back to the bigger model if you think it is one that they can work with.

 Attached is a summary model for TW's Sun Devil project.  The original model is very large; this summary version is smaller but doesn't have the links and supporting pages.  Please feel free to call me with any quesions.
