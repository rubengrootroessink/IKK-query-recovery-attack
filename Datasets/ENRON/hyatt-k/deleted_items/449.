             Palm's Software Connections!

Dear Jess,

Welcome to our second, fun-filled issue--with a 
couple of business-oriented apps to keep you on your 
toes.  

Oh, the games people play on their Palms...

Bejeweled is a real gem among the fun, fast-paced and 
otherwise totally addicting.  And Scrabble loyalists 
gather round!  Handmark has just the thing for a 
rainy afternoon, or a few minutes in between client 
calls.  If you want more fun for your buck, check out 
PopCap Games Pack by Astraware.  

Eventually you will have to get back to work.  When 
you do, tap open Documents to Go Professional to edit 
Word, PowerPoint, Excel on your handheld.  Too many 
to-dos to keep track of?  Tell BugMe! to bug you.  

If you don't see anything below that grabs you, click 
on through to the Palm Software Connection at: 
http://insync-online.p04.com/u.d?ikfxL-X5ecK5TY=320  

It's packed with new titles that are super easy to 
find. Check out our user reviews while you're at it.    

See you next time!

Travelers, put down your troubles. Worldmate is here 
to serve.  Whether you're on business or pleasure, 
going to one city or around the world, WorldMate will
