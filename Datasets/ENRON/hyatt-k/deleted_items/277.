A father asks his 10-year-old son if he knows about the birds and the
Bees. "I don't want to know!" the child says, bursting into tears.

"Promise me you won't tell me!"

Confused, the father asks what's wrong.

"Oh, dad," the boy sobs. "When I was six, I got the 'There's no
Santa speech.' At seven, I got the 'There's no Easter Bunny'
speech. When I was eight, you hit me with the 'There's no tooth
Fairy' speech. If you're going to tell me that grownups don't really
get laid, I'll have nothing left to live for."
