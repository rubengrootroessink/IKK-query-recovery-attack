I'm betting we'll meet in Dallas.  What a battle that will be.  Did you see a replay of the football spike by D Groce on Rocky Calmus's head?  If you watch the replay, you can see why.  Rocky had DeJuan's ankle under his armpit and then Rocky rolled over after they were both lying on the ground (can you say Dirty)?  The OU quarterbacks took a beating too!  That game would have been a little different had White (or was it Hybl) caught that sneak pass in the flat, but he slipped up instead.  I'm sure glad we got to play OU at home!!
 
Enron will be Enron.  Problem with a takeover is I'm not sure anyone has the financial expertise to figure out the books.  
 
take care

Kevin: 
We had fun in Lincoln. All the Nebraska people were very nice to us before and after the game. I am glad that this rivalry still has respect whereas we absolutely hate Texas! 
I hope things settle down at Enron and I hate hearing some of the news. Email when you can. 
Congrats on the win. Maybe we will meet in Dallas
