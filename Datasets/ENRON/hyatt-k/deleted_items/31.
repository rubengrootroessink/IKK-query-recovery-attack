I can handle items 1, 4 and 9.  Let me know if there is anything else.

Kevin + Kevin,

Here's my thoughts on an agenda for the upcoming meeting with APS on 10 Jan-

- Update on Enron bankruptcy
- Update on Pinnacle West power projects
- Sun Devil project review
-- Sources of equity funds
-- Regulatory strategy
-- Project scope
-- APS r-o-w contribution
- TW discussion
--Financial condition
--2002 business plan
- Sun Devil revised term sheet

Should we invite Bob Hill to join us?  His participation enhances our credibility assuming that we don't rely on TW cash to fund equity requirements.
