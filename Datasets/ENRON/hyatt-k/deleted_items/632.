Letter from the Editor:

Need to find out when the next showing of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone" is? Or whether you should pick up the new
Michael Jackson album?

Visit our newly redesigned online area for Arts and Entertainment.

You'll find expanded coverage of:

**Movies -- Read reviews of current releases and watch trailers, then find
showtimes for your local theater. Audio clips from
Chronicle interviews with actors and directors also can be found here.
<p>

**Harry Potter -- Pottermania has its own page, complete with dozens of
additional stories, a photo gallery filled with stills from
the movie and an interactive quiz. You also can find out how to get your
review of the movie posted online.
<p>

**Music -- Ever read an album review and wish you could hear what the
critic was writing about? The music area features clips from
recently reviewed albums so you can listen while you read. Also, get the
latest concert reviews, music news and interviews with
bands coming to Houston.
<p>

**Entertainment news -- It's not as important as the war in Afghanistan,
but some of us enjoy silly celebrity quotes with our
morning coffee. Like this one from Gwyneth Paltrow: "I once fell in love
with someone who was not, you know, leading man-type of guy
who was overweight and had sort of messed-up teeth." Get fascinating
tidbits like that, plus breaking entertainment news and a daily
entertainment poll in our Headlines area.
<p>

Once you've checked out the Entertainment, let us know what you think. Send
comments to the online
entertainment editor -- pamela.mitchell@chron.com 
<p>  

Thanks for visiting, and please follow along as we try to bring a little
entertainment to the news.

**Thanksgiving Day Parade

Not all of the information on the Web site comes from news reporters and
photographers. Some of it is in the form of advertising, and marketing and
promotion efforts.

Sometimes, it takes the best efforts of evrybody to bring you the full
story.

Chronicle reporter Bruce Westbrook provides the news that Santa Claus is
coming to town next week at the end of the 52nd annual annual Thanksgiving
Day Parade through downtown starting at 9 a.m. Thursday.

Because of the construction downtown, this year's parade will be following
Milam south rather than Main Street; so we've posted a map in the Preview
area of Entertainment to help the 400,000 folks expected to see the parade
in person find their way to the new route.

Parade sponsor Washington Mutual is providing a limited number of $20
reserved bleacher seats near Smith at Capitol, and the Marketing Department
has joined with them to create a special official parade Web site where
tickets can be purchased.

First the parade, then the turkey dinner.

Watch how the turkey trots at:

*What's New at HoustonChronicle.com

**Winter Olympic Games

Hard to imagine from the weather we've been having in Houston the past few
days, but the winter sports season is starting in much of the country. 

The centerpiece of this year's winter sports season is going to be the
Olympic Games in Salt Lake City early next year. 

The world will be turning its attention toward Utah, and so will we. Well,
actually, we've already started getting ready, and there's a special
Olympics section already set up in the Sports area of the Web site. 

And the newspaper will be providing weekly coverage of the Olympics
preparations -- increasing in frequency as the games come closer.

So, let it snow; let it snow ...

Check on the rest of the winter sports at:

**Archives Access for Non-Subscribers

For a couple of year now, the online archives of the Houston Chronicle and
the Houston Post have been open to Houston Chronicle subscribers. Those of
the Post are offline for some review right now. And HoustonChronicle.com
has partnered with Qpass to provide an easy and safe way for
non-subscribers to purchase access to archival material online.

Three kinds of passes allow non-subscribers to search the archives. One is
for 30 days, another for seven days, and a third lasts for 24 hours.  To
buy a pass and start a search, simply go to

http://www.HoustonChronicle.com/archives

That site also includes answers to any questions you might have about
this new service.

Please note that the Houston Chronicle archives includes only text of
news articles appearing in the Chronicle starting in 1985. It does not
include photographs, classified ads or paid death notices. As part of the
SubscribersADVANTAGE program, the archives remain free to Houston Chronicle
subscribers.
