Kevin,

Thanks for the clarification.  Can you tell me if the following assumptions are correct for your pricing?

1.	Minimum volume transported is 0, maximum is 200,000/day
2.	365 days / year for 2 years

Thanks for your help.

John

John, I had NNG price out volume of 200,000/day for a two year term.  Let me know if you need further info.

Kevin,

I work with Ned Higgins in Enron Compression Services.  He informed me of some transportation quotes that you had given to him for FT from Mid 4 to Mid 3, as well as IT to El Paso Waha.  Can you please tell me if there are any minimum or maximum volumetric requirements under these prices, and the term that your pricing applies to?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks in advance for your help.
