Kevin,

I've organized a meeting tomorrow with Rob K, Teb L, and Blair L to explore the feasibility of publishing a separate fuel retention factor.  Several pieces of info I need in preparation for this meeting- 

Actual fuel consumption on TW for the last several years
Method of calculating TW's fuel retention rate
Estimated fuel consumption associated with Sun Devil shippers
- SJ lateral
- ML
- Phoenix

Let's get together this afternoon and discuss.
