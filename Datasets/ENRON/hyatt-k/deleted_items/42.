Red Cedar - I am working with Operations and Facility Planning to coordinate the tie-in of the new receipt point in the La Plata Station yard.  All parties have agreed to the tie-in sometime between 4/2 - 4/5.  I will provide the required notification to NWPL once Planning notifies me of the estimated downtime and resulting cut in flows.

Expansion - Coordinating all groups to define project and begin pulling together documentation for FERC filing.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has requested a meeting with TW Operations for next week to discuss the appropriate facilities needed to meet our specifications.  I have worked with Rich Jolly and Eric Faueucheau (?) in identifying the appropriate person to attend.
