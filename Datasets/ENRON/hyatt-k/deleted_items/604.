Kevin, if you are okay with this information regarding Market Affiliate Rules, please forward to roger.tietz@enron.com with ENA who has called today and was requesting this information urgently.  Thanks - EF

With regard to your request for gas specification in our meeting on Friday, April 5, the TW tariff filed with FERC details TW's gas specification.  TW's tariff on file with FERC is available for public viewing and the "Quality" section can be seen on Sheets 52 thru 54 (http://www.ferc.fed.us/gas/gastariffs/HTMLAll/191201.HTM#Sht14303)

Attached for your reference are representative chromatograph data from TW's system (from San Juan Lateral Junction to SoCal-Needles) for January through March this year.

 


Below is an excerpt from TW's tariff that defines gas quality standard that you may be interested in.

                C.      shall contain no hydrocarbons in liquid form at the
                        temperature and pressure at which the gas is delivered into
