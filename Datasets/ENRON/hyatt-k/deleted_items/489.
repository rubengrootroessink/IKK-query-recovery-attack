Ludicrous........please read the Washington Post article below. I plan to f=
ax a letter to the editor. For all the negatives of the LJMs, Enron had man=
y successes and our reputations should not get slammed because of the actio=
ns of a handful of people!

Dennis and Kathy--
I need your help getting something to as many former Enron employees as pos=
sible.  At the bottom of my message I copied in an opinion editorial that a=
ppeared in the Washington Post on Sunday.  The author makes an  absurd clai=

llapse.

We need as many former Enron employees as possible to respond to the Michae=

Include your name, address, and phone number.  I attached the letter that M=

Wait a Minute. Didn't Enron's Employees Ride That Stock Up?=20


By Michael Lewis

Sunday, March 3, 2002; Page B02=20

BERKELEY, Calif. -- Not since the corporate victims of Sept. 11 rushed to C=
apitol Hill to demand financial reparations have there been so many expensi=
ve beggars in one place as there are now in Houston.=20

Every few days brings another story of the terrible predicament of Enron Co=
rp.'s current and former employees. Often these stories reveal a new grieva=
nce they harbor or lawsuit they have filed to recover money they believe is=
 rightfully theirs.

On Feb. 21, for instance, came word that roughly 900 Old Enronians are seek=
ing cash from a pair of Houston-based relief funds, and that former auditor=
 Arthur Andersen LLP had put together a package to compensate, among others=
, former Enron employees.

These relief funds now have hundreds of thousands of dollars, largely becau=
se politicians looking to unburden themselves of Enron's campaign contribut=
ions have come to view the bankrupt energy trader's former employees as a p=
opular cause. And Andersen seems never to have asked why it should be givin=
g money to former Enron employees rather than the other way around.=20

How come? Why are Enron's employees, who helped perpetrate one of the great=
 corporate frauds of all time, more deserving of reparations than, say, Enr=
on's creditors or, to expand the field of vision, actual poor people who ne=
ver worked at Enron?=20

One answer -- the answer generally assumed -- is that the blame for Enron's=
 collapse falls exclusively on Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, Andrew Fastow=
 and one or two other honchos. All lesser Enronians were, like mushrooms, k=
ept in the dark. Perhaps in some cases this is even true. In most cases -- =
above a very low level of employee -- it couldn't possibly be.=20

We now know, for example, that it took many hundreds of people to orchestra=
te the huge number of spectacularly bad investments made by Enron over the =
past decade. Many hundreds of people were at the same time very highly paid=
. How could it not occur to these people that there was something odd in th=
is arrangement?=20

We also know that some large number of employees answered former CEO Skilli=
ng's call to create a phony trading floor, so that analysts visiting from W=
all Street would have the impression that Enron was doing more business tha=
n it actually was.=20

Many of these people -- to judge from their newspaper quotes -- seem to fee=
l that the Potemkin village exercise is proof of corruption at the top of E=
nron, and thus of their case that they were defrauded by their evil masters=
. Actually, it shows that a lot of people should have known that something =
was wrong all along, and that the corruption, or delusion, extended down in=
to the Enron ranks.=20

We also know, from Enron vice president Sherron Watkins's now famous letter=
 to Lay, that Enron's corrupt partnerships were something of an open secret=
 within the company.=20

Indeed, everything we know so far about Enron suggests that many, many empl=
oyees were, at the very least, willing accomplices to the schemes dreamed u=
p by their bosses. And now they want their money back! They are like access=
ories to a failed bank heist who demand restitution because the police conf=
iscated their share of the take. I can think of two reasons they should be =
shamed into silence.=20

The first is the example it sets. The Enron case as it is currently playing=
 out sends the following message to corporate employees: You aren't respons=
ible for what you do. Turn a blind eye toward corporate deceit, or even par=
ticipate in the deception, and, so long as you aren't one of the top bosses=
, you will enjoy the moral status of the victim.

It's already hard to be a whistle-blower. This incentive structure makes it=
 even harder. One of the striking things about Enron is that no one came fo=
rward and blew the whistle on the company. (Watkins has been cast in the ro=
le, but all she really did is beg her boss to orchestrate an artful coverup=
 so she could continue to make lots of money.) Why will the people who work=
 at the next Enron behave any differently?

The second reason to ignore the yelps and whimpers of Old Enronians is basi=
c justice. The phony accounts Enron ginned up for many years allowed it to =
pay its employees as if they actually were conducting hugely profitable bus=
iness. Even those who were profitably engaged were probably grossly overpai=
d for their efforts. In short, they've already made out like bandits. Why g=
ive them more money?=20

I know, I know: the retirement plan! Eight hundred and fifty million dollar=
s in worker savings vanished!=20

Somehow the media reports suggest Enron forced its employees to keep their =
savings in Enron shares. In fact there was a brief period last fall, from O=
ct. 29 through Nov. 12, in which the 401(k) plan was frozen and Enron's emp=
loyees were unable to sell their shares. The stock during that span fell to=
 $9.24 a share from $13.81, a small step in the long plunge from more than =
$90 to pennies today. The only shares workers were restricted from selling =
outside that window were those pumped into the plan by the company as a mat=
ch for part of each employee's contribution. (Those shares couldn't be sold=
 until the worker turned 50.)=20

For the most part, workers held shares voluntarily and could have sold them=
, and diversified their portfolios, at any time. The reason they didn't is =
that they were greedy: They had seen Enron's stock rocket and decided the s=
mart thing to do was bet that it would keep rocketing. It's sad for them th=
at it didn't, but should the rest of us be responsible for them, any more t=
han we feel responsible for people who sunk their life savings into TheStre=
et.com Inc.?=20

Probably there are a few Old Enronians -- lowly clerks, some blue-collar ty=
pes out in the field, the mentally incompetent -- who deserve a helping han=
d. But I'll bet they aren't the ones who are now hollering for it.
