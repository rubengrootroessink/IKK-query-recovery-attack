Inspected 3 filter cases down stream of Inlet separator at the SLX plant, all 
were still clean and dry. Got a slug of liquid in the Inlet filter separator 
at the SLX about 90 gallons. Did not get any further down stream, also took 
sample of it. See attached for our sample results for this month. PG&E are 
having problems with their phone lines so Sherwood labs could not fax their 
results. Therefor I don't have their results on the spred sheet.I will send 
them out as soon as I get them. Thanks,Randy
