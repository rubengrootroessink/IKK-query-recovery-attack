Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of 
PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.  
They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E 
system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by 
them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes 
some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this 
meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about 
rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on 
the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
will be forwarded at a later date.....
