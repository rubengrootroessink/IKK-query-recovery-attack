Mike
We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will 
automatically
page me. I'll give everyone an update late tomorrow. We should have the hot 
tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be 
back on location to 
check on the unit tomorrow.
