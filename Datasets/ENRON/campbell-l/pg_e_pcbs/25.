This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with 
Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.
