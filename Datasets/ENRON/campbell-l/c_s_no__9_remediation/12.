Soil sampling for waste characterization was completed on September 6th. Bill 
Olson with the NMOCD was on-site to observe the sampling activities. 
Twenty-two soil samples were collected from the two former pit areas. Lab 
results indicate that the impacted soil samples do not trigger RCRA hazardous 
waste criteria, more specifically:
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP VOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP SVOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP Metal constituents were non-detect with only 
two exceptions. Arsenic was detected in the TCLP extract for two samples; one 
at 1.41 mg/L and another at 2.18 mg/L, both below the RCRA regulatory limit 
of 5.0 mg/L.
? for all 22 samples, the samples were determined to be "not-ignitable"
? for all 22 samples, reactive cyanide and reactive sulfide were non-detect 
with only one exception. Reactive sulfide was detected for one sample at 160 
mg/kg; this is below the guidance level of 500 mg/kg.
? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660 
mg/kg with an average TPH concentration of 2429 mg/kg.

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.
