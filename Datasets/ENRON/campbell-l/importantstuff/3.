This is Travis, Don Baughman's brother, and I want to be the first to invit=
e everyone on a 4day getaway for Don's bachelor party to Cozumel. I am tryi=
ng to get the ball rolling early on this and have already spoken to many of=
 you. Basically here's the deal, so get your calenders ready!!! His wedding=
 is on September 22, 2001 so the date we picked for the Bachelor Party is (=
Thursday) September 6 to Sunday September 9. I realize that not everyone wi=
ll be able to go so I expect that it will be about 12 of us. But come on ge=
t of your ass you probably need a vacation the more the merrier you know!!!=
  I am still trying to find the cheapest prices and b/c it is over two mont=
hs away there are no specials yet but I did find one ok price of $450 a pie=
ce, that is air and hotel with Continental and staying at the Fiesta Americ=
ana in Cozumel. Please let me know asap how many of you can go, yes even th=
ose that have previously confirmed the dates verbally with me. I want to tr=
y to! get the prices down a bit, like around $400 but we'll see. If any one=
 knows a travel agent or has some insite on Cozumel let me know. I know mos=
t of you and think it would be best if we can pick our own places to eat. I=
 think the general plan is to drink and have a great time. I would like to =
scuba one morning but also think it would be cool to rent some jeeps and dr=
ive around the island, and of course find some questionable local bars. We =
have most of Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday and will return Sunday (=
leaving about 12:00). Again please let me know asap (by Tuesday if possible=
) and I will write everyone back next week with better prices I hope.=20

 Don on September 14th. At our Parents farm in Iowa Colony (South of Housto=
n). It is going to be a casino night so bring some dinero it will start at =
7:00pm and last till......well whenever. There is plent of room here for th=
ose that may over indulge and need to stay the night. Probably will try get=
 around 40-50 people for this event. So far the games are Black Jack and Cr=
