John, Im in the office for a few hours cleaning out email and stomping out some minor fires.  The two RMEF persons we met with are Dan Walker and Allen Kerby.  Allen is the regional director for NM and TX.  Dan was the guy we picked up at the airport from Montana.  I think his title was VP of business operations?  His number is 1-800-225-5355.  Allen's number in Las Vegas NM is 505-454-9390.  Hope that all is well with you and the family.

Larry,
I need to speak to one of the key contacts that we met with in Albuquerque.  Do you have their names and phone numbers?  John
