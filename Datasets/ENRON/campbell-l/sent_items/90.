Don I am sorry about your loss, mostly because those in the family of God h=
ate to see pain hit a family member.  Even under the most dire and seemingl=
y impossible situations, God is in control.  Its His promise that He will n=
ever leave us nor forsake us.  That in itself, is a real comfort and securi=
ty knowing we have His eternal and loving spirit with us at all times.  Whe=
n you get some time, read Romans 8:28 and then meditate on it.  So many tim=
es we confuse our wants for our needs and that are promised by Him. Because=
 he desires to conform us inito the image of His Son, sometimes He has to e=
mpty us of worldly understandings and unrighteousness so that He can fill u=
s with blessings that glorify Him. Once we make a heart commitment and His =
spirit sets up residence within us, God's promise in Romans is to work ever=
ything, including a job loss to His glory.  If we are eternally minded and =
understand that our citizenship and home is in heaven, then life on earth b=
egins to look less important and we see the worldly goods as being very tem=
porary.  I will pray for you and your family that you see a manifestation o=
f God's work in your life and that you are brought even closer unto Him in =
your Christian walk.  I will keep my ears open for any employment opportuni=
ties. =20

When you're feeling down and discouraged, drop me a line.  Sharing Christ w=
ith someone always seems to help me through the day in difficult situations=
.  In Hebrews were told  to encourage the brethren.  I would consider it an=
 honor to hear form you again....keep the faith...  its all we have........=
.   =20
