Good Morning - 

Attached are two PAF for a retire and install a by pass valve on Unit #9 at Spraberry.

 << File: PAF Plug valve.xls >>  << File: PAF Plug valve ret.xls >> 

These projects are completed.  Do you mind filling out an environmental matrix for this project.  We need to send the matrix in with the completion package. We are ready to send the package to Houston.

Thanks for your help

Adel
