		Scheduling Issue:	

	1024	MIRANT(Rala) told me that they could not schedule anymore transactions with me.
		She confirmed they were defaulting on their contracts.

	1050	Informed DYPMI(Katherine) that MIRANT was defaulting on their contracts thus preventing
		me from fulfilling my obligation to DYPMI.

	1200	Russell spoke to the DYPMI trader to discuss LD protocol.



		Option Issue:

	904	MIRANT(Blake Mason) would not accept my exercising of an option.  He confirmed they 
		were defaulting on a firm LD product.

	1051	Told WESCO(Sherry) that MIRANT's defaulting prevented me from fulfilling my obligation  
		to them.

	1200	WESCO(Sherry) informed me WESCO was going to LD ENRON.
