David, I got hte same message from Don.  I found out he became a believer about a couple of months ago and I have been spending a little time sharing Christ with him.  Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal Christian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  Bill Kendrick seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.     

It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, Enron wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how Enron is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to Enron right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in Enron Houston were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to Jesus.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.  

Hope your holidays will be blessed with some of your family coming in. Do you have plans to do any downhill skiing in Quatar over Christmas....

Larry,

I'm sure things are nuts around there but when you can, let me know how you
are doing.  I heard from Don Stevens that he had been severed but that he
thought all the pipeline folks were spared.  You and your family are in our
prayers.

David
