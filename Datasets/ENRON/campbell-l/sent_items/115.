David got your voice mail last week.  Sorry about not getting to talk with you, but I am taking the month of December off so as not to give Enron my vacation.  Im not going to give it away anymore.  I would have liked to talked to you.  Things are somewhat stressful around here.  Probably worse in Houston.  Enron is screening  e mails so everyone is a little tense. Lots of things are going on with Enron trying to bail itself out of this mess.  As you may have heard, they severed about 4500 people so far, Joe Kolb and Don Stevens were among those.  Ive kept a low key on the daily news reports about what is going on, so I really dont know much.  This was a good time to take my vacation.  This whole thing doesnt seem to be bothering me, as I am relying on Jesus, my higher power and that has been my strength and comfort. Its a good feeling to know that whatever happens, my family and I will be just fine.

Hows Christmas in the desert? Were you able to find an acceptable substitute for a tree?  this was a good time for you to stretch your wings.

David, I hope you and everyone in the Ayers household has a very merry Christmas.  I think of you much and hold you in my prayers.  When we stop and reflect upon all that man has done to warp the meaning of our Savior's birth, it becomes hard to focus on the real meaing.  I pray that you are a wonderful witness to a lost and twisted people  in Katar and remember the love of Christ that was revealed to us in his cruxificion.  I am thankful for our Great High Priest who has opened up the doors of heaven for us and by His Spirit has given us the opportunity to peek through the veil and know the Holies of Holies.  May God bless each of you and continue to show you wonders of His love and grace.

Merry Christmas, Your brother in Christ
