Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting=
 activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits an=
d has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, t=
he permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this=
 e mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is comple=
te, but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prio=
r to the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on Octob=
er 15 and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  =
The ADEQ plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov=
. 19 in Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is locat=
ed approx. 30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is =
the Council Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have b=
een no responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review proc=
ess, they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for meas=
uring sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fu=
el monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced t=
hem otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur anal=
yzer for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There wa=
s also an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter =
emissions from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer f=
or the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has =
also approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  T=
here are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public c=
omment period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this dat=
e, it will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign=
 off on the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As=
 of this date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the per=
mits for station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.
