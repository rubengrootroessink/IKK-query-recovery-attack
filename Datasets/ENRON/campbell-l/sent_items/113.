Subject:	Wednesday's Conference Call

Due to uncertainty and proposed changes to the ETS safety/env conference that is to be held next spring it has been decided to pospone the conference call scheduled for Wednesday, until we are better informed as to the direction we will be required to go (i.e. there is a good chance the conference may be a shortened version held in Houston).  Until some of those decisions are made by upper management, it will be difficult to do a very good job of planning.  I will be glad to set up another conference call when conditions warrent.
