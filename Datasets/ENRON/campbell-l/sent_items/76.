Subject:	Keystone Revision

Please respond to Mr. Campbell,

Based on the recent information acquired from Solar the Keystone turbine is
not subject to GG.  Argent has revised the renewal application to change the
GOP index # to a negative applicability code.  Since the GOP was revised
last year to add the GG code, this is classified as a revision to the GOP.
The following pages were revised;
1. OP-2 form Table 1
2. OP-REQ1 form pages 9 and 12
3. OP-UA11 form
4. Process description was revised to add a paragraph explaining the reason
for the revision
5. Add Appendix G: Solar Turbine Documentation
6. Revised Table of Content to add the Appendix G
7. Revised the matrix table changing the "Notes" entry for unit 3 from
"Subject to 40 CFR 60 GG" to "40 CFR 60"

Attached are the affected files.  Th eleven renewals for your area were hand
delivered to Mr. Child yesterday (November 27).  If Mr. Child has access to
Microsoft Word and an Adobe reader version he can replace the revised pages.
You can request that Mr. Child replace the revised pages or Argent can send
him another copy of the renewal.  Please let me know your preference.
