Bill Ive got an "I pay it" notification for some Argent invoices for EOTT that keeps coming to my mailbox.  Im pretty sure that you have allready paid these.  I keep getting notifications and dont know how to notify the system that these have been taken care of.  To let you know which EOTT invoices Im speaking of, Ill forward them to your attention.
