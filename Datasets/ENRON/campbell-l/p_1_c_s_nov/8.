Larry,

The hardware that is replaced during overhauls is:
All Bearings (#1,#2,#3)
All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1 
nozzle,              #2 nozzle, #3 nozzle
All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)
All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc)

This applies to recoupes and standard engines.  The thing different on the 
recoupe is that some of the hardware for the cases is different and the 
internal blankets are replaced.

If you have any questions or if I can be of further service, please do not 
hesitate to give me a call.
