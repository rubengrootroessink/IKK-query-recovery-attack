Subject: Laguna PCB Issue

I received a call this morning from Jaroslav "Jarda" Solc (701-777-5217). 
Jarda is a Senior Research Manager for the Groundwater Resource & Remediation 
Group at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Jarda reports to 
Edward "Ed" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm 
Moreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, 
and asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC 
providing some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the 
Laguna site. 

I provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed 
alternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda 
agreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also 
indicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation 
technologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his 
organization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the 
Pueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would 
discuss this with Ed and get back to me.
