The mid-year 2000 performance review process is about to begin.  The system 
will be accessible through the intranet, which should be of great help to 
those of you on international rotations.  The PEP system will open on Monday, 
May 15, and will close on Friday, June 9.  PRC meetings will start the week 
of June 12.  The global associate & analyst PRC review meeting is tentatively 
scheduled for July 19 - more details will be announced later.

Please review the attached training guide and quick reference guide.   They 
should answer most of your questions about the process and procedures.  If 
you cannot view or print the guides, please e-mail Gwendolyn Williams and she 
will mail hard copies to you.



*If you have problems accessing the system, forget your password , or have 
any technical difficulties, please call the Performance Management Help desk 
at 713.853.4777, option 4.  
*If your supervisor information in the PEP system is incorrect, contact Terry 
Bosien in Human Resources at tbosien@enron.com, or 713.853.5230.
