Bret--the work on the old Texaco pit is finished and I am told that neither
Texaco , nor the NMOCD found evidence of migration to the Northern
compressor site. Once you have had a chance to talk to your clients,  and
the Enron consultants who witnessed the work, give me a call and lets
discuss the next step.  I am not sure the settlement agreements we drafted
are still relevant.

As you can see , I am now in our Houston office. You can now contact me at
the numbers shown below. The email address is unchanged. I will be in the
office through Thursday, and out of town the following week.

Let me know when you are ready to discuss this.
