Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which 
we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Subject: RE: Review Draft  - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report


Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott
