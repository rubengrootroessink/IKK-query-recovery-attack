Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the 
Midland Region.

A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality 
Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters 
from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the 
AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate 
the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they 
would be contacting us after they had reviewed this new data and information.
