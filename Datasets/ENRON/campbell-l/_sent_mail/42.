 Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20
status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9=
8%=20
complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the=
=20
month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20
Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you=
 a=20
good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai=
r=20
compliance. =20

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan=
ks=20
at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO=
TT=20
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20
listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank=
s=20
listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,=
=20
and 4 are abandoned in place.

=20
2. Permit issues.=20
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a=
re=20
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)=
. =20
This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS =
4.0=20
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7=
20=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t=
py=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy=
=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,=
=20
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3=
=20
tpy working loss).=20


State=20

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o=
f=20
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long=
=20
as throughputs do not significantly change. =20

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed=
=20
after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20
Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank=
s=20
store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual=
=20
VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the =
30=20
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary=
,=20
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT=
=20
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize=
d,=20
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent=
=20
than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati=
ng=20
roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20
pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and=
=20
the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20
requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20
required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20
warranted, and recordkeeping. =20

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s=
=20
identification plate or=20
strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20
search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t=
o=20
start on this.

5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.  The tabled information=20
identifies the following:

Federal
- 2 tanks (McElroy 58005, Loco Hills 4602) may not be meeting NSPS control=
=20
requirements
- 4 tanks (Maljamar 1519-1522)  may not be meeting NSPS control requirement=
s

(All are cone tanks,  subject to Ka/Kb.  Based on a capacity > 472 bbls and=
=20
product true vapor pressure > 2.18 psia, the tanks require a floating roof =
or=20
closed vent system);

- 28 tanks at 18 sites are subject to NSPS K/Ka/Kb inspection and/or=20

inspection is performed):
