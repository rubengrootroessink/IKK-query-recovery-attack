Transwestern Pipeline Company

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.
