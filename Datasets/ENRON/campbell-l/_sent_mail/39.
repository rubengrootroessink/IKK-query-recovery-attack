The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount 
levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality 
Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty 
to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
on this.
