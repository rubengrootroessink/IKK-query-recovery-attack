Subject: Additional Note


By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

Subject: ENSR Cashflow Estimate Through Construction of Project Sundevil


Lady and Gentlemen,

As the Subject line would lead you to believe, I am attaching a further
refinement of our cost estimate, spread out over the life of the project.  I
know that you, Dave, requested a breakdown by personnel and hours, but I am
going to have to go home and pack for my trip.  We certainly can break this
down by personnel and hours, but I cannot do it tonight.  I apologize for
any inconvenience this may cause any of you.  Please remember that you can
contact Jon Alstad in my absence (cc'ed).  I will be back in the office on
October 1st.  Scott
