Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be 
meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement 
or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for 
employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the 
Foundation.  

Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the 
facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification 
report submittals.

Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff 
teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of 
hazardous waste.

Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, 
for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred 
in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and 
assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was 
Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a 
larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components 
(inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically 
adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern 
received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine 
capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, 
EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding 
as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to 
review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
request another hearing.
