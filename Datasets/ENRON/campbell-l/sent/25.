Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly 
accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what 
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems 
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in 
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. 

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at 
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and 
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot 
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in 
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted 
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on 
this.  

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the 
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the 
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In 
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major 
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section 
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent 
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional 
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the 
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the 
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this 
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

Subject: The Draft of the PCB Cleanup Proposal



Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben:
 Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as
promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree
on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the
associated budget can then be developed.
 In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have
developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once
the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you
adequate time to collect and/or collate this information.
 Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we
can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally
important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster
the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you
and have a wonderful weekend.
