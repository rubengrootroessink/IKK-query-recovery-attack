As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.
