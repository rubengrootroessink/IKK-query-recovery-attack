John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

Larry,
Please also keep Jerry D. Martin in the loop on progress with the permits.=

 this is what Im trying for.=01; The permits dont hold us to a mass rate of=

emissions, just ppmvd.=01; We covered ourselves when we presented emisisons=

 I agree with your comments.=01; Can't we get a lb/hr limit (based on the=
=20
netting calculations) that we can live with?=01; We're only required to hav=
e a=20
ppm limit that matches NSPS requirements, and that value would be a lot=20
greater than 25 ppmv.

all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.=
