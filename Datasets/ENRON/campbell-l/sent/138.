Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about 
the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for 
review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can 
make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that 
things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply 
something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Hi Larry:
 Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
  We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the
PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from
you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.

Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?
