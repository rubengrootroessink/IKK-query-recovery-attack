Louie, after the presentation MIchael gave, there were some issues about the 
data and predictions ie., like how much solvent do we really need to clean 
the pipeline and the injection intervals and locations, but not whether the 
solvent or technology would or would not work.  The data did show that  
terpenoline does remove PCB's from pipeline.  But because Penn State was so 
deeply involved in the modeling study, and we were still under the PG&E 
thumb, it appeared to be in the best interest of TW to see it to the end.   
There wasnt anyone who had any better suggestions or ideas.  The thought was 
that because of the amount of $$$$$$ we had previously spent, not to see it 
through would have meant 0 return  for the money we had invested.    And if 
it works, the money would have been wisely used. 

The real truth of course is when we do a trial run.  I signed a six month 
extension to the contract for Penn State (I sent out a memo on this) but not 
for additional $$$$$$.  They needed the extra time to complete the modeling 
study and data evaluation.  Last summer/fall, Tiny had been overseeing the 
operational side of this (ie terpenoline storage locations and coordinating 
injection points and the pigging activities).  When the decision is made to 
begin the injections and pigging, Tiny will be ready  and waiting......

Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the PCB 
pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from you 
identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.    

Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?
