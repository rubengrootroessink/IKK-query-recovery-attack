Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will 
implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed 
sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).  
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.  

As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the 
PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been 
scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and 
discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
will be conducted at the site.
