Lorraine, I dont have a problem with continuation of this sampling, but we 
better hear from our conservative tight fisted attorney first....

Subject: PNM PCB testing

I am in the process re-negotiating PNM's FT on TW.  PNM has requested that TW 
continue to sample for contaminants at Rio Puerco, Belen and Ft. Wingate on a 
semi-annual basis during the term of the new contract which could be as long 
as five years out from 10/01.  Are we planning on continuing to sample these 
points in the East of Thoreau area?  Are there any objections to agreeing to 
this sampling?

Thanks for your quick reply.

Lorraine
