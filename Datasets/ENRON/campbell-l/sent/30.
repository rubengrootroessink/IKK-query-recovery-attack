A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce 
the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the "eyes" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The 
Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental 
compliance on the Laguna pueblo.
