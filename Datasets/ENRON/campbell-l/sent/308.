Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.
