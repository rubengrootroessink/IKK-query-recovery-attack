Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the 
pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone 
cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this 
section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of 
the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has 
been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
schedule  accordingly.
