The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the 
State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.

Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New 
Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.

A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to 
discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like 
for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to 
substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the 
State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy 
all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract 
attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. 

Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be 
made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine 
status of permit compliance with each air permit.
