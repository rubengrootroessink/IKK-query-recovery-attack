Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht 
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the 
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked 
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this 
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not 
attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and 
who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day 
for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's 
place?

Subject: Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.
