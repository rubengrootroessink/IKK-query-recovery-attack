Larry,

I spoke with Debbie Flynn this afternoon to acquire June usage information
for our customers on ELZ.  She said that she has faxed and mailed this
information to you.  Can you please let us know asap if you have that
information?  We only have two days left this month to invoice the
customers and would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping us do so.

Thanks!

Dyaniese
