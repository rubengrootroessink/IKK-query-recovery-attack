Tim,
 ET has had wholesale changes in its personnel recently. Here's the
three contacts that I talk to:

 East   John Ed James  713-371-6673
 Midwest  Tom Dickey   713-371-6163
 West    Allen King    713-371-6123

 If they can't handle the transaction, they know who can. Note that
both John Ed James and Tom Dickey will be leaving the company at the end of
the summer. Allen King is basis backup for the West, but he has always
handled my FOM deals (Allen will be moving with ET to Bethesda). Minor
intramonth changes usually can be done by the scheduler at ET, they'll tell
you if you need to talk to a trader.

  Thanks,
   Scott

Scott,

Thanks for the update. Are these contacts for scheduling purposes only? If
so, do you have the trader contacts? Please advise. Thanks.

Tim
