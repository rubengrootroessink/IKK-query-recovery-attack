Subject: field visit of EOTT tanks

In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for 
the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site 
visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the 
spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:

Andrews team  August 20 8:00 am

Spraberry team  August 21 8:00 am

Lamesa team  August 22 9:00 am
 
I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office 
on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each 
tank farm within the teams area of responsibility. Your patience and 
assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated. If a 
conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022.
