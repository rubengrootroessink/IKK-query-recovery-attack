Mr. Campbell,

Attached is a summary table showing the inspection types and intervals
required by 49 CFR 195 and 40 CFR 60.  49 CFR 195 is a DOT regulation that
references API 653 for affected tanks.  There are no exemptions for age or
size.  The DOT inspections focus on physical integrity of the tank to
prevent catostrophic failure.  The 40 CFR rules are aimed at emissions and
these do have age and size limitations.  Let me know if this is satisfactory
or if you need anything else.
