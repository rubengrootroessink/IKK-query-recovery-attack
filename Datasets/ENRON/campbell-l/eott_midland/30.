No, Not EACH TANK per day. 

For example, Scenario #1 - of the 8 tanks that we have here.....
Today, we WILL receive at least 20K BBLS of sweet, and it will go into one 
tank. We will also receive more than 500 BBL of sour and put it into a 
different tank.
Tomorrow, we will pump out of that tank, and will receive into another tank 
at least 20K of sweet.
So, within these two days, we will have exceeded the limit on two tanks.

Scenario #2:
Today, we WILL receive at least 20K BBLS of sweet and it will go into two 
tanks. We will also receive more than 500 BBLS of sour into a different tank.
Tomorrow, we will pump sweet out of one tank and will continue to go into the 
other sweet tank.

So,,
On any given day, we WILL receive/pump in excess of 500 BBLS per day. This 
will happen with the use of at least 2 tanks, possibly 3. However, we might 
have four tanks full, but not flowing.

Sorry to make this so confusing.

Kay, am I to understand that EACH TANK listed below exceeds the 500 bbl per 
day throughput threshold?  This is the information I need.  Sorry for not 
understanding or making myself clear....

A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA 
concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater 
than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of 
responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput 
criteria, please provide to me the following:


 tank name/serial number

 tank size

 average daily throughput

Thanks for your help in this matter....
