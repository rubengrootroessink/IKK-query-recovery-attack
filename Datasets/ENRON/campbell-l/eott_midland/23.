Revised listing, assumes SIC 4612 only.
For rationale for not classifying as 5171, please see Memo, para. 2.

Currently, I'm collecting required info so that the TNRCC Region can assign
an account numbers for the 12 tank sites that need them.

I received the API 653 yesterday and inserted the addendum pages.
It's an excellent reference, but doesn't focus on compliance/environmental
aspects. You only need general familiarity,
so reading Section 4 and Appendix C In-service is plenty right now.

In your spare time (ha,ha) try to look over the 2 page "In-Service" tank
inspection checklist I sent you and see if it makes sense. For about 8 years
I've used this 50 item checklist, combined with the IFR/EFR inspection
report and a seal gap measurement sketch.  In my opinion, it's all you need
right now.

Next week, I'll put the site questionnaire together.
Any questions for me... Bill Glushko 281 953-1014
