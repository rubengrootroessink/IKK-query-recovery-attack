Ed,
As you are aware, we are currently looking for some ERC's to satisfy an
Authority To Construct (ATC) for a methanol storage tank at NCL. We are
looking for approximately 175 Lbs/Yr VOC credits to satisfy this ATC. While
I was looking for credits on the APCD web sight @ valleyair.org, I came
across a list of available VOC Credits that are being held by Aera Energy
for the NCL gas plant (please see credits below), I asked Mark Poe about
these credits and he has referred me to a Darryl Gunderson of Aera Energy.
Mark informed me that he is the one that handles all of the ERC's and would
be able to help me on this. I will contact Darryl on this issue ASAP and as
we talked earlier, I am going to ask him if these credits should have been
transferred to Koch during the acquisition of the NCL Gas Plant and if not
I will see if we can purchase the necessary amounts to satisfy the ATC.

Ed, can you do me a favor and check the sales agreement between Arco & Koch
to see if there is any mention of these credits. Also inform me ASAP
whether or not to approach Darryl on these credits

Thanks,
             Scott
