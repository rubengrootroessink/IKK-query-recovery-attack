			How 'Bout Some Tonic With That Gin?
			The game of Gin was Hollywood's game. When it stormed through that town in 
the '40s, you could see Gin being played on the silver screen by all types of 
movie stars. Refined in the early 1900s at the Knickerbocker Whist Club in 
New York, Gin is the perfect social card game. It's not so strategic as to 
preclude chatting, but it still provides real competitive kick and a gleeful 
way to gloat when the cards are laid down, and "Gin" is scored. Not every 
online gaming site has Gin. But it's taking off on PlaySite. Take a break 
from your day and try it!

			Tournament Time
			What better way to test your gaming skills than to compete in an online 
tournament with other top-ranked competitors? PlaySite offers automatically 
scheduled tournaments in seven games: Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Go-Moku, 
Hex, Mancala and Reversi. Some games have tournaments geared for the 
beginning player. Backgammon has tournaments for those rated Under 1500 and 
an Open class. Checkers and Chess both have tournaments for those rated Under 
1300 and a separate Open class. 
			
			Playing in a tournament is easy and fun. Go to your favorite game page, and 
click to enter the tournament room. You'll see areas for tournament info, 
signups, games, a history of prior tournaments and a schedule for upcoming 
tournaments. PlaySite tourneys run throughout the day. Get a complete look at 
the schedule here...
