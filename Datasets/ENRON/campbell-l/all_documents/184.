The new pumps with skimmers will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of about 
$2500 each. With other associated materials and Clayton's labor we're looking 
at about $10,000 to replace the three pumps. The plan was, and still is, to 
install this type of pump in several wells at the Roswell site when we go to 
full-scale implementation of the remediation system, so all we're doing here 
is accelerating the purchase of three pumps. In regard to the Marshalk pumps, 
I'd rather not use them anywhere else because they are so maintenance 
intensive compared to the newer pumps now available. In the long run I think 
we're better off buying the newer pumps.

George, what are we looking at in terms of $$$$ for the new pumps?   Any 
place else we can use the existing pumps somewhere on the system?

The recovery system continues to produce too much water in spite of using 
product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.
