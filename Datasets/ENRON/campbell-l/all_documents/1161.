Dear Market Participants,

Please help the NYISO "clean house" so we can start our
next year of operations with an up-to-date database of
active digital certificate holders.

You may receive multiple copies of this messages - if so,
it indicates you have multiple certificates.  No action is
needed in this case.

Please notify me of persons who may have had a
certificate but have left your company, or have other
responsibilities within your company such that they no
longer need or use their certificate.

Thank you,
Pete Morrison
