Here are the waiver/notification letters to be forwarded to the CA State
Fire Marshall (for aboveground liquid pipeline waiver) and to the US DOT
Office of Pipeline Safety (for notification and aboveground waiver for
natural gas).  I have sent these as Word docs, let me know if you need a
different format.  Each package should include the attached project
description, figures (site location, aboveground installation), and
construction specs.  The Helt drawings that Ed Purcell put together should
be fine, you may want to highlight the proposed aboveground sections.  Kenny
has all the work specs and plans, which I believe the State Fire Marshall
already has copies.  Let me know if you need anything else.
