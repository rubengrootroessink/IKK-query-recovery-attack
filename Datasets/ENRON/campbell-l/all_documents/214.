Subject: Environmental Notice

Attached for your review are the technical version and summary version of 
Environmental Notices on the revised Texas upset and maintenance reporting 
rules. The rules were passed this summer so this is a bit late getting out, 
but as you know I was in Puerto Rico at the time.

I am still trying to get clarification from TNRCC on their basis for 
requiring you to include Nitrogen and CO2 when determining the Reporting 
Quantity (RQ) for natural gas. I don't believe this is a very important issue 
at most locations but I am not sure TNRCC is correct on this issue. Your 
thoughts on this are welcome.

If you could provide comments by November 29 it would be appreciated. Since I 
am not up on all the ETS organizational changes, help with the distribution 
list would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Marc
