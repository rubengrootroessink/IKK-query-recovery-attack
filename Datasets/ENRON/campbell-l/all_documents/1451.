Dear Members of the MC, BIC, OC, and TIE List,

Attached, please find the NYISO Weekly Update.  This Update
is written jointly by Mollie Lampi and other NYISO staff.

The NYISO Weekly Update provides a brief status report of, or
progress on, a range of issues that are under discussion at NYISO
Committee meetings or are being undertaken by NYISO Staff.

Many, but not all, of these issues are being addressed through the
NYISO Committee structure.  Market participants may raise any
comments or questions on items covered in the update through
the Committee structure, or directly to Mollie Lampi (mlampi@nyiso.com.).

You can find prior editions of the Weekly Update on the
"NYISO Committees" page of the NYISO web site:
