Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 
1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.  Analytical results of 
the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be 
successful.   All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 
microgram/100 cm. sq.  Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less 
than 20 ppb.  The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November 
when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher 
facilities installed at the mainline interconnect.
