The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline 
Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico.

A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the 
recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's 
portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed 
to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also 
discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other 
miscellaneous air issues.  

Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the 
source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron  
contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the 
results of the investigation.

Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the 
agency requesting action and approval of the requests.
