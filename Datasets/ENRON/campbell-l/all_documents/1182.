Larry,

How are things going?? Hope you didn't get  caught in the turbulent market 
like I did.? I guess those stocks will be  long term investments.? 
Anyway, a bunch  of?us (Karen, Roger, Viet, Chi, Grace?and me, and may some 
others) are  planning a holiday dinner at Valone's on Sat. Dec. 23 about 
7PM.? Would you  like to join us?

Regards,
?
