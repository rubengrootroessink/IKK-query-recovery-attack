Larry,
I have the State Rec Board and Kern County encroachment permit application
materials together. I also have the ACOE - 404 and RWQCB 401 information
ready for your review. You should receive all the packages tomorrow by
Fed-Ex.

I will e-mail the cover letters for you to modify as necessary and put on
your letterhead. I haven't formatted any headers or footers, as I assumed
you would have your own format style.

I need your input on a couple of questions/comments in order to finalize
things.

1) I have been listing the applicant as EOTT Energy Operating Limited
Partnership. Should I continue to list EOTT as the applicant, or should we
use Enron Transportation Services? I understand that the pipeline operator
will be Enron Pipeline Services Co.

2) Who should the local contact be? I've been using Kenny Maltby primarily
because Gary Fuller is gone, and Kenny knew what was happening from a
construction scheduling standpoint. Kenny now says that Scott Jones at the
North Coles Levee Gas Plant might possibly be the local contact. Or should
we use your name and office, as you may want to take the lead on dealing
with these agencies? Also, some of these applications/documents allow for an
agent (such as myself), but we may have to have signed authorizations in
order to do so.

3) It is my understanding that part of the overall Rogas project involves
the abandonment of an existing pipeline which travels in a separate location
through Kern Water Agency's groundwater recharge area. We may want to
address this in our application materials and get approvals as part of this
project, even though the active line may not be abandoned until a later
date. This line crosses the same bypass channel, and Kenny informed me that
they have an agreement with West Kern Water that they will remove all
abandoned lines unless they are in an "environmentally sensitive" area. This
allows you the option of capping the line on either side of the bypass
channel and leaving it in place. We would probably need the water district's
approval on this. If so, then we don't need to approach the ACOE, DFG,
RWQCB, State Reclamation Board, etc. Just something to consider. If we do
need to pull the abandoned line, we would have to go back to all these
agencies and get approvals again, pay fees, etc.

Call me to discuss at (805) 644-7976 or reply by e-mail. Thanks.
