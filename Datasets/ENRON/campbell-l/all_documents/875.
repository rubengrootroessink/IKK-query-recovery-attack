FREE                             SHIPPING on all  orders over $100, through 
November                             22.

We've                             teamed  up with Toysrus.com  to offer you 
toys and savings so massive, even  our                             North Pole 
competitors are envious.

Create                           a Wish List      at Amazon.com and you just 
might win everything on  it--up                           to $5,000. Woo-hoo!
?
5.
By                           shopping early at  Amazon.com,  you eliminate 
stress. Carolers won't seem nearly  as                           irritating.

4.
Though                           reindeer are  cute, our delivery service is 
more reliable.                           And  no fog delays.

3.
                           You can browse through all 17 of our  stores 
without                           being accosted by a persistent  perfume 
sales clerk.
?
2.
                           Free parking. 
?
1.
SHIPPING                           IS FREE on  orders of $100 or more. (Our 
Head Elf made                           us say  that again.)
