Larry,

Please take a look at the attached excel file for the 7400 ft elevation.  I 
have
calculated both NOx and CO at 100% and 50% load.

If the CO emissions cause a problem, I can investigate with our engineering
department to see if there is an on-engine control mechanism that can be
employed.

Let's talk after you have had a chance to review.

Best regards,
