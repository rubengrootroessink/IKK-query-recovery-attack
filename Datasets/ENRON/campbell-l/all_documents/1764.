The Credit Policy Working Group, which has been assigned by the Budget,
Standards, and Performance Subcommittee to address the details necessary to
develop a NYISO Credit Policy, I believe is converging on a proposal that I
expect will be drafted and available from NYISO staff by May 18.  Since the
BSP has been assigned by the Management Committee to recommend a credit
policy, the full BSP needs to review this proposal and attempt to reach a
consensus position to recommend to the Management Committee at its June 6
meeting.  Absent that, we need to able to present majority and minority
proposals.

In anticipation of this proposal being available May 18, and consistent
with the goal of presenting a recommendation to the Management Committee
for a vote at its June 6 meeting, I am scheduling two BSP meetings (in
addition to the May 21 which is to address business planning goals).

The first meeting will be Tuesday, May 22, 2001, starting at 9:30 AM in
Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue Extension in
Albany.  You are encouraged to participate in person since NYISO staff will
be presenting the details of the proposal, however, the following call-in
number is available for those who cannot be there:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

A second meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, May 30, 2001, starting at 9:30
AM in Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue
Extension in Albany to finalize our recommendation(s) to Management
Committee.  (If we can achieve this on May 22, this meeting will not be
needed.  I've been at this too long, however, to expect that will be the
case.)  Again, in person attendance is preferred, however, the following
call-in number will be available.  Same number as the first meeting:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

Marty Amati
Chair, BSP Subcommittee
