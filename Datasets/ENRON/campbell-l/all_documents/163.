A meeting was held with the Eunice Team to assign roles and responsibilities 
for the newly issued Title V air permit for the NNG Eunice C/S.  The permit 
is similiar to the other title V permits issued to New Mexico faciliites.

Assisted the Gallup Team with the preparation, completion and submittal of 
the Title V semi anual compliance monitoring report and annual certification 
report.

The state of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the 
Wt-1 C/S.  This inspection is interesting in the fact that all combustion 
equipment has been removed and dismantled and replaced by electric units.  
Written notification was submitted to the agency several months ago and a 
written reply was received from the agency that the facility is exempt from 
any and all permitting requirements.

A meeting was held with the Artesia Team to assign roles and responsibilities 
for the newly issued Title V air permit for the Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Also 
discussed was the permitting approach which will be followed for the approval 
to install micro pre combustion chambers on two White units which were found 
to be out of compliance with the air permit emissions limits when the New 
Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted a surprise inspection at the facility.
