April 20, 2001

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,
comments, concerns, and/or problems. All others may contact Customer Relations
at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
The Web Refresh Team
