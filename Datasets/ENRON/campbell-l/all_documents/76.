I just received a call from the TNRCC concerning an air quality inspection to 
be conducted at the above referenced facility on November 30, 1999.  The 
person conducting the inspection will be arriving onsite at 11:00 am.  I am 
planning on being present for the inspection.  It would be a good idea to 
have available and at the site the following:

 emissions fees paid for the last 3 years

 emissions inventories submitted for the last 3 years 

 1999 natural gas throughput

 inlet gas analysis for 1999

 H2S analysis for 1999


Also have the facility's air permit history for as far back as you can go.  
If your records have been entered into envisions, spend some time getting 
familiar with the data retrival and look like you know what you're doing on 
the 30th.

If requested, I can drive over on the 29th and assist you guys in getting 
ready for this......let me know.....
