Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
to
ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.23.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.23.4
on the routers, and replacing
route inside 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 172.16.21.1 1
route inside 172.16.0.0 255.242.0.0 172.16.21.1 1
