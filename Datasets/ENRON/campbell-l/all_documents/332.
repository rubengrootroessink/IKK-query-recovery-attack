I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service 
concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two 
C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S 
sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be 
needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic 
disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or 
near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the 
issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo 
Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on 
Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was 
almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.  

John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are 
approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of 
individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
next week  in the unlikely event a survey is required.
