Dear Larry Campbell,

Welcome to edition 3.7 of Investors Insite--an editorial 
co-production of Datek Online and The Motley Fool. 

The long-awaited news in this edition is Datek Online's introduction 
of option trades for qualified customers. Backed by an easy-to-grasp 
online trading system and real-time option price chains, Datek 
Online's commission is $9.99 per online option trade plus $1.75 per 
contract. Compare that price to the commissions charged by other 
brokerages. If you've decided that options may be an appropriate part 
of reaching your financial goals, apply now to trade options at 
Datek Online.* 

Wonder how quickly stock markets are making the move to fully 
decimalized trading? Links to an Insite follow-up article identifies 
the more than 100 stocks listed on the New York and American Stock 
Exchanges that became eligible for decimalized trading on September 
25, 2000. Qualified investors can now make decimalized equity and 
option trades of these stocks at Datek Online. 

A provocative article from Motley Fool shows how a Bear Market might 
just be the ticket to that level playing field you've been dreaming 
of. Want to learn about books that some people actually have time to 
read? Check out the Motley Fool's reviews of Peter Bernstein's 
Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk and Robert Shiller's 
Irrational Exuberance. And if you've got the urge to dust off your 
thinking cap, this month's installment of Motley Trivia offers three 
tough-but-fair corporate ID challenges. 

And be sure to check out the next generation of Streamerc. A free
download from Datek Online can put the newly expanded capabilities of 
this real-time quote system right on your desktop. 

Thanks for joining us again. Please read on!

ARE BEAR MARKETS GREAT NEWS? 
Most people don't think so. But the pros at Motley Fool point out 
that a bearish dip in prices can make stocks more affordable for the 
average investor. If you missed the boat on the bulls, or want to go 
back for affordable seconds then, ironically enough, a downturn in 
your future might be something to cheer about. more>>
