Well, I would suggest that you include some example of potential activities 
(not limited to them only, but they are possibly representatives of the types 
of activities that the RMEF could expect.  These might include:  the use of 
heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer, road grader, backhoe, etc) to do dirt work 
or relocate materials from one place to another; to use volunteer field 
employees to  perform agreed to work on RMEF projects (e.g., fence building 
and/or repair, demolish any old structures, buildings, corrals, loading pens, 
feeding and/or watering stations, etc.); to plant wildlife feed plots, etc.  
Of course, all of this type work would only be done if both parties to the 
agreement had agreed as to the type of work, timing, expense, etc.  ETS will 
provide supplies and materials needed for all projects that are agreed to by 
both (unless a third party has already agreed to provide the supplies 
needed).  You could also add that ETS would consider the funding of certain 
auction items for local chapter banquets and/or purchase a table at such 
local banquets where we have employees that will attend.  

If this kind of detail is not what he is looking for, then we might have a 
serious problem in going forward.  If he is looking for specific details of a 
project - then you will have to wait until you get a team ready to offer a 
project to the RMEF for their specific consideration.  However, that will not 
be the overall umbrella agreement that I would like to get in place.

Let me know if this is a problem.  John

Larry,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dan
