"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

It appears that the scheduling limits between ISONE and NYISO need to be
clarified and/or corrdinated.  I offer the following evidence:

> ISONE transfer limit to NY    = 600mw
> NYISO ATC/TTC posting (import from ISONE)  = 950mw
> NYISO DAM Net Import (from ISONE)   = 800 to 1050mw


1. how can NY resolve in the DAM more imports from ISONE than their own
TTC or more than ISONE's transfer limitation?
> I understand that there is no restriction on a Participant selling DA
and taking the risk of being able to deliver, but surely the software
should recognize the TTC limit and cut/prorate schedules based on price,
down to the TTC limit.  And I would presume that the two ISO's would
agree daily on the TTC limits between their respective pools, thus
ensuring that the DA transfers are always equal to or less than TTC..

2. how can we get the ISO's to coordinate something as simple as
transfer limits?
> At one time in my past life, the limiting control area's limit was the
TTC value used for both CA's....this must be on the SEAMS agenda...

Inquirying minds want to know....
