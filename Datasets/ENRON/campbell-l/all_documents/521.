EOTT

Started EPA 308 Request response Tuesday, September 4, 2001 at Russell, 
Kansas.  Large contingency of employees worked jointly to provide files on 
each release experienced since 1998.  DES had Title V Operating Permits due 
so environmental coordinators, Steve Mitchell and Monte Stebens, stayed in 
Russell until all files were completed. DES would like to thank the 
environmental coordinators and all other employees who worked on the 
information response.  Everyone did an excellent job.
