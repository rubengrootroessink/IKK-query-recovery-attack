Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the 
environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he 
has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional 
clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. 
Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the 
specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has 
extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with 
pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with 
the Office of Pipeline Safety.

When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.

Thanks.
