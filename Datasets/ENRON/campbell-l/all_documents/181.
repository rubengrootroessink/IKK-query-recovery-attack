I was talking with Bill Olson at the NMOCD this afternoon about some other 
issues and inquired about Equilon's reputation. Bill indicated that he has 
had only limited experience dealing with Equilon and apparently has not had 
any bad experience with them. Bill said that they have an abatement project 
ongoing at their Jal Basin Station near Jal, NM. He said that his contact on 
this project is primarily with their consultant, H2A. I am not familiar with 
H2A, but Bill said that they were recently formed from a couple of folks who 
left KEI to form the new company. Bill also indicated that he has had some 
contact with some folks at Equiva, which he believes is an internal 
consulting division of Equilon.
