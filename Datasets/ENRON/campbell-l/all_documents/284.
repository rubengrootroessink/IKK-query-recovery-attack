Arnold, to be safe Im going to permit at 50-100%.  that should be 
conservative and allow for minor excursions.....

normal guarentees are from 50% to 100% load at site rated conditions.

we will probably require 40% for these units and make some mods to the 
control system,  still determining requirements

Guys, emissions guarantees are in part calculated upon loading range of the 
turbines.  In order to get an accurate emissions number for each of the four 
locations, would you please provide to me the "loading range" of the turbines 
at each of their respective locations? 

thanx very much
