Because of other matters on its agenda, FERC removed the Mirant complaint
against the NYISO's implementation of the Automatic Mitigation Procedures 
(AMPs)
from its agenda on April 25.

In order to give FERC an opportunity to consider the Mirant complaint, the 
NYISO
has determined that it will delay implementation of the AMPs until after 
FERC's
next scheduled meeting on May 16.
