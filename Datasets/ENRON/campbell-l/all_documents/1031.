> > Greetings from the "Seams Team."  We've been working hard on putting

Team

> > meeting on November 20, 2000 and went through the matrix.   At that time,
> > we decided that we should identify and address  the most critical items

transactions.)
> > We  focused on  the items discussed on pages I 85-87 of the FERC report
> > entitled, "Investigation of Bulk Power Markets in the Northeast Region,"
> > issued November 1, 2000.  We chose to examine tie-out issues, curtailment
> > issues, ramping, and transaction implementation.  We will be looking for
> > your input as to whether we've correctly identified (i) the most pressing
> > issues; (ii) customer objectives with respect to such issues  and (iii)
> > whether the matrix appropriately identifies the different ISO practices
> > that will have to be examined in order to fix any perceived problems.  ISO
> > staff has committed to establishing a schedule at the meeting to resolve,
> > or at least improve, some of the problems we identify.
