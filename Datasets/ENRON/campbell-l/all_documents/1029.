NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Is evening load pick up a security issue or an economic issue?
Loading a Gilboa to peak shave is outside of the market rules. There are
other bids that should have been accepted prior to this control action.

27-Nov-2000 15:45:59 ISO REQUESTS GILBOA___4 OUT OF MERIT FOR ISO SECURITY.
EVENING LOAD PICK UP AT 16:00 11/27/00

If the NYISO is under generated due to load pick up why are GTs not
dispatched instead of loading generation out-of-merit.
If the NYISO is loading Gilboa to satisfy 10 min spinning reserve why are
not 10 min non-spin generators or 30 minute non-spin generators dispatched
prior to dispatching generation out-of-merit.
Both 10 minute and 30 minute non-spin generators if generated could be
generated displacing 10 spinning reserve negating the need to dispatch
Gilboa out-of-merit.
As always due to limited info available conclusions are drawn based on info
available. If more info is available please post it.

Thanks

Joe
