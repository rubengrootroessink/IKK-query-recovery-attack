Sportsbook.com has all Your NBA Action

With NBA underway, we are kicking off the season by including NBA action in 
our
ever popular 5% friday.  Not only will you only lay 5% instead
of 10% juice on the games, but you will also get true parlay odds.  2 team  
parlays
pay 2.8 to 1, 3 team parlays pay 6.4 to 1 and 4 team parlays pay  13.5 to 1.

Also for the NBA season, Sportsbook.com will be running juiceless half time 
wagering
on all TNT & TBS games.  Most weekday nights NBA action can be found on one of
those stations and you can lay $100 to win $100 on all half time wagers with
us.
