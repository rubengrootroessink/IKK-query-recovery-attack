Dear Larry Campbell, 

As a preferred customer, your satisfaction is our priority. We hope 
you are enjoying the superior level of service that comes with 
membership in Datek Gold. Though it will have no effect on the 
advantages you receive as a member, we want to let you know about our 
new name, toll-free number, and e-mail address. We also want to remind 
you about some of the advanced tools Datek offers. 

Datek Gold is now Datek Elite. You will still benefit from dedicated 
Customer Support, free Streamerc Level II Quotes*, and priority status 
for trying new Datek products and services before other customers. We 
feel the new name more accurately reflects the level of service we 
seek to provide to valued customers like you. Please be aware that our 
customer contact information has changed. 

New Contact Information - Exclusively for Datek Elite Members

As an active investor, you can also take advantage of our advanced 
portfolio management tools to make the most of any market conditions. 
Real-Time Screener identifies real-time investment opportunities based 
on criteria you select. Standard & Poor's Stock Reports and Fund 
Reports provide expert market information and analysis. And the new 
Streamerc Portfolio, Last Sale, and Index features allow you to 
closely track the performance of your portfolio, a particular equity, 
and market indices. When you log in to your Datek account, you can 
access all of these tools from the "Resources" menu at the top of 
the page. 

We hope you can benefit from these tools, and that our service to you 
lives up to our new name. As always, we thank you for investing with 
Datek Online. 

Sincerely, 

John J. Mullin
