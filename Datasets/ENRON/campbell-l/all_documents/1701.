"Stephen Fernands" <srfernands@cesolution.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those "golden eggs."  Likewise, the link between "expected energy
revenue" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively "good" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively "poor" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

"...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.
