"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

The 150 MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources
that would fall within the DEC cap.  Any SCR resource that is exempt should
not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP (I never meant to imply they
should).

As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply, it
seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not
comply with the DEC's wishes.

We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is
an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC.

We can flesh this discussion out next week, but from the outset, Mark's
and Roy's comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive.

First of all, not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap. Many
will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State
Facility status, either of which allows then to operate above the 150 MW
cap. Lacking any DEC-imposed limit, all such permitted facilities must
be allowed to sign up for full SCR value. Obviously, other SCR
resources, not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and
cannot be limited.

Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating
Units (CDEPGs), as John Prunkl points out, it is ISO Operations staff
that will need to decide on a real-time basis which SCR units should be
called. Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls, a unit called
one day, may or may not be needed the next. Only in the case where there
will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to
precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then, as with
generators, there is no guarantee that all SCR-certified units will be
there when called upon.

The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR, but to
decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during
emergencies. SCR resources that get signed up, but cannot be called due
to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP, but
cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee
limitations. I think this would mean a UCAP "hit" for future sales.

As a more fundamental matter, I do not believe that DEC's ill-advised
150 MW limit (which was not agreed to by the NYISO) is currently
enforceable as a practical matter.

Only the NYISO knows when the 150 MW cap is being approached and
therefore the ISO's failure to adhere to that limit should not be held
against the affected generators. Nevertheless, the DEC ruling appears to
revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that
the NYISO has violated the 150 MW limit.

The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO, which does not
hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC. If NYISO agrees to abide by
the 150 MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do
so. I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed.

Consider the following: NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where
the lights would go out in New York City with 150 MW of CDEPGs but could
stay on with 160 MW. I believe that the ISO operators might have no
choice but to order the 160 MW on and preserve reliability,
notwithstanding the DEC limitation.

By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which
they have literally no knowledge, let alone control, DEC's action
currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State
Facility Permits.

The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad
assurances in SOAS-approved Operating Manuals that operations staff can
NEVER call on more than 150 MW of CDEPGs at any given time. Even then,
it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive
assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status
revoked. CDEPGs may be forced to seek real-time certifications from the
NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed
the 150 MW limit.

I would be interested in the ISO's opinion on whether it can, and will,
limit activations of CDEPGs to less than 150 MW, no matter what the
circumstances.
