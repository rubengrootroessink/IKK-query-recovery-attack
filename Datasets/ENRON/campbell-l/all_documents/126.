Tiny, I have been sending the analyticals to Michael.  I m sorry that they
are not reaching him.  Ill switch to plan B.  I will  have hard copies of
the analyticals he needs when I see you in Gallup on Thursday.  I have
attached my PCB file to this memo for review.

Subject:  Pigging analyticals

Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from
Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for
this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter
and scrubber samples may also exist.

Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already
forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis.
They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please
advise.
