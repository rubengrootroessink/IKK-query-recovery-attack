Dear Mr. LARRY CAMPBELL:

The equity in your Datek Online trading account has fallen below our
margin maintenance requirements.  This results in a 'margin
maintenance call' that requires you to either make an immediate
payment or to close out some of your portfolio.  If your account
is not restored to its required equity by three business days from today,
portions of your portfolio may be liquidated.  Furthermore,
Datek Online reserves the right to take action at ANY time
with or without notice if market conditions warrant.

Your current margin call is as follows:

Userid =CAMPB54792
$1836.61

When funding your account, we strongly recommend that you send any payments by
overnight delivery.  Otherwise, your deposit may not be received in time to 
satisfy
this call.  Please make checks payable to Datek Online and please include your
username or account number on the face of your check before mailing to...
