John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to make sure everyone has the facts why  Transwestern was unaware 
of the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each 
agency prior to submitting each application (February of this year) to ensure 
that each application contained the correct and proper information required 
by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the 
permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September 
permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy 
issues related to California were to be given top priority.   On a monthly 
baiss I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule.  As 
we approached the anticipated September issuance calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I was first informed of the 1-4 month 
additional time beyond the September issuance which would be required for the 
permit issuance.
