Larry, below is a letter that Ed had apparently drafted. Ed's comments
below kind of indicate that he wanted you to be the one signing your name
and sending it, but it looks as though he was waiting for Lou's opinion as
to if you should be the one signing it.
Thanks,
             Scott

Contamination -- HC and HG -- Letter to Koch





     Hell, I don't even talk like that:  I just tend to get pedantic in my
demand letters to Koch.  Obviously it's ok to leave that out -- doesn't
change the import of the letter.

     It has occurred to me that, since the time I drafted it, the signature
block might best say something like "Larry Campbell of ETS on behalf of
EOTT" or words to that effect.  Do you guys do that sort of thing?  Again,
I don't think it's essential, but maybe it's a nice touch to make clear
that this is a request by EOTT through ETS.  What do you think?  Thanks.

Looks very good but i'd take out the one reference.  Larry doesn't usually
speak like that (at least not to me..)
