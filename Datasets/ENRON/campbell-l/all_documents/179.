Roger-

The attached file contains a two page summary of the remediation efforts at 
the former TW North Crawar facility. I have placed two hard copies of this 
letter and the associated site diagrams on your desk. Please feel free to 
either copy and paste this information into a separate letter from you to the 
landowner or to present my letter as an attachment to your letter, whichever 
way you feel is best.

-George
