I was at a TXOGA meeting last week and I was informed that TNRCC is only 
receiving a small percentage of the Title V Compliance Certification forms 
that they are supposed to be receiving from companies with Title V operating 
permits. Remember that Compliance Certification forms are due in Texas 30 
days after the anniversary of the date your operating permit was issued. 
TNRCC is not notifying companies that the forms are not being received. If 
you need the forms you can obtain them from TNRCC's web site at:

http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/opd/formswp.htm#compl

They are under the "Compliance and Reporting Form" section. Deviation Forms 
(for reporting noncompliance with federally enforceable regulations) can also 
be obtained at this location.
