Rich / Larry / Earl:

I sent a letter to Mike Katz, copy to Rod Boschee, that formally restated 
what I had requested at our last meeting in San Francisco. They responded 
with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with.

I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will 
be available to attend via phone.

1.  TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer 
filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing.

action items
GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get 
agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

action item:
Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team.

Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, 
as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase 
volumes.

3. PG&E will delay / defer consideration of deconning the Topock Compressor 
Station until 2001. Tests in 2001 will determine further consideration.

4. Establishment of a gas quality committee (GQC): Larry, Rich, Earl. (I will 
continue as the lead on this with Louis Saldano available)  

GQC: Take and distribute formal minutes with agreed action items.

Mike

Mike,
In my haste I failed to attach the letter.  Just one of those senior
moments.
