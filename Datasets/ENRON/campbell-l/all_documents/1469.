Dear Larry Campbell:

Don't let this rocky market bring you down! 

The market's recent drop has scared many investors, but it has also 
brought down the valuations of many of the market's strongest 
companies and now is a great time to reevaluate your portfolio. Enter 
The Motley Fool Rule Maker Top 25 report*. The Motley Fool's Rule 
Maker Portfolio has become well-known for its investments in cash-rich 
companies that dominate their industries. Now the Rule Maker Portfolio 
team has used its signature stock-selection criteria to identify the 25 
most intriguing companies in a range of industries, from financial 
services to food and beverage to technology. 

Also, each of these stocks is a candidate to achieve the Rule Maker 
Portfolio's goal of doubling in price over the next five years. No one 
can say for sure how these companies will perform in the next year, but 
they represent great starting points as you plan your portfolio. 

For a limited time, STREAMER USERS can purchase this report for $25 -- 
that's 36% off the cover price. Visit The Motley Fool to learn more 
about this exclusive offer. 

Sincerely, 

Ed Nicoll 
Chairman and CEO
