Dear Market Participants,

With regard to a prior posting of Changes to OASIS/MIS/CSS Systems
(please refer to original at bottom) implementation of the item:

*  A new internal application for Operations to manage units
placed out of merit will improve coordination between Operations
and Grid Accounting for the purposes of accurate billing.

caused some visible changes in the MIS web pages
that were not explained in the original notice.

The screens which have changed are:

- Gen Bid Query Page - New value of 'MODIFIED' in the Bid Status
dropdown.  This will allow a user to select only bids that have a
status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Bid Query Results Page - The status for a particular bid may
have a value of 'MODIFIED'.  Clicking on the bid status link will
list a message page with more information about the meaning of the
status.

- Gen Bid Page - The schedule information at the bottom of the page
may list a bid status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Outage Page - Once fixed, the outage information will be
listed on an hourly basis since the outage information is now tied
to the bids.

- For the upload/download, the templates for submission and results
have not changed.  Retrieval of generator bids may have some
records with a bid status of 'MODIFIED', along with a message tied
to the meaning of the status.  The outage schedule information
(once fixed) will have the information listed on an hourly basis.

All of these screens have not changed in terms of layout or
functionality, etc.  There are just new possible values for some
of the query parameters and query results.

Thank you,
Customer Relations
