Larry-
Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains two photos of the SVE system that 
was recently started-up. 

The cost estimate is $130,000. This figure includes only contract 
installation dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more 
than this. The bulk of this figure ($75,000) is for installation of 14 
additional remediation wells. I think we should keep-up an aggressive 
schedule with this site due to the close proximity of the Crane County water 
wells.

Give me a call and lets discuss.

-George
