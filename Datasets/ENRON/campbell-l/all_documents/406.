Laguna and or Moutainair team, because I dont know which team is responsible 
for the Belen delivery point, would someone check on liquids at this location 
and if present, collect a sample and have it analyzed for PCB's?  We're 
required to do this by the contract.  If no liquids are present, drop 
Lorraine and or myself a message  stating such.  Thanx

Larry - PCB testing that TW has committed to with PNM for October 1, 2001 
through September 30, 2006 is the same as the commitment TW agreed to 5 yrs. 
ago and that is as follows:

"...PCB sampling program standards set forth by the EPA at the TW/PNM 
delivery points of Rio Puerco, Ft. Wingate and Belen".

Thanks for your assistance.

Lorraine

FYI, Lorraine.  As I understand it there are three site for which you want 
samples collected.  One is Rio Puerco, the other is this site, what is the 
last I/C?
