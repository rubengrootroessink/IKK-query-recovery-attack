Then
select "Transmission Congestion Contracts - TCC Market" and "Additional TCC

This document contains the "Sale Agreement" which must be completed and

"Purchase Agreement" which must be completed and returned to the NYISO via an

are identical to those used for the Spring 2001 Initial Auction of TCCs except
for the relevant date references.

The revisions to these "Rules" are the following:

References to "Winter 2000/2001" were changed to "Summer 2001".
The address of the  Auctioneer was changed to the NYISO's Washington Avenue

The final version of the Time Line provided as Attachment C differs slightly
from the Preliminary Time Line posted on the NYISO web site.
Section 6.8 was revised and Attachment G was added to define the rules that
Buyers of TCCs using the HQ Proxy bus as a POI or POW must follow when
submitting their bids.
