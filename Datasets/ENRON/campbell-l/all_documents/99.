I think it would be helpful from a legal and environmental standpoint so that 
everyone might better understand our resonsibilities and obligations. Thanks. 
Audrey can set the meeting up for you.

Steve 

Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and 
I - or some combination thereof) setting up a briefing session for you and 
your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as 
Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better 
equipped to discuss matters with some of our customers - particularly PG&E 
(although Jeff and Lorraine has been a quick study already). Based on Rod 
Boschee's last email they may be looking for us to replace their line 300 
before they entertain any increased flows.

Thgts?
