Attached for your review, please note the photos of the pigs received on the 
mainline in section 4.  These are pigs Coastal oversized per piping specs.  
Approximately 10 gallons of liquid came in with the pigs but, for the most 
part it was in a sludge form.  The pigs are worn as you would expect and 
hopefully some of the photos will show enough detail to give you all an idea 
of the extent of the wear.  Samples (both wipe and liquids/sludge) were 
collected as per your direction.  Wipes on the top and bottom of the leading 
rubber on both the first and second pigs.  One liquid sample collected in 
front of first pig and a second liquid sample collected in front of the 
second pig.  This pigs ran fast (approximately 85 miles in 7 hours).  We had 
920 mmcfd flow half of which was flowing in the loop and the other half in 
the main line.  

First pig:



Second pig:



The Loop line pigs are running today and should arrive at sta 3 this evening.
