John, I had asked Randi to complete an annual report for the F&G 2081 permit, 
as I did not want to have this hang over our head when EOTT's 2081 
application was reviewed.  This may be the annual report that were talking 
about.  As you remember, the 2081 requires an annual report for activities 
conducted for the prior year and it is due by Jan 10th of every year.  It was 
not been submitted for 1999 or  2000.  Because Randi has been personally 
involved in all construction activities at the North Coles Levee facility, I 
thought she would be the prime person to complie the reports for us and then 
we would submit.  If this is the annual report everyone is talking about, 
then, yes, I instructed her to do these, primarily, because she has been 
involved since the get go and she has the information.  She has also promised 
the reports to me by 2/15 for sumibttal to the F&G.

What would it hurt to ask her?  Primarily she is working under your direction 
now as you implement various work through Scott Jones.  John

John, it s my understanding that Randi did only biology issues related to 
construction and monitoring.  I was not aware of Gary giving her permission 
to do waste surveys for the company.  Do you want me to ask her about this?  
One of the issues  that most people had with Gary was that he employed every 
contractor in California to do his work.  It may be that he had Randi working 
on this, I really dont know.....

Larry,
Does this meet with your understanding of what Randi is doing?  Are we all on 
the same page?  John

John, As per your request I contacted Randy McCormick (Bio Resources
Consulting) on the annual reports that are due. Randy informed me that she
had previously done a draft-report for 1999, which she had given to Gary
Fuller. She also told me that she believed that Gary had not finalized nor
turned in this report. Randy has committed to providing us with a 2000
Draft-Annual Report within two weeks for our review. I will inform you when
I receive the draft report.

Thanks,
                Scott
