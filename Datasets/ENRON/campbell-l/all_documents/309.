Larry,

I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially
(vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels
are between 215 and 250 vppm.

This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.

As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the
entire operating range.

I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert 
the
chart to imperial units, but hopefully it helps for you to understand the
concept.

Call me at home this weekend, if you need anything.
