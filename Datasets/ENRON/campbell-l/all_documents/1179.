Hi Larry,

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
