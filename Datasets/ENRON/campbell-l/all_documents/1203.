Dear Amazon Music Customer,

As someone who's bought music gifts from us in the past, you might
like to know about our box sets special. From now until December 18,
every box set in our Music store (that's thousands of them) will be
on sale at prices up to 30% off the list price.

Box sets make a great gift for music lovers, but with so many titles
to choose from, it isn't easy to know what to buy. That's where we can
help. To help you sift through the many choices, we've created a list
of our most popular box sets. Featuring artists like The Eagles, Elton
John, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Miles Davis, and others, it's a pretty
impressive list--and, at up to 30% off, the prices can't be beat. To
view our top boxes, follow the link below:

If you don't find what you're looking for on this list, don't worry.
We've got an entire Box Sets Store packed with thousands of box sets
in every style of music. (If you come across a box set you just have
to have for yourself, we won't tell.) To check out our Box Sets
Store, follow the link below:

Hope you take advantage of our box sets special (remember, it only
lasts until December 18).

Happy holidays,

Andy Bartlett
