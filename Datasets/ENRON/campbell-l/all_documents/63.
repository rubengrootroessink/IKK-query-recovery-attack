Kay, the choice is yours as to how you want to clean your oil staining.  both 
technologies will work.  I prefer the quicker of the two......in the interest 
of time ie steam

Subject: Oil Skim + "Bugs"

Got a question:
At the Amarillo round table, a salesman was doing a pitch on his "bugs" that 
"eat oil"
The EPA gurus there didn't have a complaint against this.....
How do ya'll feel about this? Is this something we should look at doing? Or 
should we continue to clean our burms as we normally do (ie: steam clean)
Let me know
Thanks
Kay
