After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.
