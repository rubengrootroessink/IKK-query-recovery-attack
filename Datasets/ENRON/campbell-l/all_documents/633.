Solar is having problems tracking the information down.  It appears that the 
turbine was manufactured after 1977 (1989) and is subject to subpart GG, but 
I do not have confirmation of this information yet.  This turbine was 
installed at Keystone in 2000.  Did we do all the notifications and testing 
required by GG?  Do you know when the first turbine subject to GG was 
installed at Keystone?  We should be very careful about exchanging turbines 
that are not subject to GG.  We should try to get Solar to exchange pre 1977 
turbines with pre 1977 turbines.

Ms. Jensen,

The turbine power section serial #0921-97-P was installed at Keystone.  It
appears to be a 1997 model but can you confirm this through your Solar
contact.
