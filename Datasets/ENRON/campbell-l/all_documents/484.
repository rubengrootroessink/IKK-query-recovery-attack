David-
Two files are attached. The first file is the text and figures of a plan for 
characterizing impacted soil in the former surface impoundment areas. The 
second file contains the attachments to the characterization plan. The 
attachments include copies of soil boring logs and a summary of some previous 
soil sample results. I will also send a hard copy of the plan to you via 
FedEx. Transwestern is ready to proceed upon approval from the NMOCD and the 
NMED HRMB. Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks,
George
