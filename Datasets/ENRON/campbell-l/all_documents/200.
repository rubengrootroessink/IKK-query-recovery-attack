Below is language from EPA guidance that confirms that only liquid samples=
=20
are required for characterization purposes.  Sue

Q: Under o761.30(i), is use of organic liquids for characterization of the=
=20
natural gas
pipeline system required?
A: Yes. EPA=01,s intention was for organic liquids to be used to characteri=
ze=20
the PCB
contamination in the natural gas pipeline system. EPA will make a technical=
=20
correction to
o761.30(i)(4) to clarify this.

Q: When conducting the annual sampling under o761.30(i), what do you do if=
=20
you don=01,t
have liquids present annually?
A: Under the use authorization provisions at o761.30(i), if a pipeline syst=
em=20
once contained
liquids at 50 ppm or greater but is now relatively dry (i.e., there are no=
=20
liquids available to
test at existing condensate collection points), then the owner/operator of=
=20
the pipeline
system has no further sampling and analysis to do until such time as liquid=
s=20
appear. EPA
did not intend to require wipe sampling for characterizing natural gas=20
pipeline systems in
use; hence, EPA has made a technical correction at o761.30(i)(4) to drop th=
e=20
reference to
wipe samples.  For these relatively  dry systems with no liquids, the=20
sampling requirements at
o761.30(i)(1)(iii)(A)(5) don=01,t apply. However, EPA would expect the=20
owner/operator of
the pipeline system to continue to check at least annually for liquids and=
=20
document their
absence under the recordkeeping requirements in o761.30(i)(1)(iii)(C). Shou=
ld=20
any liquids
appear later, the liquids should be tested.

Mr. Lou  is it about time we did a PCB Mega Rule characterization sampling =
of=20
the Transwestern Pipeline system west of Corona Sta # 8. I was thinking it=
=20
was every six months that you were wanting that ? Let me know and if you do=
=20
want a sample run done I will get it started.   thanks Butch =20
