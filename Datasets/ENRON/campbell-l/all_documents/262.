R equirements


1) We have the permit and drawing for boring the Kern County Water Agencies
Cross Valley Canal. I will also contact Helt Engineering for the canal
profile and Soils Engineering for the soil analysis.

2) Permits for Hwy 43 and Interstate 5 are state Permits through Caltrans,
at this time we have not received the permits. Helt Engineering has
repeatedly made calls but are having difficulty getting anyone to answer
the phone. I have asked them to notify Caltrans of who is the contractor
for the project. Alan if you can provide me with the name of the boring
contractor I will provide that information at the same time. If I do not
have an answer soon I will make a trip to Fresno and see what I can find
out. Matt, Floyd Little is the contact for Caltrans, you probably remember
the problems you had when you tried to contact him.

3) Gary Fuller put West Coast Environmental in charge of obtaining a permit
for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel from the Army Corp of
Engineers. As we discussed last week the application for the permit had not
been filed. Larry Campell with the environmental department has been asked
to contact West Coast Environmental for the status of the permit
application. I will provide the drawing, permit and permit requirements
when we receive them.

4) I will gather copies of the conditions and requirements from the water
districts and provide that to Alan.

5) We have not received the Fish and Games approval at this time. When we
receive it and have final approval from our environmental and legal
departments I will provide the Permit to Alan.

As you know we are at the States mercy on obtaining these permits. We are
shooting for the two week starting date as mention earlier. I will keep you
informed.

Once we secure all these permits and schedule work, we will provide copies
to you.

Matt,

In order for Ken Small Construction to plan and schedule the work in the
most economic manner we would like the following information in hand prior
to starting field construction work.

1) Copy of permit from Kern County Water Agency for the Cross Valley Canal
with the drawing that was submitted for permit application.

2) Copy of permit from Kern County for the Enos Lane crossing with drawing
that was submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed
as
contractor on permit.

3) Copy of permit from Caltrans for the I-5 crossing with drawing that was
submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed as rider
along with bore contractor.

4) Copy of permit from Army Corps of Engineers for the Kern River crossing
with drawing that was submitted for permit application, along with any
conditions required.

5) Copy of Fish & Game, Kern Water Bank Authority, Buena Vista Water
Storage
and West Kern Water requirements or conditions for construction of the
pipelines.

Your help in letting KSCI know the status of the above permits as soon as
possible will also help to set up a workable schedule that we can utilize
for our construction purposes.
