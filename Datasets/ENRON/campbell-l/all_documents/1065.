Dear Market Participants,

In order to assure your messages are delivered to list server
recipients please remember:

- you must be subscribed to the list server in order to send
messages to the list recipients and

- you must unsubscribe your old e-mail address, then subscribe
your new e-mail address from the NYISO list servers when your
e-mail address changes.

The web pages designed to help you with this process are at:
