Larry,

Attached is the latest version of the Red Rock Mainline Expansion
environmental report.  This should be fairly complete except for a few
pieces of information.  I have listed things I still need below.

Information Needed...
1. Dates of air permit submittals and copies of applications
2. Copies of T&E phone logs and/or written responses
3. Copy of USFS notification and/or phone log
4. Dates of cultural resource surveys, findings (verbal), date when
reports will be ready, copies of any agency responses and/or phone logs
5. Manufacture/model of new units (if different from those given to
air/noise consultants, updates will be needed)
6. Verify whether we need volume of hydro-test water

FYI Donna sent me the new plot plans via e-mail.  I took a look at those and
updated the report accordingly.  I have not heard anything regarding the
soils from the Forest Service.  Minimum checklist requirements only ask for
NRCS mapped soil data.  Scott Patti in our Ft. Collins office happened to be
speaking with one of his FERC contacts on another project and asked about
the issue of no mapped soils.  His contact indicated to him that it would
not be a problem for work within existing facilities.

I will be working remotely tomorrow, but will have access to e-mail and can
be contacted via my cell phone 919-632-6840.  Otherwise, leave me a message
and I will call you to discuss.
Hope all went well with the EPA,

Terry.
