This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no 
circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the 
turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air 
construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction 
activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, 
buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very 
dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to 
approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing 
construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance 
issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations 
are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.
