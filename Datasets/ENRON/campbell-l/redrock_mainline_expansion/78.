Larry- Please review the PM lb/hr limits and the annual test for both the 
turbine and the generator at the Kingman station. Let me know if you have any 
problems, otherwise i will try to get the permit issued tomorrow, if not 
today. The Director, Nancy Wrona, has to sign off, so i have to try and get 
into her calendar.

Thanks. Shudeish
