I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at 
stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
activities will not disrupt the site.  

I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.
