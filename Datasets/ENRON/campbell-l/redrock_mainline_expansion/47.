Absolutely - we can outline what it would take.  Greg Simmons definitely
said that it would be a congressional decision in D.C. - I asked him "what
about the 'energy initiative' and 'expedited review'" - he said that it
probably would not matter in this case - National Monuments are off limits
to new ROWs without an act of congress.

it was gonna take and then pass it along to construction and you guys.  Can
you follow up on this with a short outline of the process and steps for
approval?

Larry, I got the sense that it is not impossible, but that it would be a
long, drawn out process, and would shoot the schedule all to hell.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act
of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

Subject: ENSR Cashflow Estimate Through Construction of Project Sundevil


Lady and Gentlemen,

As the Subject line would lead you to believe, I am attaching a further
refinement of our cost estimate, spread out over the life of the project.
I
know that you, Dave, requested a breakdown by personnel and hours, but I am
going to have to go home and pack for my trip.  We certainly can break this
down by personnel and hours, but I cannot do it tonight.  I apologize for
any inconvenience this may cause any of you.  Please remember that you can
contact Jon Alstad in my absence (cc'ed).  I will be back in the office on
October 1st.  Scott
