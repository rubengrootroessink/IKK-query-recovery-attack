Larry,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dan
