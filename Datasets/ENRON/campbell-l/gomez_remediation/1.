It's that time again.  Please provide what you believe the costs for the rest 
of 1999 will be associated with the assets which have not been sold for PG&E 
and KN. 

As always, just give me your best guess.   Please have this information to me 
by April 5. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks!
