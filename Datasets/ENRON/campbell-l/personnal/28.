Hi Larry:

The name of the company is The Travel Company. They are located in Dallas and 
the number is 214-891-9663. The folks here say that they will quote you an 
amount for the day that you call and you have to get the ticket to them 
within a few days. The prices they pay vary between $ 275 and $350. However, 
they have been paying $325 to $340 for the last few tickets that the guys 
have sold to them. Trust all is well and again thanks for the help with the 
Koch deal. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks

Joe

Joe, would you please pass on to me the contact and telephone number for the 
Southwest airline ticket issue we were discussing at the Corpus Christi 
airport last week?  By the way, how's the Koch opportunity coming along?
