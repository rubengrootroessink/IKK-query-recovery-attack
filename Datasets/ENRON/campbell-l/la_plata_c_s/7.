  Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and 
all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a "trouble 
shooting" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate 
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very 
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the 
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of 
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more 
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low 
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because 
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued 
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be 
issued for the fuel use issue.

Larry---

Will the permit exceedances mentioned in one of your recent weekly reports at 
the La Plata station result in an NOV?

Thanks, Bill
