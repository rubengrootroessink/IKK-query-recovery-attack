I'll put this in, but I think items like this need to be kept by the 
individual receiving them.  We probably need to talk about this in August.

The Mighty Ducks would like to thank Rick Smith, Butch Russell and Larry 
Campbell for all  the help we received from them in preparation for our Mega 
Audit. We would like to thank them for taking time out of their busy 
scheduled to help us prepare for our audit. Their help was greatly 
appreciated. With their extra effort the Mighty Ducks are still fling high.  
The Ducks think that they should receive some recognition for their 
tremendous help. (American Express)


                                                                              
        Faithfully your Number One Team
