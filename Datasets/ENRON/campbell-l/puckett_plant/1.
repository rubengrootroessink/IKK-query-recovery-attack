Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue 
groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, 
Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire 
facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been 
ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of 
groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard 
has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be 
terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received 
on July 14, 1999.  

Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious 
weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).  
Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we 
will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
indefinately.
