Larry,
Thanks for the heads-up.  I believe management has said that all requests are 
to flow through a select group of individuals (that are in any way remotely 
associated witht he El Paso incident) prior to responding.  I have alerted 
Lou and Mike Nelson that we need to consider this request along with the 
others we have received.  Just for your information, we are currently working 
on a set of "talking points" so we can better respond to some of these 
requests related to safety of the pipeline.  Thanks again, John Shafer

Subject: Corrosion Records Request for Pipeline on the Navajo Nation

I received a call from Ronnie Ben (520) 871-7995 of the Navajo Nation EPA 
requesting corrosion records for all pipelines owned by Transwestern on the 
Navajo Nation.  We talked for awhile and I informed him that John Gormley in 
Albuquerque handled corrosion on those portions of the Transwestern line on  
reservation lands.  He said that he would be contacting John and a request 
will be made for all corrosion records and compliance activities for 
pipelines on the reservation. This may be a ripple effect from the El Paso 
incident near Carlsbad, N.M. which happened a couple of weeks ago.
