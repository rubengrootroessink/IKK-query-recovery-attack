The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.
