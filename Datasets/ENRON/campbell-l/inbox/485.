f New York:  "I've been filling out a 'baby's first year' calendar for my n=
ewborn daughter. When I receive my pictures from Ofoto, I cut up the small =
pictures on the index print and paste them onto the appropriate day on the =
calendar. Now we have a visual record of her firsts (first outing, first ba=
th, first solid food, etc.)! Years from now, it will be interesting to be a=
ble to actually SEE how she changed from month to month."  Have any creativ=
e ways you use Ofoto during the holidays? Let us know at creativeclicks@ofo=
