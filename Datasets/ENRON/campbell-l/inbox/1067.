   This poem was written by a terminally ill young girl in a New York
   Hospital. It was sent by a medical doctor - Make sure to read what is
   in the closing statement AFTER THE POEM.

   SLOW DANCE
   Have you ever watched kids
   On a merry-go-round?
   Or listened to the rain
   Slapping on the ground?
   Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?
   Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
   You better slow down.
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   Do you run through each day
   On the fly?
   When you ask "How are you?"
   Do you hear the reply?
   When the day is done
   Do you lie in your bed
   With the next hundred chores
   Running through your head?
   You'd better slow down
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   Ever told your child,
   We'll do it tomorrow?
   And in your haste,
   Not see his sorrow?
   Ever lost touch,
   Let a good friendship die
   Cause you never had time
   To call and say,"hi"
   You'd better slow down.
   Don't dance so fast.
   Time is short.
   The music won't last.


   When you run so fast to get somewhere
   You miss half the fun of getting there.
   When you worry and hurry through your day,
   It is like an unopened gift....
   Thrown away.
   Life is not a race.
   Do take it slower
   Hear the music
   Before the song is over.


   PLEASE FORWARD THIS TO HELP THIS LITTLE GIRL.
   ALL FORWARDED E-MAILS ARE TRACKED TO OBTAIN THE TOTAL COUNT.


   Dear All:
   PLEASE pass this mail on to everybody you know. It is the request of
   a special little girl who will soon leave this world as she has
   cancer. Please send this to everyone you know or don't know. This
   little girl has 6 months left to live, and as her dying wish, she
   wanted to send a letter telling everyone to live their life to the
   fullest, since she never will. She'll never make it to prom, graduate
   from high school, or get married and have a family of her own. By you
   sending this to as many people as possible, you can give her and her
   family a little hope, because with every name that this is sent to,
   The American Cancer Society will donate 3 cents per name to her
   treatment and recovery plan. One guy sent this to 500 people! So I
   know that we can send it to at least 5 or 6. Just think it could be
   you one day. It's not even your money, just your time! PLEASE PASS ON
   AS A LAST REQUEST


   Dr. Dennis Shields, Professor
   Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology
   1300 Morris Park Avenue
