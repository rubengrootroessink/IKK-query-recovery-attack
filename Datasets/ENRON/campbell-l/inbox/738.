Dear Market Participant,

Technical Bulletin #67 - Automated Mitigation Procedure for
the Day-Ahead Market - and Technical Bulletin #68 - Reference
Level Adjustment Request Process - have been revised and will
be posted to the NYISO web site.  Copies of the Technical
Bulletins are attached for your convenience.

The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation
in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.
