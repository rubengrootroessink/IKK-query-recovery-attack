This is great stuff..

Since Strategic sees the value in having this 'valuable' call option. I
would suggest that they value the put option on the load contracts being
served and rebate their customers accordingly.
Include the obvious DAM to R/T arbitrage as optionality also, the
options thay hold are hourly and therefore are much more valuable.

I look forward to the rebates being sent to their customers.

If a GT so valuable go buy one or build one.
