ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.
