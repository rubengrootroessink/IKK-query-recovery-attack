> Negotiations Begin to Integrate NeptuneRTS(tm)
> into PJM Market Platform
>
> Pittsfield, ME and Valley Forge, PA - October 31, 2001 - The Neptune Regional
> Transmission System and PJM have begun negotiations aimed at achieving the
> functional integration of the Neptune system into the PJM market platform.
> Once accomplished, the Neptune transmission project will allow for greater
> flexibility to the northeast region's electric transmission grid.
>
> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has directed Neptune to work
> with the Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO), or if that entity
> develops more slowly than Neptune, FERC called for Neptune to work with an
> Independent System Operator like PJM.
>
> "Given that the FERC has stated that the Northeast RTO should be based on
> PJM's platform and that PJM is already approved as the country's first fully
> functioning RTO, we believe the partnership will provide a convenient and
> readily understood management system for our customers," said Charles E.
> Hewett, NeptuneRTS(tm) chief executive officer. "We're delighted to be working
> with PJM."
>
> "PJM is pleased to support arrangements that will make a viable merchant
> transmission entity fully integrated with the northeast markets while meeting
> the specific needs of the Neptune Regional Transmission System," said Richard
> A. Wodyka, PJM chief operating officer. "PJM has been looking for innovative
> ways to integrate expansive, broad-reaching transmission projects into the
> competitive marketplace to better serve our region's customers."
>
> Hewett described the following functional areas as topics for the
> negotiations:
> *	System Scheduling, Dispatch and OASIS Management for the NeptuneRTS(tm)
> and  its Transmission Scheduling Rights
> *	Billing, Collection and Settlement Management
> *	Design and Conduct of Subsequent Open Season Auctions for System
> *	Capacity
> *	Management of Ancillary Services Trading Platforms Appropriate to HVDC
> *	Interconnections
> *	Management of a Secondary Trading "Bulletin Board" for Transmission
> Scheduling Rights
> *		Liaison with other Independent System Operators
> *	Facilitation Services for Settlement of Stakeholder Issues
>
> The Neptune regional transmission system is a high voltage direct current
> transmission system proposed to link the bulk power systems in the
> mid-Atlantic, Northeast states and Canadian provinces.  The system uses
> submarine cable technology.  As the designer, constructor and owner of the
> multi-regional system, NeptuneRTS(tm)  is seeking to complete negotiations
> with PJM, operator of transmission systems and energy markets. Under such an
> arrangement, PJM would offer market, operations and administrative services
> for this new multi-regional entity.
>
> PJM, the country's only fully functioning RTO, operates the world's largest
> competitive wholesale electricity market and one of North America's largest
> power grids. The company currently coordinates a pooled generating capacity of
> more than 59,000 megawatts and operates a wholesale electricity market with
> more than 200 market buyers, sellers and traders of electricity. PJM has
> administered more than $5 billion in energy and energy service trades since
> the regional markets opened in 1997. More than 70 nations have sent delegates
> to PJM to learn about the market model and the operation of the grid in the
> mid-Atlantic states. Visit PJM at www.pjm.com <http://www.pjm.com>.
