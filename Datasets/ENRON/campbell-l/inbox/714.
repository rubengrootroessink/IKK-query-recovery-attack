After several curious questions and comments, LIPA has decided to
provide
this information on a one time basis.

According to the NYISO, on July 23 and 24, the AMP process was activated
on
Long Island in the DAM and mitigation took place.  LIPA has confirmed,
contrary to popular perception, that no LIPA units were mitigated under
the
AMP.

The AMP triggered for Long Island during hours beginning 15, 16, and 17
in
the Day-Ahead Market for July 23, 2001.  Mitigation took place as a
result
of verification of conduct and impact.
