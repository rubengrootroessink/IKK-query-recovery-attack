Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following enhancements to the
NYISO web server, MIS, SPIDER, Real-Time system and AutoSys that will be
implemented on September 25, 2001.

   A new pilot application will be deployed between the NYISO and ISO-New
   England to help automate the exchange of inter-regional transaction
   schedules.  Operations groups at both sites will receive automated
   transfer of transaction data to facilitate the hourly transaction
   checkout process.

   The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the implementation
   of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application server will be the
   platform utilized by the MIS to provide bidding and scheduling
   capability to Internet customers. The new software replaces the
   NetDynamics product, will provide the same functionality, and will be a
   more robust and reliable development platform for future enhancements.

   New data postings will be made available on the web site to provide
   real-time internal transmission limits and flows, as well as
   transmission line scheduled and actual outages. This posting is part of
   the collection of data requests made by the Business Issues Committee
   (BIC) in September 2000.

   A new Upload / Download template will be created that will enable Market
   Participants to get access to generator adjusted megawatt data (current
   and historic billing data).

If you any questions, please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
