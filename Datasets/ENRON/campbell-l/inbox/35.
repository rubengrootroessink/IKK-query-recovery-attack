Dear Market Participants

A new menu option is now available on the Bidding and
Scheduling page.  The 'Daily Transaction Summary' report
will provide customers with centralized information on
transaction bids they are associated with.  This is a
continued effort to provide information flow to customers.

If you have any questions please call
Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.
