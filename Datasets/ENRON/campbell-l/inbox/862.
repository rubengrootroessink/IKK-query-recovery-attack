Market Participants:

In the early evening hours on 8/8/2001 the NYISO inadvertently ran a
billing job for
7/16/2001.  This created a version 5 of the bills for this billing date.
Version 5 is not
valid, all customers should use version 4 when reconciling their advisory
statements
to their invoice.

If you have any questions please contact Customer Relations at
518-356-6060.
