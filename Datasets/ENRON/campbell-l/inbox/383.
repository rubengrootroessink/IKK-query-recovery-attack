Dear Market Participant,

In the interest of not flooding the webmaster with constant changes (new
PTIDs or new participant names) to the
UCAP forms (Certification, Bid Forms, and Offer Forms), I will be updating
the forms about once per month.  Since you will
need a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms have
codes that will allow you to enter
undefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.

PTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned a
number.
NewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a
"Registrant Name"
NewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a
"Registrant Name"

NOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions in
the comments cell of the form being submitted.

Other Changes

ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of
NYISO transactions during the supplemental
process.  The supplemental process is implemented when there is
insufficient UCAP available within a location and
the NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage
has occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.

PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO
auction have been assigned.  The PTID
numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental
processes.   For example, a participant who is
selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction
would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when
selling into a subsequent ISO auction.

A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the
auction Offer forms.



Reminder

When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in
terms of the procurement period for the first auction
month when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auction
for the upcoming months of June through October)
3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auction
reference that you will use for both the June and
August transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be used
if on May 15, the transactions were for
August and September.

When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets say
that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip
Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Your
entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip
auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW
bilateral transaction.  You can not use a
value of 20MW on one line.

Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.



Regards,
Bob Boyle
