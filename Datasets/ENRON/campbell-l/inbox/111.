 Dave and all:
I am attaching our additions, in a redlined version, to the very good start
on this survey of the landscape of ICAP deliverability. I won't be available
for the phone call, but Frank Felder will try to catch a good part of the
call for TransEnergieUS.
I am on the road, so please use michael.jacobs@transenergieus.com for e-mail
replies.  Thanks.

Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on Friday.
To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft that
identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.
Thanks
