NYISO Market Advisory
Re:  Code Red Worm Computer Virus

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

As many of you are likely aware, there is currently a computer virus named
Code Red Worm making its way around the internet. Through the congestion it
causes, this virus and its variants may significantly impact normal
internet functions. It is projected that a version of this virus is
scheduled to go from dormant to active state sometime this evening
(7/31/2001) and could create problems for anyone using the internet.

Because of the various functions handled over the internet between the New
York Independent System Operator ("NYISO") and Market Participants, the
NYISO has done everything we can to secure our operations against problems
from this virus. Likewise, we strongly urge you to be sure that your
organization is up-to-date about this issue and that you take all possible
precautions to prevent any problems with your normal business functions.

Accordingly, we are providing three links to websites below that maintain
some of the most up-to-date and authoritative information we know of about
viruses such as these. If you have not already done so, we urge you to
visit one or more of these sites to familiarize yourself with the issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

NYISO Communications
