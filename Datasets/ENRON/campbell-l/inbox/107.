BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: "Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia."

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the "heart land" of Germany. 

Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  "The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located," explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  "Other "Raider Class" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports."  

While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.
