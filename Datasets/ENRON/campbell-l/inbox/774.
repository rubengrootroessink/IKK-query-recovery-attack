The ICAP Working Group of the New York State Reliability Council
("NYSRC") is posting this message to inform all interested parties of
the ability participate, on a "listen-only" basis, in the NYSRC ICAP
Working Group Conference Call No. 10 scheduled for August 2, 2001,
starting at 9:00A.M.  Attached in Word format is the Agenda for this
meeting.  The Working Group is an open meeting in accordance with NYSRC
Policy No. 2, which is available of the NYSRC web site at
"www.nysrc.org", on the "Policies" web page.

Those wishing to participate on a "listen-only" basis can call (608)
250-9281, and enter participant Code 132622, starting at 9:30 A.M.
Participants will be required to place their telephones on mute so as
not to prevent other parties from participating.  Those who plan on
listening to the meeting shall send an email to my attention at
"mhogan@cenhud.com" with the names of the individuals and organizations
participating.

Those who are not NYSRC ICAP WG Members or Alternate Members will be
given an opportunity to comment at the end of each meeting, or earlier
