The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
"Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short."

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.
