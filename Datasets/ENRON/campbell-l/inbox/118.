"Robb, Kathy" <KRobb@hunton.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The next ICAP Working Group meeting will be held on Monday, September 24 ,
beginning at 10 am at the NYS Nurses Association, 11 Cornell Road, Latham,
NY. The agenda is to hear presentations about, and discuss, ICAP theological
issues (originally scheduled for the Sept. 11 meeting that was cancelled.)

Presentations at the meeting will be limited to 20 minutes. All those
interested in presenting should circulate materials to the tech exchange no
later than the morning of Thursday, September 20. Please let me know if you
are planning on presenting an issue as soon as possible so we can structure
the order of presentations.

If you have any questions, please contact Howard Fromer, chair of the ICAP
Working Group, John Charlton at the NYISO, or me.
