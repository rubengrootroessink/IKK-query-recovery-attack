Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on August 28, 2001.

Generation Supplier Issues --

Additional deliverables will be completed with the following
functionality added to the NYISO markets. Please refer to the
appropriate Technical Bulletin posted on the NYISO web site for
a complete and full description.

     Payment rules for unit start-up will be modified to allow
     a unit to receive start-up payments for both the Day Ahead
     and the Real-time market provided the unit is economically
     qualified and is scheduled in both markets.  This change is
     pending approval by the Business Issues Committee at its
     August 23, 2001 meeting.

     Payment rules for unforced energy replacement will also be
     modified.  Suppliers scheduled to provide energy or ancillary
     services to the NYISO marketplace may be eligible to recover
     their Day Ahead margins if insufficient revenue is realized
     to cover such costs.

     Uninstructed Over-generation will be allowed such that
     off-dispatch generating units will be allowed to follow
     economic base points and be paid for such deviations above
     their base points provided those deviations are economically
     consistent.

Lost Opportunity Cost Payments --

     These payments will be applied for the period from May 30, 2000
     through November 8, 2000 as defined by FERC order issued
     April 2, 2001.

System Changes (as ordered by FERC to expand mitigation rules for New York
City generating units) --

     Payments resulting from the Security Constrained Unit Commitment
     (SCUC), including minimum generation, start-up and energy payments
     for all in-City generation may be mitigated.

     Payments resulting from Supplemental Resource Evaluation (SRE)
     commitment, including minimum generation, start-up and energy
     payments for all in-City generation may be mitigated.

     Mitigation measures may also be applied to energy, start-up and
     minimum generation payments made to units operated out-of-merit (OOM)
     in Real-Time for all in-City generation.

Additional Changes --

     Market Participants will be allowed to query the Customer Relations
     Help Desk system from the NYISO web site.  This will allow
participants
     to check on the status of their current questions and review their
     historical questions/issues with the NYISO.

     A new menu option will be available on the Bidding and Scheduling
     page.  The 'Daily Transaction Summary' report will show the status of
     all transactions for a user and their requested and scheduled MW's.

     A new Upload/Download template will be created that will give Market
     Participants access to specific billing data down to the 5-minute
level
     level of granularity.

     The migration of web postings from InfoReports to MrXML will continue.
     The structure of all migrated reports will be retained, therefore,
these
     changes will be transparent to the user.



If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with us
about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations
