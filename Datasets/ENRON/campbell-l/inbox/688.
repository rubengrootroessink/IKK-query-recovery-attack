Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on July 31, 2001.


The Generation Supplier Issues development project
will be completed with the following functionality
being introduced into the NYISO markets (Please see
published Technical Bulletins for full descriptions):

   Units will be able to operate as Energy Limited
   Resources (ELR). Qualifying units whose schedules
   are modified will not be subjected to any financial
   harm from the obligation to cover energy balancing
   charges.

   Units will be able to operate as Capacity Limited
   Resources (CLR). Bid rules will be modified to allow
   units to indicate an upper MW limit, separate from
   the Upper Operating Limit (UOL), that will be honored
   in the scheduling horizon by SCUC, BME and SCD under
   certain environmental and operating situations.

   Multiple response rates will be allowed. This modification
   is intended to encourage units to be on dispatch by
   allowing units to move in response to price signals. MIS
   will be modified to allow up to three response rate ranges
   to be entered as static data inputs.

   Payment rules for start-up will be modified.

   Payment rules for unforced energy replacement will be
   modified.

Changes to SCUC will be deployed to optimize Phase Angle
Regulators (PARs) for evaluation of the Day Ahead Market (DAM).

The migration of web postings from InfoReports to MrXML will
continue with the replacement of a number of reports with
those generated using the new technology (please note that
the structure of all migrated reports will be retained).
