Attachment A of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, as posted, states that on
September 28, 2001 the NYISO will inform ICAP Suppliers of the amount of
Unforced Capacity they are qualified to offer in the 2001-2002 Winter
Capability Period. It also states that LSEs will be notified of the final
Unforced Capacity requirements ("UCR") for the upcoming Obligation
Procurement Period.  Neither statement is correct and a revised Timeline is
available for comment. It will be discussed and finalized at the next ICAP
Working Group Meeting on October 5.  After that October 5 meeting, the
updated and corrected Timeline will be posted for approval at the October
25 BIC Meeting.

Providing firm final ICAP Supplier UCAP values or LSE UCRs was never
feasible in this timeframe.  Preliminary LSE UCRs for November were
provided to all LSEs on September 21.  Final LSE UCRs will be provided on
October 9.

ICAP Suppliers can estimate their UCAP value based information already
supplied. All ICAP Suppliers will have a firm UCAP value for November prior
to October 9, if there are no problems with the data submitted and in time
to participate in the Monthly Auction to be conducted on October 11. In the
meantime, Suppliers can offer as much or as little UCAP for the Winter
Capability Period strip auction as they expect to have available,
recognizing that their EFORd values will be updated monthly during the
Capability Period.  Recognize also that there will continue to be Monthly
and Deficiency auctions conducted each month during the Capability Period,
allowing any Supplier or LSE to clear any long or short postions.
