New! Build and Save Customized Streamer
 Desktops
Dear Larry Campbell,
Now Streamer
 real-time quotes can be as individual as you are - each 
and every time you log on to trade. 
Our new Quick Launch feature  lets you load, arrange and save your 
favorite Streamer
 screens onto your desktop. Customize these screens 
to fit your trading preferences. Save what you like and you'll save 
valuable time by returning to your favorite screen every time you 
open Streamer
. 
In addition, we've developed Streamer
 Actives . This applet lists the 
10 most active stocks within parameters you choose. Choose your 
criteria, time interval and market - The Island ECN
 or activity among 
Datek customers - and Streamer
 Actives does the rest! 
Datek Elite customers like you can take advantage of exclusive new 
Streamer
 capabilities. Streamer
 News * offers you real-time market 
information from some of the same sources that Wall Street 
professionals rely on. And as a Datek Elite customer, your stock 
lists will now accommodate twice as many stocks as before - up to 40 
stocks each! 
Looking to save screen space? You can do so with smaller font 
sizes and resizable applets, or use Streamer
 hotkeys - back by 
popular demand. 
You can access all these features on the Streamer 3.0 Console . 
As always, if you have any questions regarding your account, please 
contact Datek Elite Customer Support at elite@datek.com  or call us 
at 1-866-40-ELITE (1-866-403-4583) from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. ET every 
trading day. 
Sincerely, 
John J. Mullin 
President 
Datek Online Financial Services LLC www.datek.com
