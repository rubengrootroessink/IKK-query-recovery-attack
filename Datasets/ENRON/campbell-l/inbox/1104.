    They're known for taking their time between albums, but since the release  of Return to Saturn just last year, No Doubt has been working furiously to bring you Rock Steady--their best album yet!  In making the album, the band worked with Prince, William Orbit and Nellee Hooper and had to travel from Los Angeles  to Jamaica to London and back.   The upbeat sound on Rock Steady was influenced by after-show parties and Jamacian dance-hall CDs. And old fans of No Doubt will "no doubt" recognize traces of the band's original  ska sound--"Rocksteady" is the term used for the classic 1960s ska  music which preceded reggae.     	     No Doubt's first video, "Hey Baby," off their new album!  [IMAGE]   Exclusive No Doubt Interview!  [IMAGE]   Rock Steady hits stores on December 11th! Check out these great prices offered on Yahoo!
