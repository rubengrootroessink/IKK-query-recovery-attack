 must understand the business model and huge potential  in the Company?s va=
luation. GTEC develops, invests in, and operates  high technology related c=
ompanies in the US, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.  GTEC?s strateg=
y includes the internal development and operation of  subsidiaries within t=
he Company's corporate family, as well as investment in other  high technol=
ogy companies directly, and through other venture capital arrangements.  Th=
e Company's strategy also envisions and promotes opportunities for synergis=
tic  business relationships among all of the companies within its family.  =
 We believe  the Company story will get a lot of attention in the investmen=
t community in the  coming months, as China joins the WTO. GTEC is a brand-=
new publicly trading  company via a reverse/merger with Newagecities.com, I=
nc. (NACT). The Company?s  mission is to accelerate the success of technolo=
gy companies by acquisition and  development as evidenced by GTEC?s 2 recen=
t acquisitions. GTEC  has been growing at an exciting rate and the foundati=
on has been laid for spectacular  growth in its earnings and sales in the c=
oming quarters. In a world in which ?tech  companies are losing money? lurk=
s around every corner of the market, it?s  refreshing to find a technology =
company that offers real success for growth in  revenues and earnings.    C=
hina's  pending entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will generate=
  enormous opportunities within the service sector and give impetus  to the=
 country's already robust economic growth. The agreement on  China's WTO en=
try paves the way for China to join the world trade  body and opens up Chin=
a's economy to more foreign trade and investment  in sectors ranging from b=
anking and automobiles to telecommunications  and IT services and products.=
  A recent survey by the Ministry of the Information Industry showed  China=
's IT industry is robust, in sharp contrast to the slowdown  in the growth =
of the world's IT industry. Statistics show that the  sales volume of IT pr=
oducts for the past six months has reached  356.1 billion yuan (US$43 billi=
on) nationwide, up 28.3 percent over  the same period for the previous year=
. Registered Internet users  have exceeded 26 million in the country, an av=
erage annual increase  of 25 percent. It is estimated that China will spend=
 one trillion  yuan (US$120 billion) over the next five years to spur its i=
nformation  industry, according to a meeting of Ministry of Information Ind=
ustry  held in Beijing on October 6, 2001. China's information industry  is=
 to develop steadily, with its value added accounting for seven  percent of=
 the nation's gross domestic product by the year 2005,  said sources from t=
he ministry. Through 2005, the information industry  will become a major pi=
llar industry of the country. The Chinese  government will make great effor=
ts to push forward and give priority  to the application of information tec=
hnology as a way of boosting  economic and social development.     Recently=
,  GTEC?s subsidiary, entered into a distribution agreement  with Intel Cor=
poration (INTC), Cyrix and Advanced Micro Devices,  Inc. (AMD). Under the t=
erms of the agreement, GTEC?s  subsidiary has exclusive distribution rights=
 for Intel CPU and AMD  CPUs in the eastern part of China. GTEC has also be=
en awarded  the exclusive distribution rights for Cyrix's CPU in Shanghai. =
The  Eastern part of China is believed to have the most dynamic economy  in=
 the greater China marketplace.        VALUATION   A  penny stock with mult=
i-dollar potential: trading today for about  50 cents per share, but in our=
 opinion, has long-term potential  for huge gains. The stock may be one of =
the year's BIG surprises,  making its current status as an undiscovered sto=
ck a rare timing  opportunity for investors. Don't overlook this one! We no=
t  only consider GTEC an attractive "Emerging Growth Company,"  in our opin=
ion, but also a "Value Stock" in view of its  revenues and earnings its cur=
rent price is about $0.50 per share.  We believe that GTEC has targeted a c=
reative niche in a hot  sector.    One  way to value a company is to look a=
t its peers in the industry.  One public company listed on the OTCBB is pre=
tty much in the same  line of business as GTEC. It is the Hartcourt Compani=
es,  Inc. (OTCBB: HRCT) that has about $43.5 million market cap with  only =
$10 million in annualized revenues and losing money. Even  if GTEC were to =
trade at the same market cap as HRCT, GTEC  would then be valued at $1.90 p=
er share. If the stock trades  to its peer?s valuation ratios, such as PE a=
nd price to sales  ratios, GTEC should be valued at about $6 per share. HRC=
T  has a HUGE following on Raging Bull (over 165,000 messages). GTEC  has v=
irtually NONE (slightly over 100 posts). In our opinion  UNDERVALUED AND OV=
ERLOOKED.   The  GTEC acquisition/spin-off schedule in 2002 should add a  c=
onsiderable number of technology companies. According to management,  this =
will bring the projected revenue of GTEC by fiscal  2003 to $75 million and=
 net income of $12.4 million or earnings  per share of $0.41 on the basis o=
f 30 million shares outstanding  GTEC intends to acquire other business?s b=
y issuing  restricted stock). If GTEC were to trade in the marketplace  at =
15 times earnings, then this would value GTEC at $6.15  per share. If GTEC =
were to trade in the marketplace at  3 times sales, this would value GTEC a=
t $7.50 per share.  (HRCT trades today at about 4.5 times annualized sales)=
.          SUMMARY   We  believe GTEC is well positioned to take advantage =
of the  changes in the technology industry. We believe these changes are  s=
till in their earliest stages, affecting primarily the small technology  co=
mpanies to date. In other words, we believe GTEC is situated  nicely to rid=
e out the slowing domestic economy. In our opinion,  we don't see much down=
side for GTEC that is traded around  $0.50 per share.   [IMAGE]    Disclaim=
