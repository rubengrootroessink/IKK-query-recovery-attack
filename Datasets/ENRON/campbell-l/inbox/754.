As part of our on going effort to streamline the ICAP process, we are
implementing a
new method and form for the monthly ICAP certification process.  Starting
with the August 24, certification
date please use the attached form.  Both Suppliers and LSEs will use the
same form thus eliminating
two forms for those who buy and sell ICAP.  Also, the forms will not longer
be faxed to our office.
We are requiring that you password protect the workbook and email it to us.
Your password will be the
same one you are currently using for bid and offer forms.  If you do not
have a password, please contact
Serena Barrett or myself and one will be issued to you.

It is important that you read the legal page in the workbook.

Please review the workbook spreadsheet "List Page" and find your company's
8 character registrant name.
If you do not find your company or the name of a company you do ICAP
business with please contact me.
Starting with the winter strip auction your 8 character registrant name
will also be your new registrant name
for bid and offer forms.

Attached are three workbooks.  The one you will use monthly is blank and
ready for use.
The other two were developed as examples to answer your basic questions.
Please contact me by email if you have any questions.

Regards,
Bob Boyle
