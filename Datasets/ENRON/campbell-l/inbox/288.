The  rescheduling of the October Reconfiguration Auction of TCCs due to the
events
of September 11th has produced some unanticipated consequences.  The NYISO
will  not be able to post the results of Round 3 of the Initial Autumn 2001
TCC
Auction  as  scheduled.   The  results of Round 3 will be posted by noon on
Monday,
September  24,  2001.   The  Bidding Period for Round 4 of the auction will
commence
on Tuesday, September 25, 2001 at 8:00 AM and continue to 9:00 PM Eastern
Standard  Time.   The  Bidding  Period has been extended to provide auction
participants
additional time to assess their Bidding strategy.

The  remainder  of  the schedule for the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction is
unchanged.
