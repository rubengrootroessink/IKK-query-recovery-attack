Dear Sports Fan,

At Betquick, we allow any sports combination in a parlay.
You can mix and match up to 6 different sports teams in
a parlay.  You can even parlay a Golf match-up with a
football team or whatever team you desire.

We also offer the following:

 1. Post several straight bets with one click of the
    confirm button.

 2. Make an If-Win bet.
    Example: If my parlay or straight bet wins bet the
    following...

 3. Reverse bets

 4. Round Robin or Box

 And much, much more...

If that's not enough, we will add 15% to your deposit to
try our fully licensed online sportsbook. This offer is
good until September 6, 2001.

Sincerely,
Roger Dunhill
