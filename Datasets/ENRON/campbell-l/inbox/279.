Attached is a revised presentation from Norman Mah for the Sept. 24 ICAP
Working Group meeting. The presentation is three pages long. The change made
in this version is on page 2: the "O&M" number has been lowered to $22,000
from the previous version, in response to comments received by Mr. Mah.
Otherwise, the presentation mirrors the one previously circulated.
