advanced online investing tools. As an active Datek Elite customer, 
you are invited to participate in our product development by trying 
out Streamer
 News* -- our new real-time streaming market news service. 
You can capitalize on this new information resource from now until 
December 31, 2001. 
We've developed Streamer News to provide the individual investor with 
real-time market information from some of the same sources that Wall 
Street professionals rely on. Using Streamer News can help you 
anticipate market movements to make more-informed investing decisions 
-- which is as important as ever in the current economic climate. And, 
as you use the product over the next few months, we'd appreciate your 
valuable feedback. Look forward to the User Survey we'll be sending 
you before the end of the year. 
?  The same information professional brokers use. Streamer News, 
   gives you access to real-time information from Dow Jones 
   Newswires** and Reuters** -- information that was once only 
   available to Wall Street professionals. 
?  Customized to your needs. With Streamer News you determine which 
   news items you'd like to see by selecting the level of information 
   you want. "All News" gives you live Reuters and Dow Jones 
   Newswires items. "Hot News" provides important information that 
   may impact the market. You can receive news about stocks on all of 
   your personalized Streamer lists, or an individual Streamer list. 
   Or you can focus on news that concerns a handful of stocks you 
   select. Adjust the level of information as often as you like. 
?  Access it now. You don't have to do anything to respond to this 
   offer -- you can start using Streamer News right now by following
