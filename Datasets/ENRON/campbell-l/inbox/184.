Dear Larry Campbell:
All of us at Datek share with the country the sense of extreme loss 
and shock created by the terrorist events that happened earlier this 
week. It was a defining moment in U.S. history. As the time of healing 
begins, Datek joins all Americans in extending our sympathies to the 
victims and their families, and in supporting all efforts to make this 
country whole again. 
Rest assured that your Datek account and the capital market system is 
secure, and that the assets you have invested with us remain fully 
protected. Datek stands ready to serve your needs when the U.S. equity 
markets reopen in the next few days. 
On Tuesday, we shut down our call center shortly after the New York 
attacks. The location of our Jersey City headquarters--directly across 
the Hudson River from the World Financial Center--quickly made us a 
staging area for the area's massive rescue and re-supply efforts. Our 
call center was converted into a location where the rescued or injured 
were able to contact family and loved ones, and we transformed our 
building into a safe haven for victims of the disaster, as well as a 
command center for hundreds of brave rescue workers. 
Countless Datek employees volunteered to pitch in whenever, 
wherever and however they could. Like so many other good Americans, 
they demonstrated their solidarity with the victims and their 
families by supporting the live-saving and life-affirming efforts 
of local authorities. 
There are a few things that you should be aware of related to your 
online account with Datek and equities trading in general: 
?  The U.S. equity markets will reopen on Monday, September 17. 
?  The ability to place orders in your account will be available well 
   in advance of the market opening. 
?  All pre-market executed orders on September 11 will stand and be 
   cleared. 
?  All unexecuted day orders placed on September 11 will be canceled. 
?  All GTC orders will remain good orders until you cancel them. 
?  Any orders that you cancelled over the phone on September 12 and 
   September 13 may still appear in your account as open orders. 
   However, Datek will cancel these orders before the market 
   re-opens. 
?  All margin calls due on September 10 will be due when the market 
   re-opens. 
?  Any checks written against Datek accounts will be honored. 
?  All valid check, wire or Funds Now requests made after 2:00 PM EST 
   September 10 will be paid. 
As always, Datek Customer Service representatives are ready to assist 
you. If you have any questions about your account or Datek's 
capabilities, please call us at 1-800-U2-Datek (1-800-823-2835) or 
e-mail us at support@datek.com . 
Our leaders have told us that the best way to beat back terrorism is 
by maintaining our composure and way of life in the face of barbarism. 
We were privileged to be able to play a role as the nation responded 
to this cowardly attack. Datek and our colleagues in the securities 
industry stand ready to continue to provide for the most respected and 
stable financial markets in the world. We appreciate your patience as 
Datek, the industry, and the nation return to normalcy. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with all those affected by these tragic events. 
Sincerely, 
Ed Nicoll
