Having worked the same shift schedule that the ISO uses, I have something new to
ponder. Assuming Senior Shift Operator "A" was on day shift Mon/Tues and SSO "B
" was on day shift for Wed/Thurs. The results of the Real Time prices/ uplift
were dramatically different from SSO "A "to SSO "B"( Mon and Tues were very
similar and Wed very different) If all things being nearly the same, could the
operating philosophies of the two SSO's contributed to a very divergent economic
results? When the ISO does its post mortem (bad choice of words) on the high
load days, do they look at the operating philosophies of the operators to see if
they impact economics? When I say "philosophies",  I am  NOT referring to the
security decisions only on how the solving of the security constraints could be
different enough to have two totally different economic impacts. Further back
pedaling, without knowing the outages or Bid stacks etc, I am only asking if the
ISO looks at this kind of thing when they do their evaluation. Ponder away...
