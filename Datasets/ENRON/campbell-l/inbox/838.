Dear Market Participants:

This is a message that will be posted each month as a request from market
participants who attended the last Billing & Accounting Workshop.  The
suggestion
was to have a simple statement posted to the web letting each customer know
that
the last version for each billing day of the month has been posted.  In the
future this
will simply be "The latest versions of advisory statements have been posted
to each
customer's web site for the billing month of mmm/yyyy."

If you have any questions please contact customer relations at
518-356-6060.
