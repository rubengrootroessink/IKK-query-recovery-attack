Dear Market Participant,

Technical Bulletin # 72  - Bringing units that have missed at least
one BME cycle back on-line after a trip - is being distributed for

in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.
