As promised. Here is what I have learned.

I spoke with Judge Young earlier today and was told that entities that
are not yet intervenors in the Northeast RTO proceeding may attend the
meeting next Tuesday. Initially, the Judge will poll parties present as
to their status. Those that are already intervenors in the underlying
dockets need do nothing more, they are considered intervenors to the
RT01-99 proceeding already. Those who are not already intervenors will
be admitted as parties, provided there are no objections. If there are
any objections, the objecting party(ies) and the party seeking
admittance will be given a brief opportunity to state their cases and
the Judge will issue a ruling.

As to filing for party status with the Commission, it is still not clear
(and the Judge did not provide guidance) whether parties should file "in
time" in docket RT01-99 or "out of time" in one of the underlying RTO
dockets. The safest bet might be to file under both. In either case, the
mediation process may well be concluded before FERC acts on such
intervention requests. Thus, attending the meeting and resolving party
status at that time would seem to provide the quickest, surest answer.
However, I'm not a lawyer and that is not legal advice.... ;-)

Finally, my understanding is that, regardless of how many days the rooms
are reserved for, the meeting next week is for two days only, Tuesday
and Wednesday. The substance of the mediation meetings, once
interventions are sorted out, will be to develop a business plan,
milestones and timeline -- in short a process -- for developing a region
wide RTO. It does not appear that substantive answers to the myriad
issues surrounding the move to a Northeast RTO are likely to be sought
during the mediation period.

Hopefully this is helpful for you.
