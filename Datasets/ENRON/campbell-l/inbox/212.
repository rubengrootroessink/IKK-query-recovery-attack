a poodle is a poodle indeed!  the displays of patriotism are just peoples'
way of showing support, pride, and love of one's country.  hell, my 72 yrs
old papa wanted to do the candle thing...then line up 50 terrorist and
shooting them in the heads!  he said he would love to be able to help fight
the afghans!  just bc you wanna show or display symbols of patriotism,
doesn't mean that's the ONLY thing you're willing to do.  not just anyone is
gonna be allowed to help search for missing victims...only certain ones are
allowed.  others can only show their support by donating $$$ for the families
of survivors and rescue workers (mark cuban gave a million bucks), donating
supplies & blood.  people here were waiting up to 8 hrs just to donate
blood....sheit, that means something in my book.  sure, we're fat and happy
about an extended time of peace and prosperity....but i think the fat cat can
still swing the bat.  just give it some time my european canine...give the
texan a chance to lead and the people a chance to follow.  after all, that
dude leading us be from the RIGHT side of POLITIX
