In light of the tragic events in New York City and Washington, DC, there is a national call for blood donations.  Enron is taking two actions:

	1.	The City of Houston is sponsoring a city-wide blood drive at the George R. Brown Convention Center today.  For your convenience, Enron is providing transportation to and from the Convention Center from 9am-3pm.  Transportation will be leaving from the Enron Building every half hour.  We have been informed that there is a 3 - 4 hour wait.  

	2.	Enron's regularly scheduled blood drive is being held on Thursday, September 13, from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m.  Two mobile units from the M. D. Anderson Blood Center will be parked outside the Enron Building on Andrews Street to accommodate donors.  Call the Enron Health Center at ext. 3-6100 to schedule an appointment.  Information regarding Enron's blood drive program and eligibility criteria is location on the Wellness webpage http://hrweb.enron.com/wellness/healthService/bloodDrive.asp 

Our latest information is that three busloads of Enron employees have already been taken to the Convention Center and many of you have already scheduled appointments for Thursday.  We commend all of you for your community spirit.
