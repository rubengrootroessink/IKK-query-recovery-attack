Dear J.Crew Customer,

From September 12th-16th, 2001, J.Crew is offering a 20% discount
on everything in our stores and online at jcrew.com.  Check out
our new fall selection - great styles  that you can wear any place,
any time...from a business meeting to a casual dinner.

To find your invitation, please visit the following URL, that you may
forward to family, friends, and colleagues.

Here's the fine print: To receive the 20% discount, simply print the
e-mail/invite (please remember that you must have it in order to
receive the discount) and present it to the cashier at any of our
stores. Or, if you prefer to receive your discount online at
jcrew.com, you can simply enter the code "CORP901" in the
"redeem coupon" box on the first checkout page. Please note
that this discount does not apply to online clearance items,
or in our catalog.

In addition to special shopping events such as this, J.Crew also has...
Corporate Sales, where you can get discounts on large-quantity orders
of apparel and gift cards, personalized with your company's name or
logo.  No matter where you work, we've got you covered, from workwear
to business casual. (After all, what you do from 9 to 5 is your
business. What you wear is ours.) To request a catalog or for more
information, visit us at jcrew.com/crewcorp.

any questions, feel free to contact me directly at (212) 209-8301.

Best regards,

Stephanie Garbarini
Director of Brand Marketing
