The ICAP Working Group under the New York State Reliability Council
("NYSRC") is posting this message to inform all interested parties of the
ability to attend in person or participate, on a "listen-only" basis, in
the NYSRC ICAP Working Group's Meeting No. 16 scheduled for October 17,
2001, starting at 9:30A.M. at the ISO's Washington Avenue extension.
Attached in Word format is the Agenda for this meeting.   The NYSRC has
opened its Committee, Subcommittee, and Working Group meetings in
accordance with NYSRC Policy No. 2,
http://www.nysrc.org/tcweb/pdf/Policy%202-3%20Final.pdf.

Those who plan on attending the meeting in person are requested to contact
me at least seven (3) days in advance of the meeting (by at least October
14th) by sending me an email at mhogan@cenhud.com, with the names of the
individuals & organizations attending.  Meeting space will be available on
a first-come, first-served basis due to the space limitations of the
conference rooms.

Those wishing to participate on a "listen-only" basis can call
608-250-9675, and enter Participant Code 379864.  Participants will be
required to place their telephones on mute so as not to prevent other
parties from participating.  Those who plan on listening to the meeting
shall send an email to my attention at mhogan@cenhud.com with the names of
the individuals & organizations participating.

Attendees who are not NYSRC Executive Committee Members or Alternate
Members will be given an opportunity to comment at the end of the Open
Session of each meeting, or earlier at the Chairman's invitation.

Should you have any questions, please contact me by email at
mhogan@cenhud.com or by phone at (845) 486-5213.
