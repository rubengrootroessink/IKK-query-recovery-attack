Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Greetings,

Monday FERC issued an order indicating that it is giving itself some
more time to decide the NYISO's petition for rehearing of the RTO Order.
Absent the order, the petition would have been deemed rejected by
operation of law. FERC indicates that it intends to render a decision by
October 31.

See

Also, please see the note below and consider passing it along to your
friends and loved ones.

Thanks
Aaron
