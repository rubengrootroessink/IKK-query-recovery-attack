AUGUST BIRTHSTONE: PERIDOT
=============================
Today's birthstone for August, peridot was also a favorite of
the ancients.  This lovely transparent yellowish green to deep
chartreuse stone was quite a powerful gem.  It was considered
an aid to friendship and was also believed to free the mind of
envious thoughts.  Because of its yellowish color, it was also
believed to cure or prevent diseases of the liver and dropsy.
And if that's not enough, if worn on the left arm it would
protect the wearer from the evil eye.

Peridot is also popular today, but probably more for its
lovely shade of green than its professed powers.  While not
particularly brilliant, the richness of the is color can be
exceptional.  It comes in shades of yellowish green to darker,
purer green colors.  Unfortunately, because of its rarity
most people never see peridot in the deeper, purer green color
that is so prized.

Some caution should be exercised in wearing peridot.  It is not
a very hard stone and may scratch easily.  Also, some stones-
like green sapphire or green tourmaline-can look like peridot
and be mistaken or misrepresented.


THE DIAMOND MARKETPLACE
============================
In diamond bridal jewelry, the current demand is for:
* G-H color and SI-VS clarity
* Sizes form 1-1.5 carats and over 2 carats
* Round brilliants and princess cuts
* Ideal cuts


FAMOUS DIAMOND PEOPLE: DIAMOND JIM BRADY (1856-1917)
=====================================================
"Them that has 'em wears 'em," said Diamond Jim Brady, a man
who did much to popularize diamonds in the United States.
Born poor, honest, and Irish, James Buchanan Brady was a
salesman of extraordinary abilities.  During the "Gay
Nineties," when American railroads were expanding across
the continent, Brady made a fortune estimated at more than
#10 million selling railroad cars.  During World War I, he
sold 38,000 cars to the French government in one sale.

Brady had a different set of monogrammed jewelry for every
day of the month, including a "Transportation Set" comprised
of a jewelled rail car, tank car, and caboose studded with
2,548 diamonds and other precious stones.  He personally
owned more than 20,000 diamonds, and sometimes wore
$25,000 in jewelry on single day (a fortune in that day).

When he died, Brady's will left a few of his most
elaborate pieces of jewelry to long-time friends.  The rest
of his fortune went to charity.


DIAMOND COPYCATS
=============================================
Cubic zirconia dates to 1937, when two German mineralogists
discovered the cubic form of zirconium oxide. Soviet
scientists learned how to "grow" this mineral in a laboratory
in the 1970s, and Swarovski & Co. began producing it for
mass consumption in the 1980s. As it became more widely
available, CZ quickly became popular with jewelry designers.
New developments have led to a sparkling array of CZ in every
color imaginable.

Though cubic zirconia looks like diamond, there are some
noticeable differences. CZ has slightly less brilliance than
diamond and a hardness of 8.5 on the Mohs scale [diamond is
10]. CZ is 75% heavier and, because it's grown in a
controlled environment, a crystal isn't used if it's not
perfect.

Moissanite was discovered in 1893 when Nobel-prize-winning
scientist Henri Moissan uncovered minute quantities of a
new mineral from a meteorite that crashed thousands of years
before. In the late 1980s, Cree Research, Durham, NC,
developed a way to produce moissanite crystals in a lab. In
1995, a master diamond cutter discovered that when cut
properly, created moissanite crystals could look like diamond.
Moissanite's color is comparable to I-J-K colors of diamond,
is 9.5 on the Mohs scale and has a refractive index of 2.648-
2.691 (diamond is 2.417), dispersion of 0.104 (diamond is
0.044) and specific gravity of 3.21 (diamond is 3.52).

IDEAL CUT
===================
An Ideal Cut round brilliant diamond is one which is cut
to a specific range of proportions (Ideal proportions) and
also has an Ideal (0) grade for both polish and symmetry.
This has been defined by the American Gem Society Labs. as
the top, or zero grade, in their grading system. Diamonds
attaining this grade are sometimes referred to as AGS000
(AGS triple zero's). The proper grade, however, is simply
AGS0 (AGS zero). This cut grade has also come to be called
the "American Ideal Cut" based on its acceptance in this
country.  A true AGS triple zero or triple ideal is a diamond
where the proportion (cut), polish and symmetry are all
at the top (zero) grade.

Unfortunately, the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)
does not provide a cut grade in its grading report. They
provide only the table % and total depth % for the stone.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine the individual
contributions of the crown, girdle and pavilion to the total
depth and no crown or pavilion angles are given. In order
to determine if a GIA-graded diamond meets the AGS Ideal (0)
grade for proportion, it is necessary to measure the stone
for all the missing data. Fortunately, this can be done quite
quickly and easily using an automated proportion analyzer
called a "SARIN" (after the Co. which produces it) whose s
oftware can be programmed to AGS specifications. Thus, since
GIA grades of Excellent for polish and symmetry are considered
equivalent to the AGS Ideal grades, a GIA-graded diamond can,
with a Sarin analysis give as much information as an AGS
grading report. This information is important in making an
informed buying decision.


FANCY COLORED DIAMONDS
==============================================
The GIA grades the saturation of color by 9 different verbal
categories. They are: Faint, Very Light, Light, Fancy Light,
Fancy, Fancy Dark, Fancy Intense, Fancy Deep and Fancy Vivid.
Normally, Faint, Very Light, and Light in sizes under three
carats are not considered exceptional enough to pay premiums
for. To collect or mount in jewelry, these stones will often
trade in the same ranges as nice white diamonds. Often
mounting a stone in these saturation categories will "kill"
the color. Light pink and blue in a larger stone may be
desirable, if, and only if, the stone doesn't turn white when
mounted. Diamond dealers often refer to these color categories
as those you "have to read the certificate to find the color".
Generally avoid these stones unless you are looking at eye
clean 5-15 carat "light" pinks or blues. They will be expensive
stones.

The rarest and most valuable colored diamonds are vibrant reds.
In fact,  one of the highest per-carat prices ever paid for a
diamond was for a purplish red stone weighing just over
0.95 carats.  Sold at auction in 1987,  this fiery beauty
brought an astounding  $926,000 per carat.  More recently,  a
5.11 carat red diamond is rumored to have sold privately for
$8 million.  However,  not all fancy colored diamonds sell for
such colorful prices  (please excuse the pun).


PLATINUM AS A JEWELRY METAL
====================================
Throughout the world, platinum jewelry is made in a purity
of at least 85 per cent platinum, and in Europe and the USA,
95 per cent is the norm. Other platinum group metals -
palladium, ruthenium and iridium - and copper and cobalt are
commonly alloyed with platinum to optimize its working
characteristics and wear properties.

One of the main advantages of platinum for jewelry
fabrication is its strength and resistance to tarnish. It can
be repeatedly heated and cooled without hardening and
oxidation effects, while even the most slender sections of
platinum permanently retain their shape, providing a secure
setting for diamonds and giving jewelry designers a freedom
of invention not always possible with other materials. Perhaps
the best example of platinum's technical virtuosity is the
tension ring, in which a gemstone is held in place by the
tensile strength of the platinum ring shank alone.

Platinum does make certain demands on the jeweler's skills.
It requires high temperature melting and casting equipment
(pure platinum melts at 1769'C) and a scrupulously clean
working environment. Careful attention to polishing technique
is needed to achieve the highly reflective finish which shows
a diamond or other precious stone at its best.


ONLINE SPENDING TRENDS
====================================
Though Internet users are spending more time at retail sites,
online spending is down. Forrester Research reported online
spending fell to $3.2 billion in June from $3.9 billion in
May. Online shoppers spent an average of $245 per person
online in June, a decrease of $20 from May.

Internet usage overall, however, is up. Neilson/NetRatings
reported 58% of U.S. households, nearly 102 million
households, are online. In July, Internet users spent an
average of 10 hours and 19 minutes online, up 7% from a year
earlier. The growth in Internet use, Neilson/NetRatings
reports, is driven by late adopters and more aggressive use
from the enormous Internet population.

While there has been a drop in online jewelry sales the
past several months compared to last year, forecaster
agree that online jewelry sales will outpace the growth of
consumer e-commerce as a whole in the next three years. As
customers gain experience and here more success stores about
online diamond and jewelry buying, their increased
confidence translates into increased sales.


BLACK DIAMONDS: HOT TREND BUT BE CAREFUL
=================================================
Black diamonds are not new.  They have been a curiosity for
centuries, but is a recent new trend for jewelry.  They are
typically opaque, very heavily included, often with surface
reaching inclusions and fractures that mar desirability.
They are also very difficult to cut, so you often find them
in poor makes.  Buyers need to be aware that most of the
black diamonds currently being used in jewelry is treated
and not natural.  There is nothing wrong with using
treated black diamonds as long as you are told they are
treated and you pay the appropriate price, as opposed to
the more expensive natural black diamonds.

Since the natural black diamonds are so hard to cut, melee
sizes used in pave work is almost always treated.  Here are
some simple test for determining natural versus treated.
* Under strong light, treated diamonds have edges that
appear deep brown rather than black
* When the surface is examined with a 10x loupe, treated
diamonds seem spotty or the color is uneven
* When tested with a electronic diamond tester, treated
black diamonds generally are indicated as "not diamond."

While the treated black diamond is in fact a diamond,
the electronic diamond tester indicates it is not because
during the treatment, the material becomes very electrically
conductive.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
