Save 30% or more 

    Dear  Amazon.com Customer,  As  someone who's purchased books in the past, you might  be interested to learn that we've just lowered prices  in our bookstore. Now you can save  30%  or more on books  over $20 (unless clearly  marked otherwise)--that's at least $6 off every  title.  Choose  from  tons  of popular titles  throughout the store--whether  you're into Business & Investing, Computers  & Internet, Biographies & Memoirs (that's  me), Home & Garden, Literature & Fiction  (my wife loves that one), Reference, or Health,  Mind & Body, you'll save 30% or more on great  books in every category. So check out our  bookstore   today and take advantage of our new, lower prices  on books over $20.  Happy  book-shopping, Steve Kessel Steve  Kessel General Manager of Books, Music, DVD and  Video Amazon.com       [IMAGE]Search  for  more  All Products  Electronics Books ToolsMusic DVD VHS WirelessOutdoor Living Kitchen Software Video Games Toys Outlet Auctions zShops
