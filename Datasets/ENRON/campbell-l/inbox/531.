Dear Market Participants,

Due to the outage of the NYISO website today (October 16, 2001), the
following
changes originally scheduled for implementation today have been rescheduled
for
October 30, 2001.

1) Deployment of BEA's WebLogic application server.

2) Data postings for real-time internal transmission flows and limits.

3) Transmission line scheduled and actual outages.

In addition, the MIS outage scheduled for October 17, 2001 at 11:35 AM
