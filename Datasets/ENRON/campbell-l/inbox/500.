The NYISO requires additional time to reconcile settlement balances for the
January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment.  As a result, issuances of invoices
for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment are being delayed.  It is
anticipated that invoices for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment
will be posted by 23:00, Monday, October 15, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes
for any inconveniences caused by this delay.
