THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK MEETING
Presentation by Economy.com


The NYISO Analysis & Planning Department is pleased
to announce the next Economic Outlook Meeting scheduled
for October 18, 2001. The meeting will be at the NYISO
facilities:

     290 Washington Avenue Extension
     Albany, NY 12203

There will be lunch at NOON. The meeting starts at
12.45 PM.

Dr. Celia Chen and Dr. Steve Cochran from Economy.com
will present the outlook for New York, Northeast and U.S.
economies. The meeting is open to any market participant
interested in attending.

I encourage market participants to attend this meeting
particularly given the current 'uncertainty' on where the
economy is heading. The presentations will cover a
broad range of issues, including:

?    will the interest rate cuts help?
?    was the tax cut sufficient, or 'timely?'
?    how are the New York metro economies doing?
?    the impact of the stock market on New York, and
?    what are the implications of the global economic
     slowdown to the U.S. economy?

The last meeting in March was vibrant and insightful.
I anticipate the same for the next one, so mark your
calendars. Also, send me any questions that you
would like to see addressed by Economy.com.
Preferably by September 28.

Please call me or send email to confirm your attendance.

Regards,

Will.
