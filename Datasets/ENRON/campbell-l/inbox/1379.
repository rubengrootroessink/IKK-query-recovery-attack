In an effort to reduce our speed to market, improve client satisfaction, and streamline the account setup process, we have made several changes to the process:

The Work Initiation Process will no longer be used to process new deals.
The Deal Sheet has been replaced with a new form, the Deal Ticket.  The Deal Ticket consists of a one-page data entry form and a data sheet that can be uploaded.  Enron owns the Deal Ticket and is responsible for revisions and updates.  A sample Deal Ticket is contained in the attached file.
Deal Tickets will be transferred from Enron to CSC's Order Provisioning team via the share drive (Enron's I: drive and CSC's L: drive).
This new process went into effect for Gas Mid Market deals on October 8.
The new process went into effect for Enron Direct on October 22.
Power Mid Market deals will launch in the coming weeks.
CSC will report the status of all deals in process to Enron.
All deals originally submitted through the Work Initiation Process will be stored there, and changes to those deals will continue to be process through that tool.

If you have any questions about the new Deal Setup Process, please call Tom Huson, Team Enron, at 713.345.5054.

The Business Center is the central point in EES for dealing with customer issues.  Given that role, the management and staff of CSC's Customer Call Center have established procedures to handle calls that come into the Business Center but require resolution by  CSC.  A "hot" hand-off procedure ensures that customers speak to the person who can resolve their question while still on the phone.  Together, the two groups are working hard to respond to customer inquires and problems in an ongoing effort to achieve
the highest level of customer satisfaction.




Two CSC teams were called to action as a result of the September 11th terrorists attack in New York.  On the morning of the attacks, approximately 40 CSC employees were at work at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Center, the closest hospital to New York's financial district.  CSC has an IT outsourcing contract with the medical center.  After the attack, CSC employees helped to set up an expanded receiving area for ambulances and emergency vehicle, transfer patients to the emergency room, and restock
emergency vehicles returning to the World Trade Center area with towels, sheets, saline solution, and masks.  They also helped to set up additional nurses' stations and round up stretchers and wheelchairs from throughout the facility.  By Wednesday, the team moved onto other roles by helping to setup and man telephone lines and collect patient information in an ad hoc database.  Some also volunteered at the information center that was setup for family and friends in search of information about their loved ones.

The Pinnacle Alliance team supports the J. P. Morgan Chase (JPMC) data centers.  Twenty CSC employees worked 24-hour shifts at the data centers located at 60 Wall Street using backup generators for power to maintain servers and telecommunications for JPMC's equities and markets business.  The team was able to access the impact and stabilize the technology infrastructure for the client's continued operation.  JPMC was one of the first financial firms to complete New York Stock Exchange testing over the
weekend of September 15.  On September 17, JPMC had its largest single day of trading without incident.
