Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign officially kicks off on Monday, August 6.  The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from you, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison.  You have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  

In response, each Enron business unit has dedicated one Day of Caring to assist their adopted United Way agency.  Your challenge is to support your business unit by volunteering for various service projects. As an added incentive, a little friendly competition between business units has been incorporated into the campaign.  Strive to be the business unit with the highest percentage of volunteers and you'll be recognized at the Appreciation Lunch on August 10th in Antioch Park.

Be on the lookout for more information about this campaign.  Your business unit Day of Caring representative will provide details about each project and coordinate team assignments.
