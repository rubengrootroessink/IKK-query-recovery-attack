On 8/15/2001 Market Participants will have (2) new billing codes in their
advisory statements.

(1)  Code 238, which currently exists in the hrly advisory statement, but
up until now it has been null.  Code 238 will now be 'Hrly LRR DAM Contract
Bal Pmnt $'.  This will reflect dollars paid to a generator for DAM
Contract Balancing that is Out-of-Merit for LRR.  Code 239 will reflect
dollars paid to a generator for DAM Contract Balancing and is not
Out-of-Merit for LRR.  The sum (238+239)=313, and 313 can be found under
the "Power Supplier" section of the daily advisory statement.

(2)  Code 314, this is a new addition that did not exist on the daily csv
file before.  Code 314 is 'ELR DAM Contract Balancing Payment $'.  There is
not an
hrly code for ELR DAM Contract Balancing because it is a daily settlement,
not an hrly settlement.

The funds that will be collected from the LSE's to pay for Code 313, and
Code 314 will be collected through the residual adjustment codes 611 (hrly)
and 813 (daily).

Version 14 of the data dictionary will reflect these new billing codes, and
this will be found on the NYISO website under Grid Accounting &
Settlements, just like the previous versions.

A new billing code mapping will also be available, and will be version 7,
and can also be found under the Grid Accounting & Settlements section on
the NYISO website.
