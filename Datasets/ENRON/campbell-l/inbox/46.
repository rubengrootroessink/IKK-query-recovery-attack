Dear Market Participants

Access to the Customer Resolution Tracking System is now live at:

http://www.nyiso.com/services/relations.html

This system will give Market Participants access to their open
(Current) and closed (historical) issues.  When accessing this
system through Internet Explorer, a security alert message will
appear each time the system is accessed.

To eliminate this message, please do the following:

1)  When Security Alert dialog appears, click on 'View Certificate'

2)  At the next dialog, click on 'Install Certificate'

3)  The Certificate Install Wizard will start.  Click on 'Next'

4)  Next dialog, click on 'Next'

5)  Next dialog, click on 'Finish'

6)  Click on Yes, when prompted.

7)  Click on OK

8)  In the Security Alert dialog, click on 'Yes'

The certificate for the Customer Resolution Tracking System is now
installed.  The security alerts are now eliminated.

For any further questions or comments, please contact your Customer
Relations representative or call the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.
