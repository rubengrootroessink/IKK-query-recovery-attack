It appears that the NYISO , who has obviously been allotted two HAM mulligans
for each reliability period, used them yesterday for the HB 16,17 Zonal HAM
results.  Cool! I particularly admire the part where they just quietly  left
them out figuring that  you wouldn't  notice 1300,1400.1500, 1800,1900 .

resent after 1/2 hr delay if you get this twice
