Hello everyone,

	We already have a winner in this week's football pool. Rudy Acevedo only missed 5 games and picked Minnesota in tonight's game, while the other people who missed 6 games, all picked Minnesota as well tonight. There were 21 people who played this week, making the prize $63. 

	Among the games widely missed were: in college, mainly just the Alabama/Auburn game; in the pros, Atlanta/Green Bay; NY Jets/Miami; Cleveland/Baltimore; Washington/Denver and Chicago/Tampa Bay. 

	With the short week this week, there will not be a pool this coming weekend. We will resume next week. Here are the amount of games missed by each person who played this week. 

	
											Andy
