Subject:  FW: Riddle from Paul Harvey

Here is a pretty neat little thing from  Paul Harvey.




See if you can guess the riddle at the  end.
Paul Harvey Writes: We tried so hard to  make things better for our kids
that
we made them worse. For my grandchildren,  I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down  clothes and homemade ice cream and
leftover meat loaf sandwiches, I really  would.
I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you learn honesty
bybeing  cheated.
I hope you learn to make your own bed and  mow the lawn and wash the car.
And
I really hope nobody gives you a brand new  car when you are sixteen.
It will be good if at least one time you  can see puppies born and your old
dog put to sleep.
I hope you get a black eye  fighting for something you believe in, I hope
you
have to share a bedroom with  your younger brother. And it's all right
ifyou
have to draw a line down the middle of the  room, but when he wants to
crawl
under the covers with you because he's  scared, I hope you let him.

 When  youwant to see a movie and your  little brother wants to tag along,
I hope  you'll let  him.
I hope you have to walk uphill to school  with your friends and that you
live
in a town where you can do it safely. On  rainy days when you have to catch
a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to  drop you two blocks away so you
won't be seen riding with someone as  uncool as your Mom. If you want a
slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how  to make one  instead of buying
one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and  read books.
When you learn to use computers, I hope  you also learn to add and subtract
in your head.

I hope you get teased by your  friends when you have your first crush on a
girl, and when you talk back to your  mother that you learn what ivory soap
tastes like.

May you skin your knee  climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
>stick your tongue on a  frozen flagpole.

I don't care if you try a beer once, but I  hope you don't like it. And if
a
friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope  you realize he is not your
friend.
I sure hope you make time to  sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go
fishing with your  Uncle.
May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.
I hope your mother punishes you when you  throw a baseball through your
neighbor's window and that she hugs you  and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your  hand. These things I wish for you
-
tough times and disappointment, hard work  and happiness.  To me, it's the
only way to appreciate life. Written with  a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm
here for you.  And if I die before  you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for
you. Paul Harvey

When asked this riddle, 80% of  kindergarten kids got the answer, compared
to
17% of Stanford University  seniors.

What is greater than God,  More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
rich need it, and if you eat  it, you'll die?
>Send this to 10 people and then push  the shift key, it will give you the
answer. P.S. You wont believe this, but  this really does give you the
answer!!
