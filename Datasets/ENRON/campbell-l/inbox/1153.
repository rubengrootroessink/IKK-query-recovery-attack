Attached is a draft report on the impact to the pipeline companies of Engine MACT regulations which are scheduled to be promulgated early next year.  I have used various company databases and industry contacts to classify all engines as rich-burn or lean-burn.  Please review this information and let me know if you agree/disagree with the classifications or if engines are missing.  Please share this information with others on your teams.  Call (402-398-7716) or email me with ANY comments.  I'd like to have an accurate understanding of all the pipeline systems when the regulations are proposed.

Ruth Jensen
Manager, Air Programs
