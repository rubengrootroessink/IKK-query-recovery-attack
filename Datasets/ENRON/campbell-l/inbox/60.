RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Upon review of August 25, 2001 advisory billing statements you will observe
significant balances for Transmission Customer Ancillary Services: Residual
Adjustments.  This is due to the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd that
contains their sub-zonal load data.  When this file is not received for use
in the billing process, the billing system sees the ConEd subzones with NO
load in real time.  This causes all DAM LSE purchases and scheduled
transaction energy with ConEd points of withdrawal to be sold back to the
market in real time.  The deficiency in revenue is shared by all through
the residual adjustment.  We have received the missing file and intend to
rerun August 25th this evening.  The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience
caused by this problem.
