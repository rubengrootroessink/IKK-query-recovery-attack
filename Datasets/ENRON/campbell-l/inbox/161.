Dear Market Participants:

Due to today's unfortunate incidents in New York City and the rest of the
country and the resulting high level of internet traffic, some Market
Participants have reported problems submitting their bids and seeing their
schedules over the internet. This is not a problem with the NYISO markets,
which are functioning normally.  If you experience any communication
problems, we encourage you to contact your NYISO customer account
representative or the NYISO Customer Relations help desk line at (518)
356-6060. If necessary, someone in Customer Relations can help you input
your bids or relay your schedule information to you.

Sincerely,

Kathy Whitaker
Customer Relations
