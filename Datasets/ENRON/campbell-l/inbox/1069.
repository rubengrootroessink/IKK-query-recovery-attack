    Limp Bizkit took a new approach for its latest album, New Old Songs - the band chose some of its classic tunes and remixed them with the help of hip-hop hotshots such as Timbaland, P. Diddy, and the Neptunes.   New Old Songs - it's your favorite songs...with a brand new sound.   The album doesn't hit stores until December 4th, but you can order your copy on Yahoo! Shopping  today!  	    LAUNCH has not one, but four Limp videos from their latest album! And you won't see "Re-Arranged" anywhere else - catch it only on LAUNCH!
