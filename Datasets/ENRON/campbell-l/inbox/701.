After reviewing the dates in Attachment A of the ICAP manual, I noticed
that
there is not enough time between various obligation dates to process
information.  I am requesting that the following original dates be amended
with the suggested dates.


Topic               Original Date  Suggested Date
Deficiency Auction   7/23/01        7/24/01
Deficiency Auction   8/27/01        8/28/01
Post Results         8/29/01        8/30/01
Certifications      10/19/01       10/23/01
Deficiency Auction  10/22/01       10/25/01
Post Results        10/25/01       10/30/01

If the suggested dates are unworkable, please
respond by June 29 with your suggestions.


Regards,
Bob Boyle
