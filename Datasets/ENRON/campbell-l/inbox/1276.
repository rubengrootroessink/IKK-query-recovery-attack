Rick, I believe you went to runzhiemer last year.  Larry and I got new company cars last year, so we are not affected.  Please, respond to me so I can forward to Bill and start another little table for future reference.

Mike

Greetings and happy new year--


The finance folks are asking about runshiemer vehicles.  Could you please send a list of DES's currently utilizing runshiemer vehicles and if anyone is getting a new runzhiemer vehicle in 2002.

Thanks, Bill
