Enron is proud to be a part of CowParade Houston 2001.  This exciting public art event is designed to promote the arts and benefit the Building for Children capital campaign at Texas Children's Hospital and the Texas Children's Cancer Center. 
CowParade Houston 2001 will feature over 300 cow sculptures, which will be transformed into magnificent works of art and displayed all over Houston, September 6 through November 7.  Sotheby's will conduct the live auction on December 6, 2001 at the Wortham Theater Center in downtown Houston.
At Enron, we believe the most innovative ideas come from our employees and the CowParade Houston is no exception.  We would like to invite you to share your opinion with us regarding what to name our bovine friend.  Enron's cow is designed to represent the unique look of the Enron Center's reflective glass exterior.  Please keep in mind that all names submitted must conform to the CowParade's guidelines (no corporate logos or names) and should represent Enron's "Vision and Values."
