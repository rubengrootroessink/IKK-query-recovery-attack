Bill, Anabelle contacted me on Friday, December 28, 2001and said that Larry Campbell's signed final evaluation could not be located.  At that time I told her Larry faxed his signed evaluation in on December 19, 2001.  I have a voice mail mesage into Anabelle to see if she located Larry's final evaluation.

I have tried to contact Larry at home by cell phone, and pager and have not been able to find him.  I am forwarding this note and if Larry's evaluation can still not be found I will try to contact him once again on Tuesday, January 2, 2002.

At present I have given this my best effort without much luck.

Happy New Years!

Mike
