Chuck,
     I understand (barely)the mechanism which predicts/solves the voltage
constraints, my problem is more coming from the price visibility side. It's like
driving down the road with a speedometer swinging between 55 and 85 and a cop
sitting in the medium. Do you speed up or slow down? Going the wrong way could
get you a day in court. Multiple units OOM, Gen bid guarantees, BME' s $900 in
every zone, hugh positive congestion one hour, hugh negative congestion the next
(Zone P), RT prices $60-90 and neighboring ISO's in the high hundreds (PJM) and
$1000 for three hours in ISONE and one can only wait and see what the uplift
was. I may get my cocker spaniel to stick his head out the window and use the
elevation of his ears as a speed estimate. How the heck does one drive in the
NYISO market?
