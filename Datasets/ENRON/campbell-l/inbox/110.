Folks,

Attached is an agenda for the ICAP deliverability conference call on
Friday.  To facilitate discussion, I have put together a very rough draft
that identifies several of the major approaches and the concerns raised and
concerns addressed by each.  I would invite all folks participating to make
comments clarifying each alternative as well as raising additional concerns
or identifying other concerns that are addressed by each approach.  If you
have another approach, please submit it for the group's consideration.

Thanks
