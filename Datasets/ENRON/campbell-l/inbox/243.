Dear Market Participant,

Technical Bulletin # 77  - Generator Start-Up Cost Guarantee
 - has been revised in response to Market Participant
comments and will soon be posted to the NYISO web site.
For your convenience, clean and redlined versions of the
Technical Bulletin are attached.

The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation
in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.

Questions should be directed to your Customer Account
Representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Peter Lemme
NYISO Customer Technical Services
