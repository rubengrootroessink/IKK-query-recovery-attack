>>Asian-American groups plan walk to aid victims
>>By KRISTI RANGEL-KING
>>Chronicle correspondent
>>
>>Houston's Asian-American groups will sponsor a "Walk
>>for America" next week to raise money for victims of
>>the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
>>
>>"Walk for America is the unity of people all ages and
>>nationalities -- people coming together in a symbolic
>>gesture to illustrate our support and love for this
>>land we call home," says a letter from the Vietnamese
>>Culture and Science Association.
>>
>>Along with several other Asian-American organizations,
>>the VCSA will hold the event at the University of
>>Houston Main Campus, 8 a.m.-noon Oct. 28.
>>
>>The registration fee is $10 per walker and
>>participants are encouraged to solicit pledges and/or
>>donations.
>>
>>All proceeds from the three-mile walk will be donated
>>to the American Red Cross to aid in victim relief
>>efforts for those directly affected by the Sept. 11
>>acts of terror in New York City and the Pentagon in
>>Washington, D.C.
>>
>>Vietnamese-Americans have joined the fund-raising
>>efforts. In New York City, Vietnamese businessman
>>Trung Dinh Tran donated $2 million. The Little Saigon
>>Radio Station, broadcast in Houston and Orange County
>>and San Jose, Calif., raised $1 million for victim
>>relief.
>>
>>"In a crisis, everyone has an obligation to do
>>something," said Truong Nong, a member of the VCSA.
>>
>>The Vietnamese community wants to show its support for
>>President Bush and the fight against terrorism, said
>>Anhlan Nguyen, VCSA president.
>>
>>"American people have reached out their arms to help
>>us for the last 26 years," said Kim Nguyen, Walk for
>>America coordinator. "We want to give back some of
>>what we have received."
>>
>>In addition to raising money for victims, the walk
>>will also show that all Americans, regardless of race,
>>creed, ethnicity or religion, are united in their
>>efforts to stamp out terrorism, said Anhlan Nguyen.
>>
>>For more information or to register, call 281-847-3396
>>or visit www.walkforamerica.net.
