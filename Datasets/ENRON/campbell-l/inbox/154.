Sorry to impose on this list server, but many of us are involved in today's
events. The following may be helpful and of interest to some of you.

My son Ruben E. Brown, a computer maven at Incert Technology that some of
you know from NYISO meetings this Spring, has steered me to the Ananova.com
website which has high powered servers covering the Terrorist situation with
still relatively few hits. It is constantly feeding AP coverage and is
updated much faster than the conventional US sites.  Times are London times.
