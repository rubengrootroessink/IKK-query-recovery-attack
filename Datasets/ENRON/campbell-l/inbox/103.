Dear Larry,
Fabulous Fall Getaways
The days are already shorter and cooler than they were in August, but 
not to worry; fall sales are starting to get hot. Act quickly and you 
can save on fall travel to destinations around the world, from 
leaf-peeping jaunts in the Northeast to island getaways and everything 
in between. Wherever you're headed, Travelocity makes planning and 
booking a breeze. Destination Guides Make Reservations
