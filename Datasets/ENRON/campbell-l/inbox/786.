attend in person or participate, on a "listen-only" basis, in the NYSRC
Executive Committee's Meeting No. 28 scheduled for August 17, 2001,
starting at 10:00A.M. at the Albany Country Club in Guilderland, NY.
Attached in Word format is the Agenda for this meeting.  Also attached are
two pdf files with directions to the Albany Country Club.  The NYSRC has
opened its Committee, Subcommittee, and Working Group meetings in

site at "www.nysrc.org", on the "Policies" web page.

Those who plan on attending the meeting in person are requested to contact
me at least seven (7) days in advance of the meeting (by at least August
10th) by sending me an email at "jcfleury@nyseg.com", with the names of the
individuals & organizations attending.  Meeting space will be available on
a first-come, first-served basis due to the space limitations of the
conference rooms.

345-7506, and enter Participant Code 903712, starting at 10:00 A.M.

with the names of the individuals & organizations participating.

Attendees who are not NYSRC Executive Committee Members or Alternate
Members will be given an opportunity to comment at the end of each meeting,
or earlier at the Chairman's invitation.
