Subject:  ICAP Manual and Timeline Notice

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO will be posting the ICAP Stage 2 manual to the Installed Capacity
webpage shortly.  This manual will include a new timeline (Attachment A),
which covers the Winter 2001/2002 capability period.

Those market participants that will be involved in NYISO UCAP auctions, are
required to complete new Purchase and Sales agreements (Attachments F & G
respectively).  In addition, all UCAP market participants must have a NYISO
assigned "Registrant Name" and "Password" in order to complete and submit
their monthly certification form.

Until such time that the new timeline is available, please click the link
below to view a timeline similar to what will be posted (includes
disclaimer that will be removed).

Please contact either Bob Boyle at rboyle@nyiso.com or Marie Pieniazek at
mpieniazek@nyiso.com if you have any questions.

Regards,
Bob Boyle
