Market Participants:

There is one correction to the version mapping below.  April 4, 2001 should
be Version 4 minus Version 1.  This was one day when we had an overwrite
problem.  The version 1 for this day is what ties out to the original bill
and supplemental invoice.  The supplemental invoice consisted of changes on
4/4, 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 through 4/30.

If you have any questions, please contact your market representative at
518-356-6060.

Market Participants:

Please find attached the advisory statement mapping for the April 2001
Settlement
Adjustment Invoicing.  The versions are based on the current Settlement
Adjustment (SA1)
csv files minus the Supplemental Invoice csv files which were posted just
after the
original April 2001 billing.
