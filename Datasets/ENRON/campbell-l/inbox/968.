Dear Market Participants,

Required maintenance work is scheduled on Wednesday, August 22 and
Thursday, August 23 for NYISO servers that host some of the web sites.
This work is scheduled to take place between 7 and 8 am on both days.
Access to customer statements will be interrupted at times on Thursday
morning during that hour.   If you access the Bidding and Scheduling pages
by directly connecting to an IP address, you should contact your Customer
Relations representative for information on how you will be affected.
Otherwise, if you connect to bidpost.nyiso.com, you should not notice any
interruption in service.  Please contact Customer Relations if you have any
questions.

Regards,
NYISO Customer Relations
