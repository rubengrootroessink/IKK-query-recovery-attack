Dear Market Participants:

On Monday, October 01, 2001 at 14:30 an automatically generated
email was sent to contact person for all NYISO generators and
Day Ahead Demand Response loads. The email stated that there
was a "ISO COM FAILURE" that resulted in "State Wide Out of
Merit". Please be aware that the state wide OOM was for a test
of the backup dispatch system, which was conducted on 9/4. Also,
the OOM status only applies to generators with a schedule during
the subject hours.

Please contact the Customer Relations department with any questions.

Regards,
Customer Relations
