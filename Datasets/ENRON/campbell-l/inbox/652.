TTotten@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO is reserving hour-beginning 5 in the 15 July 2001
real-time market to verify prices.
Pursuant to ECA-B the NYISO, there are no hours to reserve at the
HQ, NE, OH or PJM external proxy buses.
Prices in the 16 July 2001 Day-Ahead market are correct.
