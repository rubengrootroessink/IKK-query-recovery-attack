  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  Should I Get The Orange Properties Or The Blue?=
  Remember when you and your little sister would sit down to play a game of=
 Monopoly? And how you would always sneak an extra $500 bill while she woul=
d always manage to land on the orange properties and make you pay rent? Tim=
e for a rematch! PlaySite's Monopoly, offered in conjunction with Hasbro.co=
m, has become one of our most popular online games. No cheating allowed, bu=
t you might want to learn from your sister and buy those orange properties.=
    Why? Because according to many Monopoly experts, the orange group as a =
whole provides some of the best return on investment for developed properti=
es. This is because the Jail square is the one visited the most times durin=
g a game. You may be just visiting Jail, or you may have been sent there by=
 a card, by the "Go To Jail" space on the board, or by rolling doubles. Fro=
m the Jail, a player HAS to land on something that is on the second or thir=
d side of the board (the light purple, orange, red or yellow properties). S=
tatistically, the property square that is most landed on is Illinois Avenue=
. But the orange properties are also top 15 contenders for the most landed =
on squares and are relatively inexpensive to develop.    What other winning=
 strategies do you have? Do you like to own the utilities and railroads, or=
 do you prefer the low-rent district of the dark purple and light blue prop=
erty groups? Put your theories to the test and play Monopoly!       [IMAGE]=

ing code or a particularly bad Scrabble rack? Neither, it's algebraic notat=
ion and it's used to keep a history of the moves in a chess game. Now, befo=
re you go running away screaming at the word "algebraic," you should note t=
hat it's easy to learn, it allows you to reconstruct games from the past th=
at can help your own style of play, and it's a standard feature in PlaySite=
's chess. We call it "Game History" and you can view it in games you watch,=
 or your own games. Reviewing game histories, and trying alternatives, is t=
he best way to improve your chess-playing abilities. Check out how it works=
 , and then take on some of the top PlaySite chess  players...      [IMAGE]=
     [IMAGE]      [IMAGE]   Q:  Who invented Monopoly?    A:  Nuh uh. If yo=
u said Charles Darrow, you've fallen for a long-believed myth about the ori=
gins of the game. In truth, the game evolved over time, finding its origina=
l shape in Elizabeth Magie's 1904 offering called The Landlord's Game. This=
 game was modified by Magie over a period of years, adopted and refined und=
er different names by other game designers, and eventually the game found i=
ts way to Charles Darrow. To be charitable, it could be said that Darrow po=
pularized the game and got Parker Brothers to produce and sell the game, bu=
t we owe a big round of thanks, or a trip to GO and $200, to Elizabeth Magi=
e.     [IMAGE]    Q:  Besides algebraic, what is the other form of chess no=
tation called?  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] A:  Descriptive notation. Descriptive notat=
ion uses capital letters as abbreviations for the piece that is moving and =
its destination square. For instance, the move e4 (algebraic) would be nota=
ted as P-K4 (descriptive), in that the P (Pawn) is moving to the 4th row on=
 the King's column (K4).     [IMAGE]  =09[IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=09
