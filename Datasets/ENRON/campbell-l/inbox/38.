Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following enhancements to the
public web
server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and SPIDER that will be implemented on
September 12,
2001.

Generation Supplier Issues Development Project:

? Units may operate as Energy Limited Resources (ELR). Qualifying units
that
have their schedules modified will NOT be subjected to any financial harm
from
the obligation to cover energy balancing charges.

? Units may operate as Capacity Limited Resources (CLR). Bid rules will be
modified such that units may indicate an upper MW operating limit separate
from
the Upper Operating Limit (UOL). SCUC, BME, and SCD will honor this limit
under certain environmental and operating situations.

? Payment rules for start-up will be modified. Units will receive start-up
payments
for both the Day Ahead and Real-Time market if they are economically
qualified
and are scheduled in each market.

A Technical Bulletin describing the full details of ELR/CLR will be
released shortly.
If you any questions, please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call the
Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.
