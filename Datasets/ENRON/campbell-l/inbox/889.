Matthew,

Accurate data detailing the response to activation of the Emergency Demand
Response Program (EDRP) will not be available until we receive metered data
from the Curtailment Service Providers.  An updated EDRP program status
will be written and posted on the NYISO website when this information
becomes available in a few days.  In the mean time, the NYISO has issued a
press release that provides some preliminary information on the EDRP
activation.

The press release can be found on the NYISO website at:
http://www.nyiso.com/topics/articles/index.html.

Additional information on the NYISO's Demand Response Programs can be found
at:

Regards,

Bradley Kranz
NYISO
