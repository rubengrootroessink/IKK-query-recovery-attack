Market Participants:

All advisory statements for 11/1999,12/1999, and 4/2001 have
been posted to each customers web site.  08/2001 will be done
this evening.

The NYISO was originally scheduled to invoice November 1999
and December 1999 on Friday 9/7/2001.  We have decided to delay
this until next week to allow extra time verifying the data, and
determining
the correct version mapping for reconciling invoices.  April 2001, and
August 2001 will be posted on 9/7/2001 as scheduled.

Payment dates associated with the November 1999 and December 1999
will be adjusted as necessary.  Market participants will be notified of any
change when the invoices get posted.

We apologize for the tardiness of this announcement.  If you have any
questions concerning this announcement please contact your market
representative at 518-356-6060.
