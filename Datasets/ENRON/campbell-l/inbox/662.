Attached are a few changed pages of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual , to be approved
at the July 19 BIC meeting. All these changes were made as result of ICAP
Working Group deliberations over the past two weeks. They are summarized
here:

> Section 4.4.11 - This new sub-section addresses Generators that
> temporarily may not wish to sell or certify their UCAP.  Without this
> language,  those Generators would have been considered forced out.
>
> Section 4.6 - The second paragraph is new and clarifies the result of
> outages which occur beyond the step-up transformer, and including such
> step-up transformer.  If these outages occur at a time when a Generator
> has not placed its unit on a maintenance outage, such interruption in
> availability shall be treated as a reserve shutdown for purposes of
> calculating that Generator's EFORD.
>
> Section 5.5 - Language describing the roll-over characteristics of UCAP
> bids from the first phase of an auction to the second phase of that same
> auction has been struck because the ICAPWG deemed it confusing.
>
>
In addition, a motion for approval of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, including
these additional changes, is
attached.

If you have questions, please contact John Charlton at the NYISO, Howard
Fromer, chair of the ICAPWG,
