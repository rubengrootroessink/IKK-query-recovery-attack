While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limitation
of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up.
Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster
then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to
avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that things
have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we
should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS.
An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and
using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and
gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted,
have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ray
directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.
