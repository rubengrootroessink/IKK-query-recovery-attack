GWilliams@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The October TCC Reconfiguration Auction bids and offers were received on
Monday (9/10).  On Wednesday (9/12) at least one Market Participant asked
to adjust its bids based on Tuesday's tragic events in New York City,
citing a material change in circumstances.   The NYISO has determined that
it would be inappropriate to allow one Market Participant to change its
bids at this time, but recognizes that the circumstances upon which all
bids were based may have changed.   Therefore, the NYISO has decided to
delay posting of auction results for the October TCC Reconfiguration
Auction to allow each Market Participant an opportunity to review its bids
and offers and, if deemed appropriate, adjust them.  All bids and offers
received on Monday will be invalidated.  Market Participants may submit
their bids and offers during the new Bidding Period scheduled for Friday
(9/14).  The revised schedule for the October TCC Reconfiguration Auction
is as follows:

September 14, 2001 - The Bidding Period opens at 8:00 AM and closes at 5:00
PM.

September 17 - 20, 2001 - The NYISO will conduct the required award
analysis for this auction.

September 21, 2001 - The NYISO will post the results of this auction.
Buyers who were awarded TCCs will be notified by the NYISO using email no
later than 5:00 PM.

September 25, 2001 - The NYISO distributes Award Notices to purchasers and
sellers of TCCs.

September 27, 2001 - Any dispute regarding an Award Notice must be
submitted in writing to the NYISO by 5:00 PM.

September 28, 2001 - Payments due to NYISO by 5:00 PM for TCCs awarded.

October 3, 2001 - The NYISO makes payment for all TCCs sold during the
October Reconfiguration Auction.

October 5, 2001 - The NYISO distributes any residual auction revenues from
the October Reconfiguration Auction to the Transmission Owners.


The schedule for the remainder of the Autumn 2001 Initial TCC Auction is
unaffected.
