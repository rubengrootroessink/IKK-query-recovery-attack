Dean:

Several deals are missing in Enpower for various counterparties.  There is nothing in the Hourly P&L so I am letting you know because each transmission was submitted under your ID.  Please check them out and get back to me as soon as possible with deal numbers.  We are in the last week of the month and need to get these fixed asap.  If you need help or have questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marci
