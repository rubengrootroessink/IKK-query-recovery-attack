Dear friends, all of us have been horribly saddened by the events in New York and Washington, DC this past Tuesday. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have suffered.  For those receiving this note, we hope you are well and safely with your loved ones.
One way to help the victims of this tragedy is to go to: http://www.sportsbook.com/redcross.shtml 
Please enter an amount you wish to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund from your account.
Sportsbook.com will match your donation dollar per dollar.
Sportsbook.com will not realize any profits from money donated to the red cross fund 
Though we have all been shocked by this tragedy, we urge you and your friends and family to remain calm.  Atrocities of this magnitude are committed by truly sick individuals, not normal human beings.  As people's shock turns to anger, we have seen some incidents of violence.  Lashing out at visible minorities only serves to further the cause of those who have committed these foul acts.  We must save our anger for those individuals or parties who committed or planned these crimes. 
Once again, the link to donate to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is:http://www.sportsbook.com/redcross.shtml 
And we will match your donation, dollar for dollar.
Sincerely,
The staff at sportsbook.com
