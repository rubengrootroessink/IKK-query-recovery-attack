He kept us waiting, but finally living dead rocker Rob Zombie is back  with his second solo release since 1998, The Sinister Urge. Was it worth the wait?  Watch "Feel So Numb" and find out.    In his ghoulish rocker fashion, Zombie filled the album  with thrashers like "Never Gonna Stop" and "Bring Her Down." To top it off, he lined up guest spots from Ozzy Osbourne, SLayer's Kerry King, Tommy Lee, Limp Bizkit's DJ Lethal and Beastie Boys DJ Mixmaster Mike. Take a sneak peek at The Sinister Urge.
