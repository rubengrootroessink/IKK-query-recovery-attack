The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 12:00-22:00 in the October 16, 2001
Real-Time Market as well as the following hours per ECA 20010608B to verify
prices:

HQ: 2:00, 5:00 - 6:00, 14:00 - 15:00, and 21:00 - 23:00
OH:  2:00, 5:00, 14:00 - 15:00, and 21:00 - 23:00
NE:  2:00, 5:00, 14:00 - 15:00, and 21:00 - 23:00
PJM:  2:00, 5:00, 14:00 - 15:00, and 21:00 - 23:00

SCD was unavailable during hours beginning 13:00 through 22:00; while these
intervals presently show prices, these were not used for dispatch and will
be discarded. These hours are reserved and will have all intervals
replaced.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 14:00 ? 15:00 in the
October 16, 2001 Hour-Ahead Market.

Prices in the October 17, 2001 Day-Ahead Market are correct.
