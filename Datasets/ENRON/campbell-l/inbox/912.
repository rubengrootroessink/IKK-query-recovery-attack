Please take note of the memo below from John D'Aloia of PSC Staff. John
is looking to see if there is any interest in the Marketer community in
attending a PSC hosted meeting in Albany to review the Commission's
Order on EDI as well as having the opportunity to have vendors present
to discuss what they have to offer in the way EDI technology. I believe
that it is extremely important that anyone without expertise in EDI or
the in-house capability of building such a system attend this meeting.
EDI will be a reality in New York by the end of this year and any
Marketer who is not EDI compliant by the end of 2002 will not be able to
do business in NY. Please respond directly to Mr. D'Aloia on whether or
not you would attend such a conference. Thank you.
Mike

Subject: NY EDI - call for interest in general in-person meeting

From: john_daloia@dps.state.ny.us
To: nywg@listserv.allenergy.com

To: NY EDI Participants; New York ESCO/Marketers

Subject: Call for interest in general meeting on EDI

(Note: The topic of this message was communicated in a separate email
two
weeks ago to various parties.  It is being sent again to ensure we have
reached the appropriate audience of companies involved in retail access
in
New York)


The New York Public Service Commission issued Opinion 01-03 on July 23,
2001.  This order re-affirms the Commission's intent to have all New
York
utilities and eligible E/Ms begin implementation of EDI systems for
certain retail access transactions by year end 2001.  Please note that
all companies involved in these subject transactions will
be required to implement EDI.

 The Commission's Opinion and supplemental documents can be found on the
Commission's EDI web page at:
        http://www.dps.state.ny.us/98m0667.htm.

The purpose of this email message is to solicit ESCO/Marketer interest
in
participating in a general meeting in which PSC Staff would review the
overall EDI effort to date, respond to questions regarding the
requirements specified in Opinion 01-03 and discuss a proposed timetable
for testing and implementation. In addition to these agenda topics, the
meeting may also focus on the steps involved in implementing an EDI
system
(either in-house or via contract with a suitable vendor) and
arrangements
may be made to have several EDI vendors make presentations regarding
their
services or products.  We expect representatives from each of the
utilities to be in attendance to respond to any utility specific
questions
you may have. It is important to us in planning for this meeting that we
know which topics are most important to your company.

At this time we are envisioning a two day meeting on Thursday & Friday,
September 20 and 21, 2001, and to be held in Albany near or at the
Commission's offices. Let us know your company's interest in
participating
in such a meeting and forward your ideas on which topics should be
addressed in order to ensure that the meeting is as productive and as
informative as possible.  Please respond via email to PSC staff (John
D'Aloia) as soon as you can but no later than COB on Tuesday, August 21.

 All ESCO/Marketers are asked to respond - either affirmatively or
negatively, and to provide the contact information (name, phone number
and
email) for the appropriate people at your companies who should receive
EDI
correspondence.

Also, to ensure this notice gets thoroughly communicated, all utilities
are asked to forward this message to each of the active E/Ms they are
currently working with (hence, duplicate copies may be received by some
of
you).

Regards,

John D'Aloia
