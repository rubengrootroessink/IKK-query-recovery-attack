Dear Larry,
If you're like many Americans, your thoughts have been with friends 
and family more than ever in the past few weeks. Wouldn't it be nice 
to spend Thanksgiving with the people you love? Many airlines have 
slashed rates to encourage travelers to do just that. Great deals are 
available on car rentals, too. Vacation packages, hotel rates, even 
cruises are now being offered at unusually low rates. We invite you 
to visit Travelocity to start planning your Thanksgiving getaway!
