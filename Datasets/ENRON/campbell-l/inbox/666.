As noted in the attached Order, the FERC Mediation conference scheduled
for this Thursday has been moved to next Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. In
addition, I've attached the most recent Order in the Southeast RTO case.

My understanding is that the ALJ in that case plans to hold three day a
week meetings (Tues-Thurs) from now until the deadline imposed by FERC.
Can we be far behind?
