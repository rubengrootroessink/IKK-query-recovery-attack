While Tech Bulletin 74 indicated a need to submit Sections B, F and I of
the Customer Registration, I only accidentally read Note E on page 2 of
Section B indicating that Section J must be submitted as well. Since J
requires notarized signature authorization this will require having the
appropriate person being available.
