The NYISO has successfully migrated its billing system to a new server.
Re-billings for July 1st - 16th, 2001 were rerun and posted over the
weekend.  In addition to the July 2001 re-billings, the NYISO also ran and
posted the advisory billing statements for the July 2000 settlement
adjustment.  Invoices for the July 2000 settlement adjustment and July 2001
initial billing are scheduled to be issued on August 7, 2001.  Customers
are advised to resume their reviews of advisory billing statements and
report anomalies to their Customer Relations Representatives.  The NYISO
would like to thank our customers for their patience through this upgrade.
