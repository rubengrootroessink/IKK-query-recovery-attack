nothing to do, no friends, ran out of porno tapes, just wondering
aloud...

     to my true-blue, dye-in-the-wool, RED, WHITE & BLUE friends,

   Opening my e-mails and watching the news coverage on the
Clintonlover News Network this past week, i happily realized that
i live in a nation of heroes and patriots.
   Those firemen, police officers and volunteers in NYC who are
working around the clock to try to rescue people richly deserve to
be called heroes, for indeed they are TRUE HEROES  (how many of my
friends, how many of YOU, would be there, among the ruins, if some
assholes had, say, hit the Transco Tower ? would i ? i know a
certain OD who might have, but how many more ? just wondering...)
They ARE heroes.
   Now about the patriots, all 280,000,000 of them.
   An "unusually high number" of people run to their local Wal-
Mart to buy a flag, and CNN calls America a nation of patriots.
It is ONE thing to tie a bloody ribbon to your Lexus or pick-up
truck (never understood the public display, shouldn't we mourn in
our hearts ? no problem with it, whatever floats your boat, just
find the PUBLIC part strange), it is altogether ANOTHER thing to
pick up a weapon and go fight the fukkin' Mujahedins in the
fukkin' Afghan mountains (there are no Starbucks in Kabul, just
ask the Soviets...)  REAL war, no smart-bombs-live-on-CNN-safe-on-
your-couch-Mickey-Mouse war;  REAL war, maybe for the first time
in history, on American soil.  We know the fukkers will be
committed, will our side be ?  Strange thing, commitment.  When
the Bolsheviks fought the White Russians, Feliks Dzherhinsky
compared it to bacon and eggs;  he said that the pig is COMMITTED,
the chicken is only INVOLVED.  He knew what he was talking about:
he was a pig (literally, bastard founded the KGB), and he won.
   So, let us all take a deep breath (if anything, just to mourn
the innocent victims in NYC and DC), and call things fo what they
are, a duck a duck and a poodle a poodle (sic!)  Those people in
NYC are heroes, we'll find out about the patriots.

PS

  Notice how when the camelbastards wanted to hit at the SYMBOL of
America, they hit the World Trade Center.  Ummm, isn't there
something called the Statue of Liberty, not a mile away?
  "Give us your poor, give us your weak, give us your down-trodden"
  "America, the craddle of democracy, the moral compass of a
misguided world"  ???
  People will die for their beliefs, and those things are worth
dying for.
  America's greatest virtue is its wealth, not its moral
superiority, the evil bastards hit at the true heart of America:
      They hit Corporate U$A
  America won't go to war, 280,000,000 people don't believe in
Coca-Cola all that much.
