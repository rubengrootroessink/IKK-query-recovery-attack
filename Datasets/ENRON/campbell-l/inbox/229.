Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the
following enhancement to the NYISO Billing and
Accounting System that will be implemented on
October 1, 2001.

Consistent with rules for uninstructed over-
generation, penalties will be implemented for
persistent under-generation.  Generating units
that persistently under-generate will be subject
to a penalty calculated for each SCD interval
and accumulated for each hour.

If you have any questions, please contact your
Customer Relations Representative or call the
Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Regards,
Customer Relations
