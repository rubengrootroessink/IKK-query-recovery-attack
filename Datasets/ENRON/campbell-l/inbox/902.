The "Rules, Procedures and Guidelines for the Initial Auction of TCCs -
Autumn 2001" has been posted on the NYISO web site.  It can be found on the
NYISO web site by selecting "THE MARKETS" from the home page.  Then select
"Transmission Congestion Contracts - TCC Market" and "Autumn 2001" .  The
document is posted under the heading "Autumn 2001 TCC Auction".

This document contains the "Sale Agreement" which must be completed and
returned to the NYISO via an overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on August
16th and the "Purchase Agreement" which must be completed and returned to
the NYISO via an overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on August 16th in order
to participate in the first round of the auction.  Parties not wishing to
participate in the first round of the auction may submit the "Sale
Agreement" and "Purchase Agreement" at a later date in accordance with the
Time Line provided as Attachment C of the "Rules".  Please note that these
"Agreements" are identical to those used for the Spring 2001 Initial
Auction of TCCs except for the relevant date references.

The final version of the Time Line provided as Attachment C differs from
the Preliminary Time Line posted on August 7th. The Reconfiguration
Auctions of Two-Year and One-Year TCCs were shifted to Rounds 1 and 2.
