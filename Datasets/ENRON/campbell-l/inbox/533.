Dear Market Participants:

Billing Data Dictionary Version 15 will become effective for
November 2001 billing dates forward and will supercede Version 14.
Version 15 includes provisions for billing codes associated with
Virtual Bidding.  New sections have been added to both the hourly
and daily advisory statements to accomodate the Virtual Market
settlement billing codes.  A new billing code has also been added
to the Ancillary Services section of the daily advisory statement
to report incremental uplift due to under-forecasting.

The new dictionary will be posted at:

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at 518.356.6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
