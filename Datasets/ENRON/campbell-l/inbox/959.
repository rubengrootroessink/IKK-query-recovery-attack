"Robb, Kathy" <KRobb@hunton.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Howard Fromer, chair of the ICAP Working Group, has asked that we cancel the
ICAP Working Group meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, August 21, because it
conflicts with the RTO mediation, which he and others involved in the ICAP
Working Group are attending.

In addition, the Tuesday, September 11 meeting is cancelled and will be
rescheduled for some time in September that does not conflict with the RTO
effort.

If you have any questions, please contact John Charlton at the NYISO, Howard
Fromer, or me. Many thanks.
