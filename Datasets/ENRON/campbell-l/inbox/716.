A quick question on operations.

First, thank you to the ISO for updating the HAM prices.

Second - I have a question regarding dispatch.  I notice now that HAM prices
in NY City are in excess of $1,000.  Which to me, given a bid cap, implies
that everything capable of running will be dispatched.  Yet, when I look at
the dispatcher notices, I see that both the Gowanus and Astoria CT blocks
are running out of merit for the ISO (note - not local security).  How can
this be - certainly the HAM prices indicate these units should be running
for economics and setting price.  I hope we are not going to see the cost of
these units in our uplift charges.  I look forward to a response from the
ISO
