Dear Market Participants

1st Rochdale Cooperative. Ltd. is being removed from the
NYISO-administered electric energy markets.  The changeover
of 1st Rochdale's customers to the provider of last resort,
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will take place on
Friday, October 12 for the Saturday, October 13th market.
1st Rochdale had previously posted a sufficient amount of
collateral to cover its obligations to the energy market and
the NYISO anticipates, therefore, that no losses associated
with this transition will be borne by the market.

Regards,
Customer Relations
