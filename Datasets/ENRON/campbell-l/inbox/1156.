Each of you have a seperate spreadsheet in the attacked Excel workbook.  Please review the company, facilities and cost.  The cost focuses on only three "cost elements", these cost elements represent approximately 90% of our budget, excluding salaries.  Please input individual facility cost for each of the cost elements on your attached workbook.

The cost elements are:





The main budget spreadsheet is protected, because this is the budget that was approved.  By rolling up all the facility cost , Bill will be able to determine if we are able to reduce our O&M budget any for 2002.
