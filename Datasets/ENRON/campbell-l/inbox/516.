Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World
Trade
   Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District,
   the
   ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity ("UCAP") requirement for the
   Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York
   Control
   Area.  The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period
   11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the
   New York Control Area is 32892 MW.  Changes in the UCAP requirements
   of affected LSEs will be provided to them, individually, today.

   The table below provides a comparison of the revised UCAP requirements
   to those in effect prior to this revision.
