Hello lcampbel@enron.com:

Thank you for registering for a Microsoft
 .NET Passport. Please take a moment to help us verify your e-mail address. This ensures that .NET Passport can respond to you if you contact us about a service issue. In addition, some participating .NET Passport sites may require you to verify your e-mail address to take full advantage of their own services.

The e-mail address you registered as your .NET Passport is:
lcampbel@enron.com

PLEASE VERIFY THAT THIS IS YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS by clicking this link:
http://register.passport.com/EmailPage.srf?EmailID=15547FFE80F04B0C&URLNum=0
NET Passport will display a Web page confirming that your e-mail address has been verified.

IF CLICKING A LINK DOESN'T WORK...

Copy it, and then paste it into your Web browser's address bar.
Select the entire link (which starts with http:// and may include more than one line) and then copy it, usually by clicking the "Edit" menu item and then clicking "Copy". Next, open your Web browser and click in the box where you usually see the Web page address. Paste the link into this box (usually by clicking "Paste" in the "Edit" menu) and click "Go" or "Enter".
