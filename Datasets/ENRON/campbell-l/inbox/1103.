rgy's (OTCBB: GASE)  properties and future revenues in Utah were independen=
tly evaluated  and estimated by Netherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI) - a =
 40-year-old international petroleum consulting firm. NSAI (www.netherlands=
ewell.com ) has worked with hundreds  of top financial institutions from Ba=
nk of America to Credit Suisse  as well as major oil and gas companies from=
 Exxon to Shell.    The report states that  the estimated unrisked future n=
et revenue on GASE's interest will  most likely produce $2.42 BILLION!! Ple=
ase note that the report  discusses NET revenues, which are calculated by d=
educting state  production and ad valorem taxes, operating expenses and ALL=
 future  capital costs from the gross revenues. While these are net revenue=
s,  as opposed to net income, this can mean great news for GASE's  existing=
 and future shareholders!    In evaluating  probabilities of occurrence, NS=
AI's report states "there is very  little risk of not encountering gas in t=
his basin-centered gas  accumulation". In fact according to NSAI, the prope=
rty's most likely  present worth is $242 million discounted at 10% based on=
 average  NYMEX prices for the period 09/00 to 08/02. Wellhead prices used =
in  the report are $3.56 per MMBtu, escalated 3% per year to a maximum  of =
$4.15 per MMBtu.    Foremost among GASE's  strategic partnerships is GASE's=
 agreement with Phillips Petroleum  (NYSE:P). GASE and Phillips have been w=
orking to maximize  shareholder value on the Utah properties. GASE has also=
 teamed with  Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) to potentially drill and complete =
up to  10 wells within the same area.    IN ADDITION to the  interest in Ut=
ah properties, GASE also recently reported that it has  teamed up with Burl=
ington Resources (NYSE: BR) - one of the world's  largest independent oil a=
nd gas companies - to explore and develop a  series of natural gas plays in=
 Wyoming. This significantly enlarges  GASE's land mass, which may further =
increase the company's net  present worth!!    According to the U. S.  Geol=
ogical Survey, the Greater Green River Basin has produced more  than 7.3 tr=
illion cubic feet of natural gas and 849 million barrels  of oil, making it=
 one of the country's truly significant oil and gas  fields. Burlington Res=
ources is the perfect partner to help develop  the many highly fractured, t=
