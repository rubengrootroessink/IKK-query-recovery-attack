   Here's a handy holiday photo tip from Lesa B.:  "I like to make gift tag=
s by cutting my Ofoto prints into shapes such as stars, ovals, Christmas tr=
ees, etc. I cut a small hole at top and tie ribbon to secure the tag to the=
 package. I have two children so I use their pictures and let them personal=
ize the back. The tags become a bigger hit than the present itself!"   Clic=
