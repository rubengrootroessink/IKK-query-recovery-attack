  Dear Mr. LARRY CAMPBELL:

At Datek  we are always looking for ways to even the playing field for individual investors, and rebating payments for order flow is just one more of those ways.

Your account has been credited $66.37 as a rebate for your option orders filled during May.

Our goal is to direct orders to the market center offering the best possible execution price, without consideration of order flow payments.  When our system directs your order to a market center that pays for order flow, we credit your account with a rebate.

If you have any questions, e-mail us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at support@datek.com or call us, weekdays 8 AM - midnight and weekends 9 AM - 7 PM Eastern Standard Time at 1-800-U2DATEK.  Please call 1-201-761-7500 if you are calling from outside of the United States.

Sincerely,

Datek Online Financial Services LLC
