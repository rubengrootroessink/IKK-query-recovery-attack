Dear Pricing Issues Task Force Members,

After today's meeting of the  Pricing Issues Task Force it was decided that
the meeting previously scheduled for 9/25 should be cancelled in favor of
bringing the issue to a larger group in the form of a joint S&P and Market
Structure meeting on October 4th.  Short term recommendations for actions
in response to the BME/SCD pricing issues will be considered under the
scope of the S&PWG while longer term BME/SCD issues, which has been a topic
on the MSWG's agenda, will continue to be addressed by that working group.

Regards,
Monica Ryan-Taber
