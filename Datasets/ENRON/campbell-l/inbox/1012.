   NEW CORPORATE PLAYER IN THE INDUSTRY AGAINST CYBER-TERRORISM   [IMAGE]  =
IMMEDIATE BUY RECOMMENDATION Initiating Research Coverage   Merilus Inc.   =
 Symbol: MERH Shares Outstanding: 13.2 million Share Price: $1.90 Market Ca=
pitalization: $25 million 52 Week Hi/Low: $8.50/$0.45 Estimated Public Floa=
t: 2 million shares  Developed over the last four years, Merilus has recent=
ly started marketing the latest and most advanced computer security product=
s targeted for small to medium businesses.   This market has been, and is p=
rojected to be, one of the fastest sectors in technology, largely unaffecte=
d by the current weakness in the market.      THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY A=
 Computer Security Institute and FBI survey showed 90% of large organizatio=
ns detected breaches into their computing systems.  74% of these organizati=
ons acknowledged financial losses.  Price Waterhouse estimated this loss to=
 be about $40 billion last year.  The estimated number of computer attacks =
doubled last year according to the Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mell=
on University.  International Data Corp. (IDC) predicts the compounded annu=
al growth rates of digital security revenues will continue at over 88% per =
year over the next 5 years.    Merilus' products target small to medium bus=
inesses, a particularly fast growing segment of the overall security market=
, which has been underserved by the major security manufacturers.  IDC esti=
mates the small to medium business percentage of the total internet securit=
y software market will increase from the current 43% to about 70% by 2004. =
In terms of dollars, this means companies with fewer than 1000 employees co=
uld spend about $7.4 billion on security in 2004.  We strongly feel Merilus=
 is focusing on the right market, at the right time.   MERILUS SOLUTIONS Me=
rilus' computer software and hardware products represent major innovations,=
 which protect against computer information theft from hackers and others b=
oth outside and within the business.  Their recently introduced FireCards a=
re the world's first network security system and firewall (controlling who =
can access what type of data) that easily inserts into the standard PCI slo=
t inside the computer. It is a computer within the computer allowing for re=
mote updating of new innovations and security measures to ensure sensitive =
data is protected as well as transmitted in a secure manner.   Industry rev=
iews have given the new products high ratings.  Secure Computing Magazine g=
ave the FireCard a five out of five star rating and The Tech Zone awarded a=
 9.5 out of 10 score.  NASA and Lockheed Martin are just a couple of the so=
phisticated organizations that have started using Merilus products.  Even t=
hough Merilus and its products are relatively new to the market place we fe=
el they will also have good acceptance because they are extremely price com=
petitive.  Management will strive to maintain its current 2:1 cost/feature =
ratio, where products are either half the price of competitors for the same=
 functionality or twice the functionality for the same price.  Manufacturin=
g of the products is contracted out to keep capital and inventory costs dow=
n and flexibility up.   THE ROLLOUT Over the summer, after rigorous testing=
 in Compaq's labs, Merilus has become a member of the Compaq Solutions Alli=
ance, allowing installation of products into Compaq computers. Merilus rece=
ntly announced they have partnered with the three largest distributors in N=
orth America: Ingram Micro, Tech Data and EMJ.  Last week Merilus announced=
 its Reseller Program, which provides marketing and technical support as we=
ll as substantial rebates to vendors selling Merilus' suite of computer sec=
urity products.   MANAGEMENT Dana Epp, President of Merilus started writing=
 commercial security monitoring software at the age of 14 and authored the =
book Computer Security Concepts, Managing Business Threats in a Wired World=
.  Merilus has attracted a number of credible and notable Board members suc=
h as John Connally, son of the former US Treasury Secretary, John Paul DeJo=
ria, Chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems.   FINANCIALS and PROJECTIONS T=
wo companies established in this industry are SonicWall (SNWL) and Watchgua=
rd Technologies (WGRD).  Over the last couple of years these two companies =
have enjoyed approximately 100% annualized revenue growth.  Analyst's conse=
nsus (Thompson Financial) is that they will have sales growth next year of =
about 50% and 40%, respectively. Merilus is in the process of raising $3 mi=
llion in a Private Placement to power its marketing initiatives, increase i=
nventory and to strengthen its balance sheet.  Management and its financier=
s expect to close this needed funding before year-end. Currently the Compan=
y has minimal, but rapidly increasing revenues.    Management is estimating=
 revenues of $8 million next year increasing to $34 million in 2003.  In 20=
03 they estimate achieving net income of roughly $4 million.  By 2003, we e=
stimate the shares outstanding could increase to about 18 million.  If thes=
e numbers were met and a price to earnings ratio of 30 was applied, it coul=
d suggest a possible $6 share price.  Management's latest estimates are for=
 revenues increasing to $93 million in 2004.  Merilus is little known in in=
vestment circles however an Investor Awareness Program is expected to start=
 next week.   For more information see www.merilus.com and call Steve Clare=
