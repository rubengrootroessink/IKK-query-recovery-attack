Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is starting the second phase of the Online Presence Project, the
part of our IT Strategy that will enhance the Customer interfaces with the
MIS.  We are also beginning to define the needs for the Decision Support
Project, which will provide tools to view and analyze market information.

In both of these projects, we need Market Participant input.  There are
opportunities for managers, traders, schedulers and billing specialists to
participate with us in the following ways:

Two two-day workshop sessions
One two-hour paper-prototype review session
One or two two-hour interview sessions

If you are interested in joining any of these sessions, please call your
Customer Account Representative or the Customer Relations Help Desk Phone
Line at 518-356-6060.  We need an expression of your interest by 8:00 am on
Monday, July 23.  For more information about the projects, please refer to
Agenda Item #4 of the BIC meeting materials posted for July 19, 2001.  They
are posted on the NYISO website at the address below.
