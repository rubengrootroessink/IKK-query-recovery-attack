Market Participants:

New advisory statements for April 2000 have been posted to your secure web
sites as of
8/4/2001.  The reason for the update is due to a printing error in the
previous version for LRR
Uplift charges.

Some of you may have had problems getting the LRR dollars in line with what
you were invoiced
due to this printing error.  It is important to note that the bills were
NOT re-run, just re-printed.

If you have any questions please contact customer relations at
518-356-6060.
