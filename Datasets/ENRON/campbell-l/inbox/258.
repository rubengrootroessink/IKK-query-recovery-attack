"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The example contained in the presentation with regard to the cost of
ICAP to Customers is while sound in theory contains misleading and
totally inaccurate information with regard to the cost of a GT.

The capital cost of the GT in the example is $2.5 M for a 25 MW GT or
$100 per KW. If the author can build GTs in NYC for $100 per KW then
please contact us and we will secure your services.

I can cite NYPA's investment of well over $500 million for 450 MW for a
cost of $1100 per KW.

The cost to build GTs in NYC are closer to $1000/KW or 10 times the
value represented in the example.
The O&M costs are also at some sort of serious discount to reality.

If examples are to be cited then let's get them closer to the real
world.
