  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]     	  Football  is back, and so is Betanything. Betanything is offering an "exciting"  new bonus plan for its customers - 10% bonus for all new sign ups  and re-deposits from existing customers. In addition, if the deposit is  through Neteller or Pay Pal, there is an additional 5%  bonus. The total bonus available is $500.    The great  part of this bonus program is, if you do not earn the entire $500  bonus with your first bonus, subsequent deposits through Neteller  and PayPal will earn 10% in bonus dollars. This bonus will  continue until the total $500 in bonus dollars is  earned!  Please go to  www.betanything.com   and check out the new features on the site, the variety of sports  offered and the bonus page.   Betanything is looking forward to you  registering and playing this season!
