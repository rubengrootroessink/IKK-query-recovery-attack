Dear Market Participant,

Technical Bulletin # 74  - Virtual Bidding in the Day-Ahead
Market - has been revised in response to Market Participant
comments and will soon be posted to the NYISO web site.
For your convenience, clean and redlined versions of the
Technical Bulletin are attached.

Please note that  NYISO Technical Bulletins are now
converted to .PDF format using Acrobat 5.0.   Anyone
experiencing problems opening Technical Bulletins
will want to download the current version of Acrobat
Reader from the Adobe web site at:
http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html

The purpose of our Technical Bulletins is to facilitate participation
in the NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts,
techniques, and processes to Market Participants before they
can be formally documented in a NYISO manual.

Questions should be directed to your Customer Account
Representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.
