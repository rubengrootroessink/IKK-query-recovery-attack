Dear Larry,
With the upcoming Holidays, my thoughts turn to friends and family. 
And for many of us, that leads to travel plans: Visiting relatives 
over Thanksgiving, heading or getting together with friends you 
haven't seen in awhile. This past week, our members have been 
busy booking their fall and winter getaways. We invite you to 
join them and experience some of the best travel opportunities 
in many years. 
In my 30 years in the industry, I have never seen fares as low and 
flexible as they are now. Today you can find some of the best prices 
on airfares, cars, hotels, vacations and cruises, and many with less 
restrictions than before - even for business travel. We hope you take 
advantage of these great opportunities to reconnect with friends and 
family. On behalf of all of us at Travelocity, we wish you happy 
holiday travels. 
Sincerely 
Terry Jones
