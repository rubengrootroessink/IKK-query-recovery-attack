Dear Members of the MC, BIC, OC, and TIE List,

Attached, please find the NYISO Weekly Update.  This
Update is written jointly by Elaine Robinson and other
NYISO staff.

The NYISO Weekly Update provides a brief status report of, or
progress on, a range of issues that are under discussion at
NYISO Committee meetings or are being undertaken by NYISO
Staff.  Many, but not all, of these issues are being addressed
through the NYISO Committee structure.

Market participants may raise any comments or questions on
items covered in the Update through the Committee structure,
or directly to Elaine Robinson (erobinson@nyiso.com).

You can find prior editions of the Weekly Update on the
"NYISO Committees" page of the NYISO web site:
