   			 Between economic uncertainty and the beginning of the holiday season,  it's hard to get a clear view of the outlook for companies in retail.  But you can discover promising small-cap players in the specialty retail  industry, and you won't even have to leave the comfort of home. Our Specialty  Retail Webcast brings you company presentations with audio and slide shows,  financial information and Q?sessions with RedChip analysts. RedChip's  industry-specific webcasts offer you a quick, comprehensive look at the  investment opportunities in small companies that Wall Street hasn't discovered  yet.   Registration for investors is FREE, but you must register by clicking  here  or by calling 800-REDCHIP (800-733-2447). 		   	[IMAGE]
