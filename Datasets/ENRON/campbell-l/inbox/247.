Dear Congestion Reduction Task Force Members,

The October 4th Congestion Reduction Task Force Meeting is being postponed
in order to accommodate a joint meeting of the S&P and Market Structure
working groups on that day.  A new date will be selected in the near future
and a notice sent out to participants on this task force.

Regards,
Monica Ryan-Taber
