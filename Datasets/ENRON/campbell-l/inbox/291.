Dear HAJCC Members,
Tonight, we have moved our table to Auchan's Supermarket from 6:00-9:00pm
with a Fireman. We need more members to help out. If you can make it please
contact Sharon at 713-596-2823. Currently, we have raised over $2,000 in
just 3 days. Please help us reach our goal of $5,000.
We need volunteers for September 22, 2001 at 8:00am at the Chinese Culture
center parking lot (10303 West Office Dr 77042 Near Ranchester and Westpark
) We need people to help us set up the event. The dress attire for all HAJC=
C
members is HAJCC T-shirt and Pants or Shorts. If you do not have a T-shirt
yet, just show up and see Sharon and she will have some extra shirts.
The Chinese Organizations of Houston will be holding a memorial service wil=
l
be conducted at 9:00pm to pay tribute to the victims and the heroes. We hav=

doing individual functions. We will have services performed by several
religious groups, and finishing the event by contributing the results of ou=
r
fund-raising efforts to our forgotten local heores, the Fire-fighters Union
and the Police Union. Also a portion of the proceeds will go to Channel 39'=
s
parent company, who
will match 50-cents-on-the-dollar of our donations to organizations of our
choice. We are expecting over 500 people to attend this event. We Need
Volunteers to help out at our HAJCC booth from 8:00am-11:00am. We need
members to step up and help on this important project. This schedule will
also be coordinated by Steve & Homer. Steve Yang [yang_steve@hotmail.com] o=
