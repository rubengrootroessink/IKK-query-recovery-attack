  Over  the last several years? online brokerage firms, on technology  and =
infrastructure, have invested a lot of money. Several companies  have found=
 it cheaper to BUY other companies then spend the time  and money developin=
g their own technology and infrastructure.  We  believe STTN?s story will g=
et a lot of attention in  the investment community in the coming months, as=
 the stock market  continues to move upward. STTN is a brand-new publicly t=
rading  company via a reverse/merger with Ikon Ventures, Inc.(IKNV). When  =
we consider STTN, we must understand the business model and  huge potential=
 in the Company?s valuation. Sutton  Trading Solutions Inc. ? Sutton Online=
 Trading Solutions  is an ASP (Application Service Provider) offering turnk=
ey online  trading solutions for domestic and foreign firms. With complete =
 front-end software, trade routing and back-office management applications,=
  Sutton Online has become a recognized destination for small, medium  and =
large brokerages seeking an easy and cost effective entr?e  to the Direct A=
ccess trading industry. Sutton Online has developed  a true niche, a specia=
l synergy combining state-of-the-art technology  (Level 1 and Level II trad=
ing via SONIC 2000?  and GlobalDAT?),  brokerage and clearing arrangements,=
 and high quality services including  website design and hosting and Custom=
er Service to allow both US  and Foreign brokerages to offer Online Trading=
 to their clients.  Sutton Online, Inc. currently has Service Bureau custom=
ers in Bahrain,  Russia, The Czech Repbulic, Brussels, Madrid, Brazil, Peru=
, France,  Bulgaria, and The United States. Sutton Online has received Serv=
ice  Bureau Status from ECN?s (Electronic Communication Network)  as well a=
s the NASDAQ to provide related services. Sutton Trading  Solutions, Inc. a=
lso operates Sutton Data Services in Prague,  Czech Republic. This wholly o=
wned subsidiary specializes in the  development and implementation of custo=
m financial banking and brokerage  applications for both front and back end=
 users..    Online  trading is the fastest growing segment of the brokerage=
 industry  and is expected to continue to grow significantly. IDC estimates=
  that Online Brokerage revenue will exceed $5.4 Trillion by 2005.  The evo=
lution of the Internet has fundamentally changed the way  in which many inv=
estors manage their financial affairs. The speed,  convenience, choice, cos=
t savings and information offered by the  Internet as an investment tool ha=
s increasingly driven investor  assets online. The growth of discount broke=
rage firms and the increasing  utilization of the Internet to access a wide=
 range of financial  services underscore a fundamental shift in market demo=
graphics.  This shift has altered the way consumers manage their personal f=
inancial  assets. Based on industry research reports and the rapid consumer=
  acceptance of online transactions, consumers are increasingly taking  dir=
ect control over their personal financial affairs, not only because  they a=
re now able to do so, but also because they find it more convenient  and le=
ss expensive than relying on financial intermediaries.       KEY  PRODUCTS =
   GlobalDAT?  Global Direct Access Trading; GlobalDAT? is a unique propiet=
ary  technology that connects major European and American Stock Exchanges  =
and ECN?s through one user interface for share dealing. GlobalDAT??s  open =

0 Market Makers and 9  ECN?s with dedicated connections to The Island ECN, =
Archipelago,  NASDAQ, NYSE via SuperDot, and Knight Trimark. Real time data=
 is  provided by Hyperfeed.      VALUATION   In  our opinion, as the story =
unfolds, and the investment community  becomes aware of STTN?s HUGE upside =
potential as an  attractive " Emerging Growth Company". With STTN  trading =
today at around $3.00 per share, based on STTN?s  projections, we believe t=
hat by fiscal year 2002, STTN will  earn $ 8 Million Dollars on $ 32 Millio=
n in gross revenues, or $0.38  cents per share. Applying a conservative mul=
tiple of 30 times earnings  (less then STTN?s estimated growth rate), STTN =
 should be valued at $11.50 per share near term. Looking out to fiscal  yea=
r 2003 (which Wall Street Analysts are currently doing) STTN  projects $0.6=
1 cents per share in earnings, using the same price  earnings multiple of 3=
0, this could peg STTN?s stock  at over $18.50 per share over the next 12 m=
onths. At STTN?s  current price of around $3.00 per share, STTN appears to =
 be extremely undervalued, and potentially has HUGE UPSIDE.       SUMMARY  =
 With  lower interest rates, individual investors will seek an alternative =
 for better returns. In our opinion, the next time around, individual  inve=
stors will seek a more even playing field with the "big  boys", in executin=
g their trades. Individual investors are  more educated today regarding tra=
de execution and should migrate  to a Direct Access Trading platform such a=
n STTN. This should  make STTN?s business and STTN?s stock much  more valua=
ble in today?s market.      [IMAGE]  Disclaimer: [IMAGE] Marketwizaralerts =
