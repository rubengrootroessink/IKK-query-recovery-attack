EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called "red emerald") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their "flaws" have
come to serve almost as "fingerprints," while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be "re-oiled."


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the "Crater
of diamonds" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access
to wonderful designer jewelry at a fraction of regular retail
prices.  With almost 3,000 booths of diamonds and jewelry from
all over the world, this trade show brings the most beautiful
jewelry in the world to one place.

If you have special piece of jewelry you've always wanted but
didn't think you could afford, give us a call so we can find
it for you.  The same goes for color gem stones since we can
hand pick from the most beautiful colored stones in the world
for your special ring, pendant or bracelet.

While the Diamond Source of Virginia does not have an inventory
of diamonds or jewelry, we have accounts with the leading
wholesalers and designers across the country and can special
order your custom jewelry or pick it out in person at this show.
We go with our shopping list for our customers and return with
the best of the best.  If you have a special request, please
give Anne a call at 888-477-8385 and tell us what you want.


SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are "eye clean," many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

"SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye."

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say "visible to the unaided eye face-up." With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the "full value" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a "replacement" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the "Four C's."  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher "quality" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
