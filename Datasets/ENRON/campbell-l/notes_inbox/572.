Microsoft at E3
The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or "E3," is computer gaming's premier

the industry. Five huge Las Vegas convention halls will be packed solid with 
software and hardware shown to the public for the first time. Log into the 
Microsoft Games site on May 17th to follow this year's event, which will 
feature Xbox demos and the rollout of the next-generation console and PC 
titles. Don't miss the coverage on Ensemble Studios' follow-up to Age of 
Empires, Age of Mythology, which brings mythical monsters and heroes to 
real-time strategy. Microsoft will also be showing off Blood Wake, where

cocktail in years.

Chat with the Producer of Mechcommander 2
FASA's five-star general of game development, Mitch Gitelman, will field your 
questions May 31 in the Zone Theater chat room. With the sequel to the 
groundshaking Mechcommander RTS less than a month away from going gold, we're 
sure the conversation will be lively, especially when Mitch gets going on 
"spanking." As Mitch says, it's a topic "for mature readers, so don't show it 
to the reporter for Highlights magazine."
