1. Only send your timesheet if you have taken time off/rotation information 
has changed. Sorry, we are no longer tracking overtime since you are salary 
based. To all A/A Pool members: it is important that you let us know of any 
time you have taken off. To those members who are sending time on to your 
assistant, please make sure they forward that information on to the A/A 
program. With the Roll Out of SAP, you have the ability to go on-line @ 
http://ehronline.enron.com/ and input your time. I will continue to email for 
timesheets regardless if you go on-line. This is to let you know it is time 
to input your time or fills out your timesheet.
2. If you have moved recently, please provide the following and indicate the 
new changes when sending your timesheet.
