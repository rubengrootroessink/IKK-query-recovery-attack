"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

NRG respectfully requests a written clarification of the events and
consequences of the apparent schedule deviation on Phase I/II for December
08 HE21.  The data shows a schedule of 1100mw into NE and an actual flow of
450mw, a deficiency of at least 650mw for the entire hour.

Questions:
1. Is the data correct?  If no what was the error?  If yes see below;
2. Was there an emergency energy sale to HQ for this hour to cover the
deficiency?
3. What was the impact to energy and ancillary prices?
4. What was the impact on the NERC performance criteria (CPS1 and CPS2)?
5. Is the deficiency intended to be resolved thru inadvertent energy
account?


Below is the printout of the flow and schedule.

Thanks
