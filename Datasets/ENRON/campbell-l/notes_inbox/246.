> In preparation for the discussion of Agenda Item 5A--ICAP--at the November
> 30 meeting of BIC, attached are the following documents:
>
> 1. Additional proposed language on the deficiency charge,  for Section
> 5.14.1(a) of the proposed Tariff.
>
> 2. A proposed revised Section 5.12.10, to make that section accurate ( for
> ease of review, and at the BIC Chair's request, this document consists of
> two pages: a clean current Section 5.12.10 and a clean proposed Section
> 5.12.10;the blacklined versions are simply too difficult to follow).
>
> 3. Proposed revised definitions for 2.59a Forced Outage and 2.99a
> Maintenance Outage, plus a sheet showing outage definitions from various
> entities.
>
> 4. Fourteen revised blacklined pages showing miscellaneous changes
> (usually only one word per page) to correct typographical and other minor
> errors; page numbers match the ICAPWG proposed Tariff dated November 21;
> the newest changes are shaded.
>
> Hard copies of these documents will be distributed at the BIC meeting
> tomorrow as well. Please call or write with questions.
