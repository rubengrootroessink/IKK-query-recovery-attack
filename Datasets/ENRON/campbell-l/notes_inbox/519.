There are numerous emails floating around with suggested changes to the
EDRP and DADRP Manuals. This makes it very difficult for BIC members to
know what is to be voted on Thursday.

Either those wanting changes should come to BIC with motions to modifiy or
we put off the approvals at the moment until there is a better fix on what
it is we are voting for...(or hold revisions for later).
