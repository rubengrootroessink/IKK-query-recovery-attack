Dear Market Participant,

Please disregard that the previous Technical Bulletin # 67 email.
The attachment incorrectly included Technical Bulletin # 68 which
is addressed in a separate email.

Technical Bulletin # 67 - Automated Mitigation Procedure for the
Day-Ahead Energy Market - is being distributed for Market Participant
comment.  It will be posted to the NYISO web site 5 business days
from the date of this communication.

The purpose of our technical bulletins is to facilitate participation in the
NYISO by communicating various NYISO concepts, techniques, and
processes to Market Participants before they can be formally
documented in a NYISO manual.

Please forward comments on this Technical Bulletin via email to:

Peter Lemme
