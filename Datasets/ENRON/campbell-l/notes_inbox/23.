Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John
