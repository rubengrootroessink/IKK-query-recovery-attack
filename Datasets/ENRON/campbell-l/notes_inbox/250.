Dear Market Participants,

With regard to the change shown below:
FERC ruled that the implementation of Locational Reserve Pricing must be
delayed for a period of 5 months.
The literal interpretation of that would indicate a April 8th deployment.
I can't say for sure that we have committed to that date specifically, but I 
can
say it won't take place before then.
The specifications of the eventual change may look quite different in 5 months
time.

Regards,
Customer Relations
