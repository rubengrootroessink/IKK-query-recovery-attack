Chad,

To answer your question - bid cost guarantees should be entered by you, Larry 
or Narsimha as soon as you calculate them.  I will watch them periodically 
throughout the month to be sure you are calculating them correctly.  Any time 
you have a question about what NY is showing just ask.

Here is the reconciliation for April to date.  Could you please take a look 
at your calculations for 4/5, 4/6, 4/10, 4/15 & 4/16 - the variances are 
quite large.
If you want details just ask. 

Thanks,

Rebecca
