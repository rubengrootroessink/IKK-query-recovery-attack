NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Certainly the problem Don identified is legitimate and can still occur.
However, with the implementation of the ECAs we have seen a change in
bidding behavior at the interfaces - HAMs no longer bid at or near the caps.
Thus, by changing HAM prices of accepted DAM transactions to something like
+/- $500, you can be reasonably sure your transaction will flow.  If it
doesn't you may be far better off that it didn't.

The big concern I have with this is that it can again lead to huge
scheduling problems with neighboring control areas (once DAMs and HAMs are
all competing for the same space).  How is the ISO planning on better
coordinating with its neighbors - will lead times on accepted transactions
change?  Does the ISO have any comments?  Do we remember the letters that
were received from PJM - and can we afford scheduling snafus going into the
summer?
