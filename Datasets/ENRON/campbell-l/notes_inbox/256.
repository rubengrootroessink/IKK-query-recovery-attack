Hi Larry,

We haven't heard from you for a while and wanted to check back with you.  
Have you made a purchase yet?  If so, we would appreciate a reply to this 
message telling us you have already purchased so we will know not to send any 
more follow up messages.

If you are still shopping, is there anything we can do to help you with your 
buying decision?  Our goal is to help you make an informed decision that you 
will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
