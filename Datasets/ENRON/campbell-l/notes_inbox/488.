After going through the Representative, Hot Line, and finally turning to the 
TIE
(yes , last resort). I have all my questions and concerns addressed. MP's 
using
the forum helped tremendously. However the written and phone discussions with 
a
NYISO staff person who took a lot of time and patience helped me understand,
while not the ideal solution, the combination of bid guarantees, bid baby
sitting, ECA's, and a healthy dose of caution , the resulting procedures are 
the
best that can be crafted at this time. Because of all the resultant phone 
calls
that will be generated from those who want to know more details on how to work
their bids, I have definitely decided NOT to disclose that Bob Thompson was 
the
one who helped me. I don't want  Bob Thompson's workload increase if it got 
out.
So that is why I won't mention Bob Thompson's name in conjunction with this
subject....And that's final! Thanks Bob.
