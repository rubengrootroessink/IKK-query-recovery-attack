Alert Posted: 6:10 PM December 5, 2000: CGC Interruptible notice for Wed., 
12/06/00 at 10 AM.
ATTENTION CGC INTERRUPTIBLE CUSTOMERS AND THEIR SHIPPERS:
Effective at 10 AM, Wednesday, December 6, 2000 and until further notice, 
Chattanooga Gas Company (CGC) is issuing a curtailment order for all 
interruptible customers. The interruptible customers are limited to their 
scheduled gas from the interstate pipelines plus any firm contract amounts 
with CGC. No other CGC gas is available for interruptible sales at this time 
(sometimes these interruptible sales have been refered to as incremental or 
emergency gas).
