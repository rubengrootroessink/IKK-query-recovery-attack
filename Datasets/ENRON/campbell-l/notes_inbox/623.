Ann,
Please read the note below related to one of our guys who participates on the 
SW Environmental Team.  Does this really present a problem for the PRC 
process (when I believe there are forms available through the SDWT Manual for 
review purposes)?  I hope Roger Sumlin will correct me if I am too far off 
base on this.  At a minimum I wanted to give you a heads-up that this was a 
problem for the Bakersfield Plant folks and Scott Jones in particular.  John 
Shafer

John/Bill I was speaking with Scott Jones in Bakersfield and he wanted me to 
pass along to you that the server for Bakersfield has been down for the last 
two weeks and is expected to be down for an additional two more weeks.   He 
has been very limited in receiving his email and even less limited in sending 
anything out.   I know this will impact his PEP and interim review responses 
that he is to complete by the May deadline, but he's become a victim of 
circumstance.    His telephone number is 661-765-4087x9 if you should need to 
discuss anything with him.
