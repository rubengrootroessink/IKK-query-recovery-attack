Mr. Campbell,

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

You should double check this information with the field.

Ms. Jensen,

Do you have the correct heat rates (Btu/hp-hr) for the two engines at
the
Martin Co. #1 station in Texas?
