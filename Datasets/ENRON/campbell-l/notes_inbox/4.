I spoke with Eduardo Acosta at the TNRCC.  He has stated that if a turbine
is not subject to any NSPS or 30 TAC 117 requirements you don't have to list
them on an OP-UA form.  I've prepared the renewals with an OP-UA11 form that
makes a negative Subpart GG applicability statement.  However, if you prefer
I can remove these forms.  Having the forms in the permit makes it clear to
an inspector that the turbine is "grandfathered" from GG.  What is your
preference?
