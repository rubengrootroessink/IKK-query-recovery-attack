Maui
Hawaii's year-round warmth makes it ideal to visit any time of=20
year--it's the dreariness in the rest of the United States that makes=20
it especially attractive in the winter. That means you'll hardly be=20
the only visitor escaping the snow, but the island's languid=20
tropical pace makes crowds manageable. While on Maui, be sure to=20
visit the beaches on the western side. But don't stop there. The=20
eastern half of Maui is an unspoiled, uncrowded natural paradise,=20
where time flows at its own pace, and natural wonders such as the=20
Haleakala volcano are easily accessible.=20
