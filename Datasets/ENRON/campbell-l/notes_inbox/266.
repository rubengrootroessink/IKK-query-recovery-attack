>> >       In each case, you are told to call the 809 number right away.
>>Since

>>calls.
>>If

>>Or,

>>the
>> >  phone as
>> >    long as possible to increase the charges.
>> >
>> >       Unfortunately, when you get your phone bill, you'll often be
>>charged
>> >  more than
>> >    $24100.00.
>> >
>> >       WHY IT WORKS:
>> >     The 809 area code is located in the British Virgin Islands.
>> >
>> >       The 809 area code can be used as a "pay-per-call" number, similar
>>to
>>900
>> >     numbers in the US.
>> >
>> >       Since 809 is not in the US, it is not covered by U.S. regulations
>>of
>>900
>> >  numbers,
>> >    which require that you be notified and warned of charges and  rates
>> >  involved when
>> >    you call a "pay-per-call" number. There is also no  requirement that
>>the
>> >  company
>> >    provide a time period during which you may  terminate the call
>>without
>> >  being
>> >    charged.
>> >
>> >       Further, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number blocking to
>>avoid
>>these
>> >     kinds of charges, 900 number blocking will not prevent calls to the
>>809
>> >  area code.
>> >
>> >       We recommend that no matter how you get the message, if you are
>>asked to
>> >
>> >    call a number with an 809 area code that you don't recognize,
>>investigate
>> >  further
>> >    and/or disregard the message.
>> >
>> >       Be wary of email or calls asking you to call an 809 area code
>>number.
>> >  It's
>> >    important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying to
>>fight
>> >  the
>> >    charges afterwards can become a real nightmare. That's because  you
>>did
>> >  actually
>> >    make the call.
>> >
>> >       If you complain, both your local phone company and your long
>>distance
>> >  carrier
>> >    will not want to get involved and will most likely tell you that
>>they
