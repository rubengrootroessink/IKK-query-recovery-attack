Content

On April 4, 2001, we issued a memorandum which included information from
EPA regarding the Agency=01,s current thinking on the draft MACT standards =
for
IC engines and combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP
emissions (see Attachment A of attached file).  Since the distribution of
that memorandum, EPA has provided corrections regarding the compliance
monitoring requirements for the IC Engine MACTs.  The MACT information
provided by EPA, including the latest corrections regarding compliance
monitoring are included in this memorandum.  Clearly, this is preliminary
information and should not be construed as the content of the final rules.
This content could change before these rules are submitted to OMB,
subsequently issued as proposed standards, or promulgated as final rules.
