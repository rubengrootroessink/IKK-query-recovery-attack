Subject: SPS Grandfathered agreement on Blackwater tie.


This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

Jarrett Friddle
Supervisor, Tariff Administration
