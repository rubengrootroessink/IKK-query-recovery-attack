Larry, just to keep you posted, Jon has returned from CS 3 and 4.  He did
not find anything of concern.  We are working on the survey report and
should have it to you next week to review.  Will you be out all week in the
chopper, or will you be back before the end of the week?  Either way, we
should have a report for you to review by Wednesday, Thursday at the latest.
Does anyone else need a copy?  Let us know.  Thanks,  Scott

Gentlemen,

Our Navajo Nation Permit to conduct T&E species surveys just came across on
the fax machine.  Again, Jon Alstad will be traveling Tuesday and
conducting
the surveys on Wednesday.  Thanks to Devyn Richardson for expediting
receipt
of this permit.

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said "yes" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

     Terry.
