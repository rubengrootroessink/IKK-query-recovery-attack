Larry,

Here is the info on the Elizabethtown Suiza that should begin 9/1.  I was not 
copied on the e mail, but you should have received a notification to flow 
from JoAnn Lavine.  Utility turn on should be complete by CSC.  Please let me 
know if serving this site is a problem.



Thank you!

Susan
