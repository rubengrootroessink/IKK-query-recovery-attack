A records review training was given to the Carlsbad Team.   Files were 
established and purged of historic and non applicable documents.

A check in the amount of $5,250.00 was delivered to the TNRCC for the late 
annual certifications required under the Title V air permit program.

All dehys in Albuquerque region were entered into the GRI GLYCALC software to 
determine applicability to the O&G MACT standard.  Preliminary determinations 
indicate that no dehys will not be subject to the  new rule. 

An inspection was conducted of the Transwestern Pipeline Keystone C/S 
landfarm by the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The inspection went well and 
no deficiencies ro violations were identified by the agency.

Title V air permit for the two Arizona C/S's (Leupp and Klagetoh) which are 
on the Navajo Indian reservation were issued by the USEPA.  The permits seem 
to be very lenient in terms of requirements.  Meetings have been scheduled 
with each field team to assign roles and responsibilities to ensure 
complaince with each permit.
