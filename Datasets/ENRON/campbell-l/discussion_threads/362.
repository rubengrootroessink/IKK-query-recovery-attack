Eunice team,  The NNG Eunice C/S is required to prepare and submit the semi 
annual and annual reports required by the facilities Title V Operating Permit 
which was issued by the State of New Mexico.  The reports are required to be 
submitted to the state of New Mexico and the EPA by July 19, 2001.   These 
reports are required even though the facility is not in operation.  If you 
would like assistance in the preparation and submittal of each document, give 
me a call and we can set up a time to meet at the C/S to do each report.  
This should take about half a day.
