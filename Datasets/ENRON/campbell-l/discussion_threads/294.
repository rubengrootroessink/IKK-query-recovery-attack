Larry-
Remediation efforts to remove PSH have gone well recently and it is now time 
to focus more attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. This 
is reflected in the proposed scope.

Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains photos of the site. 

The cost estimate is $93,000. This figure includes only contract installation 
dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more than this. The 
bulk of this figure ($53,000) is for system modifications to focus more 
attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. 

If you get a chance to look at the photos, be sure to look at the last photo. 
This photo shows the interior of the SVE knockout box that was installed in 
Dec 1999 in the NE pit area. This installation has worked very well over the 
past two winter periods and has greatly increased the effectiveness of the 
SVE system. The SVE knockout box recently installed at the N Crawar site is 
nearly identical. 

Give me a call and lets discuss.

-George
