Bill Olson (OCD) has issued a letter, dated 8/19/99, approving TW's modified 
Groundwater Monitoring Plan and proposed Phase V Soil and Groundwater 
Assessment Plan. The modified monitoring plan will significantly reduce the 
routine groundwater sampling costs; from about $75,000 per year to $20,000 
per year. The Phase V assessment plan is relatively limited in scope. The 
plan includes the installation and sampling of three additional off-site 
wells into the uppermost aquifer. These activities will be on hold pending 
obtaining off-site access; either by means of a property exchange, business 
lease, or water development easement.
