Larry,

I called Roger this morning to make sure he had received the BA.  He said
that he had not yet gotten it, but that it should be there around noon.  I
asked him to be sure to get back to me ASAP with any inadequacies, so we
could fix them immediately.  He said that they have decided that they don't
need to have all of the ESA requirements satisfied prior to Public Noticing
the project.  This is good news.  He didn't say how soon they would be able
to Notice it, but they don't have to wait for the BA to be exactly what they
want it to be, prior to.  Scott
