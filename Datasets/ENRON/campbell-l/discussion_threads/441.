Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.
