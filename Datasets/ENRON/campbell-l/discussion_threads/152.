George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some 
help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
as possible.
