In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
