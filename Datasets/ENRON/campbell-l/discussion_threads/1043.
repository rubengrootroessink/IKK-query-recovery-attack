Subject: EnPower presentation

Duong Luu has agreed to give his EnPower presentation on Tuesday, December 12 
in EB 3125 from 1 to 2pm.  Felicia is making arrangements for a digital 
projector.  

I left general insturctions with Duong to give an overview of EnPower from a 
trading perspective.  A specific agenda and/or questions have not been given 
to Duong but would help him better prepare the presentation.  Please forward 
any questions regarding EnPower or topics needing coverage to me so I can 
compile them and give them to Duong.
