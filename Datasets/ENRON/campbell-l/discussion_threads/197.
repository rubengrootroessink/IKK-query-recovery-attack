This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions 
testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been 
submitted to 
t he TNRCC.   The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we 
also received an emissions reduction benefit.  According to the agency, this 
replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will 
be a plus for the company.  

My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make 
this happen.  I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.
