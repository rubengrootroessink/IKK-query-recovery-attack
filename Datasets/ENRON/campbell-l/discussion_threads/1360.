Enron announces UNLIMITED discounted AstroWorld tickets for employees.

Due to overwhelming employee feedback, we have negotiated unlimited 
discounted AstroWorld tickets for you and your family in place of the 
traditional "Enron Day At AstroWorld."  We hope this will allow Enron 
families to plan their fun-filled summer trips to AstroWorld at their own 
convenience.  Enron AstroWorld tickets are $20.56 (Retail $50), which 
includes admission for one, plus a $7 meal ticket to one of five restaurants 
at AstroWorld.

Six Flags AstroWorld is a world-class family entertainment complex filled 
with exciting rides and attractions, including 10 heart-pounding coasters, 
over  40 blockbuster shows, interactive street entertainers and star-studded 
concerts.  Enron families will be able to purchase unlimited tickets for use 
anytime during the 2001 season.

Tickets will be on sale at Enron's Federal Credit Union, EB0399.  Visit the 
credit union in person to make your purchases.  AstroWorld tickets will not 
be mailed.  Enron employees who are not already Enron FCU members may pay by 
cash or money order only.  All Enron Employees are encouraged to take 
advantage of this great summer fun deal and may purchase tickets through 
August 30th.
