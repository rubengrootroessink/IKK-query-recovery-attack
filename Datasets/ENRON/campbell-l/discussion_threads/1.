Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!
