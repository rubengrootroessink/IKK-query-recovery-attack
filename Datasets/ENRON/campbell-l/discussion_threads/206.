Project update







Follow up items from Kevin Hyatt

Q: What are the Btu restrictions of gas being delivered to major California
pipelines?

A:  TW's tariff calls for minimum 970 Btu's per cubic foot.  There is no
maximum Btu value specified.  The other qualification calls for " no
hydrocarbons in liquid form at the temperature and pressure at which the
gas is delivered into Transporter's pipeline system."  TW's contract spec
with SoCal reads the same way.  I could find no contract spec for the PG&E
or Mojave contracts so the default is TW's tariff.

Q: Have any Calif. LDC's done any NGL peaking injection in the past?

A: I spoke with Mike O'Donnell, Director of Gas System Operations for PG&E.
He recalls PG&E having some peaking equipment using NGL's on their system
10 - 15 years ago but nothing recent.  They had a vaporizer (maybe several)
situated on the lines as they came into San Francisco.  He also recalled a
vaporizer on a line that served a large electric power plant.
Interestingly enough, a Canadian outfit had called him recently asking the
same questions.  Mike indicated they would be interested in talking more
about the idea as we get further along

That's all for now, let me know if you have questions.
