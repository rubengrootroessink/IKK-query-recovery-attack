Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

Roger, to be sure I have all the right tools for your rough draft submittal
of the permits for compressor stations 3 and 4, please send me soemthing in
Word perfect  so that I can open and view.  I can open a PDF file so you
might want to send it that way as you suggested.  I hope that this message
isnt repetitive, as my email has been messed up and some of the stuff Ive
sent, hasnt made it to the intended person or agency.
