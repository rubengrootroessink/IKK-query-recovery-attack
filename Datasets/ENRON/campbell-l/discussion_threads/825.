>  At the beginning of my shift I placed a stethoscope

> One day I had to be the bearer of bad news when I told

> myocardial infarct. Not more that five minutes later,
> I heard her reporting to the rest of the family that

>  I was performing a complete physical, including the
> visual acuity test.  I placed the patient twenty feet
> from the chart and began, "Cover your right eye with
> your hand." He read the 20/20 line perfectly. "Now
> your left." Again, a flawless read. "Now both,"
> I requested.  There was silence. He couldn't even read
>
> the large E on the top line. I turned and discovered
> that he had done exactly what I had asked; he was
> standing there with both his eyes covered.  I was
> laughing too hard to finish the exam.

>  I was helping a patient into the bathroom when the

> This is a one-seater!"

>  During a patient's two week follow-up appointment

>  "The patch. The nurse told me to put on a new one
> every six hours and now I'm running out of places to
> put it!"
>  The doctor had him quickly undress and discovered
> what he hoped he wouldn't see....Yes, the man had over
>
> fifty patches on his body!  Now the instructions
> include removal of the old patch before applying a
> new one.

>  While acquainting myself with a new elderly patient,
> I asked, "How long have you been bedridden?"
>  After a look of complete confusion she answered, Why,
>
> not for about twenty years - when my husband was
> alive."
>
> ****************************************
>   And of course, the best is saved for last....I was
> caring for a woman from Kentucky and asked, "So how's
> your breakfast this morning?"
>  "It's very good, except for the Kentucky Jelly. I
> can't seem to get used to the taste," the patient
> replied.
>  I then asked to see the jelly and the woman produced
> a foil packet labeled "KY Jelly."
