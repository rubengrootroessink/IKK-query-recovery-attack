Please, print out the new transmission rate sheet and keep it in your trade 
books.  The accounting people are givingt us a fit about incorrect 
transmission prices in the system.  Requires mucho Advil.

Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael
