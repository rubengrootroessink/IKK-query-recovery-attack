Today is the last day for the discount subscription  price for our indexes. 
When you subscribe, you get our historical data to date.  Contact Jeff Maack, 
713/647-8802, or jeff.maack@ipgdirect.com.

To meet your needs, we are now posting the Cin and  Ent indexes each weekday 
by 9:15 a.m. If you send us prices, please do  so by 6:30 a.m. each day.
?
WILL YOU PLEASE INFORM YOUR NIGHT CREW that we're  calling each night to get 
deals? Some have been reluctant to divulge prices, not  realizing we've 
cleared their participation through the heads of the trading  desk/hourly 
desk.
?
Feel free to pass along the following (in  bold):

To: 24-hour desk crew
From: (hourly trading  manager)

TradersNews is now posting the hourly indexes each day at 9:15  a.m. CPT, to
facilitate financial swaps off the indexes. Please provide them  (Ellen 
Clardy,
Suzanna Strangmeier and Bobette Riner) with prices and  volumes, as well as 
the
source and sink for each hourly peak deal that  day.

They are indexing Cinergy, Entergy and AEP, and are collecting  prices to 
build
historical data for TVA, ComEd and SPP. The information will  not be published
until the NEXT day, and at no time will TradersNews identify  who did what or 
for
how much.

Thank you for your  cooperation.

If you or your crew have any questions (for  example, re: hub definitions),
please contact us. We thank  you!

Bobette
