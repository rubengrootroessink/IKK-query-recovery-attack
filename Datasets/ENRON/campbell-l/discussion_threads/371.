Larry,
Call Kimberly or Gina and talk to them about how they would suggest doing 
this.  They are both great people to work with and have been so helpful on 
other initiatives.  I know they will have some ideas.  It may be that EBIZ 
could be used or some other internal company media.   John

John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.

Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
"advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
with the RMEF?
