The recovery system continues to produce too much water in spite of using 
product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.
