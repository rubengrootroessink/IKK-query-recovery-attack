Mr. Campbell,

Here is my review of the Kingman Class I permit.  Please review my review of
the transition period operating hour limitations.  If my logic is correct I
can't see why ADEQ would limit us to 2000 hours per engine.  Using their
numbers it appears to me that allowing us to operate 4,380 hours (as
originally requested) would not cause an exceedance in the PSD levels.

Let me know if you have any additional comments.  I'm reviewing the
Flagstaff permit now.
