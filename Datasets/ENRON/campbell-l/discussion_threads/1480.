Romance in Paradise!

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called "Sin City" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

Earn 20,000 AAdvantage Bonus Miles When You Travel to Hawaii!
The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic 
getaway. That's because if you and your other half can't agree on a 
vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city 
person, and you crave nature? It's easy to please both on an island 
that boasts both crowded Honolulu and rugged 3,000-foot mountains--all 
within an area you can drive clear around in a matter of hours. 

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't 
expect five-star accommodations, at least not in every village. Do 
expect uncrowded, even empty stretches of sand, protected rainforest, 
and the best birdwatching of your life. If getting away from it all 
is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you. 

Win a Romantic Getaway for Two at a Mandalay Bay Property!

sometimes you just need to cut loose. Live a little. Enjoy some of

Book a surprisingly affordable suite at one of Vegas' many luxury

indoor rollercoaster together. And if it all seems to be working out 
well, you can even get married--hundreds of people do, every day.
