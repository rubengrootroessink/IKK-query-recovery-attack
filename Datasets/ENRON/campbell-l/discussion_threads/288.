Dear Larry,
?
The electronic copies of the Transwestern  Compressor stations reports 
completed by Statistical Research are attached as  PDF files. The reports are 
considered to be drafts and we look foward to  receiving reviewers comments. 
There are three PDF files:
?
transwest1 which contains the report for compressor  station 1;
?
transwest1_sitecard which contains the ASM site  card for the site recorded 
at compressor station 1 and;
?
transwest2 which contains the report for compressor  station 2.
?
I have also FedExed a hard copy of these documents  to Bret Fritch for AM 
delivery tomorrow.
?
Best regards,
?
