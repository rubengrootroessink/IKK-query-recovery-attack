Hello!

We are the Elves in Black and we are having a Holiday Raffle in the Enron 
Lobby to raise money for the Analyst & Associate Adopt-A-Family Program. Our 
table is located near the big Christmas tree and the escalators that go up to 
the Energizer. We are selling raffle tickets, 1 for $1 or 6 for $5, December 
4-7 from 11:00-2:00. The prize is a Night on the Town: $100 Papas gift card 
and two tickets to the play, "A Christmas Carol" showing at the Alley Theatre 
on Sunday, December 17 at 7:30 PM. The winning ticket will be picked later 
this week. Even if your ticket is not picked, you are still a winner by 
helping support this great program!

For more information please contact Khrissy Griffin (5-4997).

Thank you, The Elves in Black
