I received a call from Bill Olson (NMOCD) this morning regarding remediation 
activities at the Roswell Station. Bill said that Dave Cobrain with the NMED 
HRMB made a visit to the OCD's office yesterday to get an update on 
activities at the site. Bill said that he provided Mr. Cobrain with copies of 
assessment reports for the site. The last report submitted to the OCD was the 
"Phase IV Assessment Report, Ground Water Monitoring Report, & Phase V Ground 
Water Assessment Work Plan" dated June 30, 1999. The Phase V work plan was 
subsequently approved by the OCD in a letter dated August 19, 1999. The 
assessment activities had been on hold pending a resolution of off-site 
access issues. More recently, we obtained an amendment to the existing water 
development easement so that we could complete the Phase V assessment 
activities. This work is scheduled to be complete within the next 4-6 weeks. 
In a letter to the OCD dated August 29, 2000, we indicated that a report of 
ongoing groundwater monitoring activities and a Phase V assessment report 
would be submitted to the OCD office by December 31, 2000. This was the last 
written correspondence between the OCD and TW.

Bill also indicated that he has worked with Dave Cobrain before. Bill had 
several positive and encouraging comments about Dave and about his discussion 
with Dave, including comments from Dave to the effect that media should not 
be assumed to contain listed wastes and that TW should proceed with 
remediation with oversight by the OCD. Bill said that he informed Dave of 
certain outstanding issues that have impeded progress with remediation at 
this site. Bill also indicated to me that he was encouraged by Dave's 
involvement and with other individuals now on staff at the NMED HRMB.
