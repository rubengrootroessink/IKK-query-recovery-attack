All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?
Scott
