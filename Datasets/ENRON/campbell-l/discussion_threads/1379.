Dear Larry Campbell:

As a margin account holder, you know how important it is to receive 
information about your account in a quick and timely manner. One of 
the ways we notify customers about a margin call is with a letter, but 
unfortunately that letter often arrives too late for timely action. 
That's why we've decided to stop sending regular mail notification of 
margin calls to our customers. 

E-mail is the fastest way for us to notify you about a margin call. We 
will continue to provide you with speedy e-mail notification, and are 
committed to steadily improving our already top-rated e-mail service. 
Please check your inbox regularly and make sure that the e-mail 
address we have on file for your account is current. 

To update your e-mail address online, simply login to your account and 
select "Settings" from the Account Services pull-down menu. Then click 
"User Profile" and follow the directions to modify your e-mail address. 

We'd like to remind you of your responsibility to remain aware of the 
status of your margin account at all times, and to be prepared to take 
action as soon as conditions warrant. Be fully aware that if at any 
time your account value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if 
market conditions warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or 
all of your positions with or without notice, at our sole discretion. 
For these reasons it is imperative that you monitor your account on a 
regular basis. 

If you have any questions please send e-mail to support@datek.com or 
call Customer Support at 1-800-U2-DATEK. Please call 201-761-7500 if 
you are calling from outside of the United States. 

Sincerely, 

John J. Mullin 
President 
Datek Online Brokerage Services LLC
