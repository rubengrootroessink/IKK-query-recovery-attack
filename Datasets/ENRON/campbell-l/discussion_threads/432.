Guys,

A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of 
April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ.  You should probably take a rough 
count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates.  You 
should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., 
Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.).  Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when 
any meetings like that might occur.   If you don't reserve space at the 
Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, 
etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other 
gathering that has the hotel booked.

Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any 
blockage for the dates you select.  Before you know it the time slots will 
fill up for guys like Randy.  

Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of 
some gift item from the Signature Shop (with Enron logo) for the attendees to 
take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners 
that will join us for the second day of the meeting).  We can discuss what 
will be appropriate.  

A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if 
you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting.  I believe 
you will have to get pre-approval from the Enron group that has to approve a 
meeting of this magnitude.
