The NYISO will be posting invoices for November, 2000 to each Customer's
website, as of 1700 December 08.

Funds due the NYISO are to be transferred into the NYISO Clearing Account by
close of business Monday, December 18, 2000.   Funds due Market Participants
from the NYISO will be transferred to Market Participant accounts on 
Wednesday,
December 20, 2000.  A letter containing transfer and NYISO Clearing Account
information will be issued later today.

Please be aware that as per the ISO Services Tariff any disputed amounts are 
to
be paid in full.  Upon resolution of the dispute, if it is determined that an
overpayment has been made by the Customer, a refund, with interest, will be 
made
by the ISO.
