Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a=
=20
problem.  If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger=20
requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.  For instanc=
e,=20
if a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be=20
emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978=
=20
tank regulations.  If the tank had remained at its original location, it=20
would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.  However, because the tan=
k=20
was relocated, it is looked upon as being a tank constructed in 1978 and=20
subject to the 1978 regulations and is no longer grandfathered.

I was not given this information during the records review, so I dont know =
if=20
any of the tanks apply.  If any of the tanks fit into the above scenerio,=
=20
EOTT or Koch will be  looking at some major $$$$$ to bring any subject tank=
=20
into compliance.  Generally speaking, the regualtions and costs to comply=
=20
increase as a function of date.   =20


1. Q. Of the tanks listed on the spreadsheet, have any of the tanks been=20
relocated from its original construction locations?  List the tank, date=20
moved and   location moved to.
A.  Benevides Station Tank 6125 and Mirando Station Tank 28591 were relocat=
ed=20
to those stations.  Three Rivers Tanks 28508 and 28100 were   relocated and=
=20
re-erected at that station.  Duval Station Tank 28052 and Mirando Station=
=20
28045 were relocated and re-erected at those stations prior  to Koch=01,s=
=20
acquisition of those assets.
