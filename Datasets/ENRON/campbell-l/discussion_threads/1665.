Discussion List:

The EDRP and DADRP manuals will be voted on at Thursday's BIC.  We will
start with the manuals as sent out by Kristen Kranz at 5:37 on 5/21.  If we
want to make changes, we will do so through the formal amendment process at
the BIC.  If anyone has changes that rise to that level, please let the rest
of us know very soon so we can review and coordinate possible amendments.
Thanks.

Larry
