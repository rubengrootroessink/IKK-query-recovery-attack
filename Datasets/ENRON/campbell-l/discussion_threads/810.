Dear Market Participants,

On November 15, 2000, the New York Independent System Operator,
Inc. filed a reformatted version of the NYISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT).  The new version is entitled New York Independent System
Operator, Inc.,  FERC Electric Tariff,  Original Volume No. 1.

This filing was made to comply with the FERC's Order No. 614, issued
March 31, 2000 in Docket No. RM99-12-000, 99 FERC   61,352 (2000).
Order 614 amended the FERC's regulations concerning the designation
of electric rate schedule sheets. This order changed the titles and
other administrative information to be shown at the top and bottom of
each tariff sheet, thus necessitating that the NYISO modify the information
included on the NYISO's tariff sheets.

The tariff filed on November 15, 2000 does not include any change in
the content of the tariff.  It does include the administrative changes
described above and a repagination and reformatting to facilitate
existing and future changes.  This tariff includes all tariff modifications
that were filed before September 1, 2000, and have been approved by the
FERC.  The tariff does not reflect filings made on or after September 1, 2000.
The tariff also does not reflect the NYISO's February 11, 2000 compliance
filing in Docket No. ER97-1523-029, which still awaits Commission action.

Once this tariff has been approved by the FERC, the NYISO will create and
post a consolidated version of the OATT that shows all approved and
proposed changes.  This new consolidated version will be comparable to
and replace the current consolidated OATT posted on the NYISO website.

The November 15, 2000 filing can be found on the NYISO website at:
