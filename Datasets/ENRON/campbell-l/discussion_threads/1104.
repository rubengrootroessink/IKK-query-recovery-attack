Dear members of the TIE List-Serve,

The conference call for the BME Focus Group scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon, 12/13, has been cancelled.

The white papers that were to be discussed on that call will be discussed,
time permitting, at the S&P Working Group Meeting 12/18/00.

If you have any questions about this notice, please email them to Mollie
Lampi at mlampi@nyiso.com.

Thank you.
