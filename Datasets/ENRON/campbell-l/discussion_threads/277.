Larry,

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be an USGS aerial available that
covers Station 1.  In case you need them, I did find coverage for station 3
and 4.

Additionally, there is no published soil surveys covering any of the station
sites.  I intend to word resource report 7 to reflect that.  I will also
address impacts to soils.  I think this will suffice.  We did get some
vegetation descriptions put together for the areas in and around the
stations.

Terry.
