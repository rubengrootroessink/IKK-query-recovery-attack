Team,

Here are the meeting minutes as I captured them from the Gas Injection
portion of our meeting on Tuesday.  Please take some time to review and let
me know if I missed anything or made any mistakes in my note taking.  I
look forward to working with everyone to see if we can make this happen.

Thanks for your help!
