==> We are Slashing our prices on all Thanksgiving Day Games.
Lay 5% instead of ten on all the games on Turkey Day. Higher Parlays Odds.
In the NFL, New England squares off against Detroit and Minnesota tries to
win one on the road over Dallas.
Toronto and Indiana play in an NBA TNT game which means juiceless first and
second half wagering as well.

Well remember Friday is 5% on all games, every week. True parlay odds. 2
team parlays pay 2.8 to 1, 3 team parlays pay 6.4 to 1 and 4 team parlays
