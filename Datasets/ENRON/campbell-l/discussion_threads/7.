Bill

Attached is the letter and analysis spreadsheet sent to Rod Boschee today. 
The letter outlines the additional interim steps identified at this weeks 
meeting. The letter also contains reference to a spike in the analysis 
results at Transwesterns Measuring Station filter separator. The split sample 
came back at this site at 216/185 PPM. We are making arrangements to have the 
sample rerun at another lab. All other analysis points remained consistent 
with last week. Lou Soldano advised me that since the spike occurred on our 
equipment, that it may not be worthy of my personal phone call to Rod.

Lou Soldano has also prepared a draft of a letter for you to send to Mr 
Mazotti regarding our on going concern and additional plans. He has, or will 
be sending that to you directly.

If you have any questions, please call.

Mike
