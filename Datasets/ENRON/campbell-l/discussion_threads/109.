>  >
>  > "Oh, I got some cats, said the little boy.

>  >
>  > "What are you going to do with them?" Jesus

>  > Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm

>  >
>  > "And what will you do when you get done  with

>  > "Oh, I'll kill 'em, Satan glared proudly.
>  >
>  > "How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.

>  > "Oh, you don't want those people. They  ain't
