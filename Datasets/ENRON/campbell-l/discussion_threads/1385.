Please see my comments in red below. Thanks - Bill Rust

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA=01,s network services.

1. Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy=
.
a. Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3DAEP, SINK=3DMDEA, BID =
PRICE =3D=20
$0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2. Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy. =20
a. Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DLAGN, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3D(LAGN UNIT NAME), SIN=
K=3DMDEA,=20
BID PRICE =3D $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will b=
e=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXI=
A)=20
use POR=3DEES.=20

3. Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sep=
a=20
is not flowing and we can bring MGW=01,s in from the Tva border.
a. Ex.  We find 11 MGW=01,s  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DMDEA, SOURCE=3DLGE, SINK=3DMDEA, BID=
 PRICE =3D=20
$0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying=20
(displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarif=
y=20
this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered=
=20
F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must=
=20
request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is=
=20
NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load=20
share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem. =
 I=20
just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with=20
Entergy Transmission.
