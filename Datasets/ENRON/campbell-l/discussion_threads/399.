Sta.3, 4 and 5

As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required 
to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff 
Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample 
collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months 
completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to 
send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a 
monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor 
station.     

Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 
agencies:

 Navajo Nation EPA
 P.O. Box 339
 Window Rock, AZ 86515

 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager


 US EPA    Region IX
 75 Hawthorne Street
 San Francisco, CA 94105

 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)


Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation 
EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated 
that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.

I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab 
selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 
4 and 5 reports to station 5.

The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking 
water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some 
changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the 
submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022..
