"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

The ICAP Deficiency auction results indicate a price for the Rest Of State
that I believe is equal to the ICAP deficiency price.  Likewise, the Long
Island price appears to be the deficiency price.  How much capacity
requirement in each region was unmet by the deficiency auction?
