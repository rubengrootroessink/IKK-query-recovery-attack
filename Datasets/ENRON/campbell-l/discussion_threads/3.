Subject: Dating Asian Women


Don't get offended, it's only a joke...obviously written by some bitter Asian 
guy.

Caucasian women:
First date: You get to kiss her good night.
Second date: You get to grope all over and make out.
Third date: You get to have sex in the missionary position. Then you promise 
to marry her but will probably abandon the idea.

Indian women:
First date: You meet the girl.
Second date: You set the wedding date.
Thrid date: The wedding night.



Chinese women:

First date: You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happens.
Second date: You buy her an even more expensive dinner but nothing happens 
too.
Third date: You don't even get to the third date and you have already 
realized nothing is going to happen.

Vietnamese girls:
First date: What first date? ... no such thing
Second date: You get married to some girl you've never seen before from 
overseas.
Third date: You divorce, get paid $10,000 from her family (minus a percentage 
from the guy that set you up).but only after you've helped them all immigrate 
to Canada or US take your pick.

Filipino girls:
First date: It took you forever to get a date with this really hot chick of 
your dreams (that has a killer bod), but she won't let you even kiss her.
Second date: She takes you to church and everyone thinks you're really cute 
and such a nice guy; but you still haven't even kissed her because she's a 
"proper girl".
Third date: You kiss for the first time, but miraculously she ends up 
pregnant and you have to marry her or her cousins, brothers, uncles, etc., 
will cut your penis off, and you keep wondering what happened!? Even more 
miraculous: the kid IS yours!

Korean girls:
First date: She only went out with you cause she hates the steroid-pumped, 
chauvinistic Korean guys that
are always after her.

Second date: She flirts with all your friends, but ignores you.

Third date: She's dumped you and is going out with a black guy that is 3 
times your size (in every way). She doesn't even "remember" who you are, 
neither do her friends so you have no chance of ever going out again with a 
Korean chick cause they all talk and you were an asshole anyway.

Japanese women:
First date: She's shy, so you don't get to kiss her at all.
Second date: She'll take a bath in front of you and let you smell her panties.
Third date: You get to have kinky sex with her. Then she will bid you 
sayonara as that was her fling before getting married to a Japanese man.



Thai girls:
First date: You flirted with her while she was giving you a really bad lap 
dance.
Second date: You go play pool, see a movie, or meet at a club and she tells 
you how she is making so little money here, but better than her computer 
programming job back in Thailand. You're not really paying attention though 
because this is the first time you've seen her in the light and without 
make-up, the smoky haze, and the influence of alcohol.she is BUTT ugly!
Third date: She smiles and says hi as she passes you while she's on her way 
over to the table with all the
Chinese/Vietnamese gangsters.  She'll spend the rest of the night 
lap-dancing/smoking/talking with them.
You're afraid to look over cause you think you'll get shot or jumped in the 
parking lot. You vow to never go
there again, at least till your friend tells you about "this really hot chick 
he saw there."



And finally ...

ABC (American Born Chinese) girls:
First date: She met you in a group of people and you were the only Asian guy 
in the group. In fact you two are the only Asians in the group cause you're 
both bananas. People think you two should go out cause you're both 
Chinese."   Second date: You go to dim sum, but neither of you can order 
because neither of you speak Chinese. The waiters give you really bad 
service, and you don't get any specials.
Third date: It doesn't work out, cause you're not Asian enough and she goes 
back out with some white guy she dated 5 years ago.  Eventually they get 
married and the Asian population diminishes! Or she decides she's a lesbian 
and goes out with some really Bohemian white chick that's into alternative 
music. and ends up fighting for some social cause for the rest of her life.



You marry an Asian girl and wonder what ever happened to your 
life...Or...money!!
