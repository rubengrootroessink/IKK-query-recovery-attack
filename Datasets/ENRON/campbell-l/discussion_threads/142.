I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test 
at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with 
carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.  I will send out the 
letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.  I 
would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports 
installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing 
completed ASAP.  Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel 
mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator 
on.  Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that 
we follow a portocol that I will submit to the state.
