As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron=01,s history.  We must =
adapt=20
our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this=
=20
time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate=
=20
suspension of the following programs.

? ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program=
=20
will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service=20
orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be=
=20
honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effecti=
ve=20
January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized=20
Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their=
=20
service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
? Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron=01,s Matchin=
g=20
Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consid=
er=20
the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is=20
appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable=
=20
contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees=01, volunteer=
=20
hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions=20
received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look=
=20
for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.
