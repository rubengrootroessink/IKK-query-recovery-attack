Larry,
I think you should go forward with the meeting to show that this is a 
critically important issue for TWP. I hope that Sarah can be there, but if 
she can't, is there another person in addition to yourself? Assuming Prabat 
joins Shudeish, we had anticipated this as the first step, particularly 
because we would like to resolve this with the "first-line" regulators for 
long-term good relations; Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the 
sidelines, to the extent he is consulted. If the first meeting is a 
stonewall, we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy, but let's make the first 
effort with Shudeish & Prabat.
A couple of thoughts. ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within 
41 days of the application, at the latest; altho this time frame may not have 
been met, it may have been because of follow-up questions on the netting 
calculation. Also, was there any discussion whether any of the following 
applied:
     a. Facility change allowed w/o permit revision (R18-2-317)
     b. Minor permit revision (R18-2-319.A), which could shorten EPA review 
time and possibly avoid a public hearing
     c. Accelerated processing (R18-2-326.N)
These may have been hashed out in pre-application meetings, and water under 
the bridge now, particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as 
NEW permits (compare the numbers on DEQ's completeness determination letters 
with the numbers on the "permit revision applications"), but the story of net 
benefits to air quality, as well as the need to improve energy supply to 
California, should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the 
line, as you had been told in the spring. It may be that Shudeish and Prabat 
need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment change-over.
Bottom line, I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day 
available this week. It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the 
way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in 
overcoming those barriers. It is important also that ADEQ understand that 
there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the 
project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial 
assurances of prompt review. [can you send me that list?] If Shudeish and 
Prabat are to be barriers, it is important to know as soon as possible so we 
can start moving up the chain.
There are, in fact, a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now, 
and the Corporation Commission's Facility Siting Committee is taking a 
pro-environment bent (following the Calif AQMDs), but a number of these 
projects also are dealing with county, rather than state, permits.
I will be available Thursday to take before and/or after the DEQ meeting.

Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would
not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting
and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a
good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending
in Sarah's place?

Subject:  Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.
His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him,
that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in
this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that
we could choose this avenue if we desired.

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.
