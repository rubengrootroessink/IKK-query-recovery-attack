As you requested, I prepared a list of requirements applicable to tanks that 
store hazardous wastes at LQG facilities.  I did not include specific 
recordkeeping and inspection requirements - you can find those in the 
procedures manual, Procedure 9.1.30 and 9.1.40.

If you have any questions, please call me at 281-997-9638.

Sue
