Scheduled for 11/30/00 & 12/5/00
Change type - Enhancement
Description:
Import Bilateral Fix.  Changes to billing software were made to
balance import transactions in real time for Balancing TUC's and
Balancing LBMP, and to calculate the balancing of load buses in
real time where imports are settled at what they were bid, not at
what they are scheduled.  The change was not factored in the June
re-bill.

The 12/05/00 backup dispatch test is the regularly scheduled
monthly test done by Operations.
