??Breeders' Cup Success=20




This  year's Breeders' Cup was a vintage affair and the busiest yet at =20
Sportingbet USA! We had all of our phone clerks busy as bees trying  to tak=
e=20
all of the action spawned by the pony runs. All of our phone  lines were ti=
ed=20
up as horse enthusiasts were frantically calling in  to place bets on their=
=20
favorite picks before the next race was about  to begin. There were a lot o=
f=20
unexpected surprises as long shots,  such as Spain which paid 50-to-1,=20
eclipsed the favorites. The  succession of thrilling finishes had many of o=
ur=20
members on the edge  of their seats, not to mention our clerks on their=20
toes.  Congratulations to all of the big winners who were lucky -shrewd- =
