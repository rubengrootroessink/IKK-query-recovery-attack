Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott
