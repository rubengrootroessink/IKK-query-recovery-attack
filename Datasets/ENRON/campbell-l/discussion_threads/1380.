Dear Market Participants,

The draft final report of the Regional DAM Feasibility Study has been issued
and posted to the NYISO web site.  Two versions are available for your 
perusal -
a red-lined mark up showing changes made from the preliminary report, and a
clean
version of the entire draft final report.  The links to the report are as
follows:

Clean version:

lean.pdf



Any final comments on the draft report should be sent to LECG at the following
address not later than May 2:

damstudy@lecg.com

The final report will be issued and posted to the NYISO web site on Friday, 
May
4.

At the meeting with MPs on April 26, Scott Harvey of LECG gave a presentation 
on
the changes that were
incorporated into the draft final report.   You may view the slides from this

Also at the meeting, Tony Elacqua of the NYISO presented some ideas for
consideration regarding a possible
phase II scope.  The slides presented at the meeting may be found at this 
link:

Market Participants are encouraged to review these slides about the potential
phase II scope and
to forward any comments to the following NYISO, ISO-NE and IMO addresses:

aelacqua@nyiso.com, darren.finkbeiner@theIMO.com, rburke@iso-ne.com

It is intended that future action on the Regional DAM Study will be discussed 
at
an upcoming BIC meeting.

Thank you,
