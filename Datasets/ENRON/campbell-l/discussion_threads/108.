Another meeting was held with PG&E to discuss results of the latest sampling 
and construction activities on their system.  DAta from sampling has shown 
that PCB's are steadily increasing into further portions of the PG&E system.  
The latest sampling results showed positive hits on their mainline system at 
MP 63.26 where 4 oz. of liquids were removed from a siphon.  The analytical 
result of this liquid was 10 ppm.  PG&E and Southwest Gas are continuing 
their internal sampling efforts to identifiy additional places within their 
systems where PCB's may collect  and would be passed on to their customers.  
It should also be noted that  PG&E is and will be continuing their efforts of 
installing small filter separators at strategic interconnects to protect and 
remove PCBs from entering customer and LDC lines.

Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the TW  Walton 
and NNG Seminole and Plainview C/S's

Title V air permits were receied from Region IX EPA for the Leupp and 
Klagetoh C/S's, which are on the Navajo Reservation.  A roles and 
responsibilities meeting was held with the Flagstaff Team for the Leupp Title 
V permit.  A meeting will be scheduled with the Gallup in the near future to 
assign roles and responsibilities for the Klagetoh permit.
