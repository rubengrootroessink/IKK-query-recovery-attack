Larry,

I faxed you the cover letter.  The draft permits and statements of basis
should appear on the website within two hours.  And I have attached the
four files in PDF format.  Call if you have questions.  Thanks.

Roger, I printed the Calpine permits and everything worked fine.  Am
looking forward to seeing my permits.  Any idea as to when they will be
placed on the EPA website?  The reason I ask is that I need to travel to
Flagstaff Az and cant go untill I make copies of  the Sta 3 and 4 permit
drafts. Roswell to Flagstaff is 500 miles.
Whatever you can do will really help.

Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

Roger, to be sure I have all the right tools for your rough draft submittal
of the permits for compressor stations 3 and 4, please send me soemthing in
Word perfect  so that I can open and view.  I can open a PDF file so you
might want to send it that way as you suggested.  I hope that this message
isnt repetitive, as my email has been messed up and some of the stuff Ive
sent, hasnt made it to the intended person or agency.
