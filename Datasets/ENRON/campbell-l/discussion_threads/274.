All pictures are approximately 300 to 400 yards East or upstream of EOTT's
proposed crossing. Pictures were taken after a heavy rain the night before,
there was a small amount of standing water but not any flow of water in the
channel.

1- West Kern levee road across by-pass channel.
2- Weir down stream of levee road.
3- Same weir down stream of levee road.
4- By-Pass channel looking west or down stream of the weir, once again no
flow of water in the channel.
5- By-Pass channel looking downstream in a north west direction from the
weir.
6- By-Pass channel looking West.
7- By-Pass channel looking West showing South bank of the channel. In the
top left corner notice a southern California Gas pipeline marker at there
crossing of the channel. EOTT's proposed crossing is just West or
downstream of SC crossing.
8- Levee Road East of or upstream of weir. At the time of the pictures
there appeared to be some electrical conduit being laid across the levee
road.
