A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and 
responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S.

The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.  A permit revision was 
requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the 
existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit 
replacements without agency notification.

Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and 
Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.  Analytical shows that the 
PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.  Ralph 
Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning  SoCal's experience 
with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting 
in San Francisco.

The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion 
and submitted to M. Nelson for signature.
