Larry, I will get started on identifying any changes in the business plan
and I will keep you apprised of the testing results and any issues that may
arise on the business plan update. I will certainly contact you if I need
help.
Thanks again,
                            Scott

Good choice of words, I've got some learning to do but I know you guys will
help keep me on the path. I really do appreciate all of your help with
everything Larry. I will get this to the APCD today and will keep you
informed of anything that comes about.
Thanks,
                Scott

Scott, I made some minor changes, use if you wish.  Also, if you are going
to copy to someone in Harvey's organization, place his name and address at
the bottom of the letter.  Good job.

Larry,  Attached is a letter that needs to be sent to the APCD due to
problems which kept us from testing the #2 heater. I would like you to look
it over and express any changes you may see necessary, I will than sign and
deliver it.
Thanks,
