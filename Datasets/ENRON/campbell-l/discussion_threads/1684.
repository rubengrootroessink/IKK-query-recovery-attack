Attached are a clean and blacklined revised version of Attachment J to the
proposed ICAP Manual that will come before BIC on May 24. The Attachment J
circulated last week had some glitches in it. This Attachment J has been
blacklined against the one circulated last week so you can readily see the
differences.

I apologize for any inconvenience.
