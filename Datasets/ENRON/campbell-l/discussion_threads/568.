Please find attached below a list of PG&E Energy Trading scheduling contacts.

We have been advised that the schedulers can handle small volumetric changes 
and they will advise if you need to talk to a trader. The trader contacts (if 
needed) are as follows:

East - John Ed James - 713.371.6673
Midwest - Tom Dickey - 713.371.6163
West - Allen King - 713.371.6123

Both John and Tom will be leaving ET at the end of the summer. Allen is the 
only individual who will be transferring to the Bethesda, MD office. 

Please advise with any questions. Thanks. 

Tim
