On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the 
above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated 
into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves 
natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a 
media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which 
receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only 
the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement.  

The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor 
changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that 
this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are 
diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release.  
A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie 
or myself. 

Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate 
sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas 
system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system.  
Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled 
in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting.
