Attached is a spreadsheet which details all transactions added to the RGS 
database during the current day.  Please review the accuracy of all deals for 
which you are responsible.   I cannot make changes to any deals.  If deals 
are incorrect, please unwind the deals and restructure them correctly by no 
later 6:30 PM: the MTM process begins its calculation at this time.

If you have any questions, please call me at x37847.

Tom
