Mark Mentzer says:
"When I enrolled at The University I had little skills in the web process.
Now six months later they are providing me with site work where I have
earned from $400-$1000 in a 2-4 day period!  I've built a valuable
portfolio that I can market to potential clients or employees.
This school was a big break for me."

Jennifer Den Adel said:
"The staff at The University has been great. In fact, I started out
as an intern, and through this past year I've found flexible hours,
an invaluable work experience, and the ability to earn a great income.
This School has really opened the doors for me!"

Paul Luecke mentioned:
"With the fantastic program at this school, I was able to pay for
my training in about two weeks worth of work for their clients!
To learn this skill was great....but to have a program where
the University basically paid me to learn was unbelievable!"
