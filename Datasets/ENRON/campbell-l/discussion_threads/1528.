The "Rules, Procedures and Guidelines for the Summer 2001 Reconfiguration
Auctions of TCCs" will be posted on the NYISO web site on May 9th.  It can be
found on the NYISO web site by selecting "THE MARKETS" from the home page.  
Then
select "Transmission Congestion Contracts - TCC Market" and "Additional TCC
Auction Information".  The document is posted under the heading "Summer 2001 
TCC
Auction".  It is also provided as an attachment to this notice.

This document contains the "Sale Agreement" which must be completed and 
returned
to the NYISO via an overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on May 11th and the
"Purchase Agreement" which must be completed and returned to the NYISO via an
overnight mail service by 5:00 PM on May 11th.  The NYISO regrets any
inconvenience caused by the short notice.  Please note that these "Agreements"
are identical to those used for the Spring 2001 Initial Auction of TCCs except
for the relevant date references.

The revisions to these "Rules" are the following:

References to "Winter 2000/2001" were changed to "Summer 2001".
The address of the  Auctioneer was changed to the NYISO's Washington Avenue 
Ext.
facility.
The final version of the Time Line provided as Attachment C differs slightly
from the Preliminary Time Line posted on the NYISO web site.
Section 6.8 was revised and Attachment G was added to define the rules that
Buyers of TCCs using the HQ Proxy bus as a POI or POW must follow when
submitting their bids.
