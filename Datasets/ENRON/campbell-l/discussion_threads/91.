Attended the construction projects meeting in Albuq. to discuss whether 
environmental costs and issues are included in the capital projects for 2000.

A conference call was held to discuss the late submittals in 1999 for the 
annual certifications for 7 Title V facilities in Texas.  The results of the 
meeting it was decided that a consultant would contact the TNRCC and find out 
if Northern would benefit from  offering "suplemental environmental projects" 
performed on the system to further reduce the NOV amount.  The TNRCC assessed 
a fine in the amount of $13,125 of which $2625 was reduced  for self 
reporting and the reputation that  NNG has with the TNRCC.   Additional 
actions may be taken including meeting with the agency to discuss further $$$ 
reductions.

The proposed removal date for the turbine at C/S 8 is 3/31.  

A meeting was held with the Mountainair team to discuss Title V permit 
complaince and emisisons testing  during the April outage.

Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the state of Arizona for C/S 
1, 2, and the Flagstaff Lateral.

The TNRCC announced that they would conduct air inspections at the following 
facilites:  Wt-2, Walton and Keystone C/S's.  The Kermit team has been 
notified and is compiling the necessary records and paperwork for the 3/31
