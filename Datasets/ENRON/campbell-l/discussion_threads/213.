Larry,
Here is the DFG-1603 notification cover letter and Attachment 1 (project
description and responses to questionnaire). This notification is required
for any disturbance of streams, rivers, wetlands, etc.  Unfortunately, the
State DFG requires notification as the area in question appears as a "blue
line" on USGS maps and is also a designated floodway.  The actual DFG forms
(2 pg notification and 3 pg enviro. questionnaire) and attachments will be
faxed to you and hard copy Fed-Ex'd today.  The other attachments are
available only in hard copy and will also be included in the package.
(Sorry, I missed the Fed-Ex pick-up last night).
