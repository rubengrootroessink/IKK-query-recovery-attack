I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter 
that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting 
Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been 
indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue 
at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a 
couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to 
discuss the issue with Arco.
I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.
