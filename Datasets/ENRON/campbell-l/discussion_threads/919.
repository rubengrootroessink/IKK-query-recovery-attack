Dear Market Participants,

- At about 6:30PM (1830) on November 22, 2000 the Production
Mainframe was restarted at the request of the Shift Supervisor
(for time not updating on screens).

- The Mainframe-Spider Data Exchange (DEX) did not initialize
correctly at that time causing a failure to send any 5-min data
(MWs and LBMPs)  to the MIS.

- The problem was finally corrected at approximately 7:15PM (1914)
which re-established the DEX.

- We have been able to reconstruct the LBMPs that were calculated
during this problem period, as well as the PTS data.

- This data was posted and the final billing for Nov will include this data.

Regards,
Customer Relations
