Based on the call from Rod Boschee today noting meetings set up with 
Southwest, Lou and Larry Campbell will be attending. I believe it would be 
helpful for Dave Schafer or a rep from communications to attend, as well. 
PG&E appears to be getting ready to divert attention to us. Worthwhile to 
read the PG&E media statement at the end of this lotus notes. Mike

FYI - it also appears that there is a meeting next tuesday in Vegas with SW 
Gas and SoCal.   They will have PG&E media folks ther to discuss possible 
public distribuion of some type of notice concerning this matter.

Dave Schafer (VP of HR and Media) is unavailable so I would suggest that 
Larry, myself and possibly someone from market - Lorraine??? - also attend.

please see the attached.   Comments???  I doubt that PG&E would make any 
changes.  I'd still like to make some suggestions.  Dave - it might be 
worthwile to speak to your counterpart who appear to be Jon Tremayne.   At 
least we have a heads up on thier response.  I'll review our last Q&A and 
send the comments to Dave.

Lou --

Attached is the current version of our Standby statement (i.e., statement to
read to media, in the event they "call").


 <<000207s2.doc>>

To date, and through history of our gas quality matters betw. TW and PG&E,
we have had no calls, and therefore, we have NOT externally utilized this
statement.

We (you and I) should chat this PM or tomorrow Friday, re any developments.

Cheers!

Dave, 415-973-6659

(I am cc'ing Rod and Jon Tremayne of our News Dept.)
