As most of you are aware, a Consolidation Audit was performed at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR during the month of November 2000 by a selected ENRON group.
As a result of the audit, a task list was put together by the Audit Team,
which identifies names & completion dates that were assigned to each task
on the list.

Below is a file that has your name on it, this file has a list of Audit
Action Items that you are responsible to complete. You must complete, and
update me on each action item on or before it's assigned due date. You are
also responsible for ensuring that the proper documentation supporting the
completion of each action item is sent to me in a timely manner. If you
have any problems with achieving completion of an assigned action item, you
must report it to me as soon as possible. If you have any questions on
anything, please do not hesitate to contact me. The completion of these
items are extremely important and will require your full commitment. It is
extremely important for you to download your file and begin on it
immediately since some of the due dates are just around the corner. Some of
the items will be easily taken care of, while others will take a lot of
your time. Therefore, you will want to evaluate each item to identify how
long it will take you to complete it.

Thank you for all of your help in advance,
