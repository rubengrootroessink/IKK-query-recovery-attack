the

> In summary, the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division (NMOCD) will hold a
> training session in Midland Texas on November 9 and 10, 1999.  These 
training
> sessions cover most of the forms and procedures involved in dealing with the
> NMOCD.
>
> We have had good reports in the past about this training and members are
> encouraged to send their employees.  Things work much better when everyone
> knows how to complete and file the paperwork.
>
> Note that in the past there has been a $35 charge but the charge has been
> dropped.  Note that the registration forms should go directly to the Oil
> Conservation Division.
