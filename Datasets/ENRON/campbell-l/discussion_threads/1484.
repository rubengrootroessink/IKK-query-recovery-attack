Dear larry,

It's hard to believe that summer is almost here, but my 
calendar is already filling up with graduations, weddings, 
family gatherings and barbeques.  As a photographer, one 
of my favorite things about these happy occasions is being 
able to take great pictures and share them with friends.  
I hope you're able to do the same at your summertime events 
this year.  We've included some tips in this newsletter to 
make sure you're prepared to capture those memorable 
moments.  Have fun!  

Cheers,
  
James Joaquin 
President & CEO, Ofoto, Inc.

them down to three winners: Grand Prize winner Doug White 
of Fishers, IN; 2nd Prize winner Michele Yurgaitis of 
Enfield, CT; and 3rd Prize winner Carolyn De Anda of 
Clovis, CA.  Congratulations and thanks to everybody who

Creative Clicks

You continue to amaze us with your ingenuity -- our 
Creative Clicks mailbox was overflowing with ideas from 
our readers!  Gardner Smith of Emeryville, CA shared with 
us how he uses Ofoto to enhance his dog walking service:

"I can't tell you how much Ofoto means to my business.  
I own The Rockridge Dog Co. here in the Bay Area and as a 
selling point I use your service.  Every dog that I take 
on as a client gets its own album, and being able to get 
up-to-date photos to people is fantastic!  It really sets 
me apart from the competition.  Keep up the great work!"

Submit your ideas to creativeclicks@ofoto.com.  
If we use your suggestion in OfotoFocus, you'll receive 
25 free prints!
