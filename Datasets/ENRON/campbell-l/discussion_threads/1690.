Ray,
What if you want your transaction to be cut if the economics support it? You
change your DAM ( or leave it at the original bid) to a price sensitive bid 
and
the BME promises you that price you wanted in your bid, then SCD runs and the
real time (no constraints thus no BME clearing) runs up due operational
restrictions and the price you get clobbers you? Like it did before the $20 K
adder. All these problems would go away if the BME clearing at the Proxy
busses,passed by BIC and MC ,was implemented. Baby-sitting your DAM bids would
solve the " schedule and forget deal" but if you have any arb or price 
sensitive
schedules then you run into the risk above.  Given the apparent limitations of
the NYISO (software ?) we might have to pick and choose which band aid 
approach
is more palatable.
