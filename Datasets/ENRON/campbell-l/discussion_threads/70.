Larry - Sue has done an nice job of providing an outline of what is 
required.  As you will see do not worry about the 30 day rule for materials 
that we are not actively managing.  When you see the timetable for the EPA to 
respond you will realize that....

this is a big help but a lot of work is required and we will need Donna 
Mullins to sign off on what we discussed....

Lou - 

Attached is a revised version of the bulleted document I created addressing 
characterization and cleanup of PCB contaminated concrete.  I revised the 
document to include contaminated soils (i.e., bulk remediation waste) and 
additional information about cleanup levels.

Generally - My understanding of the rules is that EPA requires cleanup to 100 
ppm in low occupancy areas if the contaminated area is capped and deed 
recorded.  Disposal in place of PCBs at concentrations higher than 100 ppm 
requires written EPA approval.
