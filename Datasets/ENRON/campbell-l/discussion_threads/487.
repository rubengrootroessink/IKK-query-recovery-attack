Here are my comments on the Draft Permits:

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.
2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on 
ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double 
check that with the agency.   Arnold -- Do we have guarantees from GE to back 
up these limits?
3.  The responsible official should be Dan Pribble.

Ruth

The EPA has posted the draft permits for C/S 3 and 4 on their web page for 
review. To review each permit go to 
http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm .  Click on the first 
yellow bullet and drill move down to Arizona, then click the yellow button 
for US EPA.  This will make available the files which are labeled 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Klagetoh Compressor Station and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company Luepp Compressor Station.  For each file, click on the field 
labeled "link permit conditions". this will present the draft permit 
conditions.  Due to the urgency of each permits review, Id like comments from 
Jon and Ruth to me by tomorrow prior to the afternoon phone call I will have 
with the state of Arizona over the draft conditions for the permits for C/S 1 
and 2.
