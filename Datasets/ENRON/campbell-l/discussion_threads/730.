Dear Datek Online Customer,

The equity in your account has fallen below margin maintenance
requirements, creating a Margin Maintenance Call (or "House Call") as of
November 8, 2000.

Amount Due: The house call is for $ 1836

Date Due: This call is due by the close of business on Monday, November
13, which will be Day 3 of the house call.

Please be aware that Friday, November 10, 2000 is a bank holiday.  Banks
will not be open to wire transfer funds.  If you plan on funding your
account to meet your margin call, please wire funds to Datek Online
prior to Friday.  Once you have wired your funds remember to have your
bank provide you with a wire receipt containing a federal reference
number.

Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.  Please fax your
wire receipt to 732-744-9143.

If you choose to overnight a check to Datek Online, please confirm with
the carrier that they will be delivering on Friday.  U.S. Post Offices
will not open and will not be delivering mail on Friday November 10,
2000.

The call requirements can be satisfied by:

1.  Depositing sufficient funds into your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
2.  Selling sufficient securities in your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
3.  The market value of your portfolio appreciating above equity
requirements.

What you should do:

A margin call requires you keep a watchful eye on the value of your
portfolio.  Be mindful of market fluctuations in your portfolio and how
they affect your account.  A margin call is payable on demand, and
rapidly depreciating market conditions may require immediate action
involving liquidation of sufficient securities in your account to
satisfy the call without further notice from us to you.  Taking the
necessary steps to satisfy the house call can avoid this.

This margin call must be satisfied by the close of the market on Monday,
November 13.  You should immediately decide which call payment method is
best for you.  Do not delay in satisfying the call.  Please take
immediate action to satisfy this call prior to the close of the market
on Monday, November 13, 2000-DAY 3. If your account does not meet margin
equity requirements as of the market open on November 14-DAY 4 we will
be forced to take action to satisfy the call by selling some or all of
your portfolio.

Sending Additional Funds to Meet Your Margin Call

The amount stated above is the amount of the call that may be met by
depositing additional funds (cash) into your account.   The fastest way
to deposit funds is to send a wire.

If you choose to wire funds you must:

1.   Fax a copy of the wire receipt
2.   Include the federal reference number of the wire
3.   Fax to 732-744-9143

Important Note
Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.

Liquidating Positions to Meet Your Margin Call

In order to liquidate enough stock to meet the initial amount of your
margin call you must do the following:

1.   Determine the margin requirement for the position you wish to
liquidate.   Stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our
HelpDesk under "Your Portfolio" and "Margin Maintenance" or by using the
following link:

http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html

2.   Divide the amount of the margin call by the margin requirement for
the position you wish to liquidate.  This is equal to the dollar amount
of the security you must sell to meet the initial amount of the margin
call.

Example:

The amount of the margin call is $1500.  To determine the dollar amount
of a security you must sell to meet this margin call divide $1500 by the
margin requirement for the stock you wish to liquidate.  If the margin
requirement is 30% (.30) you must sell $5000 worth of the
position.  If the margin requirement is 40% (.40) you must sell $3750
worth of the stock.

Your Call Could be Satisfied Through Market Fluctuation

Margin calls are calculated after the close of business on a daily basis
using the closing prices for each day.  In order for you to meet your
margin call through market fluctuation your account must close the
traditional trading day above the minimum margin maintenance
requirements.  This must be done by the close of November 13-Day 3 in
order for the call to end.  Intra-day market fluctuation will not
suffice in meeting your margin call.

Please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your
portfolio are "bound to go up". All stocks are subject to market
volatility. There are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or
assurances that a stock will not decline. Furthermore, your stocks could
decline further, creating an even larger margin call. Once again, do not
"bank" on market fluctuation. Consider all factors, including your risk
tolerance, to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call.


Account Equity and Additional House Calls

Depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their
market fluctuations, additional funds may be due or actions that are
separate from this margin call may be required.  This may result in a
second house call.  The key is to understand the equity requirements and
ensure that your account is meeting them.  We may request additional
margin maintenance due to:

? A further decline in the market value of your positions.  At that time
you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the
equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial
margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level.
In these instances, meeting the initial call may give you additional
time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the
required equity ratio.
? Any undue concentration of one security in your account.

Needless to say, selling out an account is something we don't like to do
at Datek Online.  We want you to be aware of the status of your margin
account at all times, and be prepared to take action as soon as
conditions warrant.  Be fully aware that if at any time your account
value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if market conditions
warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions
with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  You should review our
HelpDesk to check equity requirements.
