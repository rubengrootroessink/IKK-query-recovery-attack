Four of the six new monitor wells at the Laguna C/S have accumulated 
groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 
5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic 
compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells 
will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of 
the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The 
installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former 
impoundment area has been completed.  
The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be 
forwarded to the state of Texas.
The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The 
recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to 
evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation 
rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to 
active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be 
operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. 
Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent 
sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the 
sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing 
interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that 
they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing 
thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline 
filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has 
indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
determine the "front of PCB's"
A revised Title V application was submitted for the Keystone C/S turbine 
"power unit" replacement.   Fuel monitoring and emissions testing under NSPS 
will be initiated pending completion of the turbine component replacement. 
A meeting was held in Gallup to discuss the forthcoming pipeline PCB modeling 
project to be initiated in Arizona.  Environmental concerns relating to 
management and disposal of the liquids, permitting and compliance issues were 
discussed.   This project will be initiated between C/S 4 and C/S 3.  If 
successful, the modeling approach and methodology will be implemented 
throughout the contaminated portions of Transwestern Pipeline.
