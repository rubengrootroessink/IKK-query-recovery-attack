Larry,

Glad the conditions work for you.  Those are the only conditions I had any
question about.  We never share entire draft permits before public notice.
Occasionally, if there is a question about a specific issue, we'll share
one or two conditions.  That's what happened here.

Conditions for Transition Period







Roger, these conditions will work out just fine for the generators.  I have
passed them on to our project director and he has given them the thumbs up.
I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to comment on the
conditions.  Id like to have a peek at the other conditions in the permit
as you develop them, just to expidite the issuance.  Thanks for working
with us on this.....

Subject:  Draft Permit Conditions for Transition Period


Hi Larry,

Per our conversation today, I want to make sure I understand your intent
for the transition periods for Klagetoh and Leupp.  Below are two
conditions from the draft Klagetoh permit.  We would use the same approach
for Leupp.  Please let me know whether we have understood your intent
correctly.  Note that there will also be some associated recordkeeping
requirements.

From the draft Klagetoh permit:

The following conditions apply during the transition period.  The
transition period is defined as the six month period that starts on the
first day that Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine) or Emission Units  423 or
424 (Catepillar generator engines) operates.

     1.        During the transition period, Emission Units 401, 402, and
          403 (Clark compressor engines) shall not operate simultaneously
          with Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine). [40 CFR
          71.6(a)(13)(iii), 71.6(b), 71.7(e)(1)(i)(A)(4)(i)]

     2.        During the transition period, either Emission Unit 421 or
          422 (Waukesha generator engines) may operate simultaneously with
          either Emission Unit 423 or 424 (Catepillar generator engines).
          Under no circumstances may Emission Unit 421 operate
          simultaneously with Emission Unit 422, nor may Emission Unit 423
          operate simultaneously with Emission Unit 424. [40 CFR
          71.6(a)(13)(iii), 71.6(b), 71.7(e)(1)(i)(A)(4)(i)]
