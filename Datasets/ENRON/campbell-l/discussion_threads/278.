John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in 
Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have 
been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each 
contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them 
submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to 
TW.  

The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 
2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.   
Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The 
original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was 
definatley a plus.

Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what 
turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce.  
Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary 
power will be installed at each location (wind, natural gas, diesel).
