Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,
Jon

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

What say you all?
