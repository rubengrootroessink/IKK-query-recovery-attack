MAPP OASIS WILL BE DOWN TONIGHT, for 1 HOUR!

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, "Allow
on Redirect" and "Account on Reduction".

These two fields can be changed by selecting "Transmission Services" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The "Allow on Redirect" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The "Account On Reduction" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the "Query for Reductions".

All services types will default to "No" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All "Capacity Type" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your "Capacity Types" so that they are unique.

 The "Capacity Type" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique "Capacity Type" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select "Yes" for
the "Allow on Redirect" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select "HNF Secondary" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected "FCTS Daily", "FCTS Weekly", "FCTS Monthly", "FCTS Seasonal", "FCTS
Yearly", and "FCTS Monthly 1 Month" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator
