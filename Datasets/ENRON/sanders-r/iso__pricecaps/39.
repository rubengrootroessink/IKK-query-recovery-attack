Subject: Another complaint in California


Yet one more complaint regarding electricity prices in California:

Californians for Renewable Energy, Inc. v. Independent Energy Producers, 
Inc., et al., EL01-2-000 (10/06/00) -- Petitions the Commission to: (1) 
rectify unjust and unreasonable prices stemming from the wholesale markets 
for energy and ancillary services operated by the California ISO and 
California PX; (2) make findings that the events and circumstances 
surrounding the June 14, 2000 rolling outage in the San Francisco Bay Area 
warrant investigation by the Justice Department of trust activities in 
restraint of trade by Independent Energy Producers and all sellers of energy 
and ancillary services into the California ISO and PX markets.

Nancy: Please get a copy of the complaint for Sue, Mary, Sarah and me.  
Thanks.
