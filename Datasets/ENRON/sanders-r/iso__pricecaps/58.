Power-company profits climb along with prices=20
=20
=20
 By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
October 18, 2000=20

A power company executive yesterday boiled California's ongoing electricity=
=20
crisis down to the bottom line.=20

"Prices are rising, and I know that's hurting consumers =01) but it certain=
ly=20
has been beneficial for Enron," said Jeffrey Skilling,=20
president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy and tradi=
ng=20
company.  Enron declined to specify how=20
much it earned from California during the past summer, when the state's=20
deregulated electricity market sent power prices=20
soaring. But the Texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic=
es=20
unit =01) which trades California electricity and o
ther commodities =01) increased 135 percent to $404 million.=20

Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, reported that income from its marketing=
=20
and trade unit soared more than 300 percent to $142 million.   Steve
Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, said California was perhaps only the=20
third-biggest contributor to that surge. But industry analysts said the=20
earnings
 reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks.=20

"California clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies,=
"=20
said Carol Coale, senior analyst of Prudential=20
Securities. "And you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong=
=20
reports (from the power industry)."  She and others=20
say they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the=
=20
state, where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases.=20

Companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from=
=20
the deregulated market. Enron produces no electricity in California=20
but is the nation's largest electricity trader, buying and selling the outp=
ut=20
of power plants owned by other companies.=20

Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, said the big profits should be seen in=20
something other than a business context.  "These massive profits=20
by the energy companies translate directly into thousands of San Diegans=20
losing savings that were planned for education, mortgage=20
payments, health care and other . . . necessities," Hunter said.=20

When the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter =
of=20
hours, "it was clear that predatory pricing was producing=20
massive profits for someone," Hunter said.  Hunter insists that recent powe=
r=20
prices violate federal law mandating that rates be "just and reasonable."=
=20
He is calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds=
.=20
FERC is scheduled to issue a report on the California market by Nov. 1.=20

The political fallout from the price increases, meanwhile, appears to weigh=
=20
heavily on power companies, which are reluctant to tout successes in=20
California for fear of being singled out for profiteering.=20

After noting that Dynegy's recent acquisitions in Illinois contributed=20
strongly to the company's success last quarter, Bergstrom was reminded that=
=20
he=20
had omitted mention of California.=20

"Illinois is not as politically volatile as California," Bergstrom said.=20

He acknowledged that Dynegy did "pretty well" in California because its pow=
er=20
plants produced far more electricity this year than last. Bergstrom=20
also sought to correct an earlier report that Dynegy had quickly recouped t=
he=20
cost of power plants it recently acquired in the state.=20

He said that was true only of the plants it owns in Long Beach and El=20
Segundo, which it bought in 1998. Bergstrom said the cost of Dynegy's half=
=20
interest=20
in the former San Diego Gas & Electric Encina power plant in Carlsbad =01)=
=20
acquired at the end of 1998 =01) had not been recovered.=20

Typically, plant operators assume that it will take as long as 20 years to=
=20
recoup such costs.=20

In comments to financial analysts, Skilling, of Enron, suggested that power=
=20
companies could help provide a solution to California's power problems.=20

"Supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in California and oth=
er=20
locations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like Enron=20
to provide reliable power and stable prices," Skilling said.  He predicted=
=20
that California's utility companies =01) which now buy much of their power =
from=20
other companies =01) would sign long-term contracts to stabilize prices,=20
following an approach suggested by many power generators and traders.=20

"If they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to 10-year=20
contracts, then they could get contracts for $50 a megawatt, which is not=
=20
much=20
different than they were paying two or three years ago," Skilling said.=20

But consumer advocates have noted that long-term contracts at those levels=
=20
would lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little=20
choice about suppliers. Advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted=
=20
that introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs=20
and to greater consumer choice.=20

Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said he=
=20
was skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry.=20

"Any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged=
=20
in faking out the California public and price gouging when there=20
are shortages," said Snyder, who advocates an end to deregulation.=20

"They do not have consumer interests at heart."
