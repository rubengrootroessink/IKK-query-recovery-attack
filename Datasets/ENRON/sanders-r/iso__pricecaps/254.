Gary--Attached for your review and that of Christian Yoder is a draft
confirmation letter relating to the Enron block forward contracts.  It is
based on the WSPP agreement, but is modified to fit the requirements of the
CERS power purchase program.  Please let Ron Grosser and me know what you
think.
