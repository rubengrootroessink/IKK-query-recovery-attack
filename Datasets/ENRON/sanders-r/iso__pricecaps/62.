Richard --

PG&E and SCE (along with TURN) filed at FERC seeking refunds.  As Seabron 
highlights below, I wouldn't put it pass them if they already have an idea of 
who to "charge" for this summer.

Last I remember, we were not too concerned about the utilities filing in 
state court seeking redress.  Given that the undercollection number is 
approaching $4 billion, I just want to make sure that we have thought about 
this angle.  The utilities are going to start trying to fix their problem in 
every way possible (I sure as hell would if I were them).

Mary and Jim:

Did you see in the PG&E/SCE filing that the two companies have kindly
volunteered (p. 32) to "assist the Commission in developing a full record
and in undertaking the rigorous analysis needed to fix the problems in the
California markets and determine refund responsibility". How kind and
public-spirited of them. More seriously, I would expect that they already
have a full economic analysis going on prices, damages, etc.
