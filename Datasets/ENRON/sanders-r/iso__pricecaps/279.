We just received this from Jeanne Bennett for comment.  We are reviewing and
look forward to discussing it with you tomorrow.  I will try to contact

Thanks.

Subject: Motion to Dismiss SCE CounterComplaint
Importance: High


Attached is  a draft of the Motion to Dismiss SCE's Countercomplaint.

First, let me say thanks to the guys at Brobeck.  There is no way I could
have put this together in a day without the material they sent me.  So, if
you guys think you recognize your own work in the pleading, you do.

Second, as I will be out of town the next couple of days, I would appreciate
that any comments you have on the draft be sent to me via e-mail.  I would
like to have all comments in by first thing Monday morning as the motion
must be filed on Monday.

 <<X22427.DOC>>

Thanks alot.

Jeanne Bennett
