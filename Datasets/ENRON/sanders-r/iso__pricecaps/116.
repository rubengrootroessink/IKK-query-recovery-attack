 SEMPRA ENERGY RESOURCES
  I spoke with Dave Smith, Associate General Counsel for
Sempra Energy Resources.  (877) 736-7721.  He told me that unfortunately
they own part of an electrical generation facility in Nevada with Reliant.
Apparently it is a partnership.  They sell power into the PX.  Thus, there
does not appear to be a basis for claim inappropriate joinder.
 PG&E Energy Trading
  I called Marie Fiala, one of the lead partners at Heller
working on the PG&E vs. CPUC case.  She was very helpful, but did not know
the answer about what this company did or where it was located.  She found
out that the person to call is Steve Herman, General Counsel for PG&E
National Energy Group located in Maryland.  (301) 280-6815.  Meanwhile,
Peter Meringolo found this information in the 10K reports:

  PG&E Energy Trading is a defined term consisting of  "PG&E
Energy Trading--Gas Corporation, PG&E Energy Trading--Power, L.P., and their
affiliates (collectively, PG&E Energy Trading or PG&E ET)."  These companies
are headquartered in Houston, TX.  See 10-K at p. 32.  They "purchase
electric power from PG&E Corporation affiliates and the wholesale market and
natural gas from producers, marketers, and other parties. PG&E ET then
schedules, transports, and resells these commodities, either to third
parties or to other PG&E Corporation affiliates."

  In Exhibit 21 to the 10-K, which lists the subsidiaries of
PG&E Corp., these two companies are described as follows:

  PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation, incorporated in
California, with an address in Houston, TX.  This company is a wholly owned
subsidiary of PG&E National Energy Group, Inc. (a Delaware Corp,
headquartered in San Francisco, CA).  According to the 10-K, "PG&E Energy
Trading - Gas Corporation purchases and resells energy commodities and
related financial instruments."

  PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P. is a Delaware limited
partnership, with an address in Bethesda, MD.  According to the 10-K, "this
limited partnership is engaged in electric power marketing and trading."
This company is owned as follows:

* 2% owned by PG&E Energy Trading - Power Holdings Corporation, a
California Corporation, with an address in Bethesda, MD.  (This Company is
100% owned by PG&E Generating Company (now PG&E Shareholdings, Inc.), a
California Corporation with a San Francisco address.)

* 98% owned by PG&E ET Investments Corporation, a Delaware Corporation
with an address in San Antonio, TX.  (This company is 100% owned by PG&E
Energy Trading - Power Holdings Corp.)
Election of Judges

 Judge Amos and Judge Meyer were both re-elected in 1996.  They are
both up for re-election in 2002.  While Judge Amos is a Democrat appointed
by Jerry Brown, Judge Meyer is a Republican.  There is some though that Amos
might not run again.  The judges generally run unopposed on non-partisan
tickets.

I am flying in on Southwest from Oakland.  I arrive at about 9:30 p.m.
(United is suffering a work stoppage.)

I will see you for breakfast at 7:00 a.m.

Thanks
Gary
