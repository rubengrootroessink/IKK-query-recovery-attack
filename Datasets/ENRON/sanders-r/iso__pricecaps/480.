FYI.

In case you haven't seen it. According to MRW's analysis for IEP, Portland General sold the highest-price power to DWR in 1Q01. But at $318,071, PGE is 61 out of 74 in terms of total sales dollars.  The highest is Mirant at $706 million.  

Enron Power Marketing is #60 out of 74 in terms of prices charged, and #26 in terms of totals sales to DWR (about $45MM), according to the analysis.

Best,
Jeff
