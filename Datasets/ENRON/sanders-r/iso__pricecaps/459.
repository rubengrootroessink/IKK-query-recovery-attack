Davis to push backup diesel By Chris Bowman Bee Staff Writer (Published May=
 24, 2001)  In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis wi=
ll announce a plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this=
 summer by paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators =
in advance of anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor s=
aid Wednesday.  "The backup generators will help us get through the summer,=
" said S. David Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Lo=
s Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy con=
servation.  Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of =
the plan.  "The governor will announce what he's going to do," he said Wedn=
esday in a wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee.  Roger Sal=
azar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when or whet=
her Davis would make such an announcement.  "I don't know that the governor=
 has signed off on anything like that," Salazar said.  Under the plan, part=
icipating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously dis=
connect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 -- nea=
rly depleted.  The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power =
that would be saved by converting to diesel generation.  Deploying diesel-p=
owered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion engines -- to fore=
stall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle to get more mega=
watts flowing through California.  Earlier this week Davis lowered his esti=
mate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from 5,0=
00 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,00=
0 households.  The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Da=
vis administration's policy.  The governor and his appointees at the state =
Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries,=
 utilities and the operator of the state's electricity grid, arguing that r=
outine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health.  San Diego G=
as & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the Davis=
-appointed state Public Utilities Commission.  Environmentalists who have b=
een catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter t=
he governor's repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards duri=
ng the energy crisis.  A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's =
leading environmental organizations, including the American Lung Associatio=
n of California, urged Davis to reconsider.  "Given your awareness of the p=
ublic health threats of diesel emissions, please stop and have these propos=
als considered in a more thoughtful and public manner," the letter states. =
 Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emerge=
ncy use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and saf=
ety problems triggered by power outages.  "This is a no-brainer," Freeman s=
aid. "You've got human lives at stake here. This is a scary situation."  Fr=
eeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry=
 in blackouts.  But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Pla=
nning and Conservation League, countered, "If the health impacts are so mar=
ginal, why has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed th=
is?"  Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data =
management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of locom=
otives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power.  Unlike=
 diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run with l=
ittle or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergenci=
es.  Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most genera=
tors in use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming ni=
trogen oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, acc=
ording to air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of br=
eathable soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say.  Davis' p=
lan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator de=
clares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low and roll=
ing blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from collapsin=
g, according to Freeman.  Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, "An=
y backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort =
to prevent blackouts."  Environmentalists who are trying to head off the pl=
an said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least 35=
 cents per kilowatt-hour, roughly three times the rate consumers typically =
pay for electricity. Freeman would not confirm the pay rate.  The Davis adm=
inistration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to=
 the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need=
 to comply with smog rules.  For operators of existing power plants, the go=
vernor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above =
allowable limits in order to keep the lights on.  The latest plan to pay co=
mpanies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the e=
nvironmental reins.   The Bee's Chris Bowman can be reached at (916) 321-10=

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis By David Whitney Bee Washington Bu=
reau (Published May 24, 2001)  WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next =
week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk about California's worsening electricity =
crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly =
favors some controls on West Coast wholesale electricity prices.  Details f=
or the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but the fa=
ct that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor, w=
ho is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen as a sign =
that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issu=
e.  "California is a very big state," said White House spokesman Ari Fleisc=
her. "It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest =
economy in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk wit=
h Governor Davis. It's important."  Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said =
electricity price caps will be at the top of the governor's agenda for the =
meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Fleischer did not commit the president=
 to that kind of meeting.  In his first visit to the state since the campai=
gn last year, the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tues=
day night in Fresno.  Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to=
 meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis des=
pite repeated pleas from the Democratic congressional delegation.  Price co=
ntrols have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and a hand=
ful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them a=
s counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawatt-short st=
ate.  In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the at=
titude toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Fe=
deral Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senat=
e floor Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls onc=
e they are seated on the panel.  And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. =
James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in contr=
ol of the Senate, moving Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control =
advocate, to the helm of the key Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commit=
tee.  California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesda=
y that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legis=
lation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production.  Four=
 Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of p=
rice-control legislation.  On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, annou=
nced that he is introducing a bill that, while not technically a price cap,=
 would give greater price relief for West Coast consumers than federal regu=
lators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer.  Ose, chairma=
n of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, said his =
bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan approved last=
 month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only during powe=
r emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around the clock=
 under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of th=
e least-efficient plant selling into the California market.  Ose said his b=
ill would encourage generators to sell their power through long-term contra=
cts rather than on the volatile spot market.  "I am looking for a middle gr=
ound," Ose said.   The Bee's David Whitney can be reached at (202) 383-0004=

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol =
Bureau (Published May 24, 2001)  State Assembly efforts to develop a bipart=
isan proposal to help Southern California Edison pay off massive debts and =
avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end Wednesday when Republicans released a plan =
of their own.  The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and v=
ote along party lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 =
billion state purchase of power lines.  Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox=
 of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was necessary because there are few di=
fferences between the governor's plan and the Democrats' plan.  The Republi=
can plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectr=
ic facilities.  Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer ra=
tes to allow Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers=
 would receive either an equity stake in future power plants or the right t=
o purchase electricity at discount rates.=09








Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau =
Chief (Published May 24, 2001)  Utility companies and out-of-state power ge=
nerators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californ=
ia's energy crisis, but Gov. Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically o=
ver the past five months, according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.  An=
d Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power =
woes -- except themselves.  Every player in the power drama gets poor marks=
 except "residential energy consumers," which 39 percent of poll respondent=
s say are doing a good or very good job to improve the energy situation. On=
ly 22 percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job.  Public opinion=
 of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, when 32 perc=
ent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave them high m=
arks.  "The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll D=
irector Mark DiCamillo. "That's the only positive movement in the survey." =
 For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from posit=
ive.  In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from=
 41 percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor rati=
ngs from only 22 percent.  But when the Field Institute conducted its recen=
t poll between May 11 and Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After =
months of energy angst, a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases=
, only 27 percent think Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave hi=
m failing grades. The poll also shows that Californians believe the crisis =
will continue by an average of a year and a half, well through the upcoming=
 re-election battle.  "All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effec=
t early on is not going over well any more," DiCamillo said. "The public is=
 starting to view this as a long-term problem, not some temporary policy sh=
ift."  Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- =
President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry.  The pu=
blic's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops eve=
n lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half t=
he public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or v=
ery poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of gou=
ging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent =
in the May poll.  Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the st=
ate Public Utilities Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades fro=
m more than half the public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposa=
l, received low ratings from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask=
 about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office.  Davis has re=
peatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity, =
and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state's energy problems.=
 Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals "harebrained" and "goo=
fy."  The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those po=
lled, while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.   The Bee's Dan=

        New views emerging on power More elected officials support the conc=
ept of planned blackouts By John Hill Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published May 23=
, 2001)  If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least k=
now when to break out the candles or send the workers home.  That's the gro=
wing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including Gov. Gray Davi=
s, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving business=
es and residents ample warning.  On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's offi=
ce said Davis supports longer public notice than the 24 hours called for un=
der a proposal by the California Independent System Operator, which runs th=
e state's power grid.  Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill=
 that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could ma=
ke plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all oth=
er days the lights would stay on.  Briggs called his plan an improvement on=
 the existing system in which "every day is a potential blackout day."  A S=
enate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a strate=
gy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state=
 will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask Washing=
ton and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."  If the power genera=
tors refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would gut it out with p=
lanned blackouts.  "Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michae=
l Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, to=
ld the Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. But Shames and other=
s stressed the need for warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no long=
er than 90 minutes.  "Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how=
 the buyers' cartel could work," Shames said.  On a visit to Chicago on Mon=
day, Davis said he talked to officials about the city's system for giving t=
he public warning days before possible power blackouts, with definite notic=
e right before.  "There is no reason to keep that secret from the public wh=
en their safety is likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday.=
 The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at I=
SO to explore the idea of a system like Chicago's.  The grid operator annou=
nced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a half-hour notice=
 of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more war=
ning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go beyond ISO's.  There are=
 potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking advantage=
 of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts might inc=
rease the number of outages.  If people have been warned that a blackout is=
 coming, and a last-minute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid=
 managers would have to decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothroc=
k, vice president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=
  If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possi=
bly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.  "Obviously, there are tra=
de-offs," Rothrock said.  Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be=
 gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the ener=
gy crisis, sorely lacking in recent months.  "It would help us as Californi=
ans to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, we're going to handle this our=
selves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove.  Overman said he has been bu=
rning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that sch=
eduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.  Briggs said he has bee=
n told by constituents, including irrigators and food processors, that sche=
duled blackouts are the way to go.  Irrigators would know that they shouldn=
't plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be clos=
ed.  Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arran=
ge for backup power generators, he said.  "We would be very interested in i=
t," said Ed Yates, senior vice president of the California League of Food P=
rocessors.  Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, =
requiring some plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for =
more than a day.  Some processors might choose to close on days when they f=
aced a blackout, he said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands=
 of pounds of food.  "It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a v=
ery difficult situation," he said.  Briggs said that his plan would result =
in possible blackout days every two weeks. The plan would assume that a cer=
tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin=
g. If the electricity shortage went above that amount, people might still f=
ace unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.  One question is public safety. S=
ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur. But pluses=
 include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersecti=
ons, or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved.  "I=
f the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult int=
ersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments =
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.  The manufacturers' =
association and other business groups haven't endorsed the idea yet, but sa=
y it's worth a look.  "It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothr=
ock said.  The Bee's John Hill can be reached at (916) 326-5543 or jhill@sa=

        Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a F=
ield Poll * Related graphic   By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief =
 (Published May 23, 2001)  Californians have some clear ideas on how to sol=
ve the energy crisis: build more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale pr=
ice of electricity and relax air-quality standards to allow older plants to=
 be upgraded.  And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not=
 so hot on the recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay fo=
r electricity, or the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through =
eminent domain.  Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by =
respondents' unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes =
of the state's power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an arti=
ficial crisis created by power companies to make money.  But on one longsta=
nding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear preference and a dr=
amatic shift in public opinion.  In the highest recorded support for nuclea=
r power in California since before the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, =
59 percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide elect=
ricity.  Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 perce=
nt opposed. Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and th=
ree-fourths of Republicans and 55 percent of others agree.  "The change in =
attitude is very significant because they know this issue," Field Poll Dire=
ctor Mark DiCamillo said.  Californians' support for nuclear power reached =
nearly 70 percent in the mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy =
crisis. But it plummeted to 37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown a=
t Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- =
the last time Field surveyed the question.  In 1989, voters demanded that t=
he Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shu=
t down. The utility complied and has spent more than $200 million decommiss=
ioning it during the past 12 years.  Although the poll results are in line =
with some private surveys done recently by nuclear-energy advocates, oppone=
nts say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has b=
een dormant for so long. Not since the late '70s has an application for a n=
uclear plant been filed in the United States. Only two operate in Californi=
a -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo.  =
"When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about =
that much lately, you do get some aberrant results," said Bill Magavern, a =
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned abo=
ut electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like=
 to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood."  The Field Poll result=
s lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently =
released by President Bush, who called for more nuclear power plants nation=
wide.  But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energ=
y Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despi=
te opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of a=
ll adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bu=
sh's fellow Republicans -- support the price controls.  "It really does exp=
ose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems in California if =
they're perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard," DiCamil=
lo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be imposed."  Republ=
icans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and Democra=
ts narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize =
the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases.  Amon=
g all adults, 38 percent approve of the move, and 52 percent oppose it. Dem=
ocrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin.  Calif=
ornians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch=
, respondents said.  By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll responde=
nts say they would maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to=
 build plants. That support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59=
 percent said they'd rather maintain standards. Moreover, a majority (53 pe=
rcent) say they would relax air-quality standards to get older plants back =
in operation, an increase from 47 percent in January.  Slight majorities su=
pport a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and state-owned power=
 transmission lines (51 percent), but DiCamillo said that some poll respond=
ents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves.  =
Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to r=
ise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines, with Democrats in favor,=
 50 percent to 42 percent, and Republicans opposed, 52 percent to 32 percen=
t. Overall, the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44=
 percent.  A strong majority of registered voters, 56 percent, oppose addit=

Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis =09



By Finlay Lewis COPLEY NEWS SERVICE  May 23, 2001  WASHINGTON - After weeks=
 of holding California and its electricity crisis at arm's length, Presiden=
t Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a two-day visit to the=
 state that will include a possible energy summit with California Gov. Gray=
 Davis.  White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday=
 that the state's energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the p=
resident and the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time an=
d place for the meeting are still being worked out.  Bush's visit to the st=
ate will be his first since last fall's campaign. With their party enjoying=
 only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California Republicans have e=
xpressed dismay over their state's absence from the president's extensive p=
ost-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy crisis could cost so=
me GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. =09



Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas=
is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no h=
int until then that the president would address the issue during his upcomi=
ng trip to California.  However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday ni=
ght proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy. =
 He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quick=
er action on the energy front: "Californians can't afford to wait four or f=
ive years for a permanent solution. We need relief today."  In the longer o=
f two letters, Davis wrote: "You and I don't agree on everything. But here'=
s something we do have in common: we both inherited an energy mess. And the=
 people that elected us expect us to clean it up."  Davis also offered in t=
he letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and everyday citizens wh=
o have been personally affected by this energy crisis."  Fleischer said Wed=
nesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and energy consumers."  =
Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the preside=
nt's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions.  "This=
 is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very please=
d to be able to make it work out," he said.  As for the meeting with the bu=
siness leaders, Fleischer said, "The president has several events on his sc=
hedule that already include business leaders and energy consumers, and so i=
t very well may happen that we're each suggesting similar things, which wou=
ld be a healthy sign."  Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at=
 the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base designed to showcase his order direct=
ing the military to cut their energy use by 10 percent at California facili=
ties.  Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the fede=
ral government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California i=
n the cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as=
 they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are mo=
st at risk."  The White House released an outline of the president's Califo=
rnia itinerary on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not =
give prominent attention to the state's energy woes.  Fleischer declined to=
 say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while=
 in California.  Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply cri=
tical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to hel=
p alleviate the electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens. =
 They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before =
the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in=
 the state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers=
 oppose the measure.  Last week, Bush showcased an administration task forc=
e report on the nation's energy challenges that stressed long-range solutio=
ns focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded =
role for nuclear power. The report also suggested incentives to encourage e=
nergy conservation and greater fuel efficiency.  Bush's trip will begin on =
Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles wh=
ere he will spend the night. He will return to Washington on Wednesday nigh=
t after a visit to the Fresno area.  Bush assumed office despite losing the=
 nation's most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into t=
he most ambitious travel schedule of any modern president. It included stop=
s in 27 states - not California.  (Lewis reported from Washington and Sween=

California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
May 22, 2001=20
WASHINGTON - Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of Califor=
nia House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate price=
 caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state.=20
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap measu=
re, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that ti=
me the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill=
 designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this sum=
mer due to shortages in the supply of electrical power.=20
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Mond=
ay and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, c=
harging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California situ=
ation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campai=
gn contributions.=20
"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection =
laws," Waxman said. "It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 perc=
ent increases in profits for some of these generators."=20
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe =
Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily=
 waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state =
when blackouts are imminent.=20
It also would include:=20
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valle=
y;=20
  mandated power savings at federal facilities;=20
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time;=20
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to larg=
e utilities.=20
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's pric=
e-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea of =
limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve=
 California's crisis.=20
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying t=
hat such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity sh=
ortage in California and many other western states by discouraging explorat=
ion and production.=20
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa=
le power rates to production costs, plus a "reasonable" profit.=20
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican o=
pposition to price caps.=20
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, "They were making m=
oney at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: The=
y can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it fo=
r 100 years. They can continue doing it."=20
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the =
energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from p=
arty leaders to oppose the price-cap bill.=20
"There are no party affiliations for rate payers," said Harman, a committee=
 member. "Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rat=
es in California."=20






Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built =09
=09




Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it' By Diane Lindq=
uist  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  May 22, 2001  Mexican Energy Secretary Er=
nesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set any limit on the number =
of power plants in Baja California supplying electricity north of the borde=
r.  "Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in Cali=
fornia for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens =
said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin Ame=
rican Energy Conference in La Jolla.  Power plant construction in Baja Cali=
fornia has become one of the most immediate solutions to California's elect=
ricity shortfalls. At least three plants being built in Baja California in =
the next four years will send electricity north of the border, where blacko=
uts have interrupted normal activity.  One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. =
power plant near Mexicali, will export all of its electrical output to cons=
umers north of the border. The San Diego company's project gained quick app=
roval from Mexican authorities because the facility is not subject to restr=
ictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican=
 market.  Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprise=
s are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.  Such a=
 mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border t=
hat the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public h=
ealth and safety.  In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to=
 preserving the environment and local communities.  But afterward, he said =
Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve Califor=
nia consumers.  "I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of th=
e interconnecting lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he s=
aid.  With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission inte=
rconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja Californi=
a will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of electricity fo=
r the California market produced by the new Baja California plants -- let a=
lone any additional facilities.  Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric sub=
sidiary owns both the interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconn=
ector near Mexicali, spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvemen=
t will transmit electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the c=
ompany substation in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego =
and Tijuana.  Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building B=
aja California plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives o=
f the firms could not be reached yesterday.  Even if the companies find a w=
ay to send electricity across the border, the California grid system presen=
ts another obstacle.  To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the=
 Southern California grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing wh=
at capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess=
 tariffs for the service.  "It's become very important because of our proxi=
mity to Mexico," said district spokesman Ron Hull.  The ability to transmit=
 electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja Californ=
ia. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities.  Sempra again is=
 a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that wi=
ll supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja Califor=
nia and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The pipeline won't provi=
de fuel for any other facilities.  "It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In=
 the future if there is enough demand, the compression could be increased."=
  Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natur=
al gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural =
gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada.  While several c=
ompanies have expressed an interest in such an operation, Martens' comments=
 were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be approved for Ba=
ja California. =09

Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negativ=
e feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in Cali=
fornia's energy crisis, according to a Field Poll released Thursday.=20
A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & Electr=
ic's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to provi=
de service to its customers.=20
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a Sa=
n Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's priva=
te electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of res=
pondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January.=20
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. Fif=
ty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, =
a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a po=
or rating in January.=20
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by offic=
ials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state.=20
The poll found that:=20
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities Comm=
ission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in May.=
=20
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in =
May, as opposed 36 percent in January.=20
* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of =
the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a po=
or rating in January.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from re=
spondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to=
 40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January.=20
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more diff=
icult for the company to supply electricity to customers, and 49 percent sa=
id they thought it would.=20

What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out.=20
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. =
And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and alter=
natives to power sources.=20
That's the only thing we can do in the short term.=20
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike.=20
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down=
 a rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across=
 the state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on =
the ballot.=20
It will do two things.=20
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It wil=
l try to put everything back the way it was.=20
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy.=20
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ=
ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirel=
y.=20
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend sup=
porters by a substantial amount.=20
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative =
is approved.=20
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that =
it will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, =
or make the problem worse.=20
All of that will probably be true.=20
The initiative will pass easily.=20
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a=
s the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled dereg=
ulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers.=20
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of =
us are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to =
take it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains.=20
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't=
 are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we wo=
n't believe them.=20
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate =
political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo=
r the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could ha=
ve done something about this a year ago and chose not to.=20
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davi=
s and the Legislature.=20
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vo=
te up or down on Davis.=20
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means election=
s are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. S=
omeone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bette=
r than Davis.=20
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will=
 appear on the ballot in 2002, however.=20
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in disco=
uragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run against a=
 well-financed incumbent.=20
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that pr=
oblem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force=
 him out of office.=20
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term lim=
its are up -- in six or eight years.=20
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to ei=
ght years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they j=
ust meekly wait their turn.=20
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the Cap=
itol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're goin=
g next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been kick=
ed out office.=20
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature fu=
ll of people elected during the term-limit era.=20
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are a=
ll things that will happen in the future.=20
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out.=20
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical =
eye at your own habits.=20
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your=
 individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears.=20
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by swit=
ching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning down =
the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so that t=
hey truly are turned off.=20
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home=

by the blackouts," said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the Nat=

hose blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to," Knight said.=20
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackout=
s from happening in the first place.=20
"It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthqua=
ke is coming," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
 Rights. "We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy gene=
rators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes."=20
'POWER WATCH'=20
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential b=
lackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- de=
mand days. A "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 =
alert is likely, while a "Power Warning" would be issued whenever there is =
at least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves =
drop below 1.5 percent.=20
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning =
of blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a=
 chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be=
 able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipme=
nt and large businesses.=20
"We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate =
to customers about pending rotating outages," said Ron Low, a spokesman for=
=20
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer grou=
p.=20
"Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic," said Mindy Spatt,=
 spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "They create =
public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from war=
nings. But knowing in advance is better."=20
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most c=
urrent information about how much electricity is being used and how much is=
 available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that =
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail.=20
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan=
 their operations.=20
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E a=

-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light=
 candles, observe the usual safety precautions.=20
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alo=
ne is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in whi=
ch case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau.=20
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on=
 to warn you when the power comes back on.=20
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power=
 surges.=20
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can sen=
d a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power work=
ers.=20
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold.=20
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and com=

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has hand=
led the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their energy =
doghouse, a Field Poll shows.=20
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush =
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey.=20
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings=
" when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are ha=
ndling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the F=
ield Poll.=20
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating=
s skidding for anyone connected with the energy business.=20
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said.=20
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric =
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve=
ry poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers rank=
ed almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very p=
oor category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis=
sion to the same level.=20
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked w=
ith the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are supp=
orted by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said.=20
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue=
, " he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather disma=
l."=20
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect=
 the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are indi=
cations that that strategy may not work forever.=20
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job =
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new=
 survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jum=
ped to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January.=20
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It=
 has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.=20
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their =
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe=
 residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding =
to the problem, up from 26 percent in January.=20
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In th=
e public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be do=
ing."=20
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousne=
ss of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or =
more before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced=
 it will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity.=
=20
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for=
 a long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the probl=
em in a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen."=20
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that =
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to =
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if busines=
ses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts.=20
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, Di=
Camillo said.=20
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it =
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."=20

If you want to wrap yourself in the flag these days, there's no better way =
than by promoting energy conservation.=20
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national labor=
atories held a news conference yesterday to highlight new technologies and =
information sources to help consumers and businesses cut down on electricit=
y use this summer.=20
Flanked by tiny models of buildings with white roofs (up to 45 degrees cool=

ergy vampire" devices such as battery chargers that suck power whenever the=
y're plugged in, earnest researchers discussed ways Californians can reduce=
 their electricity use by 20 percent this summer.=20
Meeting the goal has a big payoff, besides the obvious one of averting blac=
kouts: Under the governor's 20/20 Rebate Plan, those who conserve 20 percen=
t this summer compared with the same months last year will not only shave t=
hat amount off their bills, but also get an equivalent rebate from the stat=
e -- essentially saving 40 percent.=20
The technologies were a combination of new twists on humble objects and fut=
uristic geeks-only inventions:=20

every day by California grid operators, energycrisis.lbl.gov  gives real-ti=

saving 8 percent by using clotheslines instead of a dryer, for example.=20
-- LAMPS. Lawrence Berkeley scientists have created the eponymous "Berkeley=
 lamp," expected to go on sale in July for under $150. It's a high-performa=
nce table lamp with two fluorescent bulbs that together use less than 110 w=

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The =
U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called off, at least temporarily, a =
vote on legislation to aid California and other states during this summer's=
 expected electricity shortage.  Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republica=
n chairman of the committee, said lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipa=
rtisan deal to get agreement on immediate help for power-starved California=
 and the West.  ``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreeme=
nt,'' Tauzin said.  He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on t=
he pending legislation as early as today.  The legislation was written by R=
epublicans to reduce demand and encourage more supply of power in Californi=
a this summer. Many Democrats on the committee objected to the bill, saying=
 it needed a provision to cap wholesale prices in the entire Western region=
 or else it fails to help the situation.  Republican lawmakers, along with =
the Bush administration, strongly oppose price controls.=09








Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism LOS ANGE=
LES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of pollution from=
 a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay owners of ba=
ckup generators to produce electricity.  The proposal, one of several optio=
ns the governor is considering, would pay for diesel power -- which at its =
dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than the cleanest natural gas power pl=
ants -- when electricity supplies are stretched.  ``If backup generators we=
re to be used, it would only be as a last resort to avoid blackouts,'' said=
 Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we are in an emergency sit=
uation. Everything is on the table.''  California's persistent power shorta=
ge has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year, w=
ith more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air cond=
itioning.  If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they woul=
d produce about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine=
 times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, accor=
ding to state Air Resources Board data.  And the state would get only about=
 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 percent of the state's peak power=
 needs -- from the backup generators. That would be enough to power about 5=
50,000 homes.  ``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' s=
aid Ellen Garvey, executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management=
 Agency. ``It's one thing to run these generators during blackouts and emer=
gency conditions, but using them for other purposes could be devastating.''=
  Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food Proc=
essors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San Die=
go Gas & Electric.  ``These generators could go a long way to taking some d=
emand off the electric grid and putting some supply back into the power sys=
tem,'' said Gino DiCaro, spokesman for the manufacturers and technology ass=
ociation.  Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units tha=
t run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and oth=
ers can be found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants an=
d university labs.  Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which a=
re not regulated, industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours=
 they can operate. But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-q=
uality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more fre=
quently.  Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -=
- a building block of asthma-inducing smog.=09










   Small generators fight for payment from utilities  Posted at 11:24 p.m. =
PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001  BY JENNIFER BJORHUS   Mercury News    BAKERSFI=
ELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a small =
natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The clam=
or of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is gone.=
 Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and twea=
ked the motionless 13-ton turbine.  Now they wait.  ``It's kind of like a s=
keleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying the octopus-tangle o=
f pipes and tanks.  Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. ow=
es it, Oildale shut down Feb. 6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed el=
ectricity with it. The hush here is the sound of small generators locked in=
 one of the most serious issues of California's energy crisis -- one that s=
tate regulators plan to wrestle with today.  Oildale is part of a growing l=
egion of small generators, from geothermal to gas-fired co-generation plant=
s, battling California's utilities and state price controls they say are cr=
ippling them. These small generators, owed about $1.5 billion, supply up to=
 a third of California's electricity.  At least 25 have sued Southern Calif=
ornia Edison over unpaid bills. Four have sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy =
proceedings in San Francisco are clogged with motions from at least 19 smal=
l generators, including Oildale. In many cases, these companies want to end=
 their long-term supply contracts with the utilities so they can sell their=
 electricity on the more lucrative open market.  ``What this is, basically,=
 is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with Ridgewood Power Manageme=
nt, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three gas-fired generators in Cali=
fornia and sued PG&E.  Officials to weigh debt  The companies are hoping fo=
r action from the California Public Utilities Commission, which is schedule=
d today to weigh whether to order the utilities to pay the back debt. Meanw=
hile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades through motions filed by d=
isgruntled generators and counter motions from PG&E.  The deteriorating fin=
ances of some of the approximately 690 small generators threatens Californi=
a's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the summer months up =
to 3,700 megawatts short.  The deep and often unexpected economic impacts o=
f California's energy crunch add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown =
not only jeopardizes the jobs of its 10 anxious employees, but those of mor=
e than 150 employees at the refinery next door.  It's one of the biggest pu=
blic policy botches in the energy crisis, some energy experts argue. Califo=
rnia is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clea=
n and efficient small power suppliers in its own back yard, they say. Gas-f=
ired co-generation plants, which provide power to nearby businesses and sel=
l electricity to utilities, are some of the most efficient producers in the=
 state. And many of the small generators harness renewable resources like t=
he sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's dependence on high-priced n=
atural gas.  ``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while =
we're paying through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else=
, this is just nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of California Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power p=
lants in the state. ``This is really a major blunder.''  The immediate cris=
is started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. That's when PG&E =
told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in Decembe=
r. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz said, which halted the=
 plant's supply.  Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine.  The move socked=
 Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over Oildale. Unable =
to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, Golden Bear canno=
t heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden Bear filed for b=
ankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 172 employees. =
 Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive =
source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought=
 the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he =
said.  Power unavailable  The California Independent System Operator, keepe=
r of the state's electricity grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power fr=
om small generators are off line. It estimates that about half of that -- 7=
00 megawatts, or energy for as many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the finan=
cial squeeze of natural gas prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Ot=
hers say financial problems have 1,100 megawatts off line.  Lawmakers haven=
't been much help. The state Assembly on March 22 rejected a hastily crafte=
d rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue has languis=
hed in Sacramento.  Days later, the utilities commission ordered California=
's utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future =
-- which saved many of them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay th=
e hefty back-due amounts. It also set a new rate for what utilities should =
pay the generators for electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too =
low for business, some argue.  The commission's position has been that the =
small generators should abide by their existing contracts, said commission =
attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the extent that some of them are facing financial=
 hardship, the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to =
help them vis-a-vis the back debt.''  The lack of stronger action to suppor=
t these generators baffles some critics.  ``It's like talking to a starving=
 man on a desert island and saying, `How long can you hold up until the shi=
p comes?' '' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficien=
cy and Renewable Technologies.  Some of the companies have appealed to the =
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if =
the state and the courts can resolve the issue.  ``We're in what essentiall=
y amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short with Ridgewood, the inde=
pendent generator that has sued PG&E.  Two courts have allowed generators f=
ighting Edison to suspend their contracts. Five have lost their fights. Ano=
ther five have won the right to put a lien on Edison's assets.  In PG&E's b=
attle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy. In=
 the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had termina=
ted before the bankruptcy.  As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 =
million it owes or Oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market=
. It also wants PG&E to pay what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its e=
lectricity.  If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forc=
ed into bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can h=
ang in limbo only three more months.  PG&E is fighting to keep its small ge=
nerators, which it says are exaggerating their damage. It reports that only=
 a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are off line.  Increased costs  If t=
he plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to pay =
the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The s=
tate Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would ha=
ve to foot that bill.  A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy cou=
rt. The judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated =
legal questions.  Meanwhile, the clock ticks.  ``We've all been a little te=
nse,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked Oildale's front desk for 10 year=
s and worries about her job. ``It's just so scary watching everything happe=
n. Who'd ever think we'd lose power?'' =09

loated to supplant that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on a=
ny of them. Plans emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily.  Energy expert=
s and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could resu=
lt in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison.  Bankruptcy means the=
 state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and Pacific Gas & Ele=
ctric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the Chapter 11 process, w=
hich could take years, experts and lawmakers said.  The state's wallet woul=
d shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and roads. Ratepayers migh=
t be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the company's legal fees,=
 because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian Bennett, vice presi=
dent of Edison International, the utility's parent company.  Southern Calif=
ornia Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the governor's plan, w=
hich calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid for $2.76 billio=
n. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various alternatives.  "We und=
erstand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are op=
en to variations on it,'' Bennett said.  Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, =
said the governor also remained committed to his deal.  "Edison is going to=
 survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public Utilities Commiss=
ion from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the agency. But the ques=
tion is "whether it will survive via the (plan) that the governor negotiate=
d or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did."  "There is still a very real=
 risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if the Legislature tinkers to=
o much with the deal, or fails to move ahead promptly,'' Wilk said.  PG&E c=
hose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the pro=
gress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's m=
ove was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big u=
tilities solvent.  "One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is=
 not filing for bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E =
case. "It would be a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays =
out of bankruptcy, they have something to trade."  Edison's creditors are s=
till waiting to see how the utility fares with the Legislature. Some have a=
greed to defer receiving payments until the end of June.  Dean Vanech, pres=
ident of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of things need to=
 happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison into bankru=
ptcy.  "In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope=
 in a deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, "there's a concern =
that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of =
time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve =
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign=
 to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief=
 executive of Edison International.  "Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson=
 said in a recent interview. "We believe there will be a solution.''  But c=
hanges are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, "bec=
ause people didn't like Plan A.''  Lawmakers cringed at some elements of th=
e plan, which many thought was overly generous to Edison: limiting investig=
ation of the utility's parent's company and guaranteeing the company an 11.=
6 percent annual return on investment.  Alternatives include: requiring pow=
er generators to accept up to one-third less than the collective $3.5 billi=
on they're owed; taxing Edison on its property and using the tax to pay off=
 its debts; and allowing Edison to build more power plants. The latest prop=
osal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off Edison's debts and gi=
ve the state the option to buy the transmission lines later. Most of the pr=
oposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off deb=
ts.  One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house be=
hind one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have =
been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the =
alternatives include that element.  But Stanford University professor James=
 Sweeney thinks compromise is possible. Lawmakers and the utility will stri=
ke a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the=
 state's political leaders. Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be=
 more fair in court.  "Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political p=
rocess,'' Sweeney said. "We're in a situation where the leadership (politic=
ally) seems not willing to bite the bullet. It may be better for our state =
to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isn't planning for a =
higher office.''   =09








      Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets  The city is the fourth sm=
all supplier with an attachment on the utility.  May 24, 2001  By KATE BERR=
Y The Orange County Register  The city of Long Beach became the fourth smal=
l power supplier to get a lien against the assets of Southern California Ed=
ison, a move that could push the utility closer to bankruptcy.  Last week, =
Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts to cover =
payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's trash-t=
o-energy plant.  Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city wi=
ll be paid, even if the utility files for bankruptcy.  Stephen Pickett, Edi=
son International's general counsel, said the utility plans to appeal.  Lon=
g Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, f=
or breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.=
7 billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, =
when deregulation was implemented.  "Edison International was required to h=
onor the debts of its subsidiary,'' said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city =
attorney.  So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known =
as qualifying facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on=
 the utility's assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-ye=
ar contracts to provide power to Edison.  Edison owes QFs about $1 billion =
and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in Los Angeles.  B=
ut Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay i=
n its contract with Edison.  "We just want to be paid under our contract. W=
e still want to deliver them power,'' said Shannon.  As a municipality, Lon=
g Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other QFs =
must.  Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edis=
on's assets could have a domino effect.  "Two things will accelerate a bank=
ruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to sell its transmission lines (to=
 the state) is going nowhere and alternatives are not acceptable - or if at=
tachments are made to the company's property that the utility doesn't want =
to run the risk of losing.''  Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain l=
iens against Edison. They include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edi=
son's 56 percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the Moh=
ave Generating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Glob=
al Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geo=
thermal Co. and Second Imperial Geothermal Co., which is owned by Covanta E=

Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdin=
gs,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi=
ng
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewate=
r
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. Th=
e
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president a=
nd
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward=
 to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the officia=
l
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental an=
d
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops =
and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  =

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gra=
y
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving constru=
ction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapo=
n is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natu=
ral
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which ha=
s
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than=
 they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants an=
d the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax m=
oney
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has c=
alled
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially durin=
g the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.

"I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators=
