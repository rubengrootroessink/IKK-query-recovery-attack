Attached is a document that WPTF members should read right away.? It  is a=
=20
motion which?was filed by Michael Aguirre, supposedly on behalf of  UCAN=20
(although UCAN is mentioned only in the cover letter and nowhere in the =20
document itself).? It requests hearings by the Commission to determine the =
=20
following:
?
"(1) the cause of the unjust and unreasonable prices being charged for =20
electricity in California; (2) the utilities efforts to pursue lawsuits=20
against  generators or marketers of electricity and natural gas."
?
The motion?further describes the following scenario which it claims =20
justifies these hearings:
?
