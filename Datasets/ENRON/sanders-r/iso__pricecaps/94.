Dan Douglass from Arter & Hadden in the Los Angeles area is WPTF's attorney.  
He plans to meet with the attorney from the AGs office to try to narrow the 
scope of the questions.  In the meantime, he will be putting something 
together in draft, which he will circulate to everyone.  But it's not due 
until Dec 13.
