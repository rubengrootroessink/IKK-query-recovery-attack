I appeared at the hearing this morning; I haven't communicated to Richard 
Sanders.  The retention bonuses were approved, and the court entered the 
stipulation turning over litigation to the participants committee.  I was 
able to successfully withdraw our opposition to the retention bonus.  As an 
aside, Joe Eisenberg never did sign the stipulation; he orally agreed to it 
at the hearing.

One note - The court stepped back from its earlier statement that 
participant's are creditors of the estate like any other.  Judge Smith said 
her earlier statement was re a specific issue, and that participants might 
not be treated like ordinary creditors for all purposes, she hadn't fully 
considered that issue.  This was in response to the creditors committee 
argument that only the participants benefitted from the costs of the non-BR 
litigation, and trade creditors shouldn't bear those costs.  J. Smith didn't 
agree or disagree, but my reading of her comments is she was leaving that 
issue for another day, when the first fee app comes in.

Here's the significant details, sorry its lengthy but I wanted to be thorough:

1.  The Perot motion - the court granted the motion to reject the Perot 
contract; Perot withdrew its objection, as did the creditors committee, 
subject to the following additional terms:  Perot agreed to subordinate some 
of its claims to trade creditor's claims (not participant's).  This did not 
appear to affect Enron or participants much, if at all; Marc Cohen had agreed 
to this.

2.  Status report - nothing we didn't already know.  Next status report 
hearing is 11/15 at 10:30 am.

3.  Stipulation re Commandeering Litigation - SCE and Puget both withdrew 
their objections, as did the creditors committee.  This was approved, subject 
to the following (these aren't all going to be placed in an order - some were 
just comments agreed to by various parties ):

   a.  the participants committee agreed that its duty was to maximize 
recovery to the estate and participants (of course, we agree, or at least I 
thought we did)

   b.  the participants committee agreed that it will not take action 
(litigation) re the AIG bond for 30 days (I know there is significant 
activity going on to resolve this issue)

   c.  re potential conflicts of interest, no disposition of litigation is 
possible without approval of the court, after opportunity for objections 
(nothing more than is required by law anyway), and if an actual conflict 
arises, the committee will not pursue that litigation but instead defer to 
the CalPX estate;

   d.  the committe will provide copies of all pleadings to Puget;

   e.  re costs of such litigation, all fee applications are subject to court 
approval and objections, and according to the stipulation all costs will be 
paid first from any recoveries from this litigation

4.  Retention/Stay bonus - approved, subject to Sladoje taking only $425k 
(down from $492k), and Miller taking only 100% of base salary, down from 105%.

That was all.  Regards,  Dan
