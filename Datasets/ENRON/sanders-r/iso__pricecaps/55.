Thanks for the note Richard, as I indicated, I will be making a presentation
at a Board of Directors meeting out of town on Wed.  I will try to break
away to be on the call for a small portion of time, but I will not be able
to listen in on the entire call.  I will call you and Gary when the board
meeting breaks up by 2 or 3 California time to see what transpired.  Mike
Day

Subject: CPUC Investigation


I have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday October 18 at 1:30 p.m.
central time to discuss our strategy relating to the CPUC investigation.
The dial in number is 1-800-998-2462 (pincode 4699545)

The rough agenda is as follows:

1.   Update on conversations with CPUC attorneys (Fergus and Day)
2.   Update on status of other companies' responses to CPUC subpoena
3.   Update on compilation of trading data to be provided to CPUC (Fergus,
Yoder, Hain, Smith, Aamodt)
4.   Legal analysis regarding Enron's objection to specific requests and to
CPUC jurisdiction (Day, Fergus, Watkiss)
5.   Assignment of tasks to be accomplished
