Subject: Imminent Release of Information to EOB


Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:
As stated in a Friday July 21 notice to Market Participants and Scheduling
Coordinators, the ISO received a subpoena on Friday from the Electricity
Oversight Board (EOB) along with a letter discussing confidential treatment
that would be afforded to confidential information. Since Friday, the ISO
has received communications from some Market Participants requesting that
prior to disclosure, the ISO, the EOB and Market Participants meet to
further discuss the subpoena. As the ISO clarified in a message sent to
Market Participants yesterday, it intends to release the information
requested by the EOB by 4:00 PM today (July 25) in accordance with the
requirements of the subpoena. As stated in the message sent yesterday,
Market Participants must raise any outstanding issues directly with the
appropriate entities. By this message the ISO clarifies that it will release
the information requested by the EOB to the EOB by 4:00 PM this afternoon
unless it receives a legally sufficient communication to the contrary from
the EOB or a court.
