Steve,
	Here is the draft summary of Enron's ripple claims against
non-claimants (entities that are not seeking refunds in the PNW proceeding.)

	For illustrative purposes, we have used three different reference
prices:  (1) ISO; (2) Seattle; and (3) Tacoma.  We believe all three are
substantially flawed, but they give you a comparison to work with.  Please
let me know if you need more detail.

Thanks
Gary
