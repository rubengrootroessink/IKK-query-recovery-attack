This guy has been pumping me for information.  It's great that other people

Attached is a copy of the complaint filed we filed today on behalf of Morgan
Stanley in connection with the California ISO price cap issue.  I will gladly
discuss with you this complaint and any other actions or proposals involving
this issue.
