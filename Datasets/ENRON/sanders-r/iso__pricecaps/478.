Here is the proposed NW template for data from FERC.  It poses huge problems
for Enron if left unchanged.  For example, it only allows data to be
submitted for sales not purchases.  Since many entities that we purchased
from were not at the hearing and will not be submitting data, we will have
no way to claim offsets.  We have an opportunity to comment on this template
before the court rules on it on 8/9.

Thanks
Gary
