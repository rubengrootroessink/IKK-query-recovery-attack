Jim/Vicki:

I have just received the attached correspondence relating to a subpoena 
issued by the California Public Utilities Commission (the "Commission") to 
the Automated Power Exchange ("APX").  The Commission is seeking from APX 
records associated with an investigation of the wholesale energy market in 
California. 

I understand that we have already received a subpoena and that  Mike Smith is 
already handling this matter.
