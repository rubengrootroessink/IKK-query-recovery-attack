Talked to a couple of people on this today.

Elena Schmid, ISO VP of Strategic SOmething, said that the ISO wants to know 
right away if the subpoena will be challenged in court.  If so, the ISO will 
not submit the info to the EOB.

I talked with Rob Lamkin, VP Southern, to see if he knoew anyone who planned 
to initiate a court challenge. He said he didn't.-- he said that Southern had 
sent a letter to the EOB and ISO yesterday, asking for an extension to the 
deadline and requesting a meeting to sit down and talk about how to maintain 
confidentiality. He said his attorneys believe that the EOB's subpoena 
authority is "questionable" but that Southern didn't want to have a fight 
about it in court.

On price caps, Rob also mentioned that he had heard that Greg Blue (Dynegy) 
was going around trying to get a group together to support a motion for $250 
!! He said that Richardson (DOE) told the WAPA Board member not to support a 
lower price cap. (but then, someone else told me the opposite -- I'll let you 
know if I hear more on that).

We still have Enron people working on four Board members to see if we can get 
one to turn.
