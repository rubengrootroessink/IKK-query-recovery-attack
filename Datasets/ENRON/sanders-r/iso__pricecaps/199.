Subject: Hendricks (SDWR case) - TRO Order



Per Doug Tribble's prior email, attached is a copy of Judge McConnel's order
denying Aguirre's TRO application in Hendricks v. State Department of Water
Resources.

Also, for those of you who may not have seen it, here is Doug's status
report:

The TRO was denied based upon the court's finding that the plaintiff
has failed to establish a reasonable probability of success. From the tone
of the opinion it would appear that the DWR has a very good shot at
defeating the case at demurrer. The AG told me the demurrer must be filed
today and the court set a hearing on the demurrer this Friday! I will have
the order sent out shortly. DRT
