Richard:

Do you think you could give me a quick call at your convenience regarding the 
foregoing?  As you know, a number of companies received subpoenas in the 
California PUC investigation last week.  A few of our lawyers received 
inquiries late last week from a couple of those companies, most of which own 
CA situs generation plants, about possibly representing them in that 
investigation.  I informed my partners that we had met on this subject with 
ENA first and I told them to "stall" if at all possible for a few days since 
I wanted LeBoeuf to be available to assist ENA if the opportunity was 
presented to us.  I think you had said you were meeting with Jim and Mark 
last Wednesday to discuss which outside firm you would use and I was not sure 
whether a decision on that front had been reached.  Could you let me know if 
you have decided on another counsel to represent ENA so that I could inform 
my partners that they can go ahead and respond to some of the inquiries they 
have received.  Obviously, we would continue to like to work with ENA on this 
investigation, but we fully understand if you have decided to go with another 
counsel.  As you can appreciate, many of the companies involved are anxious 
to get outside counsel on board quickly, so if you could just let me know 
what the status may be on your front that would be tremendously helpful to 
us.  Thanks very much for your time and consideration in this regard.  I'm 
sorry we were not able to hook up in NYC last week, but hopefully we will be 
able to do that in the near future.  Thanks again.  John
