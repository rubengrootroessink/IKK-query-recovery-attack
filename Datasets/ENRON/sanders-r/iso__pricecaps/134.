EPMI Current Trading Activities
 We reviewed the FERC orders from Friday night and discovered that a
penalty has been created for generators that refuse to sell energy to the
ISO in an emergency.  You will recall Tim Belden telling us that he had made
the decision not to sell out of market to the ISO because of the refund risk
and the credit issues.  When I asked Tim whether in his view we would be
considered a generator if we are long on power that we have the exclusive
right to sell.  He said he did not know and welcomed our advice on the
topic.  He wanted to know, for example, when is it an emergency.  He also
told me that the ISO has sought from the Secretary of Energy a declaration
of emergency under Section 202(c) of the power act.  Under that provision,
apparently if asked for energy, you have to deliver and worry about getting
paid later (my uninformed interpretation.)  At Robin's suggestion, I
contacted Dan Watkiss who was going to get his team to evaluate quickly and
provide advice by tomorrow morning.
Selected Contract Analysis  (Randy Conner)
 Tomorrow we will be sending to all of you copies of the contracts
and draft contracts selected by Christian Yoder and Steve Hall that might
relate to marketing of various strategies to customers.
