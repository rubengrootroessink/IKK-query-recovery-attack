Please convey to Owners of Pacific Virgo that we will be arranging a joint 
analysis of the Elang cargo in Singapore sometime middle of next week.  We 
will revert with details as soon as the samples (from Philippines) arrive 
Singapore in the next couple of days.  Meantime, we nominate SGS Singapore to 
conduct the analysis and would appreciate your agreement.  

Thanks.

Eric
