 You have ECT's authority (per John Nowlan and Alan Aronowitz) to notify 
Mitsubishi that ECT declines to pay its claim for freight and demurrage due 
to the cargo contamination that occurred aboard the ship and that ECT wishes 
to go forward with appointment of arbitrators for London arbitration.  I ask 
that David draft the appropriate document and then confer with Matt as to who 
should send this document to Mitsubishi.  No one over here needs to see it 
before you send it out.  You may wish to send a copy to Cliff Bennett as 
well.  Please send me a copy of this document by e-mail or telefax  once you 
have sent it out.

 Many thanks.

       Britt
