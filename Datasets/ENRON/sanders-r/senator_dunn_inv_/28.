As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducte=
d by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no go=
od press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen D=
unn stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding con=
fidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they wou=
ld be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that =
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dun=
n spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the diff=
iculty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of c=
laims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the FE=
RC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to th=
e bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As yo=
u undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the ge=
nerators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we w=
ant to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at Fr=
iday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to procee=
d in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after the fa=
iled efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not talke=
d by phone when you get this.
