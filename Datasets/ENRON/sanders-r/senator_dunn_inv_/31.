> Rich,
> 	I just received a phone call from the IT department at EPMI.  They
> have two computers which require immediate maintenance.  The first is a
> desktop of an individual who sits at the front desk.  Her work station is
> inoperable and part of the fix may be to format the hard drive.  Second,
> there is a laptop for someone who is not a trader, which will not boot.
> In order to repair that machine, they may have to format the hard drive as
> well.  At the present time, there is no easy way to copy the contents of
> the hard drive before those machines are repaired, because they are
> inoperable.
>
> 	Based on our prior discussions, it is my understanding that for
> operational needs such as these, EPMI is free to repair these machines
> notwithstanding the request for preservation of data.
>
> 	If for any reason you have a different understanding, please let me
> know immediately.
