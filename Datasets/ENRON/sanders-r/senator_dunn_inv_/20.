 	Here is a draft of a proposed protective order for your review. We
told the AG on Friday that we would send them a draft of our proposed
protective order tomorrow, September 5.  We also agreed with the AG on
Friday that we would each submit our proposed orders to the court on
September 7.
	The attached draft is a redlined version of the protective order
proposed to us by the AG on August 29. We have tried to keep changes to a
minimum, but have drastically reduced the number of "authorized persons"
under the order, and included provisions to categorize documents as "highly
confidential" and seek further court review to protect this category of
documents.
