Just got this. She is taking a harder line that Sen Dunn did yesterday. I'll wait to hear from them on the nonwaiver agreement. I'll find out what happened at today's meeting of the generators and Sen Dunn

Mike,

Attached are the Select Committee's Confidentiality Agreement and Document
Depository Protocol.  As Senator Dunn reiterated a number of times during
the hearing and meeting with you, the three conditions for compliance are
that Enron sign the attached confidentiality agreement, sign the attached
document depository protocol and deposit into the depository documents
responsive to the Select Committee's priority list of 16 document
categories.  These 3 conditions remain the same.  The Select Committee does
not agree to enter into a "protective order."  The attached confidentiality
agreement is intended to be just that and not "an outline for a proposed
protective order."

The Senator and Larry Drivon will review your proposed nonwaiver agreement
and get back to you on that after they have had a chance to do so.

Should you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to call Larry
Drivon at (916) 445-5831.

Alexandra
(916) 445-5831
