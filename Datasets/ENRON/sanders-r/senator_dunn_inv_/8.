Rich,
 Thank you for the update.  I would like to speak to you today about
some other practical suggestions that we have relating to email handling.  I
also want to tell you about a situation that came up in the past few days.
In short, one employee's computer hard drive ran out of space related to the
do not delete directive.  We decided to have the employee move sufficient
files from the hard drive on to the network (so they would be backed up on
tape) and then authorized the employee to delete those files that had been
moved to create sufficient work space so that they could do their job.  We
anticipate that this issue may arise again and we intend to follow the same
procedure.

 I will call you to discuss these issues.

Thanks
Gary

Gary--
     I'm sorry I don't have an answer for you yet on the items we discussed
yesterday.  I'm still working on it.  Thanks for your patience.  -Rich
