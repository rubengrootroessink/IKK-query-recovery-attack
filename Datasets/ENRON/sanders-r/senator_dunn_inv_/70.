> Subject:	Confidentiality Order with AG re EES subpoena
>
> 	The attorney general will agree to a confidentiality order to govern
> EES's production that was approved by the Los Angeles Superior Court that
> adjudicated the dispute on confidentiality between the AG and Reliant,
> Dynegy and Mirant. The court's order allows the AG to share documents
> produced with the AGs in Washington and Oregon. Mirant and Reliant have
> filed a writ to overturn the LA court's order on grounds that they are not
> under investigation in Oregon or Washington. Today we learned the Oregon
> and Washington AG's have initiated investigations against Mirant and
> Reliant. If EES or Enron resists the confidentiality order on these
> grounds we may invite similar action.
> 	Mark Tuohey, Mike Kirby and I discussed this today. We recommend we
> negotiate hard with the AG, but be willing to agree to the confidentiality
> order offered by the AG with  respect to EES if we can end with agreement
> on two conditions:
>
> 	.EES will produce only documents within the state of California
> under the confidentiality order and the parties agree that the
> confidentiality order governs only such documents.
> 	. EES's agreement to the confidentiality order does not waive any
> objections to either the investigation or the subpoena which EES may make
> in any subsequent action or proceeding.
>
> 	We need to get back to the AG tomorrow with our approach. Please let
> me know your views.
