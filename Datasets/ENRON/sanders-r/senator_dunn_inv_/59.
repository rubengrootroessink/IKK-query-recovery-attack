To All California Power Exchange Participants:

Please be advised that the CalPX has received through FERC a data request
from the United States General Accounting Office (GAO), as part of an
investigation into "issues surrounding the possible existence and use of
market power in California's electricity industry."  The GAO seeks bid data
that is confidential under Section 19.3.2 of the CalPX tariff.   A copy of
the request is attached below.

The GAO has requested the CalPX to provide such information no later than
Friday, July 6, 2001.  The GAO has also agreed to certain processes that
will govern how confidential materials are to be treated (see attached
September 22, 2000 letter).  If you desire to assert a claim of privilege
or confidentiality pursuant to legal authority, please direct your written
statement as follows by noon on July 5, 2001.
