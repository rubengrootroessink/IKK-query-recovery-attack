Gary--As I recall, we agreed to permit necessary repairs but for the repair
actions to be logged or tracked in some way.  Thanks.  -Rich

Rich,
 I just received a phone call from the IT department at EPMI.  They
have two computers which require immediate maintenance.  The first is a
desktop of an individual who sits at the front desk.  Her work station is
inoperable and part of the fix may be to format the hard drive.  Second,
there is a laptop for someone who is not a trader, which will not boot.  In
order to repair that machine, they may have to format the hard drive as
well.  At the present time, there is no easy way to copy the contents of the
hard drive before those machines are repaired, because they are inoperable.

 Based on our prior discussions, it is my understanding that for
operational needs such as these, EPMI is free to repair these machines
notwithstanding the request for preservation of data.

 If for any reason you have a different understanding, please let me
know immediately.

Sincerely,
Gary Fergus
