Valarie and Monica, 

Further to Chris's email below, I wanted to let you know that everything in 
his memo is accurate. From my viewpoint, we have complied with all the 
procedures necessary to terminate the Agreement with CanFibre and thus I 
consider the Agreement to be terminated. 

My litigation colleague, Richard Sanders, will be in the Portland office on 
Thursday to talk with Tim Belden about the possible risks associated with the 
early termination of the Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any questions as to the termination of the 
CanFibre Agreement. 

Thanks, 

Shari Stack 
ENA Legal

As indicated on the attached memo, the CanFibre deal is terminated.  We no 
longer have a forward obligation to serve Can Fibre.  Our forward position 
reports should no longer reflect a sale to Can Fibre.  No more invoices will 
be sent and the matter is forwarded to legal to recoup outstanding 
receivables and manage any future issues.  Shari will send you an e-mail 
indicating that the legal department concurs with this assessment.

Thanks!

Chris
