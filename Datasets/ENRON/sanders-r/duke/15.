Per Beatty:

1.  Morris is available immediately

2.  Phillips is unavailable until March 5 at the earliest.

3.  Ken Roberts has said to withdraw his name from the list (which saves us
the trouble of striking him).

4.  As previously noted, Webster has been withdrawn by Duke and Paul has
been withdrawn too (Beatty says it is because he has been picked by Duke as
their party arbitrator in another matter-- which shows how Renfrew was
trying to screw us).

Beatty suggests Jim Coleman of Carrington Coleman as a possibility.  I do
not know him.

He also suggests L. K. Smith of Oklahoma as a possibility.  I don't know him
either.

Renfrew pressed Beatty to agree to someone by this Monday (same speech Smith
had given me).  Beatty demurred.  Renfrew is still out of the country  and
will be until the 22nd of January.

For scheduling purposes, be advised I have just been re-set for trial in
another case on February 26, so we need to avoid that week for the hearing.

We still need to press forward on the witness interviews and witness
preparations.  Where do we stand on getting access to some or all of them?

Let's have a conference call when convenient for you, Richard.  Thanks.
