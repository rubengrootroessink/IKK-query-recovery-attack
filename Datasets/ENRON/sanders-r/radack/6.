uh huh.  now dig this:

you ol'two belly button sportin', G Gordon Liddy promotin', zydeco lovin',
Old Testament swearin', cookbook totin', 76116 persistin', your own

injunction weildin', lawsuit threatenin' knucklehead!

till you caught your boss corruptin', Okie race mixin', Texas returnin'
nappyhead!

and you may get yourself some too you ol' Dan Majerle doppelgangin', swamp

sippin' fool!

y'all sure y'all really want me to come home?  i wonder...

i would like to ask all y'all to use your imagination a bit so that i may
make my first attempt at the powerfully tricky and thankless task of
modifying group behavior in the clan sanders.

imagine that you had a massive and grotesquely noticeable birthmark shaped
just like a swastika on your forehead.  any sort of limb will do - the point
is, it is something of which you are always fully and painfully aware.
next, imagine that everyone you love began each conversation with you by
mentioning it, not cognizant of the fact that of course you know about it
and it does not please you to hear the constant refrains asking about it.

exaggeration for effect aside, y'all need to know that answering the
question "when are you coming home" every time i pay a dime to give a holler
back home gets purty doggone tiring.  it ain't at aggravation point yet,
but...  suffice to say i know by now how y'all feel, okay?

of course if YOU should care to ring the good and gentle folk at nippon
telephone and telegraph, you may say whatever you want.  the single
exception to this rule is the Great She-Elephant herself, who not only
retains the right to nag but who also has earned it.  have i bragged about
how much of an uberfrau she has been lately?  truly stalwart stuff - jazz
documentary taped, bitchin' xmas present, and even chunked some green into
the bank for us.  and just this morning took a mate of mine visiting Foat
Wuth for the weekend out for lunch!  Viva Camilla!  or in nipponese, she is
a sugoi oka-san!

but for not listening to my tape of jazz interpretations of broadway musical
tunes (and i KNOW you haven't listened to it, mama), you may step on up and
lend me your eyes, you ol' avocado eatin', bridge masterin', Jerry Jones
hatin', Mansfield escapin', wine spillin', no high (or low) heel wearin',
cookie selling girl scout at the door slammin', nicotine cravin', taxbill
complainin' but no church tithin', chili and rice cookin' old petal!
(apparently that is yorkshirespeak for darling)

well that is enough insults for a spell - got a wee carried away there.
just wanted to say hey to y'all and throw out the following info, namely
that the next visit will come in the autumntime.  colorado is playing UT in
austin on october 21st, and the frivolity of such an aiming point makes it
irresistable.  count on mid to late october unless notified otherwise....

hope this finds all y'all well.  please know that the love flowing from
hereabouts has not abated one iota - if anything, it has the strength of ten
grinches!  keep well -

rollo
