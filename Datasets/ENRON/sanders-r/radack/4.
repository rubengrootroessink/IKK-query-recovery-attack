Hi Richard and Julie,
 I can't remember exactly what activity I was talking about, but I do
remember saying I would love for Ben to come up. James is going to camp Pine
Cove June 24-30th. Our vacation Bible school is June 18-22. I can't promise I
could get them in the same class because of their age difference but I could
try. I think Ben would like it just the same because James always meets kids
there. It is only for a few hours in the morning.
 I don't have much else planned this summer so far. It is a little early to
know what is offered. James will probably be starting a new school next year.
He went to visit on Tues.. We found out we had a lot of work in math to catch
him up with his class. I plan to spend an hour or so each day this summer on
math. I would like him to have a couple weeks of swim classes in June, but
that only takes an hour a day. The other thing James loved was a soccer camp
he went to last year. The nice thing about the camp is they have lots of age
groups together so James and Ben could be together. I am not sure what week
this is. They send something out in April or May.
 Really, any week but the Pine Cove week would be fine. I will find something
fun for them to do. I hope Ben won't mind a little math each day. We really
would love to have him come visit. Please tell me a date when you decide, so
I won't forget to include Ben in any activity I sign James up for.
Susan
