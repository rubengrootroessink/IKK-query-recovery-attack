		 Subject: Infineum lawsuit

Bob, Gary given the fact that the lawsuit has been filed I think any 
communication/discussion internally and externally should be initiated and 
controlled by our lead counsel for the litigation.  There are issues of 
privilege/disclosure, etc. the senstivily of which we non-lawyers are not 
aware that now become very important.   This is particularly important in 
respect to strategy and evaluation/interpretation of past events and comments 
on the clarity or ambiguity of those events.  It would be a good idea to pass 
the word to this effect throughout the organization.  I do know enough about 
litigation that the legal team now takes the lead and any material or 
summaries or analyses prepared should be directed by them and handled 
specifically as they advise.   We need to be especially careful not to 
circulate any written material without legal clearance.  For the time being, 
please coordinate anything relevant to the Infineum situation with Lisa 
Mellencamp for guidance.  Thanks.  Dick.
