Evidently I misunderstood my marching orders.  Richard Sanders just called to advise me that any vote on an arbitration demand was within his bailiwick and that he was adamantly opposed to the committee making a demand or commencing any other action against SCE at this time.  I apologize for my misunderstanding and wanted to correct the record immediately.  Needless to say, Enron at this time also opposes expenditure of time by committee counsel to prepare papers in connection with any arbitration demand.
