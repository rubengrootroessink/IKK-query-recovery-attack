Richard,  my comments on the August 10 PX letter, having participated in th=
e August 13 and September 5 prehearing conferences:

Cal PX has always asserted its neutrality in the prehearing conferences in =
the CA proceeding.  Although this assertion is only partially true, I think=
 we would be barking up the wrong tree if we were to pursue the PX, given S=
teve's correct assessment that the PX is judgment proof.=20

My comments regarding the numbered paragraphs of the letter:

1.=09Regarding confidentiality, there is a protective order (as amended) in=
 place.  Despite this, my educated guess is that the protective order could=
 very well be lifted given the rather political nature of the proceeding.  =
Judge Birchman alluded to this possibility just yesterday at the prehearing=
 conference.  He has also previously expressed a belief that the conduct of=
 the proceeding could be hampered if each party's refund data is deemed to =
be confidential.  In short, I believe there will be less confidentiality ra=
ther than more.

2.-3.=09The PX is severely resource constrained.  Additionally the PX must =
await the ISO data before it can start generating the data that the PX itse=
lf needs to produce.  As of yesterday, the PX did not have all the ISO data=
, and the data they did receive from ISO was riddled with errors.  This gav=
e rise to the one month delay in the hearing schedule that the Judge ordere=
d yesterday.  As to the $150 breakpoint issue, I understand that it should =
not be as difficult to calculate as the PX purports, but the PX truly is un=
derstaffed and has virtually no funds.  In any case, this probably is a moo=
t issue since the Judge determined in the August 13 prehearing conference t=
hat the $150 breakpoint issue is pending before the Commission, probably sh=
ouldn't be dealt with in this proceeding and should be disposed of by stipu=
lation.  The parties are given about a week to agree on a draft stipulation=
 by the 12th on this and other "threshold" issues, failing which the Judge =
will decide the stipulation issue after oral argument on the morning of 9/1=
7.  Bottom line now on when the PX is to submit its data per the amended he=
aring schedule- 10/19.

4.=09Refund implementation procedures have not received much consideration =
as of yet.  Of course, our position is that we net our purchases and sales;=
 not pay in and then expect to be allocated a refund.  Interestingly, the l=
etter at 4b. foretold the finding of the Judge in the August 13 conference =
that refunds and offsets need to be fully a part of this proceeding and the=
 findings that he must certify to the Commission (as opposed to a matter to=
 be taken care of outside the hearing room by compliance filing).  I am loo=
king into the implications of allocating in accordance with a "share-fracti=
on allocation method"=09

Richard,

Here are a few comments on the CalPX letter to FERC outlining the difficult=
ies in calculating PX refunds. =20

1.  The PX claims it is a "neutral party in this proceeding" and is only a =
conduit for cash.  True for PX business, not true for CAISO obligations.  T=
he CAISO holds SC's responsible for non-payment, not the SC's customers.  T=
he PX was the SC for most of the transactions going through the day-ahead a=
nd hour-ahead market.  Therefore, the PX is primarily liable.  I'm not sure=
 how this helps us, though, since the PX has no money. =20

2.  Page 3, SC Data.  I was unaware that the CalPX acted as SC until Februa=
ry 28th---one month after it closed the doors on January 31st.  During this=
 time, the CAISO was probably in violation of its Tariff, which requires SC=
s to be creditworthy.

3.  Page 5.  Commandeered contracts.  What is the status of the PX's claim =
against the State of California?  The State owes the PX, as representative =
for its Participants, the mark-to-market value of the contracts on January =
31st, less amounts paid by CDWR to suppliers.  If the PX won't bring this c=
laim, its bankruptcy trustee or the PX Participants should bring this claim=
 against the State of Califonria.

4.  Pages 3 and 4.  $150 Breakpoint.  I asked Kit Blair in Volume Managemen=
t to review this letter and he said that it was his view and the view of tw=
o other folks in VM that the PX is vastly overstating the difficulty in cal=
culating the $150 breakpoint.  His view was that it should take hours or da=
ys, but not weeks.  However, I do not see how we get an advantage from acce=
lerating the calculation of refunds.

Finally, according to reports from Credit and VM, the remaining PX employee=
s are not exactly the "A-team."   I suggest we should ask FERC to require t=
he PX to document its methodology for calculating refunds, so that we can r=
eview for errors.  Spot audits by independent auditors might be a good idea=
, too.

Steve
