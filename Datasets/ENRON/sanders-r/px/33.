See the "nice" relay of e-mails below.  I am a bit amazed at Howard Weg
lately (I think he underestimates the role of the client in a number of
circumstances).  I provide this to you for purposes of your evaluation of
issues in connection with your being on the relevant subcommittee and would
appreciate your not sharing the fact that I shared this with you.  Thanks,

Howard--

This is not the tone I expect from a friend and colleague.

On the substance, all the subcommittee reports each week is that it is
having nice meetings, is making some progress and will have more to report
soon.  This has gone on a long time.  As a member of the PC, Reliant would
like to hear a substantive report.  Based on Lisa Mellankamp's email,
subcommittee member Enron seems frustrated.  We think Mirant may be as
well.  I sent an email to you and Marc so that you could make sure BDO
shines on Thursday.  I was being NICE so that everyone could appear
prepared.

     Michael, I assume you are sending these innane emails with rather
     naive questions for the benefit of your client.  Otherwise they really
     are quite insulting to the recipient and amateurish.  The subcommittee
     of Mirant, APX, Enron, LADWP, Powerex, Cohen and BDO are spending time
     on these and other questions.  While it is not complex, to be sure,
     there is more than simple answers to the winddown, budget and other
     questions that we want to resolve in a way that helps us in the short
     and long run.  Just because you are not on the subcommittee, Reliant I
     am sure understands that others owed both more and less are more
     impatient to resolve the process and are working on it even when
     Reliant is not there to root us on.

     Please try to contain this stuff rather than fuel it, please.  Its bad
     enough that I have to deal with Eisenberg.

          We really need to hear on Thursday what BDO has learned and what
          it recommends, including:


          How has the PX ramped down operations so far?
          Who is still there, what does each person do and how much do they
          get paid?
          How is the database stored?
          What is the fastest, cheapest way to shut down the PX and retain
          the information in the database in a form that can be
          manipulated?


          What PX employees, if any, are needed to accomplish this?
          Budget to accomplish the foregoing.


          Please make sure they are prepared.
