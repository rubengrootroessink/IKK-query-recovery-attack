One the chance you are retrieving messages I wanted to update you on my con=
versations with some PX committee members about the arbitration issue.  At =
the moment, in addition to APX and Power Exchange, Avista and perhaps Maran=
t seem to support the idea.  I do not know the positions of Reliant, Sempra=
 and Salton Sea.  Both Avista and Marant feel that something needs to be do=
ne because (1) Edison seems to be blowing us off and (2) the legislature do=
es not seem to be coming up with a solution that helps the power generators=
.  There thought is that it wouldn't really hurt and probably will help to =
put some pressure on.  Avista likes the idea of addressing the issue throug=
h a committee and its counsel.  They think that there is strength in number=
s and like the ability to share the cost of one counsel.  They seem reasona=
bly satisfied with the job Kaye, Scholer is doing.  However, Avista doesn't=
 think that this major a step should be taken on a 5 to 4 vote of the commi=
ttee if that's where things are.  Are you prepared to argue the reasons for=
 deferring action against Edison?
