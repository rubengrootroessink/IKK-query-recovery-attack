Please only send the Enron check to us.  I'll check and see who the 
appropriate person at EOG is and will forward that information as soon as 
possible.

Regarding above in the Kansas case, I am preparing the pro rata reimbursement 
checks from the Holland & Hart trust account to Enron and EOG.  To whom shall 
I send the EOG check?  Shall I send both checks to your attention?
