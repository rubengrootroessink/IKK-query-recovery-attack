		 Subject: ECP Corporate Service Invoice - December

We are trying to finalize our 2000 billings to ECP.  Could you please tell me 
the percentage/hours of time you spent on East Coast Power during the month 
of December.  I would appreciate it if you could get back to me today, or 
tomorrow at the latest.  

Mary - could you forward the number of transactions and accounts
Jason - could you forward the number of contractor hours and help/remote 
support hours.  

Thanks.  :-)
