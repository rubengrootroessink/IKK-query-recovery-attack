Elizabeth,

We have seemed to hit a brick wall in finding out who has monitored the fax 
machine we have discussed on the 31st Floor.  Don Black's assistant, 
Claudette Harvey said no one really collects the faxes and it is used by two 
groups.  Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be 
monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.  We called the 
service number on the fax to see if we could get a "poll" report listing all 
the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has 
memory for the last 10 faxes.  I have called Lucent (the telephone people) 
and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the 
incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia
