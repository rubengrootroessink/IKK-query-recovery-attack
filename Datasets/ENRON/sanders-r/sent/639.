Sorry to hear that you have yet not successfully off loaded your duties of
as unofficial secretary of the group.

Andy, not me, will be the Enron representative on the Steering Committee.  I
had subbed at a meeting 10 or so days ago because Richard Sanders had been
tied up on an extended project.  Andy will handle it from this point
forward.

I will ask Andy to copy you on the information that he sends to Tom
Nicholas.

Hope you have a nice holiday.

Charles -

Did you mean that you also wanted to participate on the Wright Steering
Committee ?  Our approach has been that only in-house counsel will
participate;  it is only in the event that an in-house attorney is unable to
participate on the committee that outside counsel has been proxied in.
Please advise.

Could you also have Andy cc: me on his E-mail to Tom forwarding his contact
information.  As the secretary (of sorts) of the Steering Committee, I have
been maintaining updated information for the groupl.

Regards,

Carol A. Alexander
