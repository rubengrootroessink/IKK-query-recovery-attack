		 Subject: Eastern District of Texas Gas Royalty Cases

This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas 
royalty cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before 
Judge Hannah.  Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a 
defendant.  Both cases are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The 
allegations are similar to those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The 
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil 
Oil Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing 
Southeast, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and 
Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. 

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs 
are Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, 
WI.  The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production 
Company, Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading 
Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the 
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of 
Houston, signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at 
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested 
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker 
told me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped 
as defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were 
named in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again 
named as defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed 
on June 13, 2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the 
plaintiffs, had a conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron 
and EOG to preserve the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 
13 complaint is not yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.
