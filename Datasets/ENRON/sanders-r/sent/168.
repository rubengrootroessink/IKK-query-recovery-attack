Brad:

First, let me say yes, if you want me to, I can write the company and "put
them on notice" that you will invoice them. Also, alert them that we would
consider court action if it occured again.  Let me know and I will proceed.

Second, yes, we could file an injunction if necessary Obviously that would
involve more time and expense, hearing, probably opposition by the other
company and see what a court would do.  We could use as grounds they have
already done it, are working in the area and, unless under court order to
stay a distance away, would be likely do it again.  Also, we could ask for
damages for everything involved by EBS, repair, disruption, etc.

Both of these are things that Richard Sanders would have a view on I am
sure, so I am cc'ing him on this.  Again, let me know what you would like to
do re court action.

I will await hearing from you.

John
