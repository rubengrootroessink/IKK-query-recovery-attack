>Dear Sir,


>My Name is Linda Stout and i live at 1735 Janes Mill RD,
>when people ask what the people where doing drilling down the road from us
>they were told that it was a well for water or some sort not a power plant
>that would keep you up at night or morning.
>I have a good reason for complainting as well as everyone eles down or up
>the road from us because the noise is so annoying and no one wants to come
>to your house to visit neverless to say we have jobs just like everyone
>does and like myself works nights or day and our childern need there rest
>but no one seems to care about that and the noise cont.
>THE NEWSPAPER said something about it could blow up if the man caring for
>it didnt do his job well dont that make me feel better knowing that my
>family isnt safe in their own home.
>It's 8:20pm right now and it sound like there is a bad storm outside
or a disturbance that the law would be summons to and if this was a party
making that much noise there would be people in jail for it but good grief
that noise that the power plant makes would wake the dead and that is the
truth and yes i would like to get away from this but we dont like much
paying for our home but no one would dare buy it.
>Some guy name PETE came to our home awhile back and said he didnt even have
>to enter our home to see if it was loud he stood at the driveway and
saw that our windows were shaking, you wake up to dishes rattling wondering
whose is in the kitchen and it wont be anyone.
>I am not one to complain i try to keep peace among my neighbors because
>they have right to but it's to the point were none of our friends or family
>wants to come over to visit or talk or watch t.v because we have to yell
>what we are trying to say to each other or turn the t.v up so loud to
>drowing out the noise.
>Ihope we can come to some sort of understanding about this even if it means
>trading homes with you or who ever done this and atleast find time
in your busy work days to hold a meeting with the resident of JANES MILL RD.
to help solve this problem and concern we have because i feel we are atleast
intitled to that.
I have lived here for 3 peaceful years and every one said how beautiful and
peaceful it was and now they are glad they dont live here and that is sad
because i was proud of my home.
>WE feel like everyone at this power plant is avoiding us and our complaints
>but the problem is never going to be solved if we dont atleast meet and try
>to hear one another side to this i am sure it was built because we would
>need it and yes that was a good thing but what about the ones whom has to
>live here and suffer through it because we have no where eles to go and
>cant sell our homes we worked hard to buy
>because no one wants them.

                           thank you,
                                   LINDA STOUT AND THE REST
                                   OF THE JANES MILL RD RESIDENTS.
