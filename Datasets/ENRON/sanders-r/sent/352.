I am on the run now, and I have not had a chance to finish the second draft
of the answers to the DOJ questions.  However, because of schedules, I
wanted to put something in your hands as soon as possible.

My secretary will be e-mailing and faxing the draft in progress to you
shortly.

I will do additional work on the draft this evening when I return from my
meeting out of the office.

So, if you have comments on the new draft, please e-mail or fax them to me
so that I can incorporate them into tonight's draft.
