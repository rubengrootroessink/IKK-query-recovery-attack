I am sorry I am so late in getting back to you. It has been a rough week. It 
looks like SoCal Ed. and PG&E are really going to file for bankruptcy. We 
have been working around the clock to review all our contracts with them and 
attempt to minimize the damage. I will call you tomorrow to talk about how to 
get your team involved.

the grammys are here in la on feb 21 and by virtue of the fact that we 
represent the recording academy we get some tickets to the show and the party 
--which is a great party--afterward.  would you and jim and your better halfs 
like to join us?  would give you a chance to get to know some more of our 
people.
