>>to your house to visit neverless to say we have jobs just like everyone
>>does and like myself works nights or day and our childern need there rest
>>but no one seems to care about that and the noise cont.
>>THE NEWSPAPER said something about it could blow up if the man caring for
>>it didnt do his job well dont that make me feel better knowing that my
>>family isnt safe in their own home.
>>It's 8:20pm right now and it sound like there is a bad storm outside
>or a disturbance that the law would be summons to and if this was a party
>making that much noise there would be people in jail for it but good grief
>that noise that the power plant makes would wake the dead and that is the
>truth and yes i would like to get away from this but we dont like much
>paying for our home but no one would dare buy it.
>>Some guy name PETE came to our home awhile back and said he didnt even
>>have to enter our home to see if it was loud he stood at the driveway and
>saw that our windows were shaking, you wake up to dishes rattling wondering
>whose is in the kitchen and it wont be anyone.
