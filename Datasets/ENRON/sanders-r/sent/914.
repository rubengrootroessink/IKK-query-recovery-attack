We have no plans for the weekend of the 20th. Why not bring them all. We can 
get babysitters to help if we go out(which I am sure we will)
As for the Perd, we are definitely coming. I invited John and Yvonne but they 
cannot come. Doug and Susan may be coming. Someone needs to call Steve and 
Jane Ellen---would you do this. We will come Fri. morning.
p.s.---
I have read your explanation of when you are coming and what this Easter egg 
hunt is all about two times and I cannot make heads or tails of it.

for is April 20th and 21st. ?We are invited to both the rehearsal dinner and  
the wedding, which is at the Houstonian. ? 

With Maury's work schedule, I bet that he will be unable to make the dinner,  
so I need to decide if I am going to or not. ?But, we would like to come for  
the wedding. ?That is either asking you to help us with the kids...all of  
them, or ... helping us find enough sitters for them if you have plans. ? 
Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do  
that. ??It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young. 

Anyway, please see if this conflicts with anything. ?The other option would  
be to stay at John and Yvonne's....or leave the boys there...and Maury and I  
stay with Carolyn at the Houstonian. ?We do not want to impose....and I know  
that I am asking alot. 

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was  
coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes....so cancelled. ?We  
will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? 
There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I 
think  
it will be at 1:00...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will 
give  
some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at 
the  
Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is  
better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and  
come back for the night. 

When it gets closer we can coordinate some meals. ?I would be happy to  
grocery shop for everyone.....and split it down there. ?What do you feel 
like  
having. 

Anyway, I will talk with you later.
