I am a little behind the curve--nothing new. Has this been resolved? Other

Attached is the Opposition of the City and County of San Francisco to the
trading motion.  They make several evidentiary objections.  To be on the
safe side, we suggest filing supplemental declarations from each of you on
the issues raised in the Opposition.  I will subsequently e-mail suggested
text to you.  Since the hearing is on Friday morning, we will need to file
these declarations by Thursday early afternoon at the latest.  Accordingly,
once you receive them, please finalize the declarations and fax them back to
me at (213) 892-4707 as soon as possible, but by no later than Noon
tomorrow.

Thank you.
