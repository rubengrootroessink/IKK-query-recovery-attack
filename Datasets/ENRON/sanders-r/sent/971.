I have instructed Jerry Odom, our FVP site representative, that all accidents 
reports he receives regarding the injury accident of the Jomax employee last 
week are only to be provided to myself, Jake, or Sheila.  Jerry received 
reports today from Jomax and CIG but NEPCO is still refusing to provide 
theirs.  Please let me know if there is anyone else you would like on 
distribution at this time.
Regards,
Mark
