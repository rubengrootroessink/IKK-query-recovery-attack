john,

sorry it has taken so long to reply to the copy of the fax from clyde & co 
which you passed to me some time ago.

basically, i reviewed the paper from sgs on copper corrosion contamination in 
lpg which reviewed possible scenarios of the lpg becoming off spec during a 
sea voyage. their conclusion was that propane which contained polysulphides 
could meet the copper corrosion tests at loading but then decompose during 
the long voyage to turn the propane off spec for copper corrosion. this 
position would support what clyde & co are saying as a factor against enron's 
case. 

the whole contamination problem, while possibly an inherent vice, was an 
unknown inherent vice. nobody was aware of this problem at the time of 
loadings but rather the problem came to light once some of the first ships 
reached their discharge ports. the sgs report also brings into account other 
reasons for the copper corrosion failure such as:

a) unclean cargo tanks, containing sulfur from previous cargoes,
b) mixing of two grades of lpg, both initially on spec,
c) the use of unclean inert gas, and
d) other incompatible corrosive cargoes (such as ammonia) by improper 
cleaning procedures.

i did take the liberty to call chris clucas of dorchester maritime's 
technical department whom i met when dorchester was managing the enron owned 
ships. it was chris who initially sent me the sgs paper as an update to the 
gastech 1988 paper.

it may be a good thing i did call him as he mentioned a subsequent paper 
issued by sgs in about 1998, by g.vermeiren, where sgs went to saudi to check 
their procedures during the time of these off spec cargo loadings. it appears 
the paper's conclusion is that unknowingly saudi may have put some pacifiers 
into the propane which would have caused the copper corrosion to show as on 
spec. therefore, the product could have actually been off spec before it was 
loaded but, due to the pacifiers, tested as on spec.

in summary, i would agree with clyde & co that this should be settled, 
especially with the amount being discussed. i do not know where this claim 
stands and again apologize for the delayed reply.

regards
