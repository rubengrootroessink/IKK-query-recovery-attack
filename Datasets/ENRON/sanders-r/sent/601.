I haven't talked to my boss about it yet- I need the right moment. I doubt 
that listing is us. By the way, thanks for the t--shirt.

Sanders - Anything ever come of that trading job we  were talking about.? I 
saw a deal from Prescott the other day looking for a  "electrical trading 
atty for an international energy company".? It looked  like the job you were 
talking about so I sort of assumed that our discussion was  a non-starter.? 
Let me know.? Thanks - Gage
