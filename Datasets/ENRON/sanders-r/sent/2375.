Plaintiff has canceled the hearing on its motion for summary judgment, which 
was set for this Friday.  Since I am sure they will re-set it if immediate 
settlement progress is not made, Ecogas has a window of opportunity to work 
out an acceptable deal.  However, I suspeect the window is not a very big one.

Our goal was to buy time.  Whether we bought it or not, we now have it.  I 
will get together with Randy and Jerrel to make sure we use it effectively.
