Sounds great--   but there aren't "provinces" in UK; and didn't she murder
some kid in Massachusetts?

I have a friend here from the UK who came to this county with a British
family as a nanny for their two girls.  She was told this weekend that
due to some financial difficulties they would no longer be able to continue
her employment.  She does not wish to return to England at this time and
is seeking to find another position with a family here ASAP.  The family
she is currently with would recommend her highly.  Her name is Elizabeth
Nugent and she comes from a very good family in northern England. (Her
father is governor of a province there.)   She is university educated in
child care and elementary education.  She is also NVQ (National
Vocational Qualification) Level 3 qualified and has taught in both the
private and public systems there in England.  She is twenty four years
old.  She has excellent references and letters of recommendation.  If you
or someone you know is seeking a well qualified British nanny please
contact me at (713) 221-1361 for more information.  Thank you.
