As we have discussed, for the personal jurisdiction and other Rule 12
motions, we would like to prove a negative and show that none of the Enron
companies has had any contacts or relationships with any of the named
plaintiffs.

There is now posted on the Kansas extranet a Dwight's printout showing the
wells / leases in Kansas for which Quinque Operating Company is the
operator.  You might have someone at Northern examine this list and see if
the well, lease, field, and reservoir names trigger any thoughts about
whether Northern has any connection or relationship with Quinque.  Thanks.

If you have any trouble getting it downloaded from the extranet, I can fax
the list to you.
