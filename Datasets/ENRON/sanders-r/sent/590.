Here it is:

I have some dope on the judge as well.  He was a very small time lawyer out
in La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that  included litigation.
He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judge
in 1998.  None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have a
relationship with him from their days in practice.  Also, he may not keep
the case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to the
case filed against the generators, which has a lower number.  People who
know Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright.

He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is now
retired.  Another has also retired.  The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, who
is of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.

Thanks
Gary
