There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in 
California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon. They did not give us 
releases. The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not 
to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will 
be happy to answer any other questions.

Hi Mary - Do you know where we stand on the release of the orginal lawsuits 
that were filed against ECT Securities and the other underwriters regarding 
NSM?  We put out a Watch Report for Merchant assets and I've sort of referred 
to that issue with a generic comment like  "Negotiations continue regarding 
obtaining releases from the lawsuits that were filed against the original 
underwriting group that included ECT Securities."

If memory serves me correctly, there was one release that was granted - 
either from Farrallon Capital Mgmt, or Oaktree?  Do you know how many others 
are outstanding.

Please let me know at your convenience.

Thnx,
