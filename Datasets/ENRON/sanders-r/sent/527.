The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will 
hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack 
is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I 
predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack 
has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 
million.

Badak is still in dispute.  Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is 
still negotiating with the company on some possible settlement.  We may need 
to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect 
resolution to our negotiations. 

We will keep you posted as it progresses.

Bill

Maybe you should speak to Bill Bradford or Brant Reves.  I'm not sure I have 
the latest news.  I can say that we terminated the positions and invoiced 
Badak after they failed to deliver (this was several months before my move to 
London).

If you'd like we can arrange a call with you, Bill and myself (I'd like 
someone from Houston to be involved).

Rod

Rod - We still have a receivable on our balance sheet for Badak.  Can you 
update us on the status?  Thanks.
