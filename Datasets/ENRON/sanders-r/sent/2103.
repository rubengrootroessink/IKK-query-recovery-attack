I think you sent this to the wrong person---at least I hope so because I have 
no idea what it is.

 Employees bid for bankrupt mill


Friday, 3 September, 8:30 p.m.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. (CP)

FORMER EMPLOYEES of bankrupt Gallaher Thorold Papers said Friday they
have filed a letter of intent to buy the paper mill. Details of the bid
were not immediately available. "We have developed employee ownership as
a viable alternative in several other locations," Cec Makowski,
vice-president of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of
Canada, said in a release.


The union said it has led successful employee ownership bids at Ontario
paper mills in Kapuskasing, Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie.

A letter of intent was sent to the receiver, Ernst and Young, with the
support of the employee group, the management group and the
International Union of Operating Engineers.

The union represented most of the mill's 310 workers, who were laid off
when the Thorold plant shut down May 25.

The mill, which produced a variety of paper products including
envelopes, wallpaper and consumer packaging, has not operated since and
was put into receivership in June. It can make products using 100 per
cent recycled paper.
