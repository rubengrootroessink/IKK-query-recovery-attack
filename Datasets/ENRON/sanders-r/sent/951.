Morris has re-set the hearing for August 22-24.  Final briefs are due August
15.  Up to the parties to negotiate revised discovery deadlines.

I assume witness designations and summaries are still due this Saturday,
meaning Monday.

Please let Brian Redmond (and anyone else who needs to know) know about the
change.  In particular, please advise our witnesses (unless you want me to
call them directly).

Please send me Andy's email address, as I do not have it.

Please keep us posted as to the developments on the business side re
commercial solution.
