Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for
Enron's motion to compel.  As you may recall, they say they want a
deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

Thanks.
