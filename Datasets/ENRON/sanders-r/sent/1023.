		 Subject: Engagement Letter for NSM Cases


I figure that the draft engagement letter between Enron and AGSK got pretty
far down in your piles these last several weeks, so I am taking the liberty of
attaching the current draft to this e-mail.  This matter is sufficiently
significant that we really should have a memorialization of the terms of our
engagement.
