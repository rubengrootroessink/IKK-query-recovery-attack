Richard - 

The following two invoices don't have work orders setup:

1.  Bracewell & Patterson Re:  Berry Group, Ltd. and Berry Contracting, LP v. 
Enron North America Corp.
 Amount:  $6,900.00

2.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges Re:  ENA/Perry Gas
 Amount:  $108.00  (Invoice #1009176B)
                   $352.50  (Invoice #10013082B)

Should these be coded to General Litigation or do you want me to set up new 
work orders?  If so, who should they be allocated to (Team Leader)?

Thanks,
