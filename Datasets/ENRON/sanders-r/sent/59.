I received a telephone call this past Friday from a Mr. Jes Jensen 
(406-238-1900) who is located in Montana and who claimed to be the insurance 
agent for the propane tanker which was struck by Mr. Van Scoyk.  He was 
wanting me to participate in a 9:30am conference call this morning with his 
clients as the claims that they are getting the run around from the rental 
company and he was hoping we could do something as we were Mr. Van Scoyk's 
employer.

I called him back and advised that Mr. Van Scoyk was not our employee, but 
rather an independent contractor who was performing Land Man services.  He 
wanted to know why he had an Enron North America business card, and that the 
number that was on it was to an ENA office in Denver, I believe.  He said 
that he certainly was holding himself out to be our employee.

He said his clients have sustained both property damage, and loss of use for 
not being able to deliver propane; yet, he could not tell me if they have 
mitigated their damages by having the vehicle repaired (I find this strange 
since he is their agent).  I told him he needed to look to Enterprise 
(although Mr. Van Scoyk) did not purchase liability coverage, and after them, 
Mr. Van Scoyk's personal auto carrier.  He said Enterprise had no 
responsibility to handle this matter as he did not purchase any liability 
coverage.  Also, he intimated that the personal auto carrier for Mr. Van 
Scoyk has (or was in the process of) denying the claim since Mr. Van Scoyk 
was using the rental vehicle for "business purposes" (he also advised that 
Mr. Van Scoyk worked this area all the time, had used his personal auto in 
the process, but that it was in the shop that day for repairs).

I advised Mr. Jensen to forward me whatever information he possessed that 
would assist me in this matter, to include a photocopy of the aforementioned 
business card.  Do you know if ENA obtains business cards for independent 
contractors such as Mr. Van Scoyk?  Is there any chance of obtaining the 
actual signed copy of the CONSULTING SERVICES AGREEMENT sent to Mr. Van 
Scoyk, short of going to his family?  Does anyone from ENA validate the 
insurance requirements of the aforementioned AGREEMENT, such as obtaining a 
copy of the pertinent declarations page or the policy itself for review?

Who in the field can I discuss this matter with futher as I am interested in 
further exploring our relationship to Mr. Van Scoyk and would like to speak 
with someone first-hand.  Mr. Jensen was told to call me by a Ken Choice 
(Joyce?) or Jessica Winthrop when he called the number on Mr. Van Scoyk's 
business card.

Your prompt attention to this matter would be appreciated.  I will forward to 
you whatever is faxed to me by Mr. Jensen.

Thanks,

Rob
