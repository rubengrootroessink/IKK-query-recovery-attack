He mentioned some case he had before but I thought he told me he lost that 
case. He never told me that he would be filing anything. In fact, he asked me 
to write a letter outlining Felix's parental attributes because they were 
still looking at what to do.

I just spoke with Koury and he was anything but reasonable.  He has already
filed an application in the Iowa courts for guardianship and conservatorhip
of Alexis, even though the Iowa Code gives parental preference, which is a
difficult preference to overcome.  Also, the Iowa court doesn't have
jurisdiction until Texas says it does.  He said he told you about some case
he took to the Iowa Supreme Court where the Court granted a grandfather
possession and conservatorship over the father who was an out of state
resident.  Do you remember that?
