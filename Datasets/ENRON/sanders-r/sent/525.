This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!"  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

Attached is a list of questions Chairman Hoecker has proposed to parties that 
spoke at the Nov. 1 (I believe FERC means the 9th) meeting.  All but No. 3 
are  directed to Enron and the responses are due on Wednesday the 22nd.
