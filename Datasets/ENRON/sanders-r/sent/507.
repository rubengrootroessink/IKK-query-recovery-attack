Richard,

You reviewed a letter from CMS a couple of weeks ago.  The company's senior 
management called me to ask what we saw that made us turn down the 
transaction.  I told them that I could not get specific because of the 
threatening overtone of their letter.  They suggested that they would be 
happy to send us a letter indemnifying us if it would allow EIP to sit down 
and walk through the issues that killed the deal.

I would like to be able to sit down with them to walk through these issues 
since EIP, as an organization, has been working with the company for almost a 
year.  I think they will sign a broad disclaimer.  Please get back to me as 
soon as possible with you suggestion for language.

Thanks,
Mark
