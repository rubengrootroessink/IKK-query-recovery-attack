As you know, in the past, I have had problems sending attachments to you.

Also, sometimes a simple e-mail message sent without an attachment would
appear to have a phantom attachment, which you could not open or which
contained gibberish.

Our IS Department has been working on some possible solutions.

THIS  IS A TEST MESSAGE BEING SENT WITHOUT ANY ATTACHMENTS.  PLEASE RESPOND
AND LET ME KNOW WHETHER YOU "SEE" ANY ATTACHMENT.  THANKS.
