We argued the issue of additional document production this afternoon.
Morris took it under advisement.

The One Oak issue came up.  Morris said he had not realized it involved an
Enron entity.  He will stay away from it.  I assured him it was no problem.

He also disclosed that he had presented some award to Ken Lay recently at an
industry conference.  Smith assured him that was no problem either.
