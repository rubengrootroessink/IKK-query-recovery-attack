Richard,

With respect to the above, I am still trying to track down the addresses for 
the following firms that have been identified as requiring the audit 
letters.  Could you please confirm the addresses so that the letters can be 
sent out as soon as possible.

  Issue      Outside Counsel  Contact

(2) PCA Bankruptcy Claim     Weil, Gotshal   Melanie Gray

Thanks,
