Richard:  Following up on my voicemail message to you.  As I mentioned, we 
were referred to you by Mark Haedicke in connection with some inquires I have 
regarding the application of the attorney-client or work-product privileges 
to internal operational audits.  In particular, I am interested in Enron's 
standard practice in that regard and any standard or sample documentation 
used to cover the audit reports by one or both of the privileges.  Im also 
curious as to whether the same approach has been used with respect financial 
audits regarding internal controls.  Pls let me know.

Regards,

Bill Krenz
