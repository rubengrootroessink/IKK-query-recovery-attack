Do these two e-mails relate to the same litigation I sent to you?

Jeff,

I attach an affidavit in support of MG's claim against Base Metal Trading Ltd 
to release an escrow order over aluminium cargoes held in the Port of 
Baltimore - this also gives a brief description of the facts.

In short, Base Metal Trading have obtained an attachment order in respect of 
the goods; however, MG is claiming that title to the goods is vested in MG.  
I will send you separately other correspondence, and will keep you posted as 
to progress.

Regards

Justin
