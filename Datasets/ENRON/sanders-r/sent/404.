As you can see, this recent default judgment/adversary proceeding appears to 
belong to EES rather than ECT, so I will work with Mike Smith as to any other 
issues related to this matter.  Thanks.

This bankruptcy is apparently ours per CSC in Dublin.  We never reveived a 
complaint here, and CSC did not receive one.  I am having the A/R pulled to 
see if we have defenses; I will send you that info.  MDS

On Friday, 10/06/00, we received through our service of process procedures, a 
certified mail envelope advising us of a default judgment in the amount of 
approximately $23,000 ($20,825.43 is the principal amount of the alleged 
preference payments, plus interest) against ECT in an adversary proceeding in 
the above-referenced consolidated bankruptcies.  The bankruptcies were filed 
in 1998 in the Western District of New York (Rochester).  We had not received 
any prior pleadings in the bankruptcy or the adversary.  I am trying to 
determine if this relates to ECT/ENA accounts or to EES accounts.  Please 
advise whether EES has/had any accounts with these entities and/or whether 
EES filed a claim in the bankruptcies.  I have spoken with counsel for the 
Plan Administrator who filed the adversary proceeding.  They apparently sent 
service of the adversary to ECT by certified mail addressed to our PO Box 
1188, Houston address.  It never made it up to us.  In any event, I would 
like to determine as quickly as possible whose account it is and whether we 
have any defenses to the preference allegations.  Plan administrator's 
counsel has told me that he will hold off on executing on the judgment for 
10-14 days to hear further from us.  If we can explain why we didn't receive 
service (I think our response is: you didn't serve our registered agent) and 
we can show defenses to the adversary, they will likely voluntarily set aside 
the default.  In any event, we need to determine this as soon as possible in 
case we need to file a motion to set aside the default judgment.  Thanks.
