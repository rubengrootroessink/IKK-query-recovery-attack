Richard -

I understand we'll be meeting next week.  I figured one of the first things 
you'd be asking me for is an accounting on what Enron spent on the power 
plant, so I thought I'd pre-empt you and send it in advance. 

Chris

Chris,

The attached schedule details the $1.3 million of costs incurred on the NSM 
Power Plant Project.  Note that until December 1999 these costs were deferred 
costs on our balance sheet.  In December, however, we wrote these costs off.

Thanks,
Frank

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Frank -

Would it be possible to get a printout of all the expenses incurred on the 
NSM Power Plant AFE?  An itemized list and total would be perfect if that is 
possible.  I need the list because ECT is being sued over their involvement 
and one allegation would be helped if we can prove that we were very 
committed to making the project work (e.g., through spending a lot of time 
and money on the power plant).

I'll need this by Tuesday afternoon if possible to give to the ECT 
attorneys.  Sending it by e-mail would be best so I can add a note and 
forward it on.

Thanks,

Chris
