 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY 
WORK-PRODUCT

 Attached is a recovery/exposure evaluation in this above-referenced case, 
for your review.  Please remember that if ELFI wishes to proceed with 
arbitration, we will need to circulate the usual "conflict check" memo to the 
general counsel first.  I await your instructions.

        B.K.D.
