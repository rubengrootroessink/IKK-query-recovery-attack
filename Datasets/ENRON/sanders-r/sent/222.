Richard-any interest in doing a lunch with me and Jana to see if this product 
would be a good fit for, say, the PACIFIC VIRGO case?  Thanks.

       B.K.D.

Britt,
Thank you for visiting with Wade and I yesterday.  Please find attached the
revised Charter Letter.  The additions we discussed are in paragraph two.
Please feel free to revise the document.

PowerBrief wants Enron to be a Charter member and will do whatever it takes
to make this a successful venture for you and your company.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me.  We appreciate
your consideration and time.

Jana
