Make sure you tell Scwartzenberg. I hear he is kinda a pain in the ass.

		 Subject: Robert Burns

You sent me a note yesterday asking what has happened to the Robert Burns 
matter (the $11 million invoice).  I have talked to Mr. Burns' lawyer and 
told him -- in essence -- that he is crazy and that we don't intend to pay 
his client a dime.  We'll just have to sit back and wait and see if a lawsuit 
is filed.
