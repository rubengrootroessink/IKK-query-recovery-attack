I have called you several times this morning but your phone rolls over to a 
messaging system that won't let me leave a message. That's ok today because I 
need to talk to you live, but it is good to know that I can't get ahold of 
you when I need to. I wonder if Bracewell's Wash. office has the same 
problem?
