Those things are such a waste of time- trying to condense 8 points of error 
and 6 weeks of trial in a 20 minute argument. Bill did a very good job. The 
opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did 
not go over well. Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. 
law. Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument. I 
personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union. The 
remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas 
purchase agreement between Union and the utility district. In short, you 
didn't miss much.
