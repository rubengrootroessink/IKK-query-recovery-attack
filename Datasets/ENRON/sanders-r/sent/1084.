Richard --

Need to include Bob Frank.  I've asked him to get involved with these matters 
given his legal background.  

Thanks,

Jim

need to talk to you about Dunn's hearing in Irvine next week....it will be on 
may 18th...Loretta Lynch will be testifying as will Bob Pease, legal director 
of FERC..because this is an offsite hearing, I don't know if they will be 
taping it..they will have a court reporter...I will attend, but I didn't know 
if you wanted to send an attorney.
