Just a follow up on the voicemail I left this morning.

I hope you will be able to (1) get Kevin McConville to come to Los Angeles
this week to meet fo a long factual meeting, (2) get us a telephonic interview
with Donna Lawry (sp?), and (3) locate the report on Kuhn Sawasdi done by the
Internal Security Department at Enron (probably in 1997 or early 1998).
