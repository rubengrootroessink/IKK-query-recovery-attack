Subject: Resume - Mirari Barriola

In case we have a position open, attached is the resume of a friend of mine, 
Mirari Barriola. She is primarily a finance attorney and is fluent in 
Spanish, German and English. Her husband just began the Enron associate 
program and sent her resume to EI but I thought it would be worthwhile 
passing it around here. 



Please let me know if you are interested to meet her.

Many thanks, 

Shari
