Richard,

I spoke with Leroy Lambert re Transammonia today.  He has not yet received 
the packet of information which you sent up to him, but if he doesn't receive 
it by Monday  he will call me and I will FedEx a copy to him.  Our answer 
date is July 6.  New York requires federal court style answers.  I have a 
meeting scheduled with Kim Godfrey at 11:30 am, Monday, June 28.  Please feel 
free to attend, if you would like.  I plan to e-mail a draft answer to Leroy 
by Wednesday, which he will check to make sure I have followed New York 
procedure & style and will then file before the end of next week.  I'll keep 
you advised of events as they occur.  Thanks.

Bonnie
