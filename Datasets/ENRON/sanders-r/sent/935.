Milberg Weiss is the main plaintiffs' counsel. They are a well known (and 
good) securities class action plaintiffs firm. The John O'Quinn of LA---Tom 
Girardi-- is the plaintiffs' atty in the somewhat related gas cases. These 
are not PI types per se, but more commercial litigation plaintiffs firms.

Richard: What is the makeup of the plaintiffs' bar in all the litigation in 
Calif?  Is it attracting PI types?
