Hi Richard--

I had dinner with Gilles August, the managing partner of the firm, on 
Friday.  I think his firm is exactly what you are looking for.  They have a 
number of partners who had high level partners in the Government.  However, 
they also have a strong litigation group if that does not work out.  As I 
said last week, their firm patterns itself after US firms.  Gilles himself is 
a member of the New York bar.

I asked Gilles to send you information concerning his firm directly.  Gilles 
tells me that he is going to be in Texas on business sometime soon.  He would 
be happy to stop by and visit with your legal team.

Gina--Will you please e-mail Gilles Richard Sanders contact information, 
including his e-mail address, his office address and phone contact 
information.

Can you forward me some information regarding the French firm we discussed
last week?
