Richard-

We are performing the 2000 audits of both HEOF and HEOF II.  I wanted to touch
base with you and get an update in status on any litigation involving either 
of
the partnerships.  I am aware of the Intrust matter as it relates to HEOF.  
Have
there been any developments on that front?  Are there any matters in which 
HEOF
II is involved?

Thank you for your time and assistance.
