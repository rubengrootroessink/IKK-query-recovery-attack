it's tough because for a huge city with lots of lawyers there really aren't 
many business trial lawyers there.  its not like texas or california.

we know david boies well and have done a number of things with him.  he might 
be interested because there is so much at stake and it is so high profile.  
of course, tho, he is stretched way way too thin and doesn't really have that 
much depth in his firm.  we could pitch it to him that we'll provide the back 
up, if you want.

another idea is david foster at willkie farr.  widely regarded in the city as 
one of the best trial lawyers. confidentially, we will be opening a nyc 
office by sept, and are negotiating with foster about his joining us.  i 
could put you in touch with some general counsel who think very highly of 
him.  again, we could provide coordination and back up if you like.  of 
course there would be value in maintaining consistency of positions in new 
york and california, less learning curve, etc.  i am a member of the new york 
bar as are about 8 of our partners.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.
