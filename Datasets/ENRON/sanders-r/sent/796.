Richard Bianchi has proposed August 20 for the arbitration, which he
believes will not last more than a day..  Does that work for you and our
possible witnesses,if any? Short of the offtakers, which Max is concerned
about involving, who would you have in mind--since we are posturing  this
as an msj case?  If the date works, I would suggest that we try to depose
McKenna as soon as possible to see if there is any additional discovery we
really need. Let me hear from you'all and then I'll ask Tom to contact the
other arbitrators about their availability and the preparation of some kind
of scheduling order for discovery, motions, etc. deadlines.
