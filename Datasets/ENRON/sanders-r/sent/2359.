.After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: 
senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to 
be independant. We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands. 
There is no "standard" promotion track. If a senior counsel is successful, a 
promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is 
the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. 
There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC.
