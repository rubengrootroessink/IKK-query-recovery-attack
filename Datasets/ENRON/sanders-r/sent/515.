		 Subject: Back to the playscape


I have shown the two playscapes that I have picked out for everyone to look
at.  I faxed to Richard, mailed to Doug and John, and Steve looked at it at
my house.  Obviously, there are much more fancy ones....and more money.  And
there are cheaper ones....that you can buy at Sam's or other warehouses and
put up yourself......

However, I picked out two that could go with our fort and sandbox out there
and really provide the swinging and climbing part of the playscape.  It was
affordable and they come out and set it up.

I would like to order soon.  They can have it too the Perd in about three
weeks.  So, please tell me what you think.

The simpler one is about 220 per family, and the bigger one is about 280 per
family.

Talk to you soon.
