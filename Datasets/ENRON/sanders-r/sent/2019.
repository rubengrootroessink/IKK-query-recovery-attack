Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill 
Gage today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think 
they are shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had 
talked to you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made 
and that I would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's # 
is 713--225--4500.
