Richard I told David Leboe we (I assume you!) would handle this.  Please let 
me know if you need anything from us.  Thanks.  Dick.

As discussed, I received a call this morning from Bill Redmond (440/893-0338) 
who indicated that he is currently representing John Schultes (former CEO of 
NSM) in connection with certain litigation.  He explained that he was trying 
to coordinate depositions from Enron related to this investment.  

His view of appropriate Enron team members included:  David Leboe, Brian 
Vass, Brian Barth and Kevin McConville.

He mentioned the existence of a certain memorandum regarding a visit to 
Thailand that Vass and myself performed during late 1998 to address 
accounting and reporting concerns.  I did not comment on the existence of the 
memo.

Please find this memo included as an attachment.  Vass and I performed this 
review at the request of the Origination unit (McConville and Barth) and my 
former boss (Drew Lynch).  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards.
