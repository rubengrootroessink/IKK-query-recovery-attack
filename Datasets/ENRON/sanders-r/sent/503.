I sent the final version to Richard two weeks ago.  I missed one week with a 
death in the family.  I will check on it today and respond back.

Thanks, 

Bob.

Attached is a copy of the Pintail Agreement you asked me to prepare.  The 
contract is effective 1/1/2000 for a term of 3 years at a price of 85% Inside 
Ferc HSC with a meter fee of $250 per meter.  Please take note of section 7.6 
of the agreement.  This section terminates the 70% Letter Agreement effective 
1/1/2000 and also states that Pintail is not a party to and has never been a 
party to the 1984 Conoco Agreement.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  If there are no changes to 
this Agreement, it is in a form that is ready to send to Pintail.  It is my 
understanding that you will send this with a release letter to Pintail.

Thanks,

Bob.\
