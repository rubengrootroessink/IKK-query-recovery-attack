I think we are in favor of the idea depending on what we buy. Frankly, the 
kids don't need anything there. What the house really needs are pots and 
pans. What is the suggestion?

I don't know when we are coming---our lives are too hectic right now.

Give me a call when you get a second. I tried to call you today.

but on the Christmas E mail I sent to you...you were the only one that I did
not hear from.  John, Steve, and Doug all thought it was a good idea to
possibly do something for the Perd for the kids.  But I don't want to
continue on that way...if you and Julie were not into that.  So, please tell
me what yall are thinking.  I meant to ask her about it yesterday...but
forgot.

Also, I am trying to do a family homepage for our clan so that the scheduling
of the Perd....would be accessible by Website....so that it is not really
under any one's control.  With Steve moving here....I think that it will work
out better.

By the way, when do yall think you will be going next.  Anytime soon.  We
would love to see yall.
