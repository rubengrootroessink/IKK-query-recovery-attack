Aleck --

I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I
sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes,
almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked
Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard
from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind
Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San
Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I
told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he
offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the
appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just
approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I
still have seen nothing.

My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that
Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems
unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me
directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this
matter.

Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.

Larry



assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would
pay a retainer in advance.
