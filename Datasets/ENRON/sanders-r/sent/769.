Richard, trial is set in the Waste Management/Ecogas/GSF case for one month 
from today.? I have been unable to gather any information from GSF's counsel 
about settlement.? Plaintiff's counsel told me they have sent a demand to GSF 
and are awaiting response.

Please let me know how you would like me to proceed. Do you have any 
information on how the settlement discussion have been going?
