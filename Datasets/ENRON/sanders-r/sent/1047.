 Richard,

 Some time ago, you and I recommended to John Nowland, and he agreed, that we 
didn't have a case against the ship or the supplier of this product ("Elang 
Crude, fit for export"), but that we would try for a quick settlement with 
the cargo underwriter.  Attached is a draft of the proposed letter to the 
cargo underwriters.  David Best, Matt Lee, and I have reviewed and approved 
it and recommend it to you.  The red-lining will of course be cleaned up.  It 
will either be signed by Jim Studdert of our insurance group, or sent by him 
with a transmittal letter signed by him.

 Please let me know whether the letter is acceptable to you.  Thanks.

 Britt

Britt -

I have now identified the e-mail and attachment to which you referred in
your message on Friday.  For some reason it is not on my system but I now
have the hard copy from the file.  The covering message was very brief:

     "I attach an amended draft with the amendments highlighted in black."

I attach the draft hereto and apologise for the delay.

With best regards,
Helen Godel.
