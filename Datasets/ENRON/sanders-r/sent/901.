I know of no reason why we could not deliver this opinion.

In connection with a series of FASB 125 transactions, ENA will be entering 
into several swap transactions.  Also in connection therewith, Mark H. will 
be asked to deliver an opinion that there is no litigation which could impair 
ENA's ability to perform under the swaps.  Do you know of any reason why we 
could not deliver this opinion?  The opinion will be dated sometime on or 
prior to quarter end.
