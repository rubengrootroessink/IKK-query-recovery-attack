If you believe that it is reasonable suggest you approve and pay.

Subject: BAse Metal v. OJSC

I have received the interim bill through September 2000 from Miles & 
Stockbridge in this matter, which is in the total amount of $73,331.38.  Do 
either of you wish to approve and pay, or do you want me to do it?  Let me 
know.  Thanks.

Britt
