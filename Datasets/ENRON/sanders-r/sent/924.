I spoke with Jim Studdert re this matter, and he advised that he believes 
that it may be covered at least in part by our insurance program.  He is 
forwarding it to our insurers for their review.  (I understand that he's 
never gotten a definitive answer re coverage in the other NSM matters, so 
that may end up being the case here.)  I will let you know when I hear 
anything further re a coverage determination.
