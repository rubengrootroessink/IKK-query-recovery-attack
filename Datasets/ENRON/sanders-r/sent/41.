 You will both be getting today, by hand-delivery, copies of the most recent 
bill from Clyde & Co. of 30,436.71 pounds, plus the available back-up for it, 
which includes a number of third-party invoices.  Per my prior e-mails to 
David Best of Clyde & Co., on which you were copied, I find the bill in order 
and ask for your authority to pay it.  If you would like, I would be happy to 
make the payment arrangements; just let me know.

 I will continue to keep you advised.

         B.K.D.
