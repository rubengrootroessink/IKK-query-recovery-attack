Now that Melanie Gray has filed a notice of  appearance on ENA's behalf and 
is receiving copies of notices, pleadings, etc., in the Perry Gas matter, I 
propose that the Litigation Unit no longer process all notices received in 
Perry Gas through our service of process procedures.  Becky Stephens will 
continue to forward copies to me when received, and I will send a copy to you 
of anything that might appear to impact ENA, but, otherwise, we would not 
forward to you copies of notices of appearance and other filings that would 
not appear to directly impact ENA's rights.  Please let me know if this is 
okay with you, and, if it is not, let me know how you would like us to handle 
documents we receive in Perry Gas.  Thanks.
