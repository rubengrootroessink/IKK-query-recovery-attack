As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing 
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's 
firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more 
aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she 
objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to 
withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her 
aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what 
Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, 
she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are 
doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the 
Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help.
