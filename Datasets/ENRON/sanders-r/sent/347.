FERC Chief Asks Congress For Retroactive Rate Authority 
  
09/21/2000

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James 
Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order 
refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. 
Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the 
commission's investigation of power market volatility in California this 
summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last 
year. 
Congress should give FERC "authority to retroactively correct extraordinary 
wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and 
consumers cannot get out of the way," Hoecker told the House Government 
Reform Committee. 
The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&Electric Co., a 
unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market 
situation in California. 
FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained 
"unjust or unreasonable" prices for the power they sold into California 
electricity markets overseen by the state's power exchange and independent 
system operator, Hoecker said. 
But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can't order any refunds beyond the Aug. 
23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation's chief energy 
regulator noted. 
"We do not now have that authority," he said. 
"The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding 
investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be 
prepared to take further measures, as appropriate," Hoecker testified. 
"The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state 
will moderate price volatility in California markets," he said.
