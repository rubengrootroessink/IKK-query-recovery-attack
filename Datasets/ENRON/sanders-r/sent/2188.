Attached is a redline of the letter to Enerstar.  Both Peggy and I have made 
some changes.   When you have a chance let's talk.

1.  I'm not sure the address is correct anymore for Enerstar.

2.  I did not change it in the letter, but I have a question about the 
sentence in the last paragraph where we say that "... , Enron is not seeking 
to recover its considerable expenses from Enerstar Limited".  Do you think 
that we need to say this?
