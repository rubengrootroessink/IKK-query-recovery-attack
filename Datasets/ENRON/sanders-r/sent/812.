Richard,

With regard to the removal of the Pier 23 case, it is unclear whether Enron
Corp. and EES were properly served.

We have the following documents:

* Memorandum from Becky Stephens indicating "Simultaneous service on
Enron Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc."
* A CT System Service of Process transmittal form verifying service on
EPMI on 1/30/2001

However, we do not have CT System Service of Process transmittal forms
verifying service on either Enron Corp or EES.

If these forms exist, please have someone forward them either to me or Jane
Chen.  If not, we need to discuss whether these entities waive any defects
in service and join in the removal.

Peter
