stooping so low as to hurl infantile insults at your youngest and
most freckled sibling?  when i get back stateside i fully intend to
show you the meaning of respect (upside your head), you ol' no
english pea eatin', medley molestin', 80 hours a week workin',
corporate slavin', too big house buyin', Hilton Head Renaissance
Weekend wannabe attendin', power tie wearin', Houston rationalizin',
adult-oriented rock easy listenin', chilluns with mutant voices
sirin' and coke bottle-itis lookin' knucklehead!

the matter of the telephone # is one of some confusion at the moment,
for mama claims she cannot reach me.  for a long while the following
was it:

001 81 06 696 2566

but this year osakatown added an extra number, a 6, making it:

001 81 06 6696 2566

it should be no worry, and inside merry old nippon it has not been.
mama has problems, but they should not be from this side.  joel
reached me two weeks ago.

would like to hear from you, brotherman, but hurry not.  i am going
nowhere anytime soon.  later for you -

rolland

ps - hakeem's decline must be sad to watch.  is it knees?
