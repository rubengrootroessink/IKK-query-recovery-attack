Administrator v. ECT

This is the new matter that we received a notice of default judgment in the 
amount of $23,579.17 against ECT on Friday, 10/06.  I spoke this morning with 
David Reed, an associate with Harter, Secrest & Emery LLP in Rochestor, New 
York, who is counsel for the Plan Administrator.  He said that he will speak 
with the partner in charge of this matter re whether they will voluntarily 
agree to lift default judgment, but he expects that they will so that neither 
side has to go through a hearing.  He will let me know sometime this week.  
This is apparently a bankruptcy preference action.  He said that he will send 
to me today copies of the complaint, as well as any proof of service 
documentation.  I will forward it to you when I get it.  We can then get 
accounting documentation to determine whether we have valid defenses to the 
preference action.  Let me know if you'd like me to handle this, or if you 
want it handled in some other manner.  I don't anticipate that this will 
require a lot of time to evaluate and answer.  Thanks.
