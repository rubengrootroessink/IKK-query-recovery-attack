This is a request for a battery charger for Richard's IBM Thinkpad Laptop.

He will be leaving for vacation tomorrow at 12:00 noon, is it any way 
possible to get this to him by this afternoon?

Please charge to Company # 413 RC# 1929

If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9402.

Thanks
Twanda
