Gary,

The agreements we spoke of yesterday are being fedexed to you today.  After a 
more comprehensive look, it turns out that only the first few agreements had 
the unfortunate wording.  As the form of the agreement evolved with 
subsequent reviews and drafting, the problem disappeared.  At Richard 
Sanders' suggestion we interviewed the trader involved, and he was able to 
confirm that actual practices did not support the negative implications of 
some of the language.  Please call Steve and me with your comments after you 
have had a chance to review these documents.

cgy
