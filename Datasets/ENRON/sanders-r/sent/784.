Robert/Richard - Montauk called yesterday and they've reached a tentative 
settlement w/ WMI at Davis St.  They sent the most current draft but I can't 
open it.  I've sent a message back asking them to resend but thought (at 
least Robert) y'all might be able to open it and provide feedback.  Please 
call/advise asap.  Thanks!
