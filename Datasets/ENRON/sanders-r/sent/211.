Even though I have not seen te bill, I do have a concern that it will prevent 
us from making our 3rd Q earnings. How bad is it?

Dan Fournier phoned this morning to say he is sending you his initial 
account, with a copy to me.  If you or Mark have any concerns please let me 
know.

NOTE:  We have set up a separate RC for Stanley so that all costs are billed 
back to Lavorato.  Your assistant can call Linda Sietzema for details 
(403-974-6708).
