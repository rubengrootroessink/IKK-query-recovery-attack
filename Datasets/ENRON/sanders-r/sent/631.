		 Subject: Schedule 4.11

Item #11 (retained) has changed and needs to be updated on the schedule.  
Pintail has elected not to accept our proposal and has submitted termination 
under the contract.  Their future actions are unknown at this time.

The potential arbitration proceedings with Shanghai needs to be added to the 
list as a retained litigation.  Contact Britt Davis for details.

Item #3 (unretained) probably needs to clarify the current situation.  In 
this proceeding, it is my understanding that HPL has already condemned the 
property and posted the appropriate bond as per the Court order.  The 
landowners were not satisfied with the findings of the Commissioners and have 
filed suit seeking a higher value.

It is unknown at this time whether there will be any litigation that comes 
out of the A/S pipeline rupture incident in Mt Belvieu.
