Gift certificates are not redeemable for cash. Any unused balance will be
placed in the recipient's gift certificate account. If your order exceeds
the amount of your gift certificate, you must pay for the balance with
some other accepted payment method. Gift certificates and unused portions
of gift certificates expire one year from the date of issue or on the
earliest date allowed under law, whichever occurs later. We cannot replace
lost or stolen gift certificates.
