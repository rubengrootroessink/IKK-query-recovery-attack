One of them has already been paid and just needs to be allocated, but I can 
send you a copy of it.  The other one has not been paid yet and I will send 
the original.  thanks.

Richard - I just wanted to verify who should be paying for the last 2 DOJ 
invoices we have received from V&E.  Should I split those costs between you, 
GPG and NB, or does ENA pay the whole invoice??  Thanks for your help!
