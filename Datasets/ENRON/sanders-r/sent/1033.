		 Subject: industrial holdings investment-- arbitration proceeding

the arbitration proceeding filed with respect to this ena investment (which 
andrews and kurth filed for us), has been settled quickly in our favor with 
gail's assistance. this is the matter which we felt would not get actually 
litigated in the context of selection of counsel and wanted to confirm back 
this was the case.
