The interest rate is fine. We do not  agree to "loser pays" attys fees. The 
arbitrator has discretion under AAA rules to award attys fees, so we usually 
leave it open. I would not agree to pay attys fees if someone goes to court 
for some relief outside the arbitration. Please let me know if you have any 
questions
