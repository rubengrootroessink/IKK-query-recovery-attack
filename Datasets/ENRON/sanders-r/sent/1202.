Great!  Now, what have you done for me lately?  The ETS entities are 
apparently still in this case and I'm feeling lonely already now that ENA is 
bugging out.  Where is our deal with Boies to get Quinn in and us out?  
Thanks for the help on this Andy.  DF

I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the 
plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss 
Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an 
affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us 
know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will 
believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the 
close of business tomorrow.  

I will keep you updated.

Andy
