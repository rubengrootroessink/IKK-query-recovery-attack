Richard,
I left you a message about this issue on Tuesday.  I really need your input 
before we make the payments to Lynx.  Could we meet today sometime or talk on 
the phone?

Thanks,

Julie,  I'm working with Legal and Bob Surles with Lynx Energy Company on 
some pricing issues regarding meter 6677.  I have verified with Bob Fischer 
in the Transport Group the transportation rates that HPLC is paying to Gulf 
Coast Pipeline Company, which in turn must be paid to HPLC by Lynx Energy.   
Would you please change Sitara to reflect the transportation rates shown on 
the schedule below?  Also, I've recalculated the average price and need you 
to make those changes too. Thanks.

Sitara Period Transport Rate Price
84425 07/99 $.10 $2.1847776 
84425 08/99 $.10 $2.4957319
84425 09/99 $.10 $2.7938893
84425 10/99 $.10 $2.4148763
84425 11/99 $.10 $2.8992412
