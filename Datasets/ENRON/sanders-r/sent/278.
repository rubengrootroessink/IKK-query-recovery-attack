Richard
 
Further to our discussion on Friday, the contact person to speak to about the 
litigation files yo now have concerning MG is Arthur Taylor. He can be 
contacted on 212 715 5635.

He is prepared to assist in bringing you up to speed with the litigation, 
however you should note that he is not an employee of the part of MG which 
Enron purchased and is assisting on a "grace and favor" basis to enable a 
smooth transition. I suggest that there is likely to be a limited window of 
opportunity in which to get the most from any briefing and you should speak 
to him as soon as possible.

Marcus
