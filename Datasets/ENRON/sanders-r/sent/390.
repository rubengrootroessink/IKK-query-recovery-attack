Let's meet at Cafe Express on the West Loop @ Post Oak at 6:30.

I heard Daniel(?) broke his arm.  I hope that he is okay.

October 8 it is.  I used the message at isbell's house to send you a
message
and erased the body.  We are going just the four of us and the kids.  Where
do you want to meet?  what time?
