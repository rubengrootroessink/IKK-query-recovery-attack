That's  not  true -

  The Resource Report  # 6 - Geological Resources for the
Vector P/L:  CP98-133 ;  filed 12/15/97 i
is on page 211 of that Report.

To whom it may concern:

I am trying to locate Resource Report 6 - Geological Resources for the
Vector Pipleline Environmental Report under docket # CP98-133;
sub-docket 000 filed on 12/15/97.  In the description it says "Vector
Pipeline Cultural Resource Rept 4 through 7.  However, the document only
has the first Resource Report which is number 4.  Could you get back to
me on how to obtain this information.

Thanks
