Richard:  when Carl and I were down in HN a few weeks ago and met with you 
and Mark, Mark had suggested a meeting on May 9th in HN to discuss all of the 
status of all of the litigation matters and to coordinate with the various 
filings being made and anticipated to be made in the bankruptcy court by EPMI 
in the PG&E case and in the PX case (or through the Creditors or Participants 
Committees).  Do you know if that meeting in HN is still on or has that 
meeting in person been "overtaken" by the Thursday afternoon litigation 
update calls?  Thanks  John
