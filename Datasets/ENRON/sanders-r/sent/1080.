 Allen and Indiana counsel talked yesterday. We have a conference call in the 
works for Monday with Kevin, Allen, maybe Wayne and Indiana counsel.  You're 
welcome to attend.

Richard,

Wanted to drop a line to see if you had any word/guidance on the 
termination/dispute language.  Can you call me early next week?
