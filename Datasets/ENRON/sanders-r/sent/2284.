Britt was going to check with all the Enron GC's. I assume he got no response.

Subject: RE: Grynberg Dismissal



I spoke with Becky Noecker re Great Lakes. It is primarily a Canadian
pipeline transporting Canadian gas to the US. It transports a little
Michigan production but not from federal leases and it does not measure that
gas for royalty purposes. Great Lakes raised this informaly with Figa and
his response was to list many things Great Lakes would have to prove in
order for Grynberg to dismiss. Great Lakes then sent a notice letter for
Rule 11 purposes and Figa dismissed rather than allowing the Rule 11 motion
to be filed.  Becky also asked me what we'd found out about whether Boies
new partner has done any Enron work. Any news on that front?
