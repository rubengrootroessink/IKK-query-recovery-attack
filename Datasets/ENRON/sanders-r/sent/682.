John

I am in receipt of your letter concerning Mobil's election not to process its
gas through Bushton for the month of January, 2001.  Below is a copy of the
email received from Mobil concerning their gas election.   We are developing 
an
estimate of the processing costs for ECT.  Will forward under seperate cover.
In the future we will forward the Mobil notification when received.

Thank you for your patience.

Michael Belcher
