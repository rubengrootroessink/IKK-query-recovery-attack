I believe I had sent to you a reply earlier this month to your memo to me 
regarding how to allocate the outstanding inovice to cost centers (e.g., mine 
or Richard's). In my reply, I indicated that I thought that since all of the 
work done by Watson Farley in the attached invoice was in anticipation of an 
arbitration, the bill should be paid from the litigation RC. If you would 
like to discuss, please let me know.

Please confirm that the invoice has been or will be paid soon. Thanks for 
your help.

Regards, Alan

Hi Alan

The legal invoices for Watson Farley and Clyde & Co are still outstanding.   
I would be grateful if you could please advise how we should proceed from 
here.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,

Would appreciate if you could help with the processing of WFW's bill. The 
bill is not small, but not unexpected. I've spent quite a lot of time 
reviewing it with Neale and already expended quite a bit of goodwill between 
us to get the bill reduced. We shouldn't delay payment further.

Thanks for your help.
Matt

I have sat with Neale Gregson to review WFW's bill and confirmed that it does 
not include independent FGH work. Although I have found the bill in order, I 
negotiated for WFW to reduce the bill by S$5,000 based on Enron Singapore's 
goodwill with WFW.

Matt

Subject: Re: Pacific Virgo - Legal Fees

Matt,

This will follow up on my recent e-mail regarding the substantial initial 
bill from WFW.  Given my statement to Richard that I thought a substantial 
portion of that bill related to resolving the FGH issue, Richard has asked me 
to review and apportion that  bill between his R/C and Alan's R/C.  Subject 
to Richard and Alan's thoughts, however, I wonder if it makes more sense to 
ask Neale Gregson to do that for us, given that he was the one that spent the 
time.

I await your response.

Britt

Alan and Matt, I have reviewed David Best's bill and find it in order.  I 
recommend that it be placed in line for payment as well.

I shall be forwarding WFW's bill (which includes PacMarine's bill) to Houston 
(for Joya Davis' attention) for payment of a reduced sum (SGD112,000 for 
WFW's legal fees). A credit note will be issued to us upon payment.

Britt - I don't have any comments on Clyde & Co's bill. If you are OK with 
it, I'll similarly forward thier bill to Joya to process payment. Please let 
me know.

Thanks and regards
Matt

Further to my earlier note, the rest of WFW's bill is for PacMarine's costs 
(SGD18,827.35 reduced from an earlier SGD25,000) which I also think is fair 
and reasonable.

Alan / Britt

I met with Neale Gregson this afternoon to discuss WFW's bill. We went 
through the bill item by item and I am satisfied that it is fair given the 
amount of work actually done. It is nevertheless  a hefty bill, so I did ask 
Neale for some accomodation. He has agreed to reduce the charges from 
SGD120,000 to SGD112,000. I should be xpecting a credit note from WFW. I 
trust this is acceptable to you as well. Please let me know.

Regards
Matt
