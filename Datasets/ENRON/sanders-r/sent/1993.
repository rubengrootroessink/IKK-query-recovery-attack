I am familiar with one active case and one threatened litigation involving 
the companies on the Investment Portfolio list.  Steel Dynamics has been sued 
for securities fraud involving the NSM transaction.  Cgas has been threatened 
with litigation by Jerry Jordan, the former CEO.  Jerry Jordan disagrees with 
Cgas' evaluation of the stock he retained (which is subject to a buyout 
provision).  We think it is worth +/- 500,000.  He thinks it is worth +/- 1.5 
million.
