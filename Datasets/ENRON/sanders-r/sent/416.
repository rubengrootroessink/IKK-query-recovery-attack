Thanks for the resume: however, we are not in the market for a litigation 
paralegal.

Richard,  I work with Norma Villarreal in supporting the recruiting efforts 
for the Legal group.   Attached is a resume of a Legal Assistant that we came 
across while trying to recruit her husband.     Please contact if interested. 

Thanks
Toni Graham
