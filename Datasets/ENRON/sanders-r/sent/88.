Squires is not going to recuse himself. However,he was not the judge who 
heard the prel. hearing. An associate judge--Brent Burg-- heard the prelim. 
hearing

opposing counsel

before I go asking around, it would be helpful to know what judge it is.

squires is wonderful.  judge probably sustained b/c objections were good.
he would be my first choice.

tell me asap who is the judge.

As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing
counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don
Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is
much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary
hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he
has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my
mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty
pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my
lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone
that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres,
and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
Thanks for your help.
