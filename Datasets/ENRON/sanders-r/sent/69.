Richard, I thought I would forward this resume to you.  We are currently full 
up.  Please let me know if you plan to contact this individual - otherwise, 
I'll respone to the headhunter that we have no interest.   Hope all is well.  
Vicki

Vicky,
I am a Managing Partner of a search firm that works with EES, but we have
not previously worked with the legal group.  I spoke to Mike Smith earlier
today about a candidate.  He thought there were probably no needs due to a
recent hiring binge, but suggested that I send this candidate to you to
cover our bases.  Craig is a very bright individual that has a heightened
interest in EES.  If you feel he can add value or solve a particular
business need please correspond through return of this email or reach by
phone at 816-524-4696.

Thank You,
Scott Eckley
