Richard,
 I have been working with Jeff Richter to solve some of the issues
concerning the bid data and questions that have arisen about the outcome
information we have already turned over to the experts.  Based upon a
conversation that I had with Jeff this morning, I believe it makes sense for
me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems.  I
want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it
will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the
information at his fingertips.  I am also scheduled to meet with the
Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading
practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland.  I also plan
to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information
he might have about my understanding of the trading practices.  If you need
more details, please let me know.

 Hope you had a pleasant 3 day weekend.

Thanks
Gary
