It appears that the Intrust appraiser is doing some extra work outside of the 
course of the already established limits.  Please tell me what you would like 
me to do about this.

 Mark,

I received a call from Pryor Counts Inc. regarding a valuation of HEOF.  I
gave them some vague responses, but wanted to confirm that these inquiries
are legitimate and I can fully answer any of their questions.

Thanks
Tom
