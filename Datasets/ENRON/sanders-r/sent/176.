Unless their is a reason having to do with the case( ie we can somehow 
recover our attys fees} I see no reason why we should separate the bills.Send 
me one bill.

Richard: 

Spending a block of time on Busse's deposition this week focuses me on a 
question that we have never really discussed:? How would you like Milbank to? 
allocate its time between the Farallon and Legg-Mason cases?

To date, without really discussing it with you, we have (1) billed the 
Farallon and Legg-Mason cases separately and (2) allocated our time 
specifically relating to each case to that case but allocated "common" time 
entirely to the Farallon case.

Is this what you want? 

Should we just send one bill for the two cases together? 

If we continue separate bills, what should be the allocation principle?? 
Should common time be allocated all to Farallon (the current practice)?? 
divided 50/50 between the two cases?? divided 18/5 between the two cases 
(i.e., allocated by the respective amounts in issue in the two cases) ?

Any thoughts?
