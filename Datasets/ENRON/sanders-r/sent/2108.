The plaintiffs atty--Patricia Whatever has been against me in two cases. She 
sued GroupMac in one case and Enron in another. One day I'm sitting at the 
house on Tosca when the phone rings. Its her. She must have seen my name on a 
list of residents. She starts pumping me for info:Have you seen this dog on 
the loose in the area before. Now mind you when I was younger,slimmer and 
with less kids, I was in the yard all the time. I knew the stray dogs. I told 
her I had never seen their dog loose before and in fact I didn't know they 
had a dog. Needless to say I never heard from her again.
