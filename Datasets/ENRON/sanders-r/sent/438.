All of Thursday morning is good.  How long do you think this should take?  
Lets meet Wed. at 3:00.   I'll hold both of these open until I hear from you.

		 Subject: PCA: Scheduling conference call




I left Twanda several messages last week about trying to schedule a conference
call to start the settlement discussions in the PCA case.  I know that last
message was to her direct voice mail, but the earlier ones may have been to a
wrong number (number dialed:  713-853-9042).  Sorry if they didn't get through
to her.

Nonetheless, the Trustee and counsel are available for a conference call on
Thursday, Oct. 26th in the morning after 10:30 CST and up until 2:00 pm.  Do 
you
have any time on Thursday.  I know it is late notice, but if you do, then I'd
say let's get the ball rolling.

I am available on Wednesday to sit down and review the issues, numbers, etc. 
in
preparation of such a call.  If we go forward on Thursday, let me know what
works for you on Wednesday.  Thanks.

I'm in the office Monday morning, but will be traveling on Monday afternoon 
and
am out on Tuesday in a deposition.  Thanks.
