I can answer almost all things California---but I don't know what I am 
supposed to do(and I don't want to write anything) I'll wait to hear from you.

Dear Suhas,
Attached is a list of things to be done in the G.C. Singh WP, which I have 
listed as "Queries". The information sought on "Pakistan", "Teeside" and 
"California" is only by way of background material and NOT for the purposes 
of setting out in the reply. According to me, those are wholly irrelevant. It 
is just that they have been raised and hence some background knowledge may be 
provided. It would help if there are any blatant false / misleading 
statements by the Petitioner regarding the three supra. The other things 
mentioned are required for me to finalise the Reply.
Please note that my e-mail address has changed to 
atul_rajadhyaksha@atulrajadhyaksha.com.
Kind regards,
Atul Rajadhyaksha
