Stuart -

Fyi.  Talked to Pete a few minutes ago.  We filed a warranty claim with 
Westinghouse.  We will be running all units tomorrow, and we'll have a 
Westinghouse engineer there to work on the problem.  Pete has since called 
all the people below back to explain what we are doing to verify whether 
there is a problem or not.

Well, it continues. We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations 
resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each 
individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to 
listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little 
frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been 
unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings 
visiting their residence.

Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the 
closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I 
was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points 
feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this 
residence.

Mr & Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit 
their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.

Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her 
and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but 
while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations 
occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.

Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of 
trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the 
trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not 
determine if Vibrations were present or not.

Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all 
other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his 
dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his 
residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience 
some noise and vibration.

In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just 
temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we 
can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to 
be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the 
exhaust transition that they need to investigate. 

I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this 
problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying 
to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if 
this is possible.

We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, 
Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.

Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats 
why I want to get everyone out here if possible.

Peter
