Michelle & Richard:
 I wanted to be sure that each of you were aware we have been given written
instructions from Enron accounts payable operations to send all legal bills
to a Houston P.O. Box, and not to any other address.
 In the past we have talked from time to time about each of your preferences
for sending our  legal bills. We will follow the instructions we have
received, but I wanted to be sure that each of you knew about this, and if
you still want copies of the bills sent to you for your information, just
let us know.
 Best regards,

 Bill
