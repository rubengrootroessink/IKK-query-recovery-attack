		 Subject: Calpine depositions and other matters


I wanted to let each of you know that, in accordance with the discussions we
had at our last meeting, I am sending out notices of deposition noticing the
depositions of:
1. Calpine's credit person;
2. Calpine Corp.'s credit person;
3. Steve Snow;
4. Carey Jordan;
5. Darrell Hayslip; and
6. Paul Posoli.

The first deposition is scheduled to begin on July 18,2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the status of the
lawsuit or if Bill Ogden or I can be of further assistance on this matter.

                                            Sincerely,

                                            Laura Gibson
