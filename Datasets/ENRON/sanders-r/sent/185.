I talked to Delainey last week and he said he wanted to have a meeting to 
discuss. This analysis is interesting.

Attached please find the revised summary for Antara.  Please delete the 
previous file you received and replace with this version.

Pricing has the biggest impact on valuation from where we were 6 months ago, 
as depicted in the operations cash flow section for the Gulf Coast.

As discussed, risk factors are estimates and are subjective.

The Proved Undeveloped (PUD) reserves in the Rockies are based on the 
Netherland and Sewell (NSA) 1/1/99 reserve report and do not reflect what 
Enron thought 6 months ago.  Our in-house estimates of the PUD reserves are 
50-75% of NSA and would indicate a current unrisked value for the PUDs of 
perhaps $4-5 million.  However, a potential acquirer may just use the NSA 
numbers and risk adjust as I have done in the spreadsheet.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jim Ledlow
