I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine 
Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston 
Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris 
County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson 
(an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck 
negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as 
a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the 
course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of 
it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.
