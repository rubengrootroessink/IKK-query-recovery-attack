I have not heard the status on these counterparties.  Do you have any updates?

Thanks,

Lisa/Richard/Bonnie,

Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to make 
a determination if we should write off these receivables but would like to 
get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a 
broader issue, do you have any report outlining outstanding bankruptcy 
preceedings or litigation that I may get a copy of on a regular basis so we 
can more effectively manage the credit and workout related issues on the 
trading portfolio?

Please advise.

Bill

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following 
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was 
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the 
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky
