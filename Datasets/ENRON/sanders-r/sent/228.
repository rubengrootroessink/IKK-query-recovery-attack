I am sorry that it took so long to get back to you.  My paralegal, Linda 
Guinn, is the best person to answer these issues. Her ext is 36104. By the 
way, we are not revising our policies.

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)
