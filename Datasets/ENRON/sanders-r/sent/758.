I have been buried with your state's energy crisis and have not had a chance 
to look at it. I would like to go to dinner on the 7th. Do you want to meet 
w/ McConville while you are here ?

Richard - Do you have any comments on the draft engagement letter that I 
faxed to you
last week?

A reminder that Roland and I are currently scheduled to have dinner with Brian
Barth on the evening of 2/7 and to meet with him all day on 2/8.  (there is
some possibility that we may ask Brian to roll this schedule one day, since I
may still be in SF in the deposition of Bill Mellin of Farallon thru 2/7
althought I am hoping to get out of SF at the end of the day on 2/6.)

Do you want to be involved in our meetings with Brian?

Steve
