My first choice is Carrin Patman or Bruce Oakley at Bracewell--Tel. no. 
713-223-2900. My second choices are Ron Welch and Knox Nunnally at Vinson And 
Elkins #713-758-2222. Lastly, Barrett Reasoner at Gibbs and Bruns 
#713-650-8805. Of course if TransCanada is already a defendant, I might 
recommend different counsel depending on which judge they drew. If Duane has 
any questions please have him call me at 713-853-5587.

Richard, a friend of mine at TransCanada Energy is looking to retain 
Houston-based litigation counsel, and was wondering who we could recommend.  
He assures me that the matter does not involve an Enron entity.  Accordingly, 
could you please provide me with a name and contact for litigation counsel 
you would recommend at V&E, Bracewell Patterson, Andrews & Kurth or otherwise?

Many thanks,
Peter
