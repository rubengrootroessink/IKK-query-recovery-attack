Subject: Farallon Suit



Mike Diamond (for PaineWeber) has negotiated an agreement with Mike Swartz
that none of the defendants need respond to the pending discovery at this
time.  We will be having further discussions.  I think some of the
defendants "demurred" today rather than answering.  A demurrer is roughly
the state-court equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

I will keep you advised.
