Richard,

I am told that the supersedeas bond will be FedExed by our surety to our New 
York counsel for delivery tomorrow.  I am hopeful that we will have it filed 
in the court by tomorrow afternoon, and a copy served on Louis Epstein.  When 
I have word that the bond has been filed with the Court, I will let you know.
