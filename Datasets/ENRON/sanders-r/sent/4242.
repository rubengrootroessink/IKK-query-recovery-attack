Subject: Document Retention Policy

The folks at East Coast Power inquired as to what is our document retention 
policy.  I understand it to be 6 months.  Is that still the case?  Is there a 
written statement of the policy that I can send to them?

I told them that the 6 month rule is a general rule, and would, of course, be 
subject to exceptions for any statutory, regulatory or contractual obligation 
to keep certain docuemtns for longer periods.  I also suggested to them that 
all docuemntation necessary to prove up the QF status of the plants should be 
keep for a substantially longer period, at least for the relevant limitations 
periods.  Do you agree?
