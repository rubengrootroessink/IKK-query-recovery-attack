Richard,
I have not received your email attaching the FERC order or the document from
Steve Hall.  In case your having trouble, here's a link my email address:
pmeringolo@brobeck.com <mailto:pmeringolo@brobeck.com>
I am sure that Gary will have access to his email, so feel free to send it
on to both of us.

Peter
