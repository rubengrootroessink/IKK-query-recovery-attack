It looks like I will be joining you and Charna in LA on June 6th. I heard 
from Steve, you or Charna( I think) that the meeting was scheduled for 
one-half day. That may be enough time, but if you are coming all the way from 
Cleveland, we should make good use of this time. I think we should schedule 
an entire day. Let me know your schedule.


I have forwarded Larry Oscar's letter regarding Durrel Metal 
Products/Sterling foundrey to Mike Smith and Bob Williams(713-646-6412) at 
EES.Bob is my counterpart at EES  Let me know if they fail to respond.
