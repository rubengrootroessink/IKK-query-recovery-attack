Linda-

Attached is a schedule detailing the gain/loss calculation for Ice Drilling.  
Apparently PriceWaterhouseCoopers acted as a receiver and sold Ice Drilling 
in August 99.  We received total cash proceeds of $9,583,845.74 between 
August and September, but the value of the asset on the books was 
$9,979,591.85 (loss of $395,746.11).  We also wrote off a receivable of 
$474,557.83.  In summary, we lost a total of $870,303.94 ($395,746.11 + 
$474,557.83).  I am assuming that we are trying to recover the total amount 
lost of $870,303.94.  Let me know if you need further information.
