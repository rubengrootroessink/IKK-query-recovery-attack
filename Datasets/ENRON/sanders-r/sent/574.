Can you call him about this? I wouldn't worry too much about the tone of this 
letter or stepping on his toes. Jim overreacts at times.

I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate 
Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing 
with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because 
we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be 
brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are 
about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various 
Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those 
was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that 
issue.  Someone please advise me or Jim Bouillion what this is about.
