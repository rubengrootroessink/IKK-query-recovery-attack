Set a short deadline for compliance: otherwise looks fine

Steve and Richard:
This looks ok to me if you set a deadline for lifting.  Richard, are you in 
agreement?

FYI,  I need to send something to Helm for not lifting under their contract


Helm US Chemical Corporation
1110 Centennial Avenue
Piscataway,  NJ  08854

Ref: Contract no. NB4680.1
 Deal No. HLC00(TS)0002

Marcus Dahlman

While we have offered you additional time to perform under the said contract 
you still have not responded.  In the event that Helm US Chemical Corp. 
decides not to lift the contracted 1,000 m/tons Styrene Monomer Enron will be 
forced to take legal action for failure to fulfill the obligation set fourth 
by the contract.
