They are pursuing the QF case to the Supremes....are we going to recommend 
that Pnderosa Pine retain either LLGM or VE on this? It is primarily a FERC 
issue and I don't know whether you want to go with VE for the litigation 
expertise or LLGM fror the FERC expertise...I expect that we are going to get 
asked about this by our commercial people fairly quickly

Kirsten,

As I mentioned to you this morning by phone, we are advised that Brazos 
Electric
Power Cooperative filed a cert. petition on Friday with respect to the  Fifth
Circuit decision in the QF case.  We will send the papers to you (or to 
whomever
Enron or Ponderosa designates) when they come in.

I believe that someone in our D.C. office has informed the Solicitor General's
office that we no longer represent the partnership.  However, I don't think it
will not be necessary for us to file a withdrawal as counsel for the 
partnership
since the cert petition starts a new proceeding.

Regards,

Bart
