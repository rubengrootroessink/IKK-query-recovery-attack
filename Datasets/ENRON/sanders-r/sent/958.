		 Subject: Houston Pipe Line Litigation Schedule Update

The terms of the Purchase and Sale agreement require us to update our 
schedules during the transition period before closing to reflect any new 
pending or threatened litigation or governmental actions/proceedings. 
Accordingly, I need to know if you are aware of any such changes in the 
threatened or pending legal proceedings of HPL since the preparation of the 
initial schedule to the PSA. I will be happy to forward you a copy of the 
current schedule if you need that. 

The changes I have already been made aware of are:
Settlement of Shanghai (need confirmation that this is a done deal)
Settlement of disputed RRC taxes
Filing of Ray vs. Armstrong World...(including HPL)

I would appreciate your comments as soon as possible regarding any additional 
changes. If you have any questions you may reach me at ext. 35465. Thanks 
very much for your help!
