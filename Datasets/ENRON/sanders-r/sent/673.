71 to Columbus.  I-10 to Houston.  Loop 610 south(right) for about 5-7 
miles(past the Galleria and Highway 59). exit Bellaire Blvd(second exit after 
you cross over 59). stay on the access road through the Bellaire exit. the 
next light past Bellaire on the access rd is Evergreen---take a right. We are 
on College st, which is the first street after the only stop sign on 
Evergreen. If you get to S. Rice you have gone too far on Evergreen. Turn 
right on College. We are the 3rd house on the left--546 College. Tel #
