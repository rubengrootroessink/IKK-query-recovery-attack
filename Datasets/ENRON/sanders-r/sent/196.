3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

 Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=
f=20
which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
=20
reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=
=20
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=
=20
impact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.
 Litigation.  In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=
s=20
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20
(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20
(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20
subsidiary of Enron.  The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=
=20
under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20
terminated.  Early in 1996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20
matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.  In the first matte=
r,=20
the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20
negligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&Panhandle program,=
=018 a=20
special marketing program established in the early 1980s.  This case was=20
tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =
In=20
the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=
=20
state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=
=20
to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=
ain=20
times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with=
=20
respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20
ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=
ed=20
the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=
=20
claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=
e=20
of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=
nd=20
factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no=
=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=
l=20
Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,=
=20
bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San=
=20
Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan), an Enron subsidiary, operated a=20
propane/air distribution system in the vicinity.  Although San Juan did not=
=20
provide service to the building, the National Transportation Safety Board=
=20
(NTSB) concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin=
g=20
from San Juan=01,s distribution system.  San Juan and Enron strongly disagr=
ee. =20
The NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan=01,s system to=
 the=20
building and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion.  Enron=
,=20
San Juan, and four San Juan affiliates have been named, along with several=
=20
third parties, as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District=20
Court for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico=
. =20
These suits, which seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, busine=
ss=20
interruption and property damage, allege that negligence of Enron, San Juan=
=20
and its affiliates, among others, caused the explosion.  Enron, San Juan an=
d=20
its affiliates are vigorously contesting the claims.  Although no assurance=
s=20
can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=
=20
will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or result=
s=20
of operations.

 Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=
n=20
of Trojan.  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon,=
=20
found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling fr=
om=20
the same court.  The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1=
995=20
general rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of i=
ts=20
remaining investment in Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon=
=20
Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1=
995=20
order.  Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling,=20
which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at=
=20
the Oregon Court of Appeals.  On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the=
=20
State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG=
E=20
to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan=
=20
generating facility.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s authorization of PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.

 PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=
=20
review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=
=20
Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20
undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=
=20
Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=
ll=20
3220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=
d=20
investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects=
=20
of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=
=01,s=20
recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati=
ng=20
facility.

 Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=
=20
Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=
rt=20
of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=
ver a=20
return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=
n=20
accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility=
=20
Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20
proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=
=20
State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=
e=20
new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has=
=20
indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20
elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=
y,=20
due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,=
=20
with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=
ng=20
PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=
o=20
assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=
se=20
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=
r=20
results of operations.

 Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
=20
local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=
re=20
expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20
operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=
=20
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to=
=20
result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses=
=20
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position=
 or=20
results of operations.

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=
=20
potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant=
=20
Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=
=20
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=
A,=20
also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=
=20
ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20
Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=
 and=20
sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=
=20
were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20
predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20
liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these=
=20
allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20
responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20
administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=
=20
subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly=
=20
located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November=
=20
1998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20
Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA=
. =20
Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with thi=
s=20
site.

 Enron=01,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater=20
remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incu=
r=20
material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.
