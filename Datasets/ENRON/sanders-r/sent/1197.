We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner to us both 
flooded.

Steve:  Did Hennigan give you any timetable for getting back to you on 
settlement?  We will need to follow up quickly.

Richard:  Hope you escaped from the storm relatively unscathed.  It sounds 
like Tuesday was a drizzle compared to what Houston experienced yesterday.

See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.
