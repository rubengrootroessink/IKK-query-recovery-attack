Just got this yesterday at 5.  I am passing it on to you and some others.
As you can see, this is just an indication of level of interest, and not a
commitment at this time. The prospectuses should be printed in the next week
or so, and I will forward one to you.  In the mean time, let me know kind of
your level of interest and I will get your name on the list.  Call or email
me with any questions.

Rob


In conjunction with the pending IPO, Encore will be offering a Directed
Share Program, also known as a "Friends and Family Program".  The program
allows specified friends, family, and business connections to participate in
Encore's offering at the time of the IPO.  The program will be facilitated
through Credit Suisse First Boston.

My contacts at Credit Suisse have asked that we assemble a list of those
people that we wish to include in the program as soon as possible.  They
will need names, addresses, and phone numbers of the proposed participants,
as well as the desired number of shares, if known.  A minimum allocation of
100 shares per participant is required.  Please think of who you would like
to include in the program, and send me your initial list by noon tomorrow
(Thursday, January 11).  I realize that this is short notice, but not to
worry; the list can be continually updated and edited as we approach the IPO
date.  Please send all list revisions to me as soon as they are available.
