Do you know if we have sued a company by the name of TDC Corporation in the 
Eastern District of Louisiana on a collar agreement?

Please advise. Thanks.

Alan, sorry I was not clear.  I understand now that Enron has sued TDC in
the Eastern District of Louisiana and we are or will be representing TDC in
that lawsuit.  Again, if that knocks us out of the Orion deal, we are sorry
to lose the opportunity to work with you, but understand.  If you are not
uncomfortable with our representation of TDC in this unrelated matter, TDC
has agreed to waive the conflict.  Marilyn

Marilyn:

Sorry, it has taken me awhile to respond.

Could you clarify that Liskow & Lewis is not representing TDC in a
proceeding against Enron?

Thanks.

Laurie and Alan: confirming my call with Laurie today, our existing client
has waived the potential conflict we mentioned, and I ask your advice as to
whether Enron would also be willing to waive.

The potential conflict is in a totally unrelated matter.  We represent TDC
Corporation.  I understand that there is a dispute between TDC and Enron
relating to a collar agreement.  I am not certain if this is merely in
dispute or if it is the subject of litigation at this point.

If Enron is not interested in our undertaking the representation at the
Orion facility, we certainly understand.  If it is, would it be possible to
obtain a waiver of the unrelated conflict?

Thank you for your patience in this matter.  Marilyn
