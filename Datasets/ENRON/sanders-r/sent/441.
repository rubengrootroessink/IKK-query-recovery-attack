		 Subject: Meeting Regarding Gleason

I know we have discussed a possible meeting regarding the problems at Gleason 
on Monday, October 23.  I will be out of the office on Monday and Tuesday 
with the Florida project development group.  Can we shoot for Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday instead?

Eric
