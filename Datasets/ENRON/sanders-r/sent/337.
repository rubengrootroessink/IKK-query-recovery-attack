		 Subject: Outstanding Invoices with Frontier Economics


Mr. Sanders:

We have received a telephone call from Kevin of Frontier Economics regarding 
outstanding invoices they currently have with respect to Project Stanley.

Kevin indicated that there are three invoices now issued and outstanding (the 
earliest dated back to July) and he is wondering when they might expect 
payment of the invoices.

Can you give me any idea as to when the accounts will be paid?  I believe 
Frontier Economics was looking for payment by direct wire if possible.

Thanks,
Joanne Bennett
