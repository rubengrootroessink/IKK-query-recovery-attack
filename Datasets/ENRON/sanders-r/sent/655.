My feeling is we stand by our confirmation - what do you think?

Mark:

This falls into your area.  I have spoke to William Kelly and advised that I 
am forwarding it to you.

Thanks,

Jeff

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

WK
