CONFIDENTIAL - - ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

To all, other than Richard, please do not forward this e-mail on to others.

Richard -

As a follow-up to your request for information in support of any possible 
legal action at Gleason, I'm forwarding the attached news report.  I have 
copied only the three principle people (Eric, Ben, Mark) involved in 
analyzing the complaints, gathering information in support of your legal 
research, and responding accordingly.

A few comments:

1.  A third party analysis (Southwest Research Institute - - SWRI) showed no 
abnormal noise within the hearing range.
2.  SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration.  
This is well below the hearing range.  There are no vendor, regulatory, or 
otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range.  The fleet of 501 
FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range.
3.  SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection 
system in the combustor.  We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens 
Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve 
the following:
 a.  Is there a problem
 b.  If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause 
of it.
 c.  Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible 
problem (damping material in the stack, etc).
4.  Since we instrumented and tested (by SWRI), we have not had significant 
run time.
5.  Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week 
to hammer out the detailed plan.
6.  The run season is coming to an end, and I expect fewer than 16 total run 
hours before next January.
7.  We are working to resolve whether there is a problem, and if so to 
correct it; however, since this is a new generation machine, any efforts have 
to be coordinated with the OEM (SWPC); therefore, an expeditious 

My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are 
doing, but I want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in any legal 
jeopardy.  Advice? I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have 
significant comments/advice.

script iconBONOBOS
Return to index of stories... 	DEEP IN THE HEART OF AFRICA, ONE OF THE THE 
MOST  INTELLIGENT ANIMALS ON EARTH FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL IN A REMOTE RAIN  
FOREST.
	THE ANIMAL IS THE BONOBO.
	SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR OWN  NAME FOR THIS UNUSUAL PRIMATE."THE PEACEFUL CHIMP."
	LIZ  PURCELL TELLS US WHY THE NAME FITS IN THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES  REPORT.
	BONOBOS ARE UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRIMATE THAT EXISTS ON  EARTH. PHYSICALLY,
	THEY STAND OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR GRACEFUL BUILD  AND ROUNDISH FACE. SOCIALLY
	THEY'RE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY'RE  VERY PEACEFUL.AND VERY
	SEXUAL.PRIMATES.
	"LIKE CHIMPANZEES  BONOBOS ARE OUR CLOSEST LIVING RELATIVE. THEY WERE  ONLY
	DISCOVERED IN THE 1920'S AND IDENTIFIED AS A SEPARATE  SPECIES FROM CHIMPS."
	WHILE CHIMPANZEES ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE  AND THEIR SOCIETY IS DOMINATED BY
	MALES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE OF  BONOBOS.
	"BONOBOS ARE EXTREMELY UNUSUAL BECAUSE FEMALES ARE  THE MOST TIGHTLY BONDED
	IN THE GROUP AND THEY USE THOSE BONDS TO  CO-OPERATE WITH EACH OTHER AND
	THEN DOMINATE MALES AND THIS IS  VERY RARE AMONG MAMMALS."
	BONOBOS REJECT VIOLENCE IN THEIR  COMMUNITY. THEY USE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO
	EASE TENSIONS AND SETTLE  DISPUTES. AMY PARISH MONITORS THE DAILY
	ACTIVITIES OF A GROUP OF  BONOBOS AT THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK. THERE
	ARE FEW IN  CAPTIVITY ANYWHERE--AND THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST GROUPS IN  THE
	U-S.
	"AARON, KILI, COME HERE." 
	ANIMAL  KEEPERS AT THE PARK FIND THAT THE BONOBOS ARE SO QUICK AND  SO
	INTELLIGENT THAT WORKING WITH THEM IS A REAL  CHALLENGE.
	"THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE CREATURES. THEY'RE  CONSTANTLY PLAYING, MOVING,
	FORAGING FOR FOOD."
	BONOBOS  LIVE IN AN AFRICAN RAINFOREST IN THE CONGO BASIN LOCATED IN  THE
	COUNTRY FORMERLY KNOWN AS ZAIRE. THEY'RE ENDANGERED BECAUSE  THEIR FOREST
	IS BEING DESTROYED BY LOGGING COMPANIES. AND THEY'RE  HUNTED FOR FOOD. 
	FEWER THAN 20-THOUSAND OF THESE ANIMALS ARE  ALIVE IN AFRICA TODAY. THE
	BONOBOS, THEIR UNIQUE SOCIAL SYSTEM  AND THEIR HABITAT ARE UNDER ATTACK IN
	THE  WILD.
	

script iconGIRL  SCOUTS
Return to  index of stories... 	A TIME OF YEAR AMERICANS WAIT FOR, AND THEIR 
TASTE  BUDS YEARN FOR, COULD CEASE TO EXIST.
	THE GIRL SCOUTS ARE TRYING  TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT A SHORTAGE OF TROOP 
LEADERS.
	AS A  RESULT, THOUSANDS OF GIRLS WHO WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH SCOUTING  ARE 
BEING TURNED AWAY.
	TRADITIONALLY, THE LEADERS HAVE BEEN MOMS  AND GRANDMAS.

	THE  KNOWLEDGE MOSTLY CAME FROM BOOKS.
	WELL, TODAY, KATHERINE STEELE  INTRODUCES US TO A WOMAN WHO BRINGS HISTORY 
ALIVE TO SCHOOL  CHILDREN.
	MOST DAYS VICKIE DANIEL LOOKS LIKE THIS. A SINGER WHO  ENJOYS THE STAGE. BUT 
SEVERAL DAYS A MONTH SHE  TRANSFORMS.
	"PHILANTHROPIST, SOCIAL ACTIVIST, BUSINESSWOMAN,  MOTHER."
	INTO MADAM C.J. WALKER.
	THE FIRST SELF-MADE  BLACK FEMALE MILLIONAIRE. SHE INVENTED WALKER HAIR CARE 
PRODUCTS IN  THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS. BY 1918, 20-THOUSAND WOMEN WERE 
SELLING  THEM AND THE COMPANY WAS EARNING NEARLY 300 THOUSAND  DOLLARS.
	"MADAM C.J. WALKER LEFT A RICH  LEGACY."
	SEVERAL DAYS A MONTH, MADAM WALKER VISITS TEACHERS  TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE 
LESSON.
	"THEY TORE THAT BUILDING  DOWN."
	THEN SHE INTRODUCES HERSELF TO KIDS.
	"ACROSS  THE STREET MY NEIGHBORS ARE THE ROCKEFELLERS."
	SHE WORKS  WITH A PROGRAM BRINGING HISTORY ALIVE.
	"I THINK IT'S A  WONDERFUL WAY TO TEACH HISTORY AND TO SHOW THE POWER OF  
HISTORY."
	THE PROGRAM INCLUDES MARY TODD LINCOLN,  FORTHY-NINERS FROM THE GOLD RUSH 
DAYS AND EIGHT OTHER HISTORICAL  CHARACTERS.
	"I THINK THEY REALLY ENJOYED AND WILL ALWAYS  REMEMBER WHAT THEY LEARNED."
	"SHE HAD A DREAM ABOUT HER  HAIR CARE PRODUCTS AND SO SHE MADE IT."
	THEY EVEN LEARNED A  LITTLE MORE THAN HISTORY.
	"I LEARNED THAT IF YOU HAVE A LOT  OF CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF YOU CAN 
ACCOMPLISH  SOMETHING."
	OTHER WAYS TO SHARE HISTORY WITH YOUR KIDS IS TO  TELL THEM YOUR FAMILY 
STORIES, TAKE THEM TO HISTORICAL SITES IN YOUR  OWN TOWN. IN THE END, YOU;LL 
PROBABLY LEARN SOMETHING TOO. KATHERINE  STEELE, 7-EYEWITNESS NEWS.

CAN'T  AFFORD TO MISS.
	THE TEST IS HERE.
	THE FIBER OPTIC CERVICAL  PROBE IS NOW BEING TESTED BY DOCTORS IN HOUSTON, 
TEXAS.
	AND,  ALREADY THEY BELIEVE IT'S FAR MORE ACCURATE AND DEFINITELY FASTER AT  
DETECTING CERVICAL CANCER THAN THE PAP SMEAR.
	CHRISTI MYERS  REPORTS ON WHAT THIS MEANS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY.
	PAULA  ROBERTS IS ONE OF 400 STUDY PATIENTS WHO WILL BE TESTING A  NEW
	FIBER OPTIC PROBE.AND COMPARING IT TO THE PAP  SMEAR.
	"THIS IS THE PROBE THAT WE'RE GONNA USE TO TAKE THE  MEASUREMENTS."
	THE CERVICAL PROBE WHICH IS BEING TESTED AT  M.D. ANDERSON CANCER CENTER MAY 
SOMEDAY REPLACE THE PAP SMEAR AS A  FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE WAY TO DETECT 
CERVICAL CANCER. INSTEAD OF  WAITING FOR RESULTS. WOMEN LEARN IF THEY HAVE 
CANCER OR PRECANCEROUS  CHANGES IMMEDIATELY.
	"WITH THE PROBE THEY CAN TELL  IMMEDIATELY IF THERE'S A PROBLEM AND TAKE A 
BIOPSY OR WHATEVER THEY  NEED RIGHT THEN."
	THE PROBE IS PLACED PAINLESSLY AGAINST THE  CERVIX.SHINING LIGHT ONTO
	THE TISSUE. CANCER CELLS AND PRE  CANCEROUS CELLS ABSORB LIGHT
	DIFFERENTLY
	"WHAT HAPPENS IS  AS CELLS GET MORE DYSPLASTIC AND MOVE TOWARD CANCER, THE 
NUCLEI  ACTUALLY GET CRINKLED SO THEY REFLECT LIGHT IN A MORE SCATTERED  WAY."
	THE PROBE'S INFORMATION IS FED INTO A COMPUTER WHICH  INTEPRETS THE TEST IN 
MINUTES. AND PATIENTS DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WAIT  FOR A DOCTOR TO READ THE 
RESULTS. PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS AND AIDES  HAVE USED THE DEVICE SUCCESSFULLY
