Richard,

Below is the resume of a friend of George Hope, a member of the Online Team.  
As head of legal recruiting, if it meets the needs of any particular group, 
please pass it on.

Shari,
 I hope that you had a good holiday. This resume is a very good friend of 
mine who wants to get on here at Enron and I wanted
to forward her resume on to you. I was hoping you could take a look and let 
me know if you have any needs in your group or if you could
recommend that I send it to any other groups. I have spoken to Tana Jones who 
said that she has no needs at this time, thank you for your
time.
 George Hope
