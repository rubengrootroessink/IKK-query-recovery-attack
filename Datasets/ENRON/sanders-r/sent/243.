Richard:

Enclosed is a draft of the Affidavit that I believe conforms to what we
discussed with Brian this morning.  Please let me know if there is anything
that is not correct.  If it is fine, please have Brian sign it and have his
signature notarized.  I will then send a messenger to pick up the final,
signed affidavit.

Thanks,

Kathy Patrick
