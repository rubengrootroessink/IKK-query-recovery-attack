Just to notify you that we have a dispute with the above company regarding 
purchase from Globoil of gas condensate. The issue in dispute is a point of 
construction of the agreement. The amount in dispute is around USD500,000. 
Michael has agreed that we use Linklaters as the litigation lawyers; Globoil 
is using Herbert Smith. tks
