David,

Where are we?  I am out on vacation all next week, and haven't sent the 
below-referenced bills to Richard yet, as I do not want to bother Richard 
with approving them piece-meal.  I trust that you will shortly be receiving 
payment from underwriters and do not want to I delay getting you authority 
for netting out what Enron agrees it owes.  I greatly appreciate your 
immediate help.

1.  Please press whoever owes us their outstanding bills to get them to us as 
soon as possible.

2.  With regard to the Minton's bills, can you get me an itemized breakdown?

3.  With regard to the barrister's fees, can we get something that will allow 
us to determine how much time/what billing rate applies to each of these 
entries?  I am mindful and appreciative that he apparently hasn't billed us 
in four years.

4.  With regard to the arbitrator's fees and expenses, is any more detail 
available (total time spent/rate)?

Many thanks for your immediate help.

Britt
