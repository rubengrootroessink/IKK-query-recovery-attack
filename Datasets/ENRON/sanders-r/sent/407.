I just spoke with Mike Day.  He received a call back from Harvey Morris at
the CPUC.  They have not yet had a chance to read our response and cannot
convene the group that needs to look at it until tomorrow.  (Mike reads that
as they are giving it to a consultant for comment.)  We have a scheduled
conference call with Harvey for 10:00 a.m. PDST on Friday.  I will call in
from Mexico.  Peter will set up an 800 number and call in ID.  Once Mike,
Peter and I are on the phone, we will conference in Harvey.

With respect to the production of documents, I told Mike that the documents
were being shipped here and we would process them on Friday.  We will
address delivery on the 10:00 conference call.

As an aside, Harvey apparently said that a number of other companies had
decided to cooperate after being threatened by the CPUC staff.

If you need to reach me in Cancun, the Brobeck satellite office number there
is 011-52-98-810962.

Thanks
Gary
