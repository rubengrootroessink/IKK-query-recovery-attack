Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
place.

Here is yet another request for e-mail from a long time ago.  Apparently EI 
has these old tapes somewhere (at least Roberto and the users think they 
do).  Any word from Richard Sanders?
