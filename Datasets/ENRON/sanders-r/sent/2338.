I  will be happy to do it this way. By the way, if you are sending a copy to 
Bill McCartney at V&E, you should know that I am also sending him a copy.

Richard, in the future, could you please have your Assistant forward the 
reports to me.  Previously, Mr. Derrick did not have e-mail and his mail was 
diverted to me automatically by the system.  Now, it does go to him and I 
have to go in and send it back to me.  Mr. Derrick reads the reports after I 
take care of the administration of them which involves copying, filing and 
forwarding on to Vinson & Elkins.  This is the procedure he has set for me.  

I don't mean to complicate your life further, but would really appreciate it 
if you could do this.  

Thanks so much,

Steph.
