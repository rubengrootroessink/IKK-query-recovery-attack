Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To: Grynberg Coordinating Counsel Committee
      Quinque Coordinating Counsel Committee
       Tom Nicholas and Steve Williams for Wright Case
       (others who received earlier message)
From: Don Schultz
Re: Joint Defense Meeting - progress notes.

We received several votes in favor of Charles Tetrault's suggestion to
meet the week after the Feb. 22 hearing, rather than on Feb. 23-24, and
that makes sense to us as well.  Tom Nicholas advises that the Wright
group would like the meeting to be held February 27-28 in Houston,
rather than Denver.   Jay Barrymore would prefer the meeting be held
March 5-6 in Denver.  Clay Latimer is available February 27-28 and would
prefer the meeting be held in Denver.  I was unable to reach Clay this
afternoon to determine if March 5-6 would work for him.  We have
confirmed availability among hotels in downtown Denver to host for
either date window.  Some of the Wright folks are reportedly checking on
availability of Houston hotels for February 27-28.  The Kansas Steering
Committee is meeting by phone tomorrow morning, and we will need to come
to a final decision in the next day or two on which to base meeting
plans.  Wright lead defense counsel are concentrated in Houston, and so
it might make sense for the Wright group to meet independently and in a
different location; however, there are a number of counsel who will need
to attend both meetings, so the meetings probably should not be at the
same time in different cities.  Thus far, we have not announced plans to
any of the JDT groups at large.
