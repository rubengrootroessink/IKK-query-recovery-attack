		 Subject: Tom Hall Lawsuit

I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank 
me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we 
agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, 
Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will 
also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with 
his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare 
the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.
