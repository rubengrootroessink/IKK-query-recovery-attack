Shonnie, it was nice meeting you at the Law Conference last week.  As I 
mentioned to you then, I have been in the Legal Department of EES on a 
contract basis since last August.  I report to Jim Keller.  My assignment 
here is winding up and I am looking for my next assignment.  

I have spent the bulk of my time at EES negotiating gas and power commodity 
transactions.  Before I joined EES I developed model agreements for EI.

I have taken the liberty of attaching my resume here for your consideration, 
or for circulation among your colleagues.  I would appreciate an opportunity 
to talk with you further.  Please feel free to talk to Jim.

Thanks,
Melinda Winn
