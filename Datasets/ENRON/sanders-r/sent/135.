Richard:
 I have spoken again today with Tom Deen, the lawyer for Natole Turbine.
 Deen still wants to mediate the case, but after talking with his client he
wants to depose Anderson, Leather, Virgo and Miller first. He says the
depositions of Virgo and Miller will be short (1/2 day each) and he wants to
try and schedule the depositions for the week of July 10. I am available
July 11, 12, 13 or 14 that week. By copy of this email, I am asking that
Miller and Virgo each advise me as to their availability then, or if
unavailable, the nearest alternate dates possible for each of them.
 I remind everyone that this case has a trial setting on September 4.
If we cannot complete this initial discovery and set a mediation promptly,
we will have the Hobson's choice either to delay the case further, or try it
with relatively little preparation time.
 I ask that Messrs. Miller and Virgo let me know about their schedules,
either by reply email, or call me at 713-844-3001.
 Thank you for your time and assistance.

 Best regards,
 Bill Ogden
