I have attached an e-mail from Steve Howard, our atty in the NSM litigation. 
Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.  Let me know if you are interested.

Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person
concerning a possible investment by Enron in some reorganized form of the
project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
so, who?

We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
first.

Steve
