		 Subject: Data Room requests

As the data room visits wind down, we have had several requests both 
internally and externally to provide greater detail on a variety of issues.  
IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ANY ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, EITHER IN WRITTEN, 
ORAL, OR SPREADSHEET ANALYSIS, GOES TO ME BEFORE IT GOES OUT TO THE 
COUNTERPARTY.  IN ADDITION, ALL CONTACT MUST BE THROUGH LEHMAN BROTHERS. This 
will ensure that we get the counterparty accurate information in a timely 
fashion.  Please call me if you have any questions (3-6396).

Thanks
Patrick
