I am sending you a copy of the subpoena "served" on Glanville. I have just 
left him a voicemail to confirm, but the last time I talked to him he told me 
this subpoena had been sent to Reliant's legal dept. You will notice that it 
is only signed by Dickstein Shapiro, not a Texas court reporter. I doubt it 
is effective. Feel free to call Glanville if you like. His no. is on the 
document.
Gary Grote called yesterday to tell me that Kevin was "served" last Sat the 
3rd. I have asked Gary to send me a copy and Linda Guinn will be following up 
with him. Linda's no. is 713-853-6104. Gary Grote's no. is 713-650-3131. Of 
course you can always call Kevin.
I am on spring Break but am checking messages. My cell no. is 713-410-6128.

Have you found out whether either Glanville or McConville has been properly,
or even improperly, served with a subpoena for their depositions in 
Texas?
