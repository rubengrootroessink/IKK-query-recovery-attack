Britt-- I can't find them. Either Wayne Gresham or Gail Brownfeld has them.

Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in 
November to the "ENA Legal Department" that he suspected had been laying 
around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with 
Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They 
threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned 
this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have 
slipped his mind.  Can you help me?
Thanks.

Britt
