** PRIVATE **

Richard:   I've put on the fax to you a copy of 2 of our invoices for legal 
services on the Brazos FERC/Cert. matter--one from Sept. and one from 
November--that are still outstanding.  I thought in particular that the Sept. 
invoice may have been lost in the system since an invoice for the following 
month has been paid.   Also, I know that the Sept invoice had originally been 
sent to Dan Lyons since we also were doing related work on the Brazos project 
and Dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall, but my 
understanding from Dan was that he was going to send the litigation related 
invoice to your attention for your review and approval.  As you will recall 
from your Bracewell days, this is the time of the year that the internal law 
firm billing people hound the partners to follow up on outstanding bills.  Of 
course, if you have any questions on the invoice or need any further 
information, please do not hesitate to call me.  Thanks , Richard.  I hope 
that you are doing well and bearing up ok in the face of the day to day 
turmoil in CA.

John
