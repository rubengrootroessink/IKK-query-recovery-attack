Bob, Nicole and Jean,

WELCOME BACK !!!

Following received from Orwell............. (Plse see attached below)
...............

Now we have to act quickly, but all moving in the same direction.

If we assume the entire cargo will be attached once the discharge operation=
=20
has
finished, then we should all realise that this represents $5,000,000.00 of =
our
money tied up on the quay, not to mention the inability to deliver against =
our
existing commitments.

We have couriered about 60 pages of further documents we received from=20
Aluminium
of Siberia proving the chain of ownership from the smelter to Aluminium of
Siberia and with copies of the RWB showing the metal was all despatched wit=
hin
April from the smelter.

Have we placed Base metal on notice that now they have attached the metal w=
e
reserve the right to counter sue for all costs and expenses WE may suffer a=
s a
result of their attaching metal to which we have clear title ???

Talk to the court in Maryland and establish what additional documentation t=
hey
actually require for us to prove beyond doubt that the metal is ours.

Speak to our lawyer and ask 'What should we do next ???'

For the avoidance of doubt no correspondence should be sent
to any of the counterparties unless it has been approved by the
lawyers.Martin Stanley is coordinating our response and should
be appraised of all correspndence,either verbal or written.

Marc Rich/Novarco are some way further down the track in their
similar problem and expect to have their case heard over the next
few days in New jersey.We should keep appraised of their progress.

As regards our stance I think that we should now take steps to hold
the plaintiff responsible for any costs incurred due to the attatchment
and we should ask the court to require the m to post a bond against
such costs.

Any comments welcome

LIEN IN USA

 MARTIN SORRY ABOUT DELAY REPLYING RE LIEN QUESTION

 WE WERE TRYING TO GET HOLD OF LONDON SHIPPING LAWYER FREIND WHO
GIVES AS FREE TELCON ADVICE

ANYWAY COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF COURT

 SO MY OPINION IS THAT US LAW NOT VERY DIFF FROM UK LAW IN RESPECT OF
THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVE WHERE OWNERSHIP LIES.

 ITS VERY EASY TO GET A US JUDGE WHO DOES NOT KNOW SHIPPING TO ISSUE
A LIEN ON THE CARGO AS THEY DO NOT PROPERLY CHECK THE 'REAL'

Spoke with Sandra Torres this morning.  She advised me we've had no further
correspondence from the Base Metals attorney, Ely Goldin, and a copy of an
e-mail from you indicates that the material is definitely being seized.  I
told her to speak with our attorney, Art Taylor, to determine what steps he
wants to take next.

I'll be reachable most of the day if you need me.  My home phone numbers ar=
e
516-489-3116 or 516-489-9291.  An overseas call to my private cell phone
would be prohibitively expensive, but Sandy Torres has it if I need to be
reached.

I'd appreciate copies of any e-mails on this subject to this e-mail address=
,
bobbyk0829@aol.com, so I can keep on top of this.  I've also told Sandy to
check with Rukert Terminal to determine when discharge is complete and to
advise you accordingly.

LIEN IN USA

 MARTIN SORRY ABOUT DELAY REPLYING RE LIEN QUESTION

 WE WERE TRYING TO GET HOLD OF LONDON SHIPPING LAWYER FREIND WHO
GIVES AS FREE TELCON ADVICE

ANYWAY COULDN'T GET HIM OUT OF COURT

 SO MY OPINION IS THAT US LAW NOT VERY DIFF FROM UK LAW IN RESPECT OF
THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVE WHERE OWNERSHIP LIES.

 ITS VERY EASY TO GET A US JUDGE WHO DOES NOT KNOW SHIPPING TO ISSUE
A LIEN ON THE CARGO AS THEY DO NOT PROPERLY CHECK THE 'REAL'
OWNERSHIP.

 IN THE END DESPITE THE FACT THE THE COURT HAS ALLOWED THE LIEN YOU
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE CARGO RELEASED PROVIDING YOU CAN PROVE THAT
YOU OWN THE PROPERTY AND NOVOKUZNETSK NO LONGER DOES.

Subject:  M/V Salvador




It's 10:30 PM here and I haven't seen any correspondence relating to the
"Salvador" from anybody.

Martin, I managed to finally get hold of Ely Goldin at about 5 PM.  He said
he was going to e-mail me a copy of a fax he was sending but I never saw it=
.
I told him in no uncertain terms that he was indeed "jamming us up" and tha=
t
if our material wasn't released to us, we'd have to cover our nearby
commitments from other sources at huge cost and would hold Base Metals
responsible.  He said he needed to establish some link between Aluminium of
Siberia and the Russian smelter and he wondered why the shipper on the bill=
s
of lading was Unimetal (or Uni something - I don't quite remember the name)
and what was their relationship to Alum. of Siberia.  I told him we bought =
it
in good faith and there may have been any number of companies in the chain
who were really of no concern to us.  At that point, Art Taylor was calling
him on the other line.  I decided that call was more important so we ended
the conversation.

I trust you have since received an e-mailed update from Sandy as to the
contents of their phone call with Goldin (which someone please e-mail to me=
).

I'll be out of the house all day tomorrow but will have my cell phone with
me, although I expect to be out of range most of the time.  I'll call the
office late morning/early afternoon to get an update.  Sandy, since Art is =
on
vacation, did he suggest that Greg Clausson might be of assistance?  He mig=
ht
be more readily available to file any necessary legal papers, unless he's
also on vacation.

We intend to challenge this condition immediately - hopefully Tuesday /
Wednesday (11th / 12th July).

Judge Garbis appears to be on our side, but since this was a 'Friday=20

judgement he has allowed Base Metals a little more time to try and prove we=

The Judge told their lawyers that he could see NO indication of any such

 Sorry I was unable to catch up with you on Monday; I tried your office and
"cell" phone, but called too late in the day.
 I think we should keep pushing here. I'm inclined to send Ely and company =
a
letter suggesting that they now have enough documentation to show them that
MG does, indeed, own the metal and that they should voluntarily release the
escrow arrangement. I would combine that with a representation that both MG
Corp and MG Ltd are quite solvent and more than able to cover a $5MM loss i=

the extremely unlikely event that Base Metals could ever prove to a court
that MG owed that amount to them. I would couple this with a request that w=

respective positions. If we can not achieve a result satisfactory to us,
then I feel we should go back to the court, probably no earlier than Monday
so as not to make it look to Judge Garbis that we are being excessively
aggressive.
 Our easiest argument to the court at this early stage is probably one base=
d
on our solvency, i.e., "Judge there is no need for you to escrow MG's money=
,
because MG is by no means a credit risk by any definition."
 The only other document relating to the metal that I would like to have is
evidence that Aluminum of Siberia did pay Unimetal for the metal in
question. Could you lay hands on that?
 I will attempt to send you a draft of the proposed letter to the Bad Guys
later this evening in the hope that we can discuss on Tuesday.

Mark,

Thanks your e-mail and proposed 'draft letter' to Egorov,Pirginsky and
Afanasiev.

We are in agreement to all your suggestions, but would ask your views on th=
e
following:

1) Do you think it would be advisable to return to the court say on this
Thursday, 13th July, and ask Judge Garbis what he considers 'reasonable tim=

for the Plaintiff to react ???

2) We are all determined to keep the pressure on Base and must ensure we ke=
ep
them on the back foot - whilst we agree with the content of your draft we f=
eel
it could be harder hitting - lets discuss.

3) In regard to proof of payment by ALS to Unimetal we have the following
situation - ALS can show they made a number of large payments to Unimetal a=
nd
can supply a spreadsheet showing details of their account with Unimetal. It=
=20
may
be harder to show specific payments against specific invoices, but I am=20
pushing
ALS for such evidence.

4) In your draft letter plse note MG Metal is part of MG plc, a publically
traded company with a market cap of $450.00 million.

Lets discuss on your opening

 Dear Arthur and Martin:
 I received late this evening a rather outrageous letter from Ely Goldin in
which he takes the position that our documents "raise more questions than
they answer." He also indicates that he sees no purpose in having a
conference call unless it is to discuss our responses to his discovery
requests served upon us earlier today, which, incidentally, are completely
void and of no effect under the US Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in my
considered judgement.
 I will separately attempt to email to you Goldin's letter, but, in the
event technology fails me, will also fax it to you first thing Friday
morning.
 I believe we should go forward with the conference call among ourselves to
agree upon the next actions on our part. As we suspected, the Base Metal
people are plainly going to be anything but reasonable and, unfortunately,
we will almost certainly be forced to seek our relief from the Court, rathe=
r
than through business like discussions with them.
 I believe you already have dial in instructions for the 10:30 am EDT
conference call. If not, let me know and I'll get them to you.
 I look forward to speaking to you in the am.

Arthur and Martin:
     We've taken a quick look at the papers in the South Carolina case.
It turns out that Base Metal dismissed in that case because they had seized
the wrong metal. As they told the Court: "Upon seizure of the cargo by the
Marshal's service, inspection of the seized cargo and associated transfer
documents, Plaintiff is satisfied that the cargo seized was fabricated at
the Krasnoyarsk Plant, which is not Defendant's plant".

Dear Arthur and Martin:
 Scott Haiber who, as you know, has done virtually all of the brief writing
in this matter, was called about an hour ago and told that, very
unfortunately, his mother fell down the steps while visiting her sister in
London and fractured her neck. Scott and his father are leaving for London
this evening to be with her. We will, obviously, continue to work from this
end on our Court filing, but I wanted to let you know our situation here in
that Scott's absence will slow us down a bit.

Dear Arthur and Martin:
 Scott Haiber who, as you know, has done virtually all of the brief writing
in this matter, was called about an hour ago and told that, very
unfortunately, his mother fell down the steps while visiting her sister in
London and fractured her neck. Scott and his father are leaving for London
this evening to be with her. We will, obviously, continue to work from this
end on our Court filing, but I wanted to let you know our situation here in
that Scott's absence will slow us down a bit.

Mark
