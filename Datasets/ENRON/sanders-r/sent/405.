I have asked my paralegal, Linda Guinn, to get you this information.

		 Subject: Legal Circularizations

As a follow up to our meeting that was held on 9/25 regarding year end legal 
circularization, I would like to obtain a list of the outside legal firms 
utilized and the associated legal matter.  Please forward this information to 
me or Jennifer Stevenson at your earliest convenience.  We will be providing 
this to our corp team as they prepare for their required year-end procedures.

Thank you for your help.  Please give either myself (3-6109) or Jennifer 
(3-4793) a call with questions.
