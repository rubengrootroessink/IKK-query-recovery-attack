I am the logical person to speak with B of A. I need to speak to Joel or Lisa 
to put  B of A's request in perspective.

joel:
i think that if b of a wants info about the lawsuit (just filed) that best to 
talk to richard sanders only, not leboeuf. he is handling primarily and will 
be careful about what to say. richard what do you think? this is connection 
with  b of a doing due diligence on increasing their sub debt line to east 
coast power.

I doubt that I am the correct person to explain the Infineum 
matter--actually, I know that I am not. Should one of our litigators be 
involved in this discussion?

When Bill gets back to his office (around 3:30 ECT) we will give you a call
to discuss.  If possible, it would also be helpful to get an update on
progress made on understanding the claim filed by Infineum and possible
meeting times later next week to discuss the case with LeBouf, Lamb.
