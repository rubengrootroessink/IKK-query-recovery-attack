Subject: HPL Litigation

Gentlemen - two items.

First, HPL has been sued (filed but not served) in a very minor right-of-way 
matter.  It is so minor I expect it can be resolved before plaintiff ever 
serves.  What type of information/involvement, if any,  would you like to see 
on this matter?

Second, the big picture.  Since Mr. Hammer has moved on to better hunting and 
fishing grounds, I now have overall responsibility of the GPG Law Operations 
group.  What types of information/involvement would you like to see on any 
HPL litigation that would be handled by operations?  We will, of course, keep 
Mr. Schneider well informed since he is the client.  

Thoughts??
