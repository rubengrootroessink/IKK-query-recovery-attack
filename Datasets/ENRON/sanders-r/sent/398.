	The Year 2000 Scenario 
The year is 1518. Amazing sights and rambunctious rivalry rule the day! King 
Henry VIII, Queen Katherine of Aragon and their brilliant court have gathered 
at the great harvest festival at New Market to award a coveted new title: 
Admiral of the Oceans and Warden of New Found Lands. The honors are to go the 
first intrepid explorer to present solid evidence that he has claimed a fine 
portion of the mysterious New World for England. And Their Majesties have 
spent the year since their challenge was issued planning to honor the winner 
and showcase his exotic New World treasures royally! 
	
	Determined to surpass even the Discoveries in the New World, merchants and 
artisans of the realm have assembled an exceptional collection of unique 
goods, savory cuisines and choice entertainments. A magnificent new stage, 
The Odeon, shall host the gala awards ceremony, to be followed by the 
spectacular 
	Cleopatra's Masque, recalling one of history's most heroic conquests of 
exotic lands. From exciting jousts, thrilling swordplay and lively players' 
arts to merry games, enchanting music and a dazzling finale of Royal 
Fireworks, all is set for a full day of adventure and delight! 
	
	But alas: 'twould seem that two swashbuckling explorers have arrived to claim 
the prize, both armed with a remarkable number of astonishing New World 
novelties and tall tales aplenty to prove their prowess in New World 
conquest! Have Their Majesties the skill to navigate these uncharted seas? 
Prepare ye for a rollicking voyage to New Worlds of mayhem and merriment, 
laughter and love!
