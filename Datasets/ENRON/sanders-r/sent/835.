		 Subject: Meeting with Dean Rapoport

Dear Fellow UH Law Center Alumni and Friends:

The new dean of the Law Center, Nancy Rapoport, is coming to Enron for a meet 
and greet with Enron's UH Law Center Alumni and friends on Tuesday, March 6 
at 8am in the 50M Dining Room.  

Dean Rapoport has been visiting all of the big law firms and law departments 
in an effort to introduce herself to the Houston legal community.  She has 
promised to give us a briefing on her vision and plans for the Law Center.  I 
have met the Dean already, and she is very impressive.  She should really 
invigorate the place.  

Please RSVP by responding to this email or by calling Jim Grace at x57702.

Also, please examine the address list.  If you see that any UH grad has been 
missed, please forward this on that person.  Thanks.
