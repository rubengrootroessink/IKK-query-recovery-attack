Richard,
I do not know this person personally, but I know very well the corporate 
culture  and the law firm culture from which he comes.  He has worked for 
TransCanada and the law firm of Walsh Young.    You probably need to discount 
the probative value of my comment as being too vague and subjective,  but all 
things considered, I would give a thumbs down to this guy, and suggest that 
we try to get someone from one of the firms up there.    Please call if you 
are interested in general background comments. ----cgy
