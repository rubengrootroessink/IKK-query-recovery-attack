Please drop me a voicemail or an e -mail when you have the time. I am out of 
town starting today. Also-- I circulated the resumes of the two Canadian 
attys you sent to me last week. If you have any more comments about 
them,leave that in the voicemail and I will forward it to Shelia and Julia.

I don't know this guy, but it seems he has experience in Calgary in private 
practice and in-house at TCPL and its affiliate ANG and I could pass along my 
thoughts on that experience if you would like.

Peter.
