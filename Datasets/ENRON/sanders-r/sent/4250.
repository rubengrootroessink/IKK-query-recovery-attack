Thanks for your e-mail about the Duke/Enron case. There is only one slight 
problem---we have no idea what case this is. Neal Manne at Susman represented 
us in a case against Duke that settled early last year. We have no active 
litigation  or disputes against Duke. My curiosity is pegged out. I asked Bob 
Boemer if he could find out more w/in ethical boundries.
