Richard,

Have you received the check from Teldata?  I have our signed version of the 
settlement agreement dated 4/5 but I haven't received their executed copy.

Thanks,

Andy

How are things ?  Have you heard anything on the cash we're due from 
Teldata?  
Thanks,

Hi Andy,
Just checking on the status of the amount we're going to collect from 
Teldata.  Is it still around $450k?
Thanks,
Mike
