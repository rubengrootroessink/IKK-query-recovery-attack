Richard:  actually, it is pretty clear.  We definitely would never file any 
papers without running them through you.  But on drafts of papers should we 
get your clearance first before sending to ECP or should we send out drafts 
to each of you simultaneously.  I assume the latter.  Could you let me know 
if you think differently.  Thanks, Richard, and I'm sure we will be speaking 
soon.  John

Yes. I am the contact person at Enron. The LLGM attys should send me copies
of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers,
counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As
for contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them
directly for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made
through me. I would suggest that they give me the option of participating
on the initial calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because
of time constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

Richard:  Could you let me know at your convenience if you should be the
contact person for any LeBoeuf lawyer with respect to any correspondence,
papers, questions, etc. in this matter.  Do you want us to be sending any
drafts of court papers that we prepare, for example, to ECP simultaneously
with sending them to you or after you have reviewed them?  I assume our
litigators can contact the ECP folks directly to obtain any information or
other materials that they may need, but please let me know if you would
rather that they work through you.  Thanks, Richard.  I hope that all is
going well.  John
