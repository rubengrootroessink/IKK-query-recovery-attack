I talked to Robin about this yesterday in relation to the class actions. I 
think the way we left it was that Jeff Alexander was going to look at the 
issue of transfering venue based on prejudice and get back to me. When do you 
need to make this motion?

Richard,

Do we need to consider filing a motion to transfer venue of this case on the 
ground of bias in the jury pool?  Do we prejudice your cases if we don't?
