Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.
