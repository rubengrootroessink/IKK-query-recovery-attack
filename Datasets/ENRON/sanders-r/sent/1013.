I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for
Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard
today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that
they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to
challenge our setoffs. Any news?

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the
process of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular
has Enron completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of
the Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more
likely to hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to
file something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know
the possibility is out there.
