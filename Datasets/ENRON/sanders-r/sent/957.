The sale of Pastoria will close this Wednesday, April 11.  I need each of you 
to again review the PSA and let Tom Moore, our outside counsel whose e-mail 
address is listed above, and me know if you are aware of any facts or events 
that have occurred since March 16 that would make any of our reps or 
warranties false or misleading.   Attached is the Seller's Officer 
Certificate we will deliver at closing.  It includes updates that have been 
identified through March 30.

I must have your response by 4 PM Houston time on Tuesday, April 10.  

Should you have an questions, please call me at 713.345.8992.  Thanks.
