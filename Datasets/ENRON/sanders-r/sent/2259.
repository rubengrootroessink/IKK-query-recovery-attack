Subject: Boies potential DQ



Mike Williams at CIG called today to advise that he received an announcement
from Donald L. Flexner, formerly of Crowell & Moring LLP (DC), that (1) Mr.
Flexner has now joined David Boies' firm, and (2) Boies' firm has changed
its name to Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP.

Mr. Flexner previously rendered anti-trust/other legal services to CIG, and
Mike is exploring whether Flexner's joining Boies' firm creates any basis
for disqualifying Boies, Schiller & Flexner in Quinque.  To this end, Mike
asked that I contact Enron's lawyers to learn whether Flexner has also
represented any Enron entities in the past.

If you know of any representation of Enron entities by Mr. Flexner, please
let either Barrett Reasoner or me know.

Thanks,
Andy Pickens
