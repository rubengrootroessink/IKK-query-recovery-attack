Congrats on your new arrival. I hope all is going well. I had lunch w/ Bill 
Gage
today and he mentioned that they had an opening at his firm. I think they are
shy about talking to current Bracewell attys. I told him that I had talked to
you about other opportunities after the partner decisions were made and that I
would pass along the information. If you are interested, Bill's # is
713--225--4500.
