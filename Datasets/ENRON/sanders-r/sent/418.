Mark Haedicke and I would like to talk to her. Lauren Prescott sent her 
resume to Chuck Cheek and she is scheduled to talk to them. I have left a 
message with him to find out when Cheryl is going to be in the building. 
Please call Twanda Sweet to set up a time (853-9402)

Richard,

Now that I've recovered from your bad news --  here's Cheryl Nelson's
schedule as of this morning:

  she is still available any time next Wednesday (10/18), Thursday  (10/19),
or Friday  (10/20), or the following Monday (10/23).

Let me know what when you would like to schedule her.  She is very excited
about Enron -- keeps hearing great things about the company.

Thanks!

Elaine
