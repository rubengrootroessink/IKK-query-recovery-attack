Bernard,

This will confirm our telephone conference of today and your telefax to me of 
today.  You confirmed that you had not mentioned settlement to Interfert's 
attorneys; I assume that Interfert's attorneys have not raised the subject 
with us either.

You also confirmed that Enron has no obligation to pay anything based simply 
on Mr. Cornuot's final report, which will have to be considered by the Court 
of Appeals of Versailles before it can become legally binding, and that Enron 
would likely have no obligation to pay any additional amounts until 
approximately the middle of 2002.  You advised that the parties' pleadings 
regarding Mr. Cornuot's report were not due to be filed with the Court of 
Appeals of Versailles until October 1, 2001 and that supplemental pleadings 
could be filed until January 17, 2002.  Oral argument (trial) before the 
Court of Appeal of Versailles was set for March 7, 2002.  Based on this, you 
did not expect the Court of Appeal of Versailles to render its decision until 
around June 2002.

You have also inquired with our appellate experts as to when they expect a 
ruling from the Supreme Court of France, and expect a response within the 
next ten (10) days from now.

You will have your legal assistant translate only those portions of Mr. 
Cornuot's final report that differ significantly from his preliminary 
report.   I would also appreciate it if you would send copies of the complete 
report to Christophe Casabonne and Michel Bouthonnet.  

As soon as it becomes practical to do so, I would appreciate inquiry into how 
much Mr. Cornuot will request for his fees and expenses in this matter.

You will also advise me of  (a) your attorney's fees and expenses 
outstanding, for your billed but unpaid time (if any); (b), for your accrued 
but unbilled time and expense; and (c), for your estimated fees and expenses 
going forward, until the exhaustion of all appeals.

Last, you confirmed that you frequently travelled to London and expected to 
be available for a conference in person with Richard in either Paris or 
London, at his convenience, around March 12, when Richard intends to be in 
London on other matters.

Many thanks for your help.

Regards,

Britt
