Lunch as you proposed sounds good. Thanks in advance for waiting for me.

Richard:

I've arranged for both Judge Lacey and Stu Alderoty (both from our Newark, NJ 
office) to join us for lunch on September 27th when you are in New York.  
I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working 
on the Infineum case, can attend as well.  Based on your planned arrival into 
LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:00/1:15 
p.m. range.  I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 
W. 55th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)--19th Floor.  
If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me 
know.

On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I 
would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice 
mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late 
last week.  The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I 
described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill & Knowlton who, 
according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's 
press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is 
very well known in CA Democratic circles.  He has been assisting us in 
certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he 
has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks 
to facilitate anything for you in that respect.

I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.  I hope that all is 
well.

Best regards.

John
