I agree that we should send such a letter. 
Also-- I talked to Mike Beatty and he is willing and able to serve as our 
party designate arbitrator. I told him that Neal would follow up with him on 
the details.

It's a two way street, of course.  Have they expressed any interest in
negotiating?  There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing
particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.

Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece?

As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is
not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that
our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke
clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen
ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP
(the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an
economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye?
