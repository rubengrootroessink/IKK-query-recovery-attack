Travis,

 I reviewed an "Agreement for Project Services" having an effective
date of May 20, 1999 and a "Project Work Description" (PWD) with a date in
the title of May 27, 1999, which includes an Attachment A.  The PWD and its
Attachment A apparently modify the 5/20/99 agreement, but reference it as
the 5/21/99 agreement in the preamble and above the signature line.  The
5/20/99 agreement conveys (in paragraphs 4.8.1 and 4.8.2) any intellectual
property rights that Agency.com may have acquired to Enron Corp.  Attachment
A, however, added a paragraph 4.10 that begins with the following sentence:
"Company shall obtain no intellectual property rights to the Work unless it
has made timely payments of all reasonable and undisputed fees."

 Please confirm that "reasonable and undisputed fees" were paid and
that there is no 5/21/99 agreement.

 Thanks.
