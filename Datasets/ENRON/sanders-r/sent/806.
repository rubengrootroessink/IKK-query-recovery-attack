Can one of you call him. Jim Steffes says he has told Jim that he can help in 
the lawsuit.

Richard -

Steve Mitnick (202-997-0924) called to find someone at Enron to discuss his 
ability to document fossil fired generation production by hour over the last 
few years.

I am not sure if this is helpful in your defense of the litigation 
surrounding CA, but thought you should know.  Steve is a consultant that 
worked with us on PECO.

Jim
