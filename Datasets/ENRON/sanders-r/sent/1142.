You have sent me some random e-mails lately. The reason they are leaving is 
because Broadband--move closer to your screen while I whisper-- is not making 
any freaking money. Yes I am going to South America. I don't know when. Why 
do you care about any of this--- is your ne'r do well brother-in-law one of 
these people??

Digressing, why are so many tech department people receiving buyout
packages?

Richard-

I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
you.

Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
Lagrave Field.

John
