Confidential.  Privileged.  Attorney Client Work Product.

Laura:

As discussed, attached are materials gathered in-house as to ERCOT Summer 
1999 price movements, consisting of (i) a chart of high and low ERCOT B 
product prices for each trading day of the summer, as published in MegaWatt 
Daily, and (ii) articles from the Megawatt Daily indicating unusual price 
movements in the same period.  Our "InfoCentral" employee has indicated as to 
the latter that articles published on August 2, 3, 16, 17 and 19, 1999 made 
reference to "next summer", and may thus on their face be indicative of 
altered forward price curves.  Please contact me with any questions or 
comments.

David
