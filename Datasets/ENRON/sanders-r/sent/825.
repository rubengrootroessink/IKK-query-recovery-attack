Richard,
  I am writing to request a conflict waiver so that one of my partners Fred
Holden can represent JEA, a water sewer and electrical utility located in
Jacksonville, Florida I connection with the pending PGE bankruptcy.  This
representation would be uder the same terms as the City of Palo Alto.  JEA
agrees we will not repesent them against Enron, they do not believe they
have claims against Enron and if JEA becomes adverse to Enron they agree we
ca represent Enron against them.

Thanks
Gary
