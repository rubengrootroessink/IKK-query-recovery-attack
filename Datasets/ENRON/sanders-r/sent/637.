Richard,

I have received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Mark D. 
Gately, now of Hogan and Hartson.  Gately was the lead partner on this file 
with Miles & Stockbridge before he changed firms toward the end of the case.  
He is billing us for 6.75 hours at $325 an hour, for a total of $2,193.75.  I 
find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for 
payment.  

I have also received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Miles & 
Stockbridge, for work done from October to date.  There are three timekeepers 
(with billing rates from $290 to $115 an hour) who charged a total of 17.70 
hours, for total fees of $4,101, and total expenses of $1,1129.30, for a 
total bill of $ 5,230.00.  I find the bill in order and ask for your 
authority to place it in line for payment.

Let me know if you wish to review either bill yourself, or whether you wish 
to pay the bills yourself.

Britt
