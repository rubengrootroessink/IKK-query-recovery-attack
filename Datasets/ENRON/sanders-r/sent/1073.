Dear Ms. Guinn,
Regretfully, we are unable to initiate the processing of your iBuyit Security 
request, because certain criteria were not met. These criteria are:
 
1. As you indicated, "Yes" to the approver role, the form must be submitted 
by someone at the appropriate approval level you are requesting. In this 
instance, Mr.Richard Sanders or someone above him in your group, would be the 
person to submit your request
3. The aforementioned submitter must indicate their approval of your 
projected role as an Approver within the body of the email. This indication 
need be no more than the words: "I approve." placed in the body of the email.

We will begin processing your request just as soon as receive your amended 
Security Request Form.
Thanks,
Karen
SAP Security
