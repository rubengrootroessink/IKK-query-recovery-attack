I don't know the Merit case. As for Badack, ENA has filed suit and moved for 
Summary Judgment on liability.The hearing will take place in the next month. 
On Thursday  Oct 12th, I met with  Badack's outside attys re settlement. 
Badack offered $2.375 mm. ENA's last offer was $5.0mm. We agreed to exchange 
additional offers. Is this update enough?
