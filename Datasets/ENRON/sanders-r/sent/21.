Can you please call her and get this worked out. I asked her to send me the 
invoice.

Richard, your name is on here too, Linda never answered my e-mails.  Any 
ideas?  I don't think this is Apachi's.

Hi Linda,
I am Director of Accounting/Reporting for the Apachi region (Asia Pacific 
Africa China) and I'm hoping you can help me with something.  We have 
received an invoice from Enron North America for outside legal costs for 
something called Havmann.  No one over here seems to know what that project 
is, but your name appears on some of the correspondence.

Looking at the backup for the invoice did shed a bit of light though, because 
some of it mentions charterers liability I vaguely remember from my EGLI days 
(too many years ago) that the Havmann was an LPG tanker.  Is it the same ship?

Can you let me know how this issue relates to Apachi, and what project it 
is.  I'm hoping you can provide an answer in the next day or so as this is an 
issue for February close.

Thanks a bunch and have a good weekend,
Paula
