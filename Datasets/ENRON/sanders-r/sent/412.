  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation
("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron
Entities")

Harvey,

 As set forth in Gary Fergus' e-mail message dated October 6, 2000,
and pursuant to our conference call today, the Enron Entities are producing
the enclosed documents (Bates numbered "Enron Entities 000001-_______")
pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public
Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").

 The Enron Entities produce these documents pursuant to our email
exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission
agrees that by producing these documents, the Enron Entities have not waived
any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any
claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses
have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if
necessary.

 In addition, the Enron Entities produce these documents with the
understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order
than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document
productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In
addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding,
the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve
the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such
order.
