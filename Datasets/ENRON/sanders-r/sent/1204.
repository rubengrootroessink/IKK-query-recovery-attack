After conferring with Rob Cole, I will make my recommendation to Mr. Derrick 
today as to local counsel so that we may get a responsive pleading on file in 
a timely fashion. Thereafter, Rob and I will coordinate the defense with 
local counsel and report in the usual fashion.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced 
case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The 
Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had 
previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined 
that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT 
owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be 
handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the 
activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this 
matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.
