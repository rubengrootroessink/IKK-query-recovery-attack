Looks good. I would send it from me to Lisa Urrick at the PX instead. What do 
you think?

Gary,

The only suggestion I have for the letter involves your reference to the FTR 
Auction.  I would propose that you revise 2(b) of the letter to read as 
follows:

b. Has the CalPX made any attempts to have the ISO apply the approximately 
$80 million in proceeds from the ISO's recent Firm Transmission Right auction 
to PG&E and Edison's ISO real-time charges incurred while the CalPX was 
acting as Scheduling Coordinator for the two utilities?

Here is the original sentence:  "b. Has the CalPX credited the $80,000,000 in 
auction revenue for the Firm Transmission Rights from the auction held in 
January in any of these chargeback calculations?"

The FTR proceeds are held by the ISO, not the PX, making it impossible for 
the PX to credit the IOUs for these amounts.

Here is a draft letter to the CalPX for your review and comments.

Thanks.
