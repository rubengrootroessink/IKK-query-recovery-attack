Richard could you please review Section 4 (f) of the attached NDA from 
Microsoft regarding exclusive jurisdiction.  I proposed non-exclusive New 
York jurisdiction and this is their response.  If you could call me or e-mail 
me your comments, I would greatly appreciate it.  Michelle Hicks referred me 
to you.

Hi,

We can not agree to the modifications. However, we can agree to exclusive
jurisdiction in New York.  Pls. let me know if that will work for you.
Leaving jurisdiction and venue open is not an option.

Donna

Donna attached is a red-line version of the NDA with my one comment in
Section
4(f).  Our corporate policy does not allow us to submit to exclusive
jurisdiction.  Please call me or e-mail me upon your review.  Thanks.
