Thanks for setting up this meeting. It will have to be Thursday Morning for 
me or before 1:30 PM. I have to catch a flight to New York for business later 
that afternoon.

Richard

It was nice to meet you. Will we be able to review some possible transcript 
candidates on or before Jan. 11? Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Kirk and Richard:

Just want to let you know that Beth Stier of Innovision will meet with us on 
Thursday, Jan. 11 (exact time to come) to discuss the treatment for this 
video.  Beth is out of town today and will let me know available times on 
Monday.  See you soon and have a great weekend.

Mary
