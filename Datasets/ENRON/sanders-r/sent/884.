		 Subject: Request for Conflict Waiver


One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
Charlie Vetters and
Kyle Kettler.

Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
described above?

Thanks
Gary
