Gentlemen:

This lotus note is to advise you that trial in the captioned matter is 
scheduled for January 17, 2000 and mediation is scheduled for November 16, 
1999.  We have authorized $50,000 in settlement authority.  I have advised 
our outside counsel that I am available to attend the mediation.  Dave Howe 
told me that he needs to check with the other parties involved as it was his 
understanding that only trial counsel are going to attend the mediation.  In 
any event, Risk Management will be available by telephone if more authority 
is necessary.

I will keep you abreast of all significant developments.
