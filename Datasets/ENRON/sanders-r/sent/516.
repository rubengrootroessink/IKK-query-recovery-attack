>  We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for
> EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by
> October 27th.  However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation
> that any data provided be useful and reliable.  The collection of data you
> requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same
> location nor organized as you requested it.  In fact during our review of
> some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the
> methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.
> When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it
> would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,
> we informed you of the problem.  We now understand that if we cannot give
> you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be
> available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to
> compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission
> ("FERC").  We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data
> immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the
> immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce
> accurate data.

>  Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number
> of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas
> served on the Enron entities.  First, we understand that many other
> parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the
> detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very
> sound legal grounds.  Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing
> on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is
> supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes
> sought by other parties served.  Third, the Commission has filed its
> motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data
> from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited
> hearing and production schedule.  We note that the reasons stated in the
> motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially
> different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application
> to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.
> Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a
> tentative order as of November 1, 2000.
>
>  Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept "most
> favored nation" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests
> by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that
> was available.  However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need
> for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite
> substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate
> Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described
> intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal
> objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's
> threatened motion to compel before FERC.

>  We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission
> has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been
> served with subpoenas.  We understand that there is a list for those
> entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been
> delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their
> rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We understand that the Commission
> intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that
> object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.  We deplore
> these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described
> above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating
> list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.
