Bob and Richard:  

Mr. Derrick has asked me to ask you if you would like to join he, Scott 
Burdine and Fred Hagans for lunch on Wednesday, June 7, 2000.  The new firm, 
Hagans, Bobb & Burdine, is interested in becoming more involved in Enron's 
litigation.  

Please let me know your availability so that I may coordinate with the 
Hagans, Bob & Burdine firm.  

Thank you,

Steph. Harris
