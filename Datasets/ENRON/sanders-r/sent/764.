Out of Florida would be better(Atlanta) but Miami is fine. I can't speak to 
whether Fla law is good or not. Sorry.

I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in 
Florida, under which the muni would allow us to periodically test turbines at 
its facilities.  They want Florida law to govern, and I don't anticipate that 
they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for 
arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of 
arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?
