Did you ever get an opinion from V&E?

		 Subject: Amparo Litigation

Attached is a brief memo from Rogelio-Lopez Velarde concerning the Court of 
Appeals that will hear the appeal of the Amparo proceeding in which Enron 
Energia Industrial de Mexico is an interested party.  We are fortunate that 
this Court has heard, and denied, two prior appeals of virtually-identical 
Amparo proceedings.

The meeting yesterday among Rogelio Lopez-Velarde, Jorge Canals (Enron's 
litigator) and Bill Wieland went well.  Bill indicated that he hoped to be 
able to provide his opinion by this afternoon.
