We will be delivering ENA opinions dated Thursday and Friday.  I just wanted 
to confirm with you that you are not aware of any litigation or any other 
proceeding which could affect ENA's ability to enter into and perform under 
swap agreements (other than anything that is disclosed in the 1999  10K or  
the 10Q's for 2000.
