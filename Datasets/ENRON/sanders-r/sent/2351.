The employee in question in Bill's e-mail is Harry Moulton.  Harry is an 
employee of EECC's construction subsidiary, NEPCO.  Harry was in Korea to 
survey the machines at the Kunsan site.  Harry is currently the NEPCO site 
manager for the construction of a sixth unit at East Coast Power's Linded 
project (Enron owns 25%).  As far as the depositions go, it would certainly 
be better if Bob and I could do them back-to back, but that is a lawyer vs 
lawyer issue, let us know.
