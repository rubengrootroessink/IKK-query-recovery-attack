Project Stanley is a unique, sensitive project that is being handled within a 
limited circle within Houston and Calgary.  Nonetheless, the project is being 
handled out of Houston and is incurring significant expenses, only some of 
which are legal expenses.

A separate RC was requested to be set-up under the commercial direction of 
John Lavorato and Rob Milnthorp.  The other principal contacts are from Legal 
- Mark Haedicke, and Government Affairs - Rick Shapiro.  Frankly, I (as well 
as Rob Milnthorp and Enron Canada generally) only have limited involvement in 
this project.

Thanks,
Peter

Peter,

Cheryl (from accounting) spoke to me this morning - she said that they are 
having no luck with their contacts in Houston (Accounting) with respect to 
setting up a Houston RC for Project Stanley - no one seems to know anything 
about it.

Cheryl was wondering if we have a contact in Houston - Legal that she could 
speak to about getting this set up with Houston - Accounting.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Linda
