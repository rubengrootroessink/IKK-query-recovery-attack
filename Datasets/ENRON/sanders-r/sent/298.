Joe Hartsoe has previously arranged for Richard Tabors (Enron's economic 
consultant) to meet with FERC staff and Craig Baker of AEP (for AEP to 
explain certain practices to FERC.)  Please contact Joe 202-466-9150 to 
coordinate whether this should take place in light of the discussions that we 
had today with outside counsel at Gibbs & Brun.  Thanks.
