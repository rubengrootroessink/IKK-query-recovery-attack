You have been identified as a supervisor who has not completed a 2000 year 
end evaluation form for some of your employees.   Please review the following 
names and take a moment to complete an evaluation form for your employees. 

1.  Linda Guinn

Please note that it is extremely important for all employees, that go through 
our PRC process, to have an original signed evaluation form  IN THEIR 
PERSONNEL FILE. 

If you have ANY questions, please contact me at ext. 5-7803 or my assistant, 
Ramona Perkins at ext. 5-8165.

Thank You.
