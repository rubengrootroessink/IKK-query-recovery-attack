Sheila and Karen,

As you requested, our accounting department has not been following up on our
outstanding invoices -- which at this point total about $700,000 (see
attached).  Sheila, I gather you told Barry you would try to get us current
before the end of November.  That would be great if you can do it.  (I can
give you wire info if you need it.)  If we don't make November (I know
you're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us that
we get caught up by year end.  Let me or Barry know if there's anything we
need to do.

Harlan
