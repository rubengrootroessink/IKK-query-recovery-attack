Hi John.  I wanted to get you (and Richard Sanders) thinking about a request 
we have received from Owen Orndorff (who, for Richard's benefit, is one of 
the principals in Rosebud Energy Corp., the general partner of Colstrip 
Energy Limited Partnership ("CELP"), in which Enron, now through the "Condor" 
vehicle, holds a 25% limited partner interest;  CELP owns a waste 
coal-burning QF in Montana).

Rosebud has expressed an interest in filing suit against Montana Power 
Company ("MPC"), the facility's offtake purchaser, for MPC's refusal to allow 
CELP to remarket power above the minimum contract demand under the facility's 
PPA.  I will fax to you and to Richard a memorandum that the Doney, Crowley 
firm, which traditionally has done some work for CELP, has prepared regarding 
litigation theories and chances of success.  Owen has preliminarily scheduled 
a partnership meeting to discuss this issue (among others, as yet identified) 
on April 25th in Chicago.

My preliminary reactions to the Doney memo are that, at the time it was 
written, at least, there were a number of issues that had not been fully 
enough  researched for the partners to be making a decision.  I will ask 
Terry Donovan if further work has been done by now.  My initial reactions are 
that (1) having the PPA be the subject of a pending lawsuit could make our 
current efforts to sell our interest much more difficult;  (2) the potential 
is there for MPC to cook up some kind of counterclaim, which, even if not 
successful, puts additional pressure on the PPA, could draw out the 
litigation, and add costs, not to mention problems for our sale, and (3) the 
effort could result in as yet unknown costs to the partners (since, as I 
recall uner the partnership agreement, the costs would be borne by the 
partners - ??).  I also need to check and see just who within Enron is 
supposed to call the shots on the strategy for this, given that the 
investment is now held in Condor.

I will be out of the country on vacation beginning late Friday, April 6th, 
until Monday, April 23.  I'd like to touch base with you before I leave, 
since there won't be much time to develop our response to Owen prior to the 
meeting on the 25th.  At that time, we can also talk about what might come up 
on the sale effort while I'm out (at this point, there shouldn't be much, as 
Terry seems immersed on another deal).

I'll be in SF all this week trying to close on Pastoria, but am reachable at 
the office there (415/782-7800) or by pager (800/316-0430).  Thanks.
