 Are you guys aware of this case?  Is this "the" antitrust case? It is filed 
against both EES and Enron Power Marketing. Is it anything I can be of 
assistance with?  Thanks.

Greg:

Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron
affiliate and they are likely aware of it.  Just in case, I am forwarding
this message to our Houston headquarters for their handling.  Please do not
engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be
controlled by the business unit attorney responsible for that affiliate.
Thanks for your awareness of this filing.

Regards,  David Lund

David: Attached is a portion of the San Diego Superior Court webpage
indicating new superior court filings. Padre Dam Municipal Water District,
Valley Municipal Water District and the Sweetwater Authority filed suit
against Enron and others for "antitrust/unfair business practices" on
January 16, 2001. I will get a copy of the complaint so you can call me
regarding specifics(I will not forward the complaint, thereby avoiding any
argument that you have been "served"). I'll let you know when we obtain the
complaint. Jeff and I will be ready to help if you need us, Mac
