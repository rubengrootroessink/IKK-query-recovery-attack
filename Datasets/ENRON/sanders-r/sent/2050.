Attached, please find a memo and a number of spreadsheets describing the 
events at Silver Peak for deliveries on May 25, 1999.  I am faxing some 
additional background information downloaded from the internet to Richard and 
Elizabeth.  I have provided a lot of information and could drill down on many 
more details.  Let me know what other information you need.  Thanks to 
everyone for your help in this matter.
