what is the basis for that determination? 
ethics [conflicts]? work load?

The whole purpose is not to end up in the Bronx, or in family court in 
Albany. 

Richard, do you have a view on this?

I think that it is correct that the parties can't force a specific branch or
part to take a case and not assign it elsewhere.

Acceptable NY Courts





Here's a new one in our continuing saga of acceptable New York courts.

Currently, (with appropriate GC approval) we can specify United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in New York
County ("USDCSDNY") or
the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of the State of
New York sitting in New York County.

In-house counsel for Chase Securities Inc. would not accept this provision
without a caveat that if a judge of the specified state court determined
that some other branch or division of such court sitting in NY County
should have jurisdiction, we had to accept jurisdiction in the other branch
or division.  Rather than risk ending up in an unacceptable forum, both
sides agreed to limit jurisdiction to the USDCSDNY.

I believe Joel may have checked earlier this year on New York courts with a
V&E litigator in New York.  If so, we might want to get further guidance on
this point.

Regards, NJD
