Although I would love to allow someone else the opportunity to participate in 
this project, it makes more sense for me to be the  Enron rep. What do I need 
to do to begin the transition?

Gary, I am circulating the protocol for internal review and will get back to 
you shortly on both the protocol and our participation in this working 
group.  Thank you.

Dear Mr. Williams,
?
This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute 
Management Protocol.? One of the most exciting aspects of  that meeting was 
the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.
?
Should you have any questions, you can reach me by e-mail 
(gstrathmann@mediaone.net) or  telephone (978-376-9004).
?
Thank you.
