You have chosen to enroll in the Enron PAC.  You should have received a 
confirmation e-mail which you must respond to, as your new contribution 
election will not take effect without an electronic signature as outlined by 
the Federal Election Commission.  As soon as we receive confirmation from 
you, your enrollment will take effect the next available payroll period.

Thank you for your participation in the Enron PAC.
