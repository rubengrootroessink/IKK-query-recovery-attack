I talked to Mark Palmer last week about some other issues and casually 
thanked him for talking to you. His response was somewhat disapointing: " I 
really enjoyed meeting him and he would be great for our Gov. affairs office, 
too bad they have no openings." Sorry for the lackluster interest/bordering 
on rude behavior. Take the transmission wire job, come repackage the deal to 
Enron and get your revenge by getting $mm of dollars from Enron.
