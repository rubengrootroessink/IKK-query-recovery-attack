I was reading through your and others' recommendations and saw(for the first 
time) your dinner invitation. Sorry for the delay. I need to take a rain 
check. Life is really hectic right now. As you will note from the time, I am 
here early just to clean out my e-mails--what has technology done to us. I am 
in CA once a week. Yesterday, my 5 year old called me at the office at  7am 
and asked me why I was never there when he woke up. So much for my cushy 
in-house job. Anyway, a night away is too hard to find right now. What about 
lunch? Thurs or Fri of next week?

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.
