It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again. The real question is 
:did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence 
w/ the future president. Maybe this says alot for Bush. He thinks Pat is as 
much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to  take him 
seriously. Wouldn't that be refreshing. You need to get the real scoop before 
lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana.
