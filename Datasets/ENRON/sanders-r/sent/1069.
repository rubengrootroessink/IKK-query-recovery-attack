Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen for her computer.  Please let me 
know if I can move forward with fulfilling this request.  Thanks!

Stephanie:

Go ahead and order the computer battery for Gail Brownfeld.

You  need to get approval from Richard Sanders by e-mail so you will have a 
record he approved it (because he is the cost center owner) before you order 
the flat panel for Michelle Blaine.  Please note, the standard flat panel for 
our department is a 15" panel, definitely not an 18".    When Richard 
approves it you can go ahead and order the flat panel through iBuyit.  

The usual procedure for our department is the cost center owner needs to 
approve any requests for computer equipment before they are purchased.

Thanks.  I hope you are doing well.

I need to order a new computer battery for Gail Brownfeld, as her current one 
has a broken connector.  Also, Michelle Blaine has requested a flat screen 
for her computer.  Can I order these from IBuyIt, or do I need to get 
approval from someone first?  Thanks!
