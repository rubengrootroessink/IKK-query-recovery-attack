Jeff Shankman has reviewed his legal allocations for February and would like 
more detail on exactly what each attorney listed below is working on for his 
teams.  If you are not listed below, an attorney who reports to you is and I 
will need the projects/services they are working on for Jeff.  I have 
attached the February allocations for your reference.  Please have this 
information to me no later than 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.


Thanks for your help.
