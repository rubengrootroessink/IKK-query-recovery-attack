Richard,

Please review the attached fax from Ben Ogletree, one of Natwest's lawyers,
especially the four attached agreements (which Natwest already has.)  Can I
represent to Natwest that these four agreements, along with the Oaktree
settlement agreement, constitute all settlement or cooperation agreements that
we have with any parties to any of NSM litigation?  If I can say that, the
issue of ECT Securities' deposition goes away.

Steve
