Would you have time to contact Linda Green or do you want me to do it?

Hi Sheila.  For a headhunter in the NW, I'd suggest Linda Green.  Perkins 
Coie uses her, as do (it turns out) PGE and ECI.  She also does work for 
Intel.  Here is her information:

 Green and Associates
 2701 NW Vaughn Street, Suite 450
 Portland, OR   97210

 (503)224-9601

Hope this is helpful.  Did you get my message about Andy Wu?
