Sounds great. If you are going there from your office I might want to catch a 
ride. If not, I got the directions and will see you there.

Hi Richard--

Because you liked it so much, I have made dinner reservations at Ducz in 
Pasadena.  The reservations are for 7:00 pm.  Bill Price, Duane Lyons and I 
will meet you there.  John Quinn may join us as well.

Gina is going to fax you directions to the restaurant from LAX.  One of us 
can drop you off at your hotel after dinner.

Bill
