John Quinn, one of our (many)litigators in California was approached by David 
Boies' firm about getting involved in the Quinque matter. He called me, 
learned that we were a defendant, and declined Boies' offer to get involved. 
I have attached the Boies firm response. I think the danger of allowing the 
Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a 
release. The release may be shortlived.  Enron could be added to Quinque or a 
Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in 
Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position 
in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?

I think it would be worth pursuing that option with your client.  If it
meant the involvement of your firm (to any significant extent), the
plaintiffs would likely agree to dismiss the Enron defendants.
