Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  
We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  
However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn 
down...please advise.

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping 
required levels available?
