The requirement that all three arbitrators have 10 years of experience in 
unrealistic. We will be hard pressed to find one. Most arbitrators are 
lawyers.
With respect to the second change, it is not a change we should make. This  
changes the arbitration from a party designate arbitration where one of the 
arbitrators is our advocate, to a totally nuetral panel.
