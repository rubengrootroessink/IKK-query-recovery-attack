Thomas:
On my way back to the job site after a meeting in Dever, with Rooney
Engineering. I received a call on my cell phone from Mike White site manager
for NEPCO telling me a OSHA compliance officer was on the job site. Mike J.
Mc Williams, Mike White, and I walked the site, looked at all records and
spoke with NEPCO, CIGC and Jomax personnel. MR. Mcwilliams and I had a close
out interview meeting after the inspection. He said the job site and records
were in order and no major violation were seen with the accident or the job
site. His only comment was he saw a missing clip on a out-boom. He will issue
a report on his inspection within 6 months.
Accident reports from NEPCO, Jomax and CIGC will be forward to your office on
Thursday March 29, 2001. If you or your offfice need addtional infor. please
let know.

Jerry Odom
Enron Site Rep.
