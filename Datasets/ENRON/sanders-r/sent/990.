Your resume was not attached to your e-mail. I don't have any openings in 
Enron Wholesale, but I will send your resume around.

Richard-

        As I mentioned in a voice mail I left a little earlier, Iam currently 
looking for a position in litigation, with a preference for some work in the 
appellate area.  Kristina Mordaunt and David Koogler suggested that I contact 
you to see if there is anything presently available.  I am taking the liberty 
of attaching a resume and list of reported decisions so you can see my 
background.  If you don't mind, I will try to call you the first part of next 
week.  If you would like to talk before then, I can be reached at 
713-754-6300.

        Thanks for your consideration.

        Kevin Risley
