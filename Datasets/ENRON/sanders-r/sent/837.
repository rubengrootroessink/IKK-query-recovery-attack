Hopefully this provides what you are looking for, however, there is more to 
come.

Please note the fourth paragraph requesting the total labor and expenses for 
the "big picture".  This was discussed at our first meeting and hopefully, 
you can produce same or make it available to him for inspection.

Also, we need to quickly resolve the "missing System 700 book".  If it 
exists, lets produce it.  If not, we need to advise that it was 
miscommunication or whatever, but we need to do so soon.

I thought we were going to advise that we had appointed a "point" person to 
deal with extracting information from the subcontractors.  Apparently this 
was not communicated to Claude.  Do you want to re-consider allowing him to 
go direct?

Jim/Russ/Ron,

This will confirm our tele-conference this AM on the pending claim filed on
behalf of Doyle.

Unfortunately, my meeting at Dean-Oliver did not fully take place on the
intended scope as Charlie McCorkle had to take his wife to the doctor on an
unexpected trip.  I am out of town until Friday, but we do plan on meeting
Friday afternoon, I will respond on any additional information outstanding.
(Charlie had Kelly McKenzie's book with him)

You had ask that I further explain our deductions on the reduced Craft Labor
hours detailed in my last letter.  In our December meeting it was noted that
NEPCO was in a support roll to Elliott on the rebuild.  NEPCO had their most
involvement at the very beginning and very end of the repairs.  The repair
area had its own trailers, parts warehouse and staging area.  We discussed
in the meeting that the support roll essentially would take a Supervisor and
three employees per shift or about eight per 24 day.  In review of the
submitted labor it is noted that an average of three Start-up Employees
charged their full day to this job from 6/15 up to 7/3, then 4 up to 7/17,
then 6+ up to the final completion of repairs, 7/23.  At the same time,
Office Staff employees averaged charging up to 8 employees per day, day
shift, during the repair time and continued to charge labor up to a month
after.  The Craft Labor group charged an average of 11 employees per day
charging all of their work day to the repairs.  When you average it out, you
had around 13 support personnel for an Elliott crew on every shift (24
hours), when the Elliott crew consisted of about 13 to 15 persons.  This
would account for between 25 to 30 people (without consultants &
sub-contractors) time charged working every hour, 24 hours the entire time.
Add the consultants/subcontractors and it goes up to a minimum of 30 people.
This is unrealistic by any standard and cannot be explained away as an
inefficiency of site versus shop work.

One of our requests in our meeting in Houston was that additional
information concerning the total labor and expenses charged to the entire
site be made available to see the "big picture" of the site labor and
expense charges on a weekly or monthly basis.  This additional information
or it's location has not been forthcoming to date.  There has to be some
type of summary cost details which Doyle was billed on a per Unit basis.

I also noted that I would comment on differences in scope of repair, thus a
lesser measurement of the loss & payable claim.   I have been commenting on
differences in scope since my first letter and subsequently as information
has been made available.  The major scope differences are:
1. Partial vs. full stationary and rotor blades
2. Repaired versus replaced 1st Stage Turbine Buckets & Nozzles
3. Use of "old" designed stub shaft vs. purchase of "new" designed stub
shaft
4. Overscope of repairs by Preco on work completed in their shop.
5. Elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items,
misalignment and other items noted in my e-mail of 1/24 (including work
completed on Units #2 & #3).
6. NEPCO labor charges noted above.

There are a number of lessor items.  If the meeting this Friday takes place,
I will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based on
documentation we have received to date.  It is unfortunate that there was no
"System 700" or similar type book completed on the repairs.  Our discussions
in Houston and up until recently indicated that this was an SOP at NEPCO.
As I noted the Kelly McKenzie book is not a complete view of the repairs
made.

The request to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of
work in my last letter has not been responded to.

Once again, I will e-mail you after our meeting Friday with any requested
support items that were to be included in this e-mail.

Claude
