CFP and I discussed my question, posed
to both you and her, about whether I
needed to involve others at my firm in this
case.  Her view was no, and I do not
disagree.  But I did not hear from you
and, still scarred from my prior error in
assuming that CFP spoke for Enron, I
would like to have your view.  So, again: do you want Geoff Harrison, Vineet 
Bhatia
or Steve Susman involved in this case? Right now it is being handled by a
Bracewell team, a V&E team, and me as
the sole SG contributor.  That's fine with
me if it is with you and JVD.
