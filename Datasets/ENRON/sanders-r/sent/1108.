I admit that this is a little unclear--sorry. Obviously, I am heading up the 
overall CA litigation strategy for Enron. Robin Gibbs in Houston is our lead 
trial counsel in all the CA cases. He is out of Houston. Mike Kirby was hired 
as local counsel in the San Diego cases, but both Robin and I have been 
impressed with his judgment and we would like to expand his role a bit. I 
have asked him to lead the Sen Dunn response but he is coordinating closely 
with me and Robin. Is this as clear as mud?

Sandi-to follow up our telephone conference this afternoon, I understand that 
the hearing in Irvine will be this Friday, May 18 at 9:00, rather than 
Thursday, May 17. I will be there and will await receipt of the specific 
address. I called Heather and she is faxing me a map of the location. As I 
indicated, and as Richard Sanders mentioned in the earlier conference call 
today, I am taking the lead in dealing with Sen Dunn on behalf of Enron. 
Please send to my attention the transcripts of the prior hearings and any 
videotapes. I will make sure they get copied and distributed to everyone who 
needs them. The firm name is Post Kirby Noonan & Sweat LLP, 600 West 
Broadway, Suite 1100, San Diego, CA 92101. The phone is 619-231-8666, and my 
direct dial is 619-557-4402. The fax is 619-231-9593 and my cell phone is 
619-871-8121. This should cover everything you requested. I look forward to 
meeting you in Irvine on Friday.Thanks.
