The main problem in getting him paid was that Blakes didn't send me his bill 
until Nov. We have processed the bill and he should have already received his 
money. I will call Larry today to apologize.

Larry Ruff sent along a note indicating that his invoice  (US$20,000)  for 
consulting services re Stanley has not been paid, 5 months after it was first 
submitted to Blakes.  He was told by Web MacDonald of Blakes that it had been 
submitted to Enron Corp in Houston for payment.  Hopefully we can expedite 
payment.  Evidently Larry has been approached by Enron's California counsel 
to do some work out there for Enron and Larry insisted on a retainer given 
his experience on Stanley.   Regards, Aleck
