Jay,

As I mentioned, I had met with Richard Sanders and Andy Edison earlier today, 
and they recommend that we respond to Ron's latest letter.  Richard tells me 
that, in litigation, much is made of the fact that a party did not respond to 
another's correspondence.  As you can see, I have kept the response short 
rather than rehash and contradict once more each of Ron's numerous 
inaccuracies and self-serving statements.

Pete
