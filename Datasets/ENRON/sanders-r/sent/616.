Hi Richard.  We are close to finalizing a sale of our Pastoria project in 
California to Calpine.  I've got you listed as a "knowledge" party of ENA for 
purposes of making a rep regarding litigation.  Could you please take a look 
at Section 4.1(i) of the attached draft, and let me know if there are any 
actions required to be scheduled for the rep to be accurate.  At this point, 
my proposed Schedule 4.1(i) says "none", and, hopefully, that statement is 
still accurate.  We're on a timetable that requires me to ask for your 
response by the end of theday tomorrow (Thursday).  Thanks. --  kj
