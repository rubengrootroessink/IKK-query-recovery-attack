Enron's business unit Y2K teams have done an exceptional job preparing for=
=20
Y2K.  Approximately 3,400 employees and contractors have been involved in=
=20
assessing more than 75,000 systems, 45,000 embedded systems, and 20,000=20
external entities.  In addition, more than 2,900 employees and contractors=
=20
will be dedicating some of their time over the millennium weekend to retest=
=20
systems and to ensure continued operations as part of our contingency=20
planning program. =20

As a final measure, the Corp. Y2K project office recommends that you take t=
he=20
following precautions to protect your desktop computers and PC applications=
:

Make diskette backups of critical documents and data kept locally on your P=
C.

Consider making printouts of the following:
Staff listings and contact numbers
Internal and external contact lists
Personal calendar details and =01&to do=018 lists for January
Frequently used standard electronic templates and forms

For important business information such as contracts, processes and=20
procedures, diagrams, and curves, your Y2K teams are making preparations to=
=20
retain hard copies.  If you are unsure whether this is being done, please=
=20
contact your local Y2K coordinator.

Ensure adequate supplies of paper, toner, and diskettes are stocked prior t=
o=20
the last week in December.

Unless specifically told otherwise by your local Y2K team, be sure to do th=
e=20
following before leaving the office for the last time in 1999:
 Log off. For most users, follow normal procedures and choose "Close all=20
programs and log on as a different user=018 when leaving for the night.  =
=20
 Leave PC turned on.  =20
Following these procedures will allow the network teams to download virus=
=20
patches to your PCs over the millennium weekend. =20
For many laptop users, or for those in doubt, leave your PCs turned off unt=
il=20
you return to work and can log in to the network.  If this is not possible,=
=20
be sure to follow the backup procedures recommended above.

After December 31, carefully review output from applications (primarily=20
spreadsheets, local database applications, and documents with macros).  We=
=20
have encountered problems with older applications and macros that use hard=
=20
coded two digit years.  Be sure to double check output, and question data=
=20
that does not =01&seem right.=018 =20

To protect against viruses, e-mail with attachments will be quarantined=20
beginning on December 31.  E-mail without attachments will be delivered as=
=20
usual.  Those with low-risk (non-executable) attachments will be delivered=
=20
after a brief delay of approximately 15 minutes. Delivery of e-mail with=20
executable attachments (those with the extension ".exe" and possibly ".zip"=
)=20
may be delayed indefinitely. Consistent with normal business practices, avo=
id=20
downloading anything from the Internet.

We have done a considerable amount of work preparing for Y2K, and we hope y=
ou=20
will help minimize any impact the calendar rollover could have on personal=
=20
computer systems.  Thank you for your assistance.=20
