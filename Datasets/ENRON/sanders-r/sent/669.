I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your 
voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being 
handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next 
week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, 
I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business 
contact--a short and sweet letter should do.

Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one.

In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista 
manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction 
tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of 
interest.  

It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes 
for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the 
declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, 
how would you like to go about making the request?
