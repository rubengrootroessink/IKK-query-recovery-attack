Limor and Richard,

I would like to recommend that we use Goodsill, Anderson, Quinn & Stifel as 
our local counsel in Honolulu, the port where the M/V OBOD, and her cargo, 
are under arrest.  Although I do not have any personal experience with this 
law firm, I got their name from local admiralty attorneys who have access to 
the books published by the various P&I Clubs, which list what maritime 
attorneys each club has certified for use in each port.  The Goodsill, 
Anderson firm was mentioned by two different admiralty attorneys here in 
Houston as being listed by a number of different clubs for the port of 
Honolulu.  It is not at all unusual for admiralty attorneys to choose local 
counsel in this manner.

I have not yet received Goodsill, Anderson's proposed engagement letter, but 
will send it to you when I do.

I will call each of you tomorrow to get your thoughts on this firm.

Britt

Dear  Britt:
?
Per your  request, I am forwarding you copies of our firm's resume and 
billing  policies.? I am also forwarding personal resumes for two of my 
partners,  John Lacy and Mark Desmarais, both of whom do maritime work.? For 
reasons  discussed hereinbelow, I suggest that Mark and his associate, Randy 
Baldemor,  would be best suited to work on this matter.? The billing rates 
for Mark  and Randy are $245/hour and?$130/hour, respectively.
?
Two issues  turned up during our conflict check.? First, our firm represents 
Hawaiian  Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and its subsidiaries, including its 
three public  utility subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), 
Hawaii Electric  Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Company, 
Limited (MECO).?  Although we are not aware on any actual conflict between 
ENRON and HEI, HECO,  HELCO or MECO, we are cognizant that ENRON is a major 
player in the power  producing industry.? Accordingly, we would need to 
confirm that our  representation of ENRON in the present maritime matter 
would not preclude us  from representing HEI, HECO, HELCO or MECO in other 
matters in which such  companies' interests may be adverse to ENRON.? Please 
let me know as soon  as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable.
?
Second, as it  turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been 
tracking the M/V OBOD  and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.? 
The Seattle firm  retained our firm strictly to monitor the vessel and any 
actions with regard to  her arrest, but has neither asked for legal advice, 
nor disclosed who their  client is.? Mark does not believe that our firm's 
monitoring the status of  the vessel presents any conflicts with our 
representing ENRON.? He has  placed a call to the Seattle firm and expects?to 
hear back from his contact  later this afternoon.? Assuming our firm is 
engaged by ENRON, given that  they already know about the vessel, its recent 
history and the parties and  counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear 
best suited to assist you on this  matter.
?
Finally, I  passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be 
viewed  (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having 
abandoned its  interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.? Mark checked (on the 
premise that  our firm was being considered to be retained as Hawaii counsel) 
with Bryan Ho,  attorney for Nordic Technical Development, Inc., who 
indicated that he was not  aware of any passed or pending filing deadlines.
?
I will call you  tomorrow morning, Hawaii time, to discuss the two issues 
that came out of our  conflict check.? I look forward to resolving these 
issues to our mutual  benefit and to assisting ENRON on this matter.
?
Best  regards.
