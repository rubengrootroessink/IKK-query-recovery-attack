NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a
reward of more than $50 million to anyone who has information that will help 
his
office prosecute power suppliers accused of gouging the wholesale electricity
market in the state.

Lockyer's Energy Emergency Task Force has been conducting an investigation for
several months into allegations that generators and natural gas marketers have
engaged in "any wrongful act which may have resulted in reduction in the
California (electricity) supplies or increase in the price of natural gas or
electricity."

"My office is conducting an aggressive investigation into whether energy
providers have violated any laws," Lockyer said. "It is possible that one or
more members of the public can help with information, and if so, the financial
reward to such a person or persons could be enormous."

Gov. Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer's office can
investigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and other
anticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.

Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) have
vehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale 
electricity
market has already been investigated by federal regulators and various state
agencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate any
antitrust laws.

Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of the
state's electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companies
overcharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and 
early
2001.

Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand 
in
the state and the high price of natural gas.

The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generators
to refund the money to the state's utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generators
the benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate their
electricity prices or refund the money.

Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to a
spokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.

"Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of a
false claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award," Lockyer
said. "Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informant
could potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of 
dollars."

Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as "greedy 
profiteers"
and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place a
windfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state's
wholesale market.

Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for "greedy business
decisions of generators, marketers and utilities" adding that he will seek
criminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gouged
the wholesale electricity market.

"Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at the
expense of California pay back what they owe."
