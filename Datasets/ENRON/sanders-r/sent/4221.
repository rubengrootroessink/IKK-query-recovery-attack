		 Subject: Document Retention Policy

Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)
