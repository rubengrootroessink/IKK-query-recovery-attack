Richard and Gary - please let me know if you would like us to forward any 
pleadings.  I agree that the people at Enron should handle any press 
inquiries.

 I just got a call from Chris O'Brien at the San Jose Mercury News
(408) 920-5352.  Email cobrien@sjmercury.com.  He wants a copy of our
pleadings in the case against PX and to talk about it.  What do you want me
to do?  I told him that Enron had people responsible for press enquiry's and
I would pass his name and request along but I was not authorized to comment.

Thanks
Gary
