Richard, we have located charts prepared by someone at ECT indicating that
ECT held on to 11,750 units of the "B" NSM notes.  The Offering Memorandum
indicates that ECT was to purchase 12,210 units of the B notes.  Thus, it
appears that some 500 units were "sold." We would like to discuss the charts
with Travis or Kevin (during the visit to Houston - if not before).

Thanks.

Just a reminder -- As discussed during our conference call this past Friday,
we are hoping to receive from you a chart or other documentation reflecting
what ECT did with the "B" NSM Notes that were purchased.  Thanks.
