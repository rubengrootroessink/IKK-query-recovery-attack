Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?

I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
you about it.

Are you interested?
