I am in London this week for a series of meetings and an appeal to the House 
of Lords of the lawsuit that I was over here for in July(we won $130 USD) 
What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been 
traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, 
LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her 
impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling 
rivalries going

I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our 
participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job 
with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his 
financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are 
pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for 
District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a 
Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her 
chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was 
not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me 
on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she 
will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to 
have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with 
their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition 
at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen 
anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a 
firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told 
me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it 
Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?
