I would be shocked if these candidates even had fund-raisers at this point.=

Please let me know what you want to do about these uncontested raises.

I have requested $500 for Martha Hill Jamison.  My sources tell me that the=
=20
Republican activist groups (Steve Hotze) will be supporting Frank Gerald ov=
er=20
Martha Hill Jamison.  Perhaps we should hedge our bets on this race.  Let m=
e=20
know what you think.

There is another race that we have never talked about that I would like you=
=20
to consider.  Michael Stafford is the First Assistant to Michael Fleming, t=
he=20
County Attorney.  He is running for Johnny Holmes' office.  This may fall=
=20
under Joe Allen=01,s umbrella, but I think  there is a tremendous benefit t=
o=20
giving some money to Mike Stafford.  Steve Radack has informed me that he h=
as=20
the "downtown establishment" support.  If he wins, great.  If he loses, we=
=20
look good to Mike Fleming and to Mike Stafford.  I can personally attest th=
at=20
Stafford had tremendous influence of the County Attorneys=01, office.  This=
 may=20
come in handy at  a later date.  Again, I look to you for guidance.
