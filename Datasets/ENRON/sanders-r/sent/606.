		 Subject: ENA Legal Opinion

ENA has been asked to deliver a legal opinion which will be dated December 7, 
2000 in connection with its delivery of a ISDA Master Agreement.  Are you 
aware of any litigation or proceeding, threatened or ongoing, which would 
question the validity of the ISDA Master Agreement.  I ask this in connection 
with my opinion due diligence.
