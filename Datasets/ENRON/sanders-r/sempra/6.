Yesterday,=01; George McClellan called the guys looking for an unrecorded l=
ine.=01;=20
He talked to Les and inquired which side of his turret was unrecorded,=01;h=
e is=20
set up with his recorded line on his right.=01; Les went down to check his=
=20
system and George said he couldn't get dial tone.=01; He pushed his left bu=
tton=20
to demonstrate.=01; Les checked his cables and discovered they were swapped=
.=01;=20
George had been pushing his RIGHT BUTTON to get dial tone on his left hands=
et=20
and did not report the problem.=01; George inquired whether or not he was=
=20
recorded on the right handset as indicated by the red cap.=01; Les informed=
 him=20
that this was not the case because his=01;line cords were swapped.=01;=01;T=
he problem=20
has been corrected.=01;=01;=20
=01;
Normally, our system notifies=01;us of recorded channels that are inactive =
or=20
are in trouble.=01; Since this trader uses both handsets regularly, an alar=
m on=20
inactivity was not applicable.=01; We are not sure how long this problem ha=
s=20
existed.=01; His last=01; move was in September of 2000.=01; On all moves, =
all=20
handsets, and recorded channels are thoroughly tested.=01;=20
