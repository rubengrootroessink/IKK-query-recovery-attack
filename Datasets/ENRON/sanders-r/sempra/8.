Subject: RE: synfuel marketing info


I'm writing to follow up on my last email regarding synfuel sales.  We are
on a tight deadline and need to know or at least be aware of the field of
documents that Enron may have, by Tues., concerning synfuel sales.  We need
documents concerning:

1) our efforts to market or sell synfuel (term sheets, contracts, e-mail
conversations, etc.);

2) all parties with whom we've had contact regarding efforts to sell or
market synfuel, and specifically, documents that reveal customers or
potential customers; and

3) customers' permits for the use of synfuel.

I spoke with Matt, who told me that the seller is not responsible for
checking or maintaining customers' permits, so we should focus on #s 1 & 2
above.  We have a few emails and other documents that you have already
produced to us as part of your email dumps to us, so you don't need to
reproduce those, but it seems as though Sam Grossman and Scott Pack at
minimum may have responsive documents.  Any term sheets or documents
generated from specific dealings with them that you may have would also be
helpful.  On this point, would someone please give me Sam Grossman's and
Scott Pack's phone numbers so I can contact them about documents they may
have.

We will also need copies of these documents, by Friday if possible.

Thank you.
Aaron

With respect to plaintiffs' latest request for documents, did we take any
steps, create a plan, or attempt to market or sell Synthetic Fuel that was
to be produced by the Facilities?

Matt mentioned Sam Grossman's marketing materials, is there anything else
that we possess that may be construed as a plan or attempt to market or sell
synfuel?

Also, plaintiffs asked about documents relating to customers' permits for
the use of Synthetic Fuel.  Does a synfuel seller have to keep or otherwise
verify its customers' permits?

of course the answer is that we could have sold it in europe.  we should
have sam grossman send all of his marketing info  over -- i think we forgot
that.

Tony Bezanson is the guy who would have kept control of inventory etc at
Pier IX on our behalf.  I'm not sure who Blaine Pickens is.

Given the tenor of Sempra recent requests it seems they will try to hit us
on the synfuel marketing side - sort of we failed to perform because we
couldn't sell the stuff anyways.

George
