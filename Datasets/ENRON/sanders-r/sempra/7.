		 Subject: Sempra Litigation

We need to assign a commercial employee to the Sempra litigation.  I want to 
officially inform everyone in this group that no one from my group (Sales and 
Trading) are either assigned or spending any time thinking about Sempra.  I 
am personally not spending any time on it.  This being said, I am very 
concerned about the management of this case and have no feeling of who is 
running the show.  I believe unless things change, we are placing $23.5 MM at 
risk and a good deal of the problem is due to management of this case 
(including direction, strategy, decision making).  Sending flaming e-mails to 
a leaderless effort is not going to get us anywhere.

Maybe we should have a meeting and get our heads out of our ass.

KJM
