I authorize the retention of the audio tapes of George McClellan, Dan Reck, 
Matt Arnold, and Kevin McGowan from this day forward until we notify you that 
the need for the retention is no longer necessary.  I am aware that by 
retaining the audio tapes of these four individuals that this will result in 
the retainage of three call logger systems (360 recorded channels).

Jeff, I understand that this needs to be forwarded to Darren Adamik, Manager 
of IT Non-Development with your approval.

Thank you,
