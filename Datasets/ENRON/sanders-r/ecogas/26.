Richard:? 

It looks to us like Ecogas has a laydown contractual indemnity claim against 
GSF Energy LLC, under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of GSF, for any 
liability that Ecogas may incur in the Waste Management lawsuit (including 
attorneys fees).? We could file and serve a cross-complaint against GSF 
asserting this claim; alternatively, we could send a demand letter.? Either 
of these alternatives might set off Montauk.? We do not have to do anything 
right now in order to preserve the claim.

How should we proceed?
