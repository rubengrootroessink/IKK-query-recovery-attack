Lisa and Richard, we received a call from one of the Enron business guys regarding whether LLS was authorized to represent Enron in its possible of its interest in the Hurricane JV with Texaco (we represented Enron in the original transaction).  I understand that the two of you are who I need to talk to about this.  While I understand we are currently not on the bankruptcy-court approved list, is this something you might want us to get involved in?  Thanks.
Bill
