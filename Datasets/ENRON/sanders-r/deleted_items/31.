Do you guys need the discovery materials that are sitting in the conference room in the SF office?  Can they be refiled or disposed of?
Is there a law firm involved that can store these materials if they are still needed?

Parquet would like to move all the litigation boxes out of his conf room and can't reach Richard to see if that's ok (it's causing him heartburn with his business visitors).  I left Richard a message - if you see him, could you please inquire?  Thanks!
