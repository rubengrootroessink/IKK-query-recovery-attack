JJR and I are coming, and are bringing our wives.  My understanding is that
both SLR and RNR will be out of town.  I look forward to seeing you!  Whose
name is it under?  And is Steve Smith coming?

BTW, I had dinner with Judge Webster last week.  He was here to arbitrate
(as the neutral) a case between Duke and Exxon.  Charles Renfrew was Duke's
arbitrator-- apparently they use him in anything and everything.
