John Devine for County Attorney 

January 22, 2002 
FROM:       John Devine 
RE:     Tuesday, February 12, 2002 Fundraiser 
As your State District Court Judge, I worked hard for you and the citizens of Harris County since 1995.  Administering justice fairly and efficiently, and standing strong on the moral values our nation was founded on, has always been my priority.  I reduced the court's case backlog by more than 40 percent, was a leader in swift and fair disposition of cases, and earned the respect of many for my "Kids in Court" program.  As you know, whether on the bench or in the community, my commitment has always been for making Harris County safe place for honest law abiding citizens to work, live and raise a family, and that will continue to be my top priority as your Harris County Attorney. 
As your County Attorney, I pledge to continue to be the proven, principled and proactive leader I am known to be.  As the peoples' attorney, I will be your voice and advocate - protecting the law-abiding taxpayer and holding government accountable for its actions.  My commitment to these principles is unwavering. 
I respectfully ask you for your financial support at my upcoming fundraiser.  Your support of my campaign is important and much appreciated.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713-681-1996 or via fax at 713-681-8402.
