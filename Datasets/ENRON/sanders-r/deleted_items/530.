Sharon, I think it works best for only one of us to respond to these data requests.  Would you mind taking that role?  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle,

It looks like my contacts have added more than one addition to our list of

possible Enron employees.  I am forwarding on this complete list w/ 25 more

possible employees to search.  Can you let us know if these people were

Enron employees and their dates of employment?   Sorry, I didn't send this

list with the request yesterday, but it was not generated at the time of

the request.

Thank you,

Kevin Kosub
