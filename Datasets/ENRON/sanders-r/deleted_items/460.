Do we care about this?  I don't imagine we do but I thought I'd run it by you. Thanks.

Gail,

One of Dechert's transactional lawyers has been asked to represent Kaiser
Aluminum in a derivatives transaction in which Enron Metals is on the other
side.  We do not believe that this would impair in any way our ability to
represent Enron and its other subsidiaries in the York matter.  I wanted,
however, to bring it to your attention in case you have any concerns.
Please let me know that this is ok.  Thanks, and sorry to bring this up at
such a busy time for you.

Bob
