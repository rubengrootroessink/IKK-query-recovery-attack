Folks: I am sending at Howard's request.  The Search Subcommittee (Rich
Stevens, Howard, and myself) has performed the initial screening, and
concluded that Coffman, Jermaine, and Robert Mosier deserve your serious
attention on Friday after the weekly OCPC meeting.  Shirmoammadi, Rodriguez,
and Pope did not make the cut.
The plan is to conclude the OCPC meeting no later than 12:00 Friday, take a
short 30 minute break to get organized and allow telephone attendees to get
a quick bite to eat, and resume at 12:30 with three quick-hitting,
action-packed 45 minute interviews of Coffman, Jermaine, and Mosier.  I am
attaching a scoring template to aid your note-taking and deliberations.  It
is our intention to make a decision on Friday afternoon that will result in
a firm offer going out.
Mosier was a late entrant, and his resume is available for your inspection
at his work-out company website www.mosierco.com.  Mosier may be on travel
on Friday, necessitating a call-in to the Committee.
The Search Subcommittee would be grateful if you could arrange your schedule
on Friday afternoon to permit your active participation in the interviews
and deliberations.
Marc: could you have your staff set-up and reserve a second conference call
beginning at 12:30?  Thanks- jim crossen, APX
