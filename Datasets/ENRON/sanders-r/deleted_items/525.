Thanks very much Paul. If AA request anything other than deal documentation, please let me know.

Subject:	RE: DOCUMENTATION RELEASE TO AA

We have now set up a formal data room for processing/logging documents that AA want to view, in NE5016. As well as the documents that my team has produced, the data  room also contains the transaction bibles from Legal, Tax and Global Finance handed to Liisa Mulbrecht over the last two weeks. The room is locked and access is via my team only. 
We are in the process of completing the log of what is in the room, which will include any requests that AA make to view, copy etc any of the documents in the room 

Regards
Paul

Subject:	DOCUMENTATION RELEASE TO AA


Please note that we are currently formulating an approach to releasing documentation to Arthur Andersen.

At the moment the process is:

- Melissa will ask AA to route document requests thru Paul Jones. 

- Only deal documentation will be released, not internal files etc. until further clarification is obtained from Houston.

- Paul will keep a log of what is produced to AA.

- AA will be permitted to copy what is produced to them.

- Paul may have to call Melissa and /or individual lawyers, if he is not able to satisfy AA's documentation requests. Please log anything you make available to AA. Again, deal docs only for the time being. 

Thanks
