Thought you could use some good news--The DR gov't paid us!!  So we don't have to sue them for the time being.  we have a our Request for arbitration ready but are not incurring any more bills for the time being.

Jim/Stan,
I wanted to let you know that the DR team was able to get payment of $8.9 million from the CDE.  While we are still awaiting conversion of approximately $2.3 million (from Pesos) to clear to our account, the funds are out of the control of the CDE and are 'good'.  Based on the state of affairs today, we will be able to pay the lenders their approximately $12.3 million of principal and interest by tomorrow afternoon; the payment due date is Monday.

The local DR team, lead by Otto, did a superb job under very adverse circumstances.  Congratulations and thanks for a great effort.

Mariella
