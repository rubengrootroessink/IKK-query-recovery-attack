I spoke to the head of origination to make sure he was alerted to Stu Zisman
in case the resume comes in form another a source.  Gave a good reference,
the background story.  Mark is interested.  Have Stu send me his details to
my email: jebeling@tractebelusa.com and I will see that it gets to where it
needs to be.
