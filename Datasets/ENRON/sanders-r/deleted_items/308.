	Attached is a list of the domestic cases pending against Enron entities that do not name Enron Corp or ENA. There are numerous cases involving India that name DPC as the defendant. These matters are either pending in India or the UK.  I am not aware of Enron Corp. being named in any of these but I will double check. There are also several cases I am handling in the Philippines that involve Enron entities but none of them name Enron Corp. Finally, there is a NEPCO arbitration pending in the UK.  Finally, there are several EES cases that I need to talk to Bob about.  I'll get you these tomorrow. 
	Please note that the Friedman case is set for trial in February.  I have asked Mark Wawro for a budget. 
	There are also a number of disputes that haven't quite ripened into lawsuits. Let me know if you need any info on those.
