Yesterday, George Caplan and I attended a hearing before Judge Kuhl on the
Committee's ex parte application shortening time to hear its motion to
enforce the stipulation with the state regarding rejection of the claims
before the VCB.

After hearing brief argument, the Judge made it very clear that the State
needed to sign the stipulation.  In fact, the Judge waited around all day
until the State signed a stipulation (which will be submitted to the VCB
shortly) whereby the State agreed that the consolidated claims pending
before the VCB should be summarily rejected as unduly complex and that all
administrative remedies regarding the inverse condemnation claims on the
commandeered contracts have been exhausted.

The Judge, however, was reluctant to enter our proposed order (which
declared that the VCB proceedings were moot and that the parties no longer
needed to participate in those proceedings).

Please call if you have any questions
