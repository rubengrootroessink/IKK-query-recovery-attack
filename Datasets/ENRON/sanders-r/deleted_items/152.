Dear Kidventure Families,

Join us tonight, Thursday, October 25th for Operation Hope, sponsored by Enron.  Join experts to develop a blueprint for adapting to these challenging times. Enron?s Hope offers participants ways to deal with September 11th and the ongoing issues we face as a nation.  Panelists will cover attendees concerns about issues at home and at work.
     Attendees will select one of four concurrent panels (town-hall meeting style) while children (kindergarten-8th grade) participate in imaginative, helpful and dynamic classes. A licensed therapist and staff members representing Kidventure Camps, Bo?s Place and A.D. Players Theater Academy will lead the KIDS Classes. Children will be with their peers as they engage in innovative, team building activities. High school students will meet with a panel that includes an athlete, a motivational speakers and a security expert.
   Business, religious and healthcare leaders will answer questions from Enron OperationHope.com?s website and the attendees. When the sessions end, everyone will meet for a closing ceremony led by singer, author and motivational speaker Willie Jolley. Participants will leave with a renewed sense of confidence and hope and direction.  The event is FREE to the public.  To make your reservations, log on to www.enronoperationhope.com.

We hope to see you there.
