Howard Weg is setting up a meeting next week to negotiate a resolution of PX's claim against Edison.  The claim is for something north of $900 million.  Edison indicated that, barring settlement, it would just pay the full amount to PX.  If refunds are ordered by FERC or if Edison otherwise successfully pursues claims against participants, it will just look to the participants to pay.  Edison is willing to particpate in discussions aimed at settling the FERC issues and possibly providing funding for the post-reorganization PX (although, if deals are cut with Edison and PG & E, is there anything for the PX to do?).  Enron is on the Edison subcommittee in the PX case.  Edison wants company representatives available for next week's meeting either on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Do we want to participate and, if so, who will either attend or be available on the telephone from Enron?
