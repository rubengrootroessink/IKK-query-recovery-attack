Don't forget!!  The Monthly BikeHouston Meeting is at 7 PM, Tuesday, November 27, 2001, at the Houston Environmental Center, 3015 Richmond at Eastside.  Call Dan at 713.652.2555 for more information. 

This will be an important meeting!  We have invited City of Houston representatives to talk to us about the Memorial Park Picnic Loop and the Braes Bayou Trail closure.  Come learn what we can do to save the Picnic Loop from being replaced with tennis courts proposed for relocation to make way for the Shell Houston Open golf tournament in Memorial Park.  Find out how we plan to go about getting a signed, marked detour around the Braes Trail closure, which will remain in effect until the Metro Light Rail construction is completed.   

Come and participate in bicycling advocacy!  Meet other people interested in safe cycling in the Houston area.  Get involved in BikeHouston!! 

Please RSVP to Jackie Freedman,
