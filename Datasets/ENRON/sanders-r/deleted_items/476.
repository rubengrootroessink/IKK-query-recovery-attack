Richard -

I have a small contract matter involving Enron Credit that requires a settlement agreement.

Basically, EC orally agreed to have a third party develop and host a website that would provide the EC information to site subscribers.  These subscribers might also be subscribers to other products promoted by the third party.  The written agreement backing up the oral agreement was due to be finalized on Friday of last week, but, as you can imagine was not actually signed.

As EC is not pursuing its business at this time, it has asked to terminate the relationship with this third party - a termination that will cost $96K.

I have been asked to do a settlement agreement and was wondering if there is any particular form that Enron uses or that you may have for this type of deal.  It is rather simple in nature, but we do want to make sure that all necessary release language is included.

Thanks.

Mark
