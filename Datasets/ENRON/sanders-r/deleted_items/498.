follow up on the conversation we had on the flight to Portland about the di=
fficulty of finding satisfactory counsel in New York for that IP litigation=

NY attorneys I have encountered, Jim has actually been in trial and does we=

ctions are in the NY area, or you are doing interviews for counsel anywhere=
, he would do a good job for you. I suspect he would go into shock if he kn=
