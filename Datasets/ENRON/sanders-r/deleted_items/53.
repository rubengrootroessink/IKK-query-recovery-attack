Mike Day believes that SCE might agree to a new Stipulation in which they commit to pay our claim if their new deal and their pending Advice Letter are approved by the CPUC.  I have scheduled a call for tomorrow at 12:30 CST to discuss the terms we would like to see in the Stipulation (e.g., drop approval of the Advice Letter as a condition, payment within 10 days after CPUC approval, agreement on the number set forth in our response to their Data Request, agreement to apply accrued negative CTC credits to current T&D charges, to name a few).   On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.
