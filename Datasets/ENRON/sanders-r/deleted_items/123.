Steve,

I have confirmed the mediation and arbitration dates for the Vinmar matter that we discussed last Friday and yesterday.  The mediation will take place on Tuesday, November 6.  I will send you another e-mail with the exact time and location.  If the mediation is not successful,  the arbitration with take place in Houston on Tuesday, December 18 (with a carryover day to December 19, if necessary). 

Thanks.
