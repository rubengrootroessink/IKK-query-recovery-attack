If I could "expand" a bit on Michael's outline for the Agenda, I would
specifically include the following for discussion items at the beginning of
the call:

1.  Plan progress
2.  Status of budget analysis and creating revised realistic budget
     i.  Reduction of operating expenses/ legal expenses; provide break
down of legal       expenses on PX's budget.
     ii.  Status of IT and staffing analysis
3.  Controlling professional fees at committee and debtor level.  For
committee professionals:
     i.  Provide summary of professional tasks to be performed (committee
and       subcommittee oversight necessary for approving and expanding
tasks)
     ii.  Provide list of professionals who will perform tasks (committee
oversight           necessary for expanding list of professionals)
     iii. Provide estimated budget for tasks (committee oversight necessary
for       exceeding budget and reporting of budget to committee)

Howard:

I understand that Lisa expressed our concerns about the Case's progress
yesterday.   Enron would ask that we have an agenda circulated prior to the
call which in addition to the previous items encompasses two items:

1. Progress on submitting a Plan
2. Controlling and directing professional resources (expenses)


Regards,



Michael
