Peter Mims called this a.m.. He reviewed the documents we sent yesterday and seemed pleased.  We wants more detail on the specific section pertaining to "clearing" of orders. 

I spoke with Leonardo Pacheco who suggested we meet with Kevin Montagne (he reports directly to Jay Webb and is the Sr. Director in charge of IT E-Commerce.)

I've left a voice mail to get on his calendar on Monday for a meeting with Peter and Bill.  Do you want to attend if I get time with him?

Thanks.
