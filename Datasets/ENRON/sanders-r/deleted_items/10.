Dear Kidventure Families,

In response to many requests, we have made all Weekend Safari trips open to families and not just kids.  The next expedition is Canoe and Camp November 9-11 at Cado Lake State Park.

On this expedition, adventurers will be instructed in canoeing safety and technique. Then it's off to explore for two days in one of the most beautiful sprawling mazes of bayou and slough.  This is a great family outing you don't want to miss.

Register now by logging on to www.kidventurecamp.com
or call us at 713.960.8989.  Coming soon: The all new Kidventure Web Site and Priority Registration for Summer Safari at Mo-Ranch 2002!
