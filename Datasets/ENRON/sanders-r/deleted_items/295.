In order to answer your question, a very complicated analysis needs to be p=
erformed. One of the questions that needs to be addressed is who owns the p=
roceeds of the insurance policy.  Are the D&O's entitled to the proceeds or=
 are the proceeds part of the bankruptcy estate?  Another question that nee=
ds to be looked into is the nature and scope of the coverages available.  Y=
et another consideration is competing claims against the policy.  The AEGIS=
 form for the first 35 million is very sophisticated and the endorsements n=
eed to be fully understood.  The next step in the analysis is the excess wh=
ich is not fully follow form. Jim Bouillion and  I have scheduled an all da=
y meeting with Gary Cooney (Vice Chairman of MSW) on Tuesday to discuss D &=
 O cover. This is the first time that Mr. Cooney can come to Houston.  Afte=
r this meeting, I hope to be in a position to identify issues for your cons=
ideration.  If any of you would like to attend this meeting, please advise.=
   If you would like to discuss any of these issues with me over the weeken=
d, my home number is 713 721-7676.  I will be in the office early on Monday=
 morning.  My extension is 37535.
