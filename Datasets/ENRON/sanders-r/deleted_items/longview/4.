Subject: RE: Longview 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 
REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE 
  
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success 
assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is 
depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
which McCook have forced on us. 
  
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent 
to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation 
dept). Thank you.
