Sheryl: I think I mentioned to those on the call that the Dec 27 call would
be a placeholder for a meeting just in case we need to have a discussion
regarding the PGE plan, FERC developments or the PX plan, all of which will
probably have developments over the next few days.  Noone, including me,
wants to spend any more time than is necessary in meetings, at this time of
the year or any other time.  Therefore, I propose to leave the scheduled
call for 12/27 in place for the moment, with the hope that we can cancel it
or limit it to a short call.  I am pleased to note that our calls have
gotten shorter, and we have scheduled separate calls from time to time to
discuss individual topics when necessary.

I too want the subcommittees to address the more detailed issues and to
bring issues to the full committee as appropriate.  In many instances, this
is what is happening.  However, as you know, the members of the full
committee often want to discuss topics in detail and I try to give everyone
an opportunity to voice their views, while at the same time trying to move
things along.  I am sure that everyone is busy and brings up items to
discuss during the committee meetings only when they think they are
important enough to take up the time of the full committee.  We all owe that
to each other.

At our next meeting, I will propose to schedule the regular calls two weeks
apart, with the understanding that we can schedule more frequent meetings
when necessary.  Thanks for the suggestion.
