THE RULES OF BEDROOM GOLF 
1. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play - normally 1club 
and 2 balls. 
2. Play on a course must be approved by the owner of the hole. 
3. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and 
keep the balls out. 
4. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course 
owners are permitted to check shaft 
stiffness before play begins. 
5. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid 
damage to the hole. 
6. The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until 
the course owner is satisfied that play 
is complete. Failure to do so may result in being denied permission to 
play the course again. 
7. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon 
arrival at the course. The experienced 
player will normally take time to admire the entire course with special 
attention to well formed bunkers. 
8. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played, 
or are currently playing, to the owner 
of the course being played. Upset course owners have been known to 
damage players equipment for this 
reason. 
9. Players are encouraged to bring proper rain gear for their own 
protection. 
10.Players should ensure themselves that their match has been properly 
scheduled, particularly when a new 
course is being played for the first time. Previous players have been 
known to become irate if they discover 
someone else playing on what they considered to be a private course. 
11.Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times. 
Some players may be embarrassed if 
they find the course to be temporarily under repair. Players are advised 
to be extremely tactful in this 
situation. More advanced players will find alternative means of play 
when this is the case. 
12.The course owner is responsible for manicuring and pruning any bush 
around the hole to allow for 
improved viewing of, alignment with, and approach to the hole. 
13.Players are advised to obtain the course owners permission before 
attempting to play the back nine. 
14.Slow play is encouraged. However, players should be prepared to 
proceed at a quicker pace, at least 
temporarily, at the course owners request. 
15.It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play 
the same hole several times in one 
match. 
Virginity can be cured.
