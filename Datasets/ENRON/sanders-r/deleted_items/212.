 BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE ENRON BROADBAND SERVICES-MICROSOFT DEAL, MSN   
WILL HAVE TO TEMPORARILY LIMIT DELIVERY OF ITS NEW HIGH-SPEED INTERNET SERVICES 
TO THE 14 STATES COVERED BY QWEST COMMUNICATIONS INTERNATIONAL INC. (Q), SAID   
BOB VISSE, DIRECTOR OF MSN MARKETING.                                           
   THOSE 14 STATES ARE ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO, COLORADO, WYOMING, IDAHO, IOWA,     
MINNESOTA, SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA, NEBRASKA, OREGON, UTAH AND      
WASHINGTON.                                                                     
   THE ENRON DEAL WAS TO PROVIDE BACKBONE SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE QWEST AREA,   
VISSE SAID. BACKBONES PROVIDE LONGHAUL SERVICES THAT CONNECT SMALLER AREAS OF   
NETWORKS.                                                                       
   AN ANALYST, WHO DIDN'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED, EXPRESSED SHOCK WHEN TOLD THAT 
THE DISAGREEMENT WOULD LIMIT THE NEW MSN BROADBAND SERVICES TO THE 14-STATE     
QWEST REGION. THAT CALLS INTO QUESTION THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ENTIRE ENRON      
BROADBAND NETWORK, HE SAID.                                                     
                                                                          (CONT)
   MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY BACKBONE SERVICES AND MSN 
WILL FIND ONE, MSN'S VISSE SAID.                                                
   THE NEW SERVICE WAS JUST LAUNCHED THURSDAY SO THERE WEREN'T EXISTING         
CUSTOMERS IN THE AREAS OUTSIDE THE QWEST REGION, HE SAID.                       
   VISSE WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE LAWSUIT FILED BY ENRON BECAUSE MICROSOFT HASN'T
REVIEWED IT IN DETAIL. COMMENTING WOULD VIOLATE THE NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT     
MICROSOFT HAS WITH ENRON, HE ADDED.                                             
   "WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE FULLY UPHELD THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT," HE SAID.    
   MICROSOFT HASN'T FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ENRON RELATING TO THE DEAL, HE      
ADDED. HE WOULDN'T COMMENT ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A SUIT.                   
   IN RECENT TRADING, SHARES OF ENRON WERE DOWN 66 CENTS, OR 4.04%, TO $15.69.  
SHARES OF MICROSOFT WERE OFF 15 CENTS, OR 0.25%, AT $62.63.
