I am working with Richard Sanders and Jay Webb in defending EnronOnlline in a lawsuit based on alleged patent infringement.  As part of our preparation for this case, we need to obtain a copy of all promotional materials related to E-Online.  I understand there is a "client packet", and I assume we had press releases and other materials.

I have printed everything in the Press Release section from the website.

Can you direct me to the appropriate person to obtain these materials?

Thanks for your assistance.
