Michelle thanks, from the logistics point of view I would recommend to do Guatemala,fly to Nicaragua as it's a short 30 min. flight.
From there Panama City is about 1hr.15min.
The next  jump would be  to Venezuela where VENGAS and ACCRO (30 min from Caracas) where you could do a direct flight home back to Houston.
That would be my recommendation.
I will be checking with Guatemala on the  November date.
Rgds, Teo

I'm thinking the week of November 5-7 because I thought I would be in Toronto and now I don't have to go.  I'd like to do Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela in one big trip.  Help me with logistics here.  I know there are a couple of places in Venezuela, but where else did you need me and are we trying to combine any of these offices?
