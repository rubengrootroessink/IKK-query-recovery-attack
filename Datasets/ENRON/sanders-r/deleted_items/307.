Richard, following up on my voice mail of yesterday evening, I am
responsible for putting together the application that will be filed with
the court regarding retention of Weil Gotshal.  In connection therewith, we
must disclose to the court all potential conflicts between parties in
interest that are adverse to Enron who may also be clients of the Firm.

In that regard, I need the following information:

1.  A list of secured creditors of the potential debtor entities, broken
down by entity

2.  A list of landlords for each entity

3.  A list of outside law firms who perform significant work on behalf of
the potential debtors (broken down by entitiy, if possible).  I'll leave it
to your judgment what constitutes "significant."  We clearly don't want to
have to run through our conflicts system each and every law firm that you
employ.  I think the best way to draw the line would be law firms to which
you routinely pay more than $___ per month.  It may be that this number is
$50,000 or $100,000 or more.

4.  A current list of officers and directors for Enron Corp. (I have lists
for the other entities from another source).

5.  We have a list of 160 banks that are lenders to various of the Enron
entities.  Can you easily identify banks as to which the only relationship
is that Corp. has guaranteed an obligation of a non-debtor subsidiary?  If
so, that would be helpful information to have.
