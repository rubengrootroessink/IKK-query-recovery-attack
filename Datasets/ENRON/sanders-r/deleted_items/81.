Brad Richter made arrangements for Leonardo Pacheco to assist us in collecting information re: EnronOnline for the VE lawyers.  Leonardo has been with EnronOnline since its inception, and can be very helpful in locating materials from our files.  He is not, however, a key technical or commercial person; he's just a contact at EnronOnline that is able to retrieve and print materials.
