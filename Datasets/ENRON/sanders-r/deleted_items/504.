Please see the attached.  I can hardly believe Lehman would have responded in the manner stated but if they did I believe we should advise Lehman that all inquiries should be directed to Scott Josey.  Your thoughts?

I met with Gary Guidry (VP-International) of Alberta Energy (AEC) in late
September at his request to discuss AEC's plans for expansion into the Gulf
of Mexico. After reviewing Gwen Morgan's overall vision for AEC to become a
global energy concern,
Guidry indicated that AEC had decided to set up a platform in the US Gulf of
Mexico to pursue the deepwater play and serve as
an operating hub for further expansion into other offshore areas worldwide.
AEC's activities to date have been handled by two
technical teams in Houston who normally cover other parts of the world. In
addition to grassroots exploration/exploitation (eg. recent Green Canyon
farm-in deal with Conoco), AEC has conducted an active program to evaluate
M/A opportunities in the Gulf over the past few months.

Based on the goals outlined by Guidry and Mariner's status as a merchant
investment within Enron, I indicated that Mariner Energy might be a perfect
fit for AEC. Pursuant to a conversation with Kelly in early October,  I knew
that I could not give  any advice on
Mariner, so I encouraged him to review the Mariner record and seek feedback
from industry sources on Mariner's reputation.  I
later learned that AEC had initiated direct contact with Mariner and was
pursuing an evaluation of the Company through normal channels.

Guidry called me Tuesday evening to express concern over recent feedback
from Lehman on this matter.  I believe he was calling me as a Mariner Board
member because he could not establish direct contact with appropriate Enron
personnel and was hopeful that I could pass along a message.  Guidry
received a message from Lehman Tuesday saying that the Enron contact (Tim
Detmering) and his boss couldn't consider a sale at this time because it
would result in a book value loss and potentially further erode investor
confidence in Enron.

Given the mixed signals concerning the possible sale of the company and
Guidry's inability to speak directly with an Enron contact, Guidry is
concerned that the feedback through Lehman may have been somehow distorted.
Since I am unaware of Enron's goal for Mariner , I told him I would try to
contact you to verify he was getting the straight scoop from Lehman on
the Enron position.  Guidry's office number is 403/266-8111.
