	On Friday, I talked with Derick Smith at AA about the status of my international cases for reporting purposes.  I mentioned that I was working on other non-international cases and he said that he didn't do the "domestic" stuff.  Is there anybody I need to talk to or anything I need to do vis-avis AA/ reporting in connection with my non-international stuff?  To the extent that Costilla and York are new matters and Sempra is set for trial in November, they come to mind.
