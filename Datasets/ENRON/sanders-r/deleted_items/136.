Richard Sanders' assistant, Twanda, is trying to set up a meeting with outside counsel to discuss congestion in ERCOT -- please respond if certain times are best for you before the end of the week, and/or early next week.  

Additionally, please ask someone in your group to get us examples prior to such meeting of what is submitted to ERCOT in connection with (1) scheduling load represented by EPMI acting as QSE, and (2) scheduling in relation to congestion occurring between zones.  I presume this would be hard copies of what appears on the computer screen and is transmitted to ERCOT at each of point in the day that scheduling activities are being effected by EPMI as QSE -- day-ahead, day-of and real time.
