As I understand it a committee meeting has been scheduled for 12/27.
What is the agenda for this meeting?  I would like to see if we can
start having committee meetings less frequently than once a week.  The
time spent at weekly meetings does not seem necessary and could perhaps
be handled in biweekly meetings with more subcommittee meetings to cover
specific issues that can subsequently be raised with the entire
committee.  In addition, the meeting currently scheduled for 12/27 is
during a time at which many of us will be on vacation and not able to
participate.  If there is something urgent, can we handle it this week
or, if not, can it wait until the first week of January?  I would like
to hear other members thoughts on the frequency of the meetings.  Sheryl
