I gather that Bob will be spending most of his time on the securities litigation.  Is it still possible to get a litigation manager to  handle EES matters.  I would hope we could use one of the EWS litigators, as we discussed earlier.  Having someone on the floor would be a definite plus as well. I had talked to Andy but  never finalized because of the crisis situation we are in.  My main concern is that the EES business not be allocated among numerous litigators so that we do have accountability  or take a back seat to other assignments.  Thanks.
