I have talked with Ken Krissa and have placed a couple of calls to Jesus.  In short, there is no conference call set for today; however, Jesus has brought back with him (from Cresendo's offices) copies of all the correspondence between Cresendo and Rocky Mountain Helium.  These documents also contain an opinion letter from Cresendo's outside counsel, Bill Ward, at Pruitt, Gushee and Bachtell.  I've also learned that ENA owns about 85-90% of Cresendo with the remainder being owned by NG Resources (a BCCK Engineering entity) and Cresendo Energy Partners.  Cresendo Energy Partners is owned by Ken Krissa and another guy and is the managing member of the LLC.  I'm getting a copy of the LLC agreeemnt .
I'll keep you posted.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
