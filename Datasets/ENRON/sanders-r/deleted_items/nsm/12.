Gentlemen,

Steve asked that I forward the attached updated versions of Hellmold's rough
transcript.  I've bolded what appears to be the only two annotations made by
Steve and they are in the 6/13/01 transcript.

Sincerely,

Nancy O'Brien
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ................................................
