	I know you're busy and there is no urgency needed in your response; however, when you get a minute, please let me know what additional litigation/dispute matters, if any, NEPCO is involved in other than:

	FKPCL v. NEPCO,
	Payne Creek,
	Foster Wheeler, and 
	Oklahoma EHS.

	To the extent that NEPCO has hired or is seriously considering hiring an outside litigator, I'd consider that to be disclosable.  Thanks in advance.
