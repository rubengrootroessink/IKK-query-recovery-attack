I have received a notice of arbitration from HoustonStreet related to Enron Net Works' termination of the Posting Agreement several months ago.  The notice of arbitration specifies damages "in excess of $5 million."  The notice (dated November 1) has been sitting in my office on the 8th floor and I just found it tonight as I was going through my mail.  I don't think that there is anything here that would have an MAE on Enron, but I clearly would have preferred to have known about this before the merger agreement was signed up.  Richard, I'll catch up with you on Monday with the demand for arbitration.
