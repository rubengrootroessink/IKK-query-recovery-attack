I am very happy to have you involved to the extent you want to be.  I asked Steve Elliott to be the corporate rep for the arbitration because Richard Sanders did not expect that you would want to take that much time for such a modest matter in terms of potential recovery ($90,000-145,000). 

Currently, we have the following scheduled:

Th, Oct. 25	Deposition of Tim Clifford	(If there are any questions, issues you would specifically like for me to discuss with Tim, please let me know)

Fr, Nov. 2	Hearing on Motion to Compel and for Sanctions	This hearing is expected to last 1-2 hours and relates to the issue of production of tape recordings related to conversations between you or Steve and Tim Clifford  during December 1999.  I expect that Richard Sanders and I will attend this hearing.

Tu, Nov. 6	Mediation			This mediation will take the better part of a day.  I need a corporate representative in attendance who is able to make decisions re settlement, and who can speak to issues such as custom and standards in the industry, that deals are routinely made with credit finalized later, etc.  Steve is available to attend that day, but if you'd prefer that would certainly be okay with me.  I anticipate that Vinmar will have a its lawyers and a corporate representative from Vinmar.  I doubt that Tim Clifford will be there since he is no longer with the company.  If we decide to have Steve present, perhaps we can arrange a short meeting prior to the mediation to discuss strategy and settlement authority.

Tu/We, Dec. 18-19	Arbitration		If the matter is not settled at mediation, the arbitration will take place on Dec. 18 and carry over to Dec. 19, if necessary.  I will need a corporate representative there the entire time.  Steve is available to act as corporate representative, but let me know if you'd prefer to do so.  If you are not available for the entire time period, it would be helpful to have you available for a couple of hours to give your testimony re the making of the contract in person; however, I can use your deposition testimony if you are not available.  I have confirmed that Debbie Brackett will be available to give her testimony at the arbitration hearing.

Please let me know if you have any other questions/comments re this matter.  Thanks.

Bonnie, I think I need to stay involved in this case as I did the deal and have given a deposition. Is there any reason you do not want me involved?
