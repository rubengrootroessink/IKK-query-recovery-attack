Danielle,

Thank you for the invitation to discuss scheduling activities for the month of August. As I am sure you are aware this company is undergoing a significant period of turmoil. It would therefore be of great help if you could send a list of specific questions so that we may be able to answer them directly.

If it would aid your understanding of our activity, we have full requirement obligations in both the North and South zones that were to ramp up starting in July. This load was to reach in excess of 100 MW by September. However, the speed of switching and the location of this load were not known. In addition, we have resources off 2 power plants, both located in the South. One of these plants is consistently subjected to various types of command and control dispatch by the ISO and we are obligated to find a market for any residual energy. 

I trust this paints a picture of what we do and can help clarify any questions you may have. At this time, I do not feel we are in a position to comment on the actions of other QSEs as any information we have would be purely anecdotal.

I trust all is well,

Doug Gilbert-Smith
Director, Ercot Trading
