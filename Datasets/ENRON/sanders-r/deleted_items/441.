Wrap It Up with SNAP

SNAP's volunteer elves will again be taking over bookstores near you just in
time for the holidays!  Barnes and & Noble Stores as well as Borders Books
provide the paper.  We provide the smiles and paper cuts!  (Not too many
paper cuts!)  Here we go again, wrapping gifts for holiday shoppers at
selected locations all over Houston.

Calling all hands as all shifts are open to wrap gifts for tips!  And do we
mean tips!  Past experiences have earned SNAP as much as $1000 in a single
weekend at one store.  Three to four hour shifts ensure that this volunteer
opportunity won't spoil your holiday cheer.  In addition, volunteers will
receive a FREE "We Wrap for Tips" t-shirt!  
 
For store locations and times & to sign-up online go to
www.snaptx.org/volunteer/giftwrapping

If wrapping is not your "bag" then you can help by donating bows and
ribbons.  The prettier the packages...the better the tips!!  Just drop them
off at the Wellness Clinic and we will make those presents beautiful for the
animals!
