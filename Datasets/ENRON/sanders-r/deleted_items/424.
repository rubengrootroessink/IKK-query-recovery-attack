We need to talk about the XMAS thing this year...as well as scheduling our
Perd clean-up that was postponed to 2002.

Does anyone have suggestions on XMAS giving.  Since last year we bought the
playscape, I didn't know if we wanted to try to do something at the Perd
again.  It is obvious to most that the Perd is getting that runned down look
and needs some tendor loving care and some updating.  But where to start is
the question I am asking.  But does this have to do with XMAS.

Please book the weekend of January 25th for the Perd Clean-Up...no kids.
Ryan, I think, is the only one old enough to truely help out if he wants to.
Also, be sure to bring the family big car...so we can haul off things to
dispose of.

We will also need to paint.  At least the bathrooms downstairs.

Mom, you will need to decide on what dollar amount you intend to spend this
year on maintenance.  And then we can decide on the rest.

Besides the XMAS thing...these are the "wants and needs" of the Perd;

1)  Siding replaced
2) Road to the Water bulldozed
3)  Freshen Up the furniture....in the main room.  New couches...or other
things
4) Cement in a sports court with basketball hoop to replace the garden area

Ideas for XMAS...anyone...anyone.  One idea, for ease sake, would be giving
each cousin a gift certificate...to say Barnes and Noble...for that child to
spend as he/she would like.  A denomination of $25...which would be $65.00
per family.  I would be glad to buy, collect and send out.  This is just an
idea.

Looking forward to comments and soon.
