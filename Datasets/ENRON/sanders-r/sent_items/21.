Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
 
I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
 
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.
 
Paul Johnson
