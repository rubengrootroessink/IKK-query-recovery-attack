Thank you for submitting an order through iBuyit eProcurement.  Unfortunately, the system was not able to determine who should approve your request.

Please route this document to the person who generally approves your expenditures and have them send an email to Enron IT Purchasing denoting the approval.

To facilitate the communication, attached you will see the list of items you ordered.

 

Thank you,

For future orders, we can update the workflow table to route directly to the approver if you provide the approvers' names.
