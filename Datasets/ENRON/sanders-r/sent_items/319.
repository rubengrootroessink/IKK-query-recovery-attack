The Rio Piedras Explosion Litigation note needs to be updated. My suggested=
 note follows with deletions being noted by "***" and additions noted in bo=
ld.  Please let me know if you have any questions are comments.

____________=20

On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in *** the Humberto Vidal Build=
ing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily =
injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Juan Gas =
Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air di=
stribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the build=
ing. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were=
 named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puert=
o Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath C=
onsultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers,=
 in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puer=
to Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for=
 wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage=
 allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without determi=
ning the cause of the explosion, all parties *** agreed not to litigate fur=
ther that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to de=
termine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and=
, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants ***=
 agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have bee=
n settled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trail in =
the United States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001. No cases h=
ave yet been scheduled for trail in the Superior Court. Although no assuran=
ces can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matt=
ers will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or re=
sults of operations.=20

3. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES=20
Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of=
 which are discussed below. Although no assurances can be given, Enron beli=
eves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate res=
erves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such item=
s, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impac=
t on Enron's financial position or results of operations.=20
Litigation. In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris =
County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intr=
atex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, t=
he Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron. =
The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas pur=
chase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated. Early in 1996=
, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherw=
ise resolved) separately. In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that =
the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in con=
nection with the "Panhandle program," a special marketing program establish=
ed in the early 1980s. This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in =
a verdict for the Enron Defendants. In the second matter, the Plaintiffs al=
lege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and c=
ertain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratabl=
y with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988. The tri=
al court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims. On Mar=
ch 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class cert=
ification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court. The Enron =
Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmativ=
e defenses, including the statute of limitations. The Enron Defendants beli=
eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=
sly contest the claims. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes=
 that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adv=
erse effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal=
 Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The explosion resulted in fatalities, b=
odily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property. San Jua=
n Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/=
air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the=
 building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carrier=
s were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The=
 Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, H=
eath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance car=
riers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District o=
f Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damag=
es for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property =
damage allegedly caused by the explosion. After nearly four years without d=
etermining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litig=
ate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trial=
s to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explos=
ion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defenda=
nts have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims =
have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that=
 the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse =
effect on its financial position or results of operations.=20
Trojan Investment Recovery. In early 1993, Portland General Electric (PGE) =
ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility=
. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a genera=
l rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining inv=
estment in Trojan.=20
The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigat=
ion in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appea=
ls and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to th=
e OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens =
Utility Board (CUB).=20
In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff of t=
he OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investmen=
t in the Trojan plant. Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw fro=
m the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the =
Trojan litigation. The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements=
 of the settlement on September 29, 2000. As a result of these approvals, P=
GE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to custome=
rs, either through a return on or a return of that investment. Collection o=
f ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement=
 agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order. With the CUB's withdrawal=
, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation.=
 The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC orde=
r allowing PGE recovery of and a return on its investment in Trojan.=20
Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions. Although no assurances c=
an be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters w=
ill not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results=
 of operations.=20
Environmental Matters. Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and loc=
al environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations require e=
xpenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the oper=
ation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites=
. The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result =
in increased operating expenses. These increased operating expenses are not=
 expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or result=
s of operations. Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and gr=
oundwater remediation on a number of their facilities. Enron does not expec=
t to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater re=
mediation.
