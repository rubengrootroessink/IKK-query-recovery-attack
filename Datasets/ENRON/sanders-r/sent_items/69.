This is pathetic but I don't know the status of this. What is going on? Did we send the letter?

Richard,

I'm wanting to send out the attached demand letter later today or tomorrow, after credit and the deal makers have had a chance to corroborate the facts.  Would you please review and get back to me with any concerns over issuing this demand.  The transaction involves as sale of old corrugated cardboard to a Chinese paper mill who has a sales office in California.  The Confirm was issued under the old Pulp & Paper General Terms and Conditions that do not contain an Arbitration Clause.

Thanks

Aparna,

Please review the attached for factual accuracy and forward to anyone you believe should comment.  Also, please note that we should include copies of the invoices that total the US$292,522.77 with the Demand Letter.  Will you please obtain them from accounting.  Please call with any questions.

Steve
