Knox thinks any settlement will be between 1-2 million,probably closer to 2. What business person, if any, should we talk to about this? With Carrin, Neal M. and Knox, the attys fees will be enormous if this case ever gets going again.

I assume JVD will not overpay.  In my view $1mm would be grossly overpaying.

I had lunch with Ronnie Krist and he will settle if the money gets right.
He said it should be easier with no class, to work something out  since he
now has a case with only 87 plaintiffs.  Our earlier offer of I believe
$400,000 won't do it.  It will probably take more than $1,000,000 in an
offer to get a real number from Ronnie.  He also observed that it will be
interesting to see what happens to the make up of the Supreme Court.
