I am ok. We have gotten into trouble before when we used a different address or fax# that the one contained in the contract. Send it to as many addresses as you have but check the one in the contract.

The attachment to Ms. Sager's letter did not come with the copy you
forwarded to me, but the text you proposed seems to me to say everything
necessary, and I'm generally in favor of not saying anything more than that.

Section 15.2 of the Unisil agreement gives an address for notices.  If
Unisil Aquisition is still using that address, I would send the notice
there.  Otherwise, I would make sure it gets to Unisil's management.

Rob,

Is my short version okay?  Looks like we've been wordier in the past.
