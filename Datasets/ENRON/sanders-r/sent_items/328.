Subject:=09Remand Decision

Judge Whaley's decision granting the plaintiffs' remand motions is attached=
.
Judge Whaley held that, while the filed rate doctrine may well constitute a=
n
"absolute defense,"  it does not support complete preemption sufficient to
provide federal jurisdiction.  While not the result we wanted, that aspect
of the decision was not unexpected.  Also, at several points, Judge Whaley
confirmed the "central and controlling role" the federal government plays i=
n
the regulation of wholesale energy issues.

Unfortunately, the decision also includes Judge Whaley's view that
plaintiffs can state claims under the Cartwright Act and UCL statute
"without alleging or establishing that the electric rates charged were not
'just and reasonable'". Decision at 14-16.   While not binding on the state
court, plaintiffs will no doubt seek to make use of these and other portion=
s
of Judge Whaley's decision to oppose our state court pleading challenge.

I'll set up a conference call in the next day or so to discuss status and
approach in light of the remand decision.

Regards.
