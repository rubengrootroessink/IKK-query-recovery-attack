Chris Boehler is the lawyer at A&K who handled the IDB Lease (the one that I gave you a copy of the other day).  Bill Neese is the lawyer for the IDB who worked across the table from Chris.  You might want to get Bill's number from Chris Boehler (Chris' direct lines is 713-220-4421) and give him a call.  I am sure that Bill is worried about who is covering his legal fees.  If memory serves me, the Lease calls for the IDB to be fully indemnified by the lessee (Gleason Power I, L.L.C.).  Please call if you need any further information.

Chris,

As you know, we have all been sued over the alleged vibrations at the
above plant by the Chamberlins.  Who will be handling this for Enron?  I
will contact Allegahny so we can coordinate the defense.

Please review and call me at your earliest convenience.

Bill
