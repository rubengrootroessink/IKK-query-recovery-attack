The Houstonian has notified me that I need to provide them a new date for our dinner by tomorrow morning or we lose our opportunity.  I propose Thursday, October 18.  There is no National League Championship Series game scheduled for that night.  Dinner and drinks begin at 7 p.m.  I hope to see you there.
