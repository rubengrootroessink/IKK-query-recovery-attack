Sorry for the overreaction on Fri. I was having a very bad hair day. It see=
ms like no harm, no foul. I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on th=
is issue. I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surpri=
sed that Mirant had voted in favor. Can you call Brian Holman and see where=
 they stand. If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call th=
em and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to b=
e on the conf. call thurs. Can you make sure I have the #s.


With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter. Please=
 let me know if the proposal changes.

Richard, sorry about the mix up.  The damage has been undone with a call to=
 Weg and Cohen changing our vote to a loud no.  I apologize.  I really don'=
t want to be out in front of the client, particularly in a case in which I =
myself cringe at the creative ways lawyers are coming up with to keep thems=
elves busy.  When I couldn't reach you before the committee conference, I c=
alled Lisa to ascertain whether she still was in the PX loop.  We talked ab=
out the committee call.  She actually participated for the first few minute=
s to express her view that our committee should not be filing in formal mot=
ion to expand the PG & E committee.  We briefly discussed the arbitration i=
ssue, and she did not appear adverse to commencement of the arbitration.  M=
aybe that wasn't formal clearance to vote.  Lesson learned.  I want to avoi=
d any such problem in the future.  Unless I hear otherwise from you, on sub=
stantive issues I won't vote until I clear positions with you personally.  =
However, we have to find a better way for me to get your take on particular=
 points because they will continue to arise as Weg and Cohen (not to mentio=
n other attorneys who participate on the committee) urge the committee to t=
ake actions in the interest of discharging our fiduciary duty.  Case in poi=
nt, the Weg settlement.  Have you decided whether to withdraw the approval =
you previously communicated.  If it would help the communication, I'm perfe=
ctly willing to talk with you evenings or weekends.  Then again, you wife m=
ight react like mine if her privacy at home is interrupted.  In any event, =
assuming that Enron wants to stay on the committee, probably a good idea ju=
st to reign in the lawyers, let me know how we can most effectively communi=
cate so that I know your position and can convey it when you are not availa=
ble for a call.  Incidentally, with you impending trip, feel free to call m=
e over the weekend at 626-683-7644 if you want to discuss this further.  Bo=
