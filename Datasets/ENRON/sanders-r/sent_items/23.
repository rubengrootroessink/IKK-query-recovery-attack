	I have scheduled an all day meeting with Greg and Chris, in New York, on Friday, September 21, 2001. At this meeting wwe will discuss the trial plan and, in effect, have a dry run of what we might expect to occur during the October 11 trial.  Please let me know if you are available to attend. I have also asked that, by the end of this week, Brobeck provide us with a summary of the best arguments for and against both sides and an analysis of the realistic exposure to both sides. We can review this before the meeting on the 21st. 
	Also, the two motions for summary judgment we filed are set to be heard on October 1, 2001. The outcome of this hearing (assuming the judge makes a ruling) could certainly affect the tone and scope of the case. Please let me know if you are available on the 21st.  Thanks.
