John- I think that Mark Haedicke talked to Sam about this but I wanted to f=
ollow up. We want to make sure that Sam is available to Enron as well and t=
hat his representation of Idaho Power does not infringe on work we might wa=
nt him to do.

Mark & Richard:  I am attaching an e-mail from one of my partners who has b=
een asked to assist Idaho Power in the context of the ongoing FERC proceedi=
ngs being run by ALJ Wagner.  It would not appear to me that there would no=
t be a conflict problem with us handling this engagement for Idaho Power, b=
ut I thought Richard would be closer to the proceedings (and the likely sta=
nces of the various players) and may have better insights that me on this i=
ssue at this point.  Sam Behrends would probably be handling most of the wo=
rk from the LeBoeuf side.  Since, as I understand it, we got the call from =
Idaho Power on Sunday night and the proceedings commenced yesterday, I woul=
d appreciate it if you could let me know whether you are comfortable with u=
s taking on this assignment as quickly as you can.  Thanks very much.  John

John-
Further to our discussion regarding participation on behalf of Idaho Power =
in the FERC dockets (EL00-95-031, et al), after their call to me this weeke=
nd.  Their interest focuses on sales into and purchases from the ISO and th=
e PX, substantial portions of which remain unpaid.  The sales at issue are =
not from their own generation but are as a marketer.  Idaho expects to asse=
rt that marketer sales must take into account more than the simple price of=
 procurement, but also associated costs and a margin.  Conditions that enha=
nce the creditworthiness of purchasers also are likely to be on Idaho's age=
nda.  The foregoing is provided solely to assure that Enron will not interp=
ose any objection to our role on behalf of Idaho.  I attended the morning s=
ession of the settlement conference before Judge Wagner as an observer, pen=
ding completion of our formal procedures.  Bear in mind that Dan Watkiss of=
 Bracewell & Patterson appeared on behalf of the involved Enron subsidiarie=
s.  Understandably Idaho would like our position confirmed at the earliest =
possible time, as they already had to release their traditional FERC counse=
l.
