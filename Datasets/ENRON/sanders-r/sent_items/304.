Subject:	Fwd: Proposed Settlment Agreement with Schultes

Proposed Settlement Agreement With  Schultes attached.  In my view, ECT
Securities should not release Schultes of anything unless he drops the
Cleveland suit against Enron.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ................................................
