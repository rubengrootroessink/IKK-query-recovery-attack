> Rich,
> 	Here is a summary of what we discussed with respect to EES.
>
> 1.	EES will take its oldest backup tape as a snapshot of the email
> system as it then existed.  EES will not be making daily backups of the
> email system.  (This would involve about 7 tapes per day.)  Thus, current
> business email will not be kept for EES unless there is a business reason
> to do so.
>
> 2.	EES will take its oldest backup tape of data for its file servers as
> a snapshop of the data that existed at that time.  EES will not be making
> any other backups of file server data other than they normally would in
> the ordinary course of business
>
> 3.	EES will not be taking copies or mirror images of the 300 employees
> hard drives and any associated floppy disks at this time.  Employees will
> continue to use their equipment as they normally would.
>
> 4.	If you need additional data preservation regarding EES other than as
> described above, you will let me know.
>
> Please let me know if this summary is not accurate.
> Thanks
