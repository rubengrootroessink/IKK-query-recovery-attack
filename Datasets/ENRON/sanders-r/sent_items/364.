Richard,
here is the list of potential witnesses, with a brief description of their
role in the story, as taken from the Grella deposition.  The boldfaced
additions at the end were suggested in our meeting yesterday with Mr.
Detmering.

I'll wait to hear from you re: Jeff Bartlett's availability.

Regards,
Dan
