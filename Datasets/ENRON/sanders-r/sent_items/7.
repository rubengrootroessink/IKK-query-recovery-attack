   per your request, this e-mail will update you on the scultes lawsuit in
   cleveland.

   you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
   half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion)
   filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald
   and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss
   and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs
   are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing
   on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.
   The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are
   heard.

   if you need any further detail, or have any questions, please do not
   hesitate to contact me.
