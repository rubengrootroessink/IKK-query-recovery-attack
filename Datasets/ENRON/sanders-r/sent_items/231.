Sure.  Bob Joffe at Cravath.  Greg Joseph (used to be at Fried Frank, now on
his own).  Bernie Nussbaum at Wachtell Lipton.  Gary Naftalis at Kramer
Levin.

I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks.
