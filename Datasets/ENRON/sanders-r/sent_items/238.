We made it but the house next door and the house catty-corner did not. I called Zisman this morning and was told that his houe was flooded. Yes I need tickets-- 4 tickets for either Fri, Sat or Sun the 22nd, 23rd, or 24th.

A couple of things:

(1)  I hope you are dry

(2)  Rebecca McDonald's prep session is supposed to be at 10 a.m. today.  In the event no postponement of her depo was agreed to, Robert Rivera is planning to be at McDonald's office at 10 a.m.  I don't know if Mark Lowes will be there or not.  I told McDonald's assistant that it was up to her whether to have Mark there or not.  By the way, please let me know by e-mail what is up with the settlement talks.

(3)  Do you still need Red Sox tickets?  If so, let me know.  Cliff and I worked quite a bit with a firm up in Boston (Hill & Barlow) and I am sure I could have them find tickets for you.

Later.
