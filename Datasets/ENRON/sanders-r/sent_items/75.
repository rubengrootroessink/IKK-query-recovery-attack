In today's call we addressed the usual issues.  This Friday the complex lit=
igation panel will decide whether to consolidate the commandeering suits.  =
In case you hadn't noticed, the state filed a declaratory relief action in =
Sacramento naming each of the individual participants but not the PX.  The =
state's alleged fear is that it might be exposed to double recovery to the =
PX and the individual participants, so it asks for a declaration of its exp=
osure to the participants.  The new complaint has not yet been served.  Our=
 counsel who are trying to keep matters simple are considering strategies t=
hat will avoid the need for each participant to respond, and we should have=
 some recommendation next week.  Next, Howard Weg will circulate a draft mo=
tion to FERC submitting his proposed settlement.  We should have the draft =
within the next week.  Next, a subcommittee met with PG&E reps last week to=
 get a preview of a possible reorganization plan.  Weg may call Michael Tri=
bolet to get his take on plan structure.  Next, the state Senate evidently =
balked at the Edison bailout.  Reliant and Marant have not filed a petition=
 and are considering their options in view of the possibility that the gove=
rnor will call the legislature back into special session in early October. =
 In the meantime, Edison is producing documents in response to the 2004 not=
ice.  Weg raised a question about whether Enron will be filing an administr=
ative claim in the PG&E case pursuant to court order in that case.  I wasn'=
t aware of the issue.  Are you?  There were productive plan discussions wit=
h PX representatives as to structure and tasks of the PX going forward, and=
 we are expecting a proposal momentarily.  Discussions with the Trade Credi=
tors Committee still haven't reached closure.  PX reps evidently will be ap=
proaching PG&E and Edison to share the cost of future operations.  Our next=
 committee call is Sept. 26 at 2.  We still need to talk about the funding =
issue when you have a moment.  Bob
