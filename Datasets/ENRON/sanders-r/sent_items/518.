Tell Bethany that I am sorry I miss the Country Day Alumni function last Fri. I told her I would be there, but other more pressing matters prevailed----at least I think so--- the days are blurring together. I probably did one of two things--- got drunk( there has been alot of that around here lately), or went home, got in bed, and pulled the covers up over my head.
