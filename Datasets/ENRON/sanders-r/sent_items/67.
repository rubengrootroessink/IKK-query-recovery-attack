	Richard,

	I am doing this so I won't forget.  This will confirm that I will pick you up for work Wednesday morning.  I will be by your house between 7:00-7:15 (it depends on when Sue Ellen gets back from her jogging, which I don't do anymore because of my alleged heel problem).  I have an out-of-the-office meeting Wednesday evening, and I go to it directly from work at 5:30, so I won't be able to give you a ride home on Wednesday.

	Later.

	Britt
