 There will be a meeting with our outside counsel, Doak Bishop and Will Russell Tuesday at 4:00pm in 20C3 of 3AC to discuss the legal issues associated with SECLP plant and the CDE.   You are both invited to attend if it is convenient, otherwise we can brief you later in the week.
 
Regards,
     Michelle
