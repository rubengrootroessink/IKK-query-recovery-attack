Jenny,

There is no rush on my part with any current requests. Just wanted to be proactive an see where we are at with approval of the procedures so we are prepared for the next request.

Thanks!

DRAFT PROCEDURES -  PENDING APPROVAL BY RICHARD SANDERS


Richard Sanders and Tim Belden have agreed upon the following sign-off procedures:

Tapes:  When we need to access audio tapes to resolve disputed trades or standard settlement questions we will use the standard form authorized with Tim Belden's signature.  Dave and Dan will sort out the logistics of acquiring and listening to the tape.

Data Requests:  Any data requests for data residing in Houston require Tim Belden's signature plus the signature of one attorney.  Richard Sanders may choose to delegate signing authority to Gary Fergus or another litigation attorney by sending an e-mail to this same group.  Dave and Dan will sort out logistics depending on the frequency and complexity of the data requests.
