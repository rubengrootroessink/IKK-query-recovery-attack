I just talked to our accounting dept and told them about your proposal to f=
ix the mistake. They are ok with it. Just make sure you document it as desc=
ribed in this e-mail.

P.S. There is no bigger matter to deal with than your bill. This  must be t=
he kind of half--truths that made you the most hated man in Sacramento.

My accounting department advises me that back on April 27,2001,  Enron appa=
rently sent us a check for $54,585.11, which we received and deposited on M=
ay 7. The check  included the payment of $28,087.71 for this firm (the exac=
t amount of our February billing) and mistakenly included payment of $26,49=
7.40 for one of Ed Kee's (PA Consulting Group) bills. That check was receiv=
ed after we sent our March billing and is thus not reflected on that bill. =
The full amount of that check showed up as a May 7 payment to us from Enron=
 on our April billing, and reduced the outstanding balance by that amount. =
Whereas the total balance due shown on the April statement sent to Enron wa=
s $44,772.92, if the overpayment had not been made , the true balance due w=
ould have been $26,497.40 higher. Given the delay in sending our bills, and=
 the accumulation of additional time, there was never a credit balance on a=
 billing to Enron, but the total balances due always included credit for th=
e prior overpayment. We are about to send out our July billing today and ou=
r accounting department(Annmarie Robertson) got a call from Martha at Enron=
(345-4088) who realized what happened and asked for a refund check. We can =
and will obviously do that , but then we have to immediately ask Enron for =
that same amount-$26,497.40- because our prior bills would have been underp=
aid by that same amount. I am told that we cannot easily(if at all) go back=
 and have the computer generate previous months' bills now with an unpaid b=
alance when they were previously paid. My accounting department says it wou=
ld be easier to just send out  the July billing with a cover letter confirm=
ing that the $26,497.40 erroneously paid to us on May 7 has been credited i=
n full  to Enron, and is fully reflected in the total balance due. Hopefull=
y this makes sense and I know we both have bigger matters to deal with.  Ca=
n you approve us doing this or send us an email if Enron needs to get a che=
ck and revised billings. Thanks. .
