As a follow up to the conversation between Lora Sullivan and Bill Peterson, we have concerns as we move forward to convert to Outlook about the email retention policy regarding file folders.  Please be aware that several people in the Washington, DC office will need to retain items in their email as per the attached email from Mark Haedicke and Richard Sanders.

The people that will need to maintain their files are:
	Linda Robertson
	Sarah Novosel
	Ray Alvarez
	John Shelk
	Lora Sullivan

We are currently scheduled to be converted during the week of August 13th.  Please let us know ASAP how we can maintain these files from Lotus Notes in order to comply with the request from the legal department.

I  can be reached at (202) 466-9146.
