I talked to Mark and I don't think we have any interest.

Jim - 
 
It has been several years since  we've visited, and there are a couple of areas I'd like to update with you  on.  I'm hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again.
 
First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright & Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I've mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats.
 
Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a "Legal Information Counsel" position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.   
 
I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.  
 
I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.  
 
I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.
 
Steve
