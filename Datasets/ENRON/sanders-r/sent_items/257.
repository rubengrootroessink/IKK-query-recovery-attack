Subject:	AG Grand Jury


Our local legal newspaper, The Daily Journal, reported in Thursday's edition
that the AG will ask a Sacramento Grand Jury to investigate whether "the
California market was manipulated and profits taken illegally, and whether there
was fraud against the public".  The story reports that the investigation "will
begin shortly after July 1" which is consistent with out recent intelligence.
My guess is you have already seen this basic story because the Journal picked it
off the AP wire service.

Do you already have some clipping service keeping track of all the stories being
published out here?  I've assumed you are doing this already, but if not and you
want to do that, let us know.
