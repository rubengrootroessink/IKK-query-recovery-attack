Talk to Dave. I think he reports to Shelia so you should talk to her as well.

	This is another example of litigation involving NEPCO about which 'the litigation group' (me) knew nothing.  I assume David obtained Derrick's approval for counsel (he usually does) but I still wonder what other matters are hiding under the rug that we don't know about.
	Last time we discussed this you mentioned that you wanted us involved in their litigation the same way we would be involved if they were here. Accordingly, should I talk to Dave and find out what else is out there?  This deal is very similar to the last situation wherein NEPCO had filed an arbitration and we didn't find out about it until well after the thing was under way.

Gail,  

I think you are referring to a case between the Oklahoma Dept. of Health and
NEPCO, and yes I have it.  Steve Jantzen of McKinney and Stringer in
Oklahoma City was retained early on when the threat of litigation was
evident.  There was actually an earlier case filed but improperly served on
NEPCO so the court dismissed it.  This is a new case  and repeat of the old
case which has now been properly served on NEPCO.  The case will be stayed
pursuant to a Consent Decree that is being negotiated by NEPCO with the
Dept. of Health concerning compliance with the correct ratio of apprentices
to licensed electricians on the Jenks, OK jobsite.   In fact, this issue
will be moot soon as the project is near completion and all matters of
compliance will be non existent when the workforce is released later this
month.

On the other case for a $2800 collection matter, that is being handled by
Bonnie White and set to be dismissed by the plaintiff on agreement by NEPCO
to pay a compromised amount.  This case should never have happened expect
for the fact that a forwarding address from a closed office in California
never properly forwarded the claimant's invoices to NEPCO
