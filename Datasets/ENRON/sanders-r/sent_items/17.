Two answers:1) I don't think you need one--you can file anywhere in the Southern District, 2) a desire to get crazy judge, like Sam Kent.

	Apparently, he is going to do a broad search and has asked VE's expert searcher to get involved as well.  What would be the basis for a filing in Galveston?

	Thanks.  
	On an unrelated note, I have Dan Shilliday checking and re-checking to see if there is a Costilla lawsuit anywhere to be found.  I'll keep you posted.  Jeff needed to reschedule our meeting till tomorrow so there is no new news on that front either.
