Sorry about the conference call this morning--- I neglected to get a call in number. I talked to Paul Simon, who had talked to Limor Nissan, and among the lawyers, we have no more comments. Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues. Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions. If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them. Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading. Thanks for your help.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 
REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE 
  
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success 
assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is 
depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
which McCook have forced on us. 
  
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent 
to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation 
dept). Thank you.
