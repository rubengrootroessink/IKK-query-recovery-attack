Can't make it. That is my son's third birthday. Maybe I should bring him and the rest of my family(and inlaws) and try to pass it off as a joint celebration.

Subject:	Duke/Citrus Dinner

In order to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Duke/Citrus matter, we are planning on hosting a very nice dinner at the Houstonian (surprise, surprise) for the fine legal talent -- both in-house and out-house -- involved in this matter.  You along with a spouse/significant other are invited.  How does Tuesday, October 2 look?  I would like to do it sooner, but Mr. Manne has informed me that, due to his busy social calendar, he is not available before then.  We will plan on beginning at around 7 p.m. Please let me know if you can attend.
