You have it in hand--as I knew you would. Adkin's atty is supposed to call me at 9:30. you may want to call him today to let him know not to call me.

Subject:	Adkins v. ENA


	Richard,

	This will acknowledge receipt today of and thank you for the above-referenced new matter and accompanying file.  I have reviewed that file and spoken about it with Stacy.  In brief, this is an as-yet-unfiled claim for breach of a gas supply contract and $336,832.17 in damages by the seller, Franklin Adkins, against ENA, as the buyer.  

	Adkins' claim is based on breach of an index price contract that had been assigned to ENA from Columbia Energy Services Corporation.  ENA contends that this index price contract had been terminated and replaced with a ENA Enfolio fixed price contract, and that ENA accordingly owes Adkins nothing.  All this is, of course, subject to further investigation, including whether ENA may have a counterclaim against Adkins for overpayment.

	I will contact the key witnesses tomorrow and find out as much as I can about the matter before speaking with Adkin's attorney on Friday at 9:30 a.m.  Please let me know who else I should be reporting to besides you and Stacy.  I assume that you will be handling this, rather than Andy Edison, unless you instruct me otherwise.

	As always, I appreciate the referral and the chance to work with you and Stacy.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt
