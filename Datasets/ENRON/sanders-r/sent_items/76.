I am not in a huge hurry. I just want to make sure we have fully reviewed our options now that we have a little more time. LLGM should participate on this call and gather all other information available(Mirant and Reliant legal memos) and lets talk sometime next week. I think LLGM is in a better position than Enron to dictate timing, so I'll leave the scheduling to you.

Richard:  ironically, I received this e-mail from my bankruptcy partner Ben Young a minute or so after receiving your note regarding SCE/involuntary filing.  Is this a call that you want to be on?  Also, do you want to try to talk with Carl/Ben tomorrow on the SCE situation?  Do you want us to take a quick look at the information from Mirant et al before we speak?  Perhaps you could reply to this e-mail or give me or Carl a call and let us know what your schedule may look like.  Thanks  John

I participated in the conference call that Phil Warden put together regarding SCE.  The call was brief, lasting about 20 minutes.  Reliant suggested that an approach be made to SCE's lawyers to ask them what their plans are in light of the apparent failure of the MOU.  The parties on the line agreed to this suggestion, and this Wednesday, 9/19 at 9:30 was tentatively set for a call with SCE's counsel.  Phil will confirm the call and circulate the dialin information.
