Is there any way that we can move this to 3? I have a meeting from 1:30-2:30. Or just move it back 30 min.

Tom Engel will conduct the demonstration for Bill LaFuze and Peter Mims on Wednesday at 2:15 p.m..  I will meet Bill and Peter at 2 p.m. and escort them to the new building.  Tom Engel will do sample trades and answer any questions they have.  Do you want to participate? 

Thanks.
