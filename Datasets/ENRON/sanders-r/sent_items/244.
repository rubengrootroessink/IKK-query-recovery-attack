After conferring with Rob Cole, I will make my recommendation to Mr. Derrick today as to local counsel so that we may get a responsive pleading on file in a timely fashion. Thereafter, Rob and I will coordinate the defense with local counsel and report in the usual fashion.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this matter, please contact Dave. 

Thanks.
