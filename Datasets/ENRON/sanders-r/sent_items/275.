Please check with John on a later date. By copy of this e-mail, I will ask Stephanie to get alternate dates from you, John,Me, and Jim McCartney and to take the lead on the scheduling. If no other date works, we will go the week of the 16th.


Also- I need you to give dates to Stephanie for the meeting w/me and Mark re your travel schedule.She will take the lead on this one also.


Finally--- I talked to Julia Murray about FCPA training that you were going to do for her group. I think this would be  good PR for you. Please do whatever you can to get them a firm date.

Richard I think the week after that, John wanted to take vacation.  Maybe we should try for the first week in August.  Its winter in South America and it will be a good break from the heat.  I'll check with John.  Otherwise we could do Tuesday- Friday that week of the 16th? That may be tough just returning from vacation.

I have left a message for Jim. I will be getting back from working a week in the Portland office on Sunday, so we would have to leave on Monday. Are any other weeks after that good?

Hi Richard,
How about the week of July 16-17?  That works for Novak and me.  I'll make an agenda.  Please check with Jim.
