PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

Bob --

Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.
