I think we need to have a conference call for everyone to select playoff
tickets.  Please get back to me with your availalbity.  I think the
concensous is we draw number 1 to 9.  Number 1 picks first etc.  Number 9
would then choose first in the second round etc.  The people persons picking
would have fist choice on what games you want to choose.  We have 30 total
slots, 2 tickets for the first two rounds for each game (total of 14 slots),
and 1 ticket for each world series game (16 slots).  See attached spread
sheet. <<playoff.xls>>


regards
