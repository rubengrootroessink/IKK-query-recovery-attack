Richard, 
Here is more info on the appalachian producer problem.  Do you want to meet sometime today to work through the situation?

Stacy,

We deducted the difference between Index and his fixed price hedge from hs last check.  He removed his meters 2 months prior to the expiration of his fixed price hedge.  He says he did not have a valid contract with ENA.  He was sent a Confirmation at the time of the deal.  He did not contact me about not having a contract until the prices were above his fixed price deal pricing.  Dan Hyvl agreed that the deduction should be made from the final payment to Adkins.  Dan should have all the info.

 I am on my way back from vacation today.  Call me on my cell phone @ 330-284-3871.

Here are:  1. a copy of the Confirmation and 2. the worksheet used to make the deductions.

 << File: Adkins Confirmation.doc >>      << File: F Adkins Final Payment.xls >> 

P.S.  He pulled the same stunt with Jim Javins  - EES, prior to moving his meters to CES.
