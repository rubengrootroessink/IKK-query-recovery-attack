This was the instruction I got today.  Please let me know if you think it is overly aggressive.  Thanks

Craig
 
My instructions from Kevin Heffron who is the commercial lead overseeing this matter is to file the answer and counterclaim within the normal time limit, without seeking any time extension.  The intention is to signal beyond doubt that we mean business - and Kevin is concerned that seeking an extension, however usual, will give the opposite message.  Our target should therefore be to file this week and I suggest that we stick to the original schedule.
 
Thanks for your help
 
Paul

I have left a message for Richard to this effect, but wanted to make sure that everyone was in the loop.  Due to the incidents in the US yesterday our offices in Chicago were evacuated.  That has thrown off our schedule slightly for distributing the answer and counterclaim.  We plan on having a draft to everyone by 12:00 noon tomorrow.  I am also going to contact opposingc ounsel to let see if they would be agreeable to an extension of time to answer.  (I will wait until we discuss the matter to specify a definite time period for an extension).  In all likelihood, we can obtain an extension from opposing counsel (and/or the Court) if that is necessary in light of the events. 
 
In light of this revised schedule, we may want to reschedule the conference call currently set for 7 am central time tomorrow.  That is up to you.
 
Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any questions or concerns about the revised schedule and for what time you would like to have the conference call.
 
Regards

I spoke to Rick McCombs at Mayer Brown this morning and he informed me that he is in trial all week and unavailable for a call today. We agreed to a 7am central (1pm London and 8am New York) call on Thurs. to go over the answer and any other pending items. He promised a draft answer by  3 pm central on Wed afternoon.H opefully, Paul will be well by then. I will set up a call-in number for the conference..

Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
 
I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
 
Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
 
We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.
