Gentlemen:  I work with Bill Abington, Partner in our Financial Advisory
Services Group at PricewaterhouseCoopers - Houston.  Bill met with you on
Wednesday and asked that I add your names to our mailing lists for the
various activities hosted by our group during the year.  In order to make
sure that I put you on mailing lists for the events that you would find
most interesting, would you please advise me if you play golf or shoot
sporting clays?  We have our annual Sporting Clays event coming up on
October 19th at American Shooting Center.  If you are interested in either
golf or clays, would you please let me know?  Thank you.
