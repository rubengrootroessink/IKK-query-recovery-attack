	Drew, I got your voice-mail, which included Richard's voice-mail to you.  I have an open file on this breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit between the above-referenced characters, and have been dealing with informal discovery responses from both.  If it is the same lawsuit, I am surprised that I have not been given a call about any deposition of Stan Horton.  I am asking Becky to follow up with Richard about who he got the telephone call from, and compare that with the attorneys of record we know about.

	I will be on the road most of the day driving to Fort Worth for a family reunion.  I will have my cell phone (713-252-7711).  Hopefully, we won't need to do anything until Monday, but if that is not the case, I will make sure this gets handled.

	Britt
