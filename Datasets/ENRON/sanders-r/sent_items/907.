I have done it but not until this morning. You may want to call him. Also-Novack and Williams have not completed reviews.

Hey Richard-I'm just following up to tell you that I want to take Bruce Lundstrom off my review list and ass John Guidry who is a client, since Bruce is already on the PRC anyway. How do I do that?

Michelle
