I talked to Claudia about this and she says that she has not seen it since =
we found it some two months ago and gave you the only executed copy we coul=
d find.  We checked with the vault to see if they had a copy.  They do not.=
  I searched your green files and miscellaneous papers in your office -- al=
l to no avail.  Can you remember what you did with the copy I gave you?
