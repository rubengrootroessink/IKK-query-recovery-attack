As you will recall, Steve was referred to us by Neal Manne and served as local counsel in the Glatzer matter. He has done a great job. Although I don't have anything now, I would love to send something his way.

Richard:  Thanks for thinking of us.  I was at ground zero, saw the
whole thing, and escaped in the nick of time.  There are obviously a lot
of emotional consequences, but I'll give you the basics.  On Wednesday,
we learned, incorrectly, that our building had collapsed or was about
to.  At that point, we all decided we might never return and that our
mission was to obtain new space and to resume our operations as soon as
possible.  Last Thursday, we took new space at 45 Rockefeller Plaza and
ordered all new computer systems.  Friday we got hold of the computers
and over the weekend they were installed.  By Monday, we were had phones
and computers and we were up and running.  Now we just need to get our
documents out of 1 Liberty and we are not sure when that will happen.
We had a tremendous amount of help and offers of assistance all of which
we greatly appreciate.  My information appears below. My fax is
841-8868. Let's talk soon.  Steve

I tried to call you, but the phones are out. No urgency, I just remember
your proximity to the WTC and wanted to make sure you and the members of
your firm are OK.
