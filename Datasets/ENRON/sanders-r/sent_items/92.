Yes-- deal with Willie directly. As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine. Is that just ENA or does EES also have a claim?

Hello!

It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did a
fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing for
a trial that begins mid-October.

I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in which
ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the anticipated
(not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's counsel
(who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it appears
that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart in
accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that there
is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA for
August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like -- just
let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry for
August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
$1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the commitment
up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry will
cut a check for the first distribution.

If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
get caught up.  Thanks and take care.
