Where do we stand on Guido's compensation for his most recent activity. It appears he holds a strong interest in this matter but I think it is best to cap his efforts on our behalf before we get a substantial bill for multiple political outcome analysis.

Richard I would suggest Andy call Guido and define where we are cost wise and define the box as of today.
