Andy,
I need to make disclosure on any threatened or pending litigation against BAM Lease Company or any other party affecting the Leased Facilities. The Leased Facilities are the Houston, Bammel and Texas City Loops and the Bammel Storage Facility including the compressor sites and compressors as well as meters. Currently the Leased Facilities are leased by HPL Assets Holdings LP to BAM as assignee of HPL. BAM will be leasing the Leased Facilities back to HPL under the sublease. Can you let me know if there is any threatened or pending litigation involving these entities or assets specifically--as always,
 I appreciate your help--

Sandi
