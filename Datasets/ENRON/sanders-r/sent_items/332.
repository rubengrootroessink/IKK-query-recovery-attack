Subject:=09Temporaries' Access Rights

THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our L=
egal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants =
need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars curren=
t, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars =
for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the =
temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   ("I don't know where=
 they are" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below.=20

For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e=
-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently,=
 the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to O=
utlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights =
to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control h=
ow much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you coul=
d give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail =
or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to y=
ou.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.=09Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your=
 folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
=09then "Folder List")

2.=09Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.=09Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.=09Left click on "Add".
=09Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
=09Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add"=
 button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
=09to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
=09Left Click "OK"

5. =09You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID =
you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
=09left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holdin=
g the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
=09access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not =
select anything that has "own" or "owner"
=09in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.=09Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.=09[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may hav=
e, right click on that folder and repeat steps
=09 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be complete=
d only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come i=
n handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.
