> SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp., the giant Texas-based seller of electric
> power, won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the
> secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought
> by state lawmakers.=20
> A Senate committee investigating price gouging in California's
> wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enron's documents in April,
> seeking records of electricity sales, bidding strategies, prices and
> out-of-state transactions.
> The company refused to make the documents available without a court
> order protecting the confidentiality of the records. Enron sued July
> 11, and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C.
> Kobayashi granted the company's request for a protective order.=20
> The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of
> the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying
> electricity on behalf of the state's two largest utilities last
> January.=20
> "Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition
> with plaintiff," wrote Kobayashi, "the functions of the Senate and the
> Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that
> there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict,
> actual conflicts can arise."=20
> Kobayashi's order is a reversal of an earlier, tentative ruling, in
> which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be
> an "unacceptable" intrusion by the courts into the internal operations
> of the Legislature.=20
> Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based company, described
> executives as "very pleased" with the court ruling. "Turning over the
> documents was never the issue," she said, "The issue was always
> protecting our rights."=20
> Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen. Joe Dunn
> (D-Santa Ana) to craft an agreement that details which documents will
> be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides, Denne said.=20
> Reliant Energy of Houston, another company that resisted demands for
> business records, on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with
> Dunn's committee and will begin bringing 250,000 documents to a
> depository in Sacramento, said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson.=20
> Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to
> Sacramento, but not all are fully complying with subpoenas.=20
> "There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market
> participants," he said.=20
> On July 21, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price
> Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that
> Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents.=20
> The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation.=20
> The committee, which the Senate created in March, has focused its
> investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants
> after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in 1996.
