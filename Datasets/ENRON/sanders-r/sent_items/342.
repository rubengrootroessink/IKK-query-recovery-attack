Dear Richard:

Tammie and I want to thank you and Julie for inviting us to the Astro's game
on Saturday.  We had a great time, both at the game and afterwards.  Those
were the best seats I have ever had for a professional sporting event.  We
will have to try and get together more often for simple activities like
cards or Scrabble or just drinks and talk.  We hope to have the house
settled before the end of the month and can have people over without having
to apologize for the mess.
Thanks again for the good time

Jim Ebeling
