not much to report.  the other defendants apparently have yet to come to ground on a final settlement agreement.  i spoke with one of the principal drafters today, who sounded frustrasted and would report only that they "are still working on it."  she also withdrew her colleague's prior indication that there was one thing we would be able to know once they settled.  she was quite firm that the confidentiality provisions were all encompassing, with no carve-outs.

neither we nor they have heard a word from the court. when the last hearing was cancelled, it was left that the court would give the parties some time to work out a settlement and then would schedule a status conference to figure out who was in/out, and how to proceed.

if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.
