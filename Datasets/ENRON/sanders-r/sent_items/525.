Now that the Astros have hired Williams, they'll be my favorite NL
team.  I would love for the Astros to do well just to make Dan Duquette
look stupid.

And in the World Series good triumphs over evil.

I would give you the second half of the old "I have some good news and
some bad news for you" but given your employer, that would just be
piling on.
