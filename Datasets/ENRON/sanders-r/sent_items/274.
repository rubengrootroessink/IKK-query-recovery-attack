I have lost track of this. Is there an actual matter? Who is handling?

Works for me.

Deb -- Unless you or Mark Haedicke advise otherwise, Becky Stephens will process SOP for Ste. Aurelie Timberlands as she does for other companies in the Enron Wholesale Group, i.e. Service Recipient -- Richard Sanders; Copy Recipient -- Linda Guinn; ELU Contact -- Bonnie White.

Kate -- Please confirm with Becky when the change of agent has been effected.

Deb and Kate -- During the interim, I understand that service will be handled by the current agent and notice of service will be issued by that agent to whomever Deb has designated. If that is to be Becky during this transition, Deb will need to so instruct the current agent with a copy of the instructions to Becky.

Thanks.

Thanks Deb.  We'll proceed to prepare change of agent forms.  Will you also be able to provide information on officer or director slates?  At present we have no info. at all so we will not be able to get a signature(s) on the forms.

Please advise whether minute books, seals, stock certs., etc. will continue to be maintained by Canadian counsel in Quebec.

Which are the "documents" referred to in your message below?

Thanks for your help.  It's much appreciated.

Best regards
Kate

A slight clarification: SOP is currently made on an individual: John J. Flaherty, 443 Congress St., P.O.Box 11410, Portland, ME 04104-7410.  Mr. J.M.Gagne' of Fasken Martineau Dumoulin, a law firm in Quebec, handles the corporate records but not SOP.  KC

I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel. This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago, whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states. Currently, that agent is NRAI. 

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific business needs. 

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone on your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.
