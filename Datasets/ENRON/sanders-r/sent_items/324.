Subject:	Coordination of Legal and GA Teams

With the FERC evidentiary hearings coming up soon for California and with investigations into NW power markets I want to make sure that the litigation team's activities and government affair's activities are coordinated.  Is this being done?  Is there a formal process?  If there are data issues or data that you need I would like to get those issues on the table right now.  Specifically, do we have all of the data that we need (for both of your purposes) and do the people on the litigation team have a detailed understanding of this data?  There are only a few people who understand how all of our data fits together and what each type of transaction means.  As the investigation move from Californa to the Northwest markets I may have to get other people from the desk involved.
