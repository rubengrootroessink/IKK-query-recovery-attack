Monthly Report Updates Due
					
It is time to update the Monthly Report for Mark Haedicke to send to Jim Derrick.  Please use a hard copy of the attached June report to mark changes for transactions as of today.  

Remember that the report is to reflect 
	significant transactions that are most likely to close
	
Remember to add outside counsel (the firm name) where appropriate.

Give your hard copy changes to Kay Young by 5 p.m. Friday, July 13.

Thanks!
