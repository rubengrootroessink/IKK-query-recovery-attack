	I haven't heard back from George yet.  I'll confirm with him. It's set as far as Brobeck and I are concerned.

I have to move some stuff around on the 8th. Is that set in stone?

The 8th is fine. Mel knows he never responded since I have raised that with
him three times. George we need your help with Seth. I was in Washington
today and they are not ready on damages although they were supposed to be. I
am going to meet them again on Friday to drive this foward. They need
additional information from you and maybe a pep talk. I have already tried
to impress on them the urgency of the situation.
