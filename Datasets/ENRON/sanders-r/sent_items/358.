Subject:	A couple of things

1)  We would like to use the Perd on Oct 5- 8th. 
2)  We need to organize a family clean up weekend at the Perd.  This has not  
been done in over two years...and the Perd really really needs it.  Does  
anyone have any suggestions on when to do this and how....and what age  
children come or without children.  But the cooler months are coming...and we  
should try to do it before the holidays. 
3)  Mom is turning 70 this December.  What in the world sould we do to top  
Dad's 60 surprise birthday party for her.  Any ideas of a present.....or a  
plan.  We should talk about this now if we need to plan something. 
4)  There is someone in my neighborhood selling a cargo bunkbed with good  
mattresses for $300.  Should we buy this for the Perd.  It also has a pull  
out trundle bed.  Great condition and great price. 
Please get back with me.  Happy delayed birthday greeting to Yvonnne....and  
Susan early birthday greetings to you.
