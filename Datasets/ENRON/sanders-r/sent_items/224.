I have just learned that we have been sued in a case styled Earnestine Neptune v. Charles Thompson, Enron Corp., and Enron Corp. d/b/a Houston Pipeline Company, Cause No. 2001-21283, in the 333rd District Court of Harris County, Texas.  The lawsuit was filed on May 7, 2001, and Charles Thompson (an Enron employee) was served on May 23, 2001.  This case is a car wreck negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.  I am going to take care of it, and give it to Eilee Kisluk because of the insurance issues involved.
