I am flying in on the morning of the 3rd, arriving at approx. 9:30. I will be leaving for Portland at 5:30. That should give us from 10:30 to 3:30.

Richard- I definitely want to attend the FERC briefing with you and Gary Fergus in San Francisco. Is it on Oct 2 or 3? At what time? I have advised Dave Noonan about it and he will go if he isn't in New York. Are you going from San Francisco to Portland on the evening of the 3rd? Let me know. Thanks
