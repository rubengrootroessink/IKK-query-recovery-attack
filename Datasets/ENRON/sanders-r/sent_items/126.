From those that have responded (Scott, Mike, and Richard) it looks like October 17 or October 19 are the two best days.  There are still spaces available!

Chris Ferrazzi Bill Wiggins and Gene Nettles want to play golf with you at Champions!  I told them a weekday would probably be most palatable.  Please let me know if you are interested and if so what time and days would work for you.  Thanks.
