Hello everyone,
 
I just wanted to let you know that the trophies and  pictures and evaluation forms are ready to be picked up. Just come to the front  office and let them know what you are picking up. They are all clearly marked.  Please encourage parents to fill out the evaluation form and your equipment to  the game on November 10th and give it to the official.
 
 
Thank you,
Buster Adams
