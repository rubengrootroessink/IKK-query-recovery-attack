Subject:	PX conference call

I just participated in a conference call of the PX committee.  Our counsel
are urging the committee to clear them to commence an arbitration action to
recover the PX's claim against SCE.  This may be followed by a judicial
action seeking prejudgment relief in the form of an attachment.  A written
memo will be circulated shortly to the committee summarizing this course of
action.  The view seems to be that SCE has all but assured that it will be
suing PX and all the participants, and why not take the initiative.  Any
thoughts?
