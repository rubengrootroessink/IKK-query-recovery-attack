I have left a message for Jim. I will be getting back from working a week in the Portland office on Sunday, so we would have to leave on Monday. Are any other weeks after that good?

Hi Richard,
How about the week of July 16-17?  That works for Novak and me.  I'll make an agenda.  Please check with Jim.
 
 
  Rgds,
      Michelle
