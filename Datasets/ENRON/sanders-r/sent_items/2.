CEO | Super 180's
Made in Huddersfield England

With demand so high, and supply increasingly limited, it's a privilege to be
able to offer CEO Super 180's to our clients.  But, what exactly does make
these fabrics the finest Super 180's in the world?

New South Whales, Australia.  There, on a ranch deep in the outback, 114,000
specially bred Merino sheep are raised under strictly controlled conditions.
All are individually numbered, fed a special diet and even protected from
the elements by jackets.  Each year, a new generation of prized rams and
ewes surpasses the previous one in the quality of their wool.  Yet, at a
demanding 14.5-14.9 microns, less than 1% of total production will be judged
worthy of CEO Super 180's.

Huddersfield, England.  At Taylor & Stewart, a famed mill known for its
expertise, the longest and strongest and most supple of these wool staple
yarns are spun, woven and finished according to 400 year old tradition.
Fabrics are scoured with rainwater which travels from 60 miles away through
ancient rock to reach the mill's own 1500 foot deep well.  Unique finishing
processes truly set these fabrics apart, and are accomplished via treasured,
time-tested machinery and state of the art computerized equipment.

The result is a magnificent, superbly tailorable cloth that's actually finer
than cashmere.  Its soft, buttery hand, durability and resilience are
unparalleled in the luxury market.  Of raw materials as scarce and
painstakingly acquired as earth's rarest gems, the cost of such wools has
risen significantly.  Yet, a close partnership between Tom James and the
renowned mills of Huddersfield permits us to control costs and make CEO
Super 180's readily available to you.

Surely, a privilege you will enjoy for seasons to come.
