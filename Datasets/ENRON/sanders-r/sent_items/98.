Subject:	Bid/Ask Lawsuit

Richard:  One of my litigation partners mentioned to me the other day that he had seen that Enron recently had been sued by Bid/Ask LLC in the Eastern District of Texas. I assume that this type of case would fall under your "jurisdiction."  (Just what you need, another lawsuit!).

Apparently, this caught my partner's attention because he recently had been considered as litigation counsel by another company that had been sued by Bid/Ask for infringement of Bid/Ask's patent and, in that respect, had done a considerable amount of diligence on Bid/Ask's patent and its patent application history. (This lawyer is a patent litigator).  He surmised that the lawsuit against Enron might be somewhat along the same lines; however, I don't know whether or not this is the case or not.

Since the action was brought in Texas, I assume that you are (or will be) using one of your Texas outside counsels to assist you.  Nonetheless, I thought I would just mention this prior diligence to you on the off hand chance that it could be of some assistance to you or your outside counsel, at least in terms of getting a download of any information that we may be able to impart in the event the case is very similar to this previous one.

I hope that you are doing well (or as well as can be expected with everything you have going on).  Congratulations on the resolution of the CA Senate investigation proceeding.  Let me know if you want to follow up at all on this.  If I don't talk to you before then, hopefully we can catch up for a few minutes at the ENA Legal Conference in two weeks.

John
