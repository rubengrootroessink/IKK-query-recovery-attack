The problem with tapping those funds is that the hogs will get fatter. I think we should vote with our overall theme in mind: the PX participants committee is out of control and anything that curtails them is good.  Is that clear as mud?

There is a committee call Sept. 10 at 12 your time.  It's the regular
weekly committee call.  We may discuss further the arbitration issue
although, for the moment, it would appear that the vote is against making a
demand, at least until after FERC rules.  I won't be surprised however, if
Weg keeps lobbying to try and get the committee to come around on this
issue.  We need to discuss how we will fund the operations. professionals
etc both pending plan confirmation (hopefully early 2002) and after
confirmation.  Weg suggests that we use the earnings on the $400 million
held by PX.  Any thoughts in that regard?  Bob
