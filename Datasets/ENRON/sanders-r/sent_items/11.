In connection with ENA legal opinions (to be signed by Mark H) required for two swap transaction closings later this week, please advise by return e-mail whether or not, to your knowledge, except as disclosed in Enron Corp.'s SEC reports, there is any action, suit or proceeding pending or threatened against ENA before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body agency or  official that could either (1) materially and adversely affect the business consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations of ENA and its subsidiaries, or (2) impair ENA's ability to perform its obligations in connection with the swaps. 

Thanks
