Very sad.

Hey, yall really need a break from Houston.  Any chance you want to meet us
at the Perd next weekend.  I would do all the grocery shopping.....to make it
easy for you and Julie to get the kids out of town.  We have not seen you
forever....and I have not been to the Perd since July.

I transferred the bunk beds out there, but they still need to be put together
and in a room.

It would be the 16 and 17
