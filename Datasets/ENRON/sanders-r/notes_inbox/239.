Letter from Wright defendants.  Conference call went fine.

> Reason: Judge Downes already in some respects has a de facto scheduling
> order based on what he has said at various hearings.  It seems likely that
> he will get to public disclosure / original source after the pending
> motions are resolved.  This is consistent with the goals of the Wright
> defendants' letter.
>
> If there is a scheduling conference in the near future (and the letter
> does not suggest that there should be), we will face the demand from the
> relators that "core" discovery (read "merits" discovery) should proceed
> during the pendency of the motions practice.  So, I simply would prefer
> not to use the phrase "first scheduling conference."
