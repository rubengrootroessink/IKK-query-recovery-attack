Linda,

Lee just found the invoices, I think.  I will confirm shortly.

Britt

P.S. to Matt--I inadvertantly forget to send you an e-mail that is attached 
to this one.

Britt --

I do not have a copy of the WFW invoice.  I have requested same from Angeline 
and she indicated she would be forwarding to it to me.  I will forward on to 
you when I receive it.

Linda,

Could you send the WFW bill down to me please?  I just changed admin 
assistants and my new a/a, Lee, could not find that in the file.  Richard 
wanted me to take a look and try to apportion it between his r/c and Alan's, 
given my statement to Richard that the WFW bill contains a lot of time that I 
(and I believe Matt shares this belief) was directed to resolution of the 
dispute with FGH.  

Britt

P.S. to Matt-- what do you think about asking Neale if he would take a look 
at that bill and apportion the time spent between the cargo claim versus the 
FGH matter?

Hi Linda

I have just faxed to you the statement that reflects the various items 
charged by Watson Farley, which was attached to Watson's invoice.  My 
apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.
