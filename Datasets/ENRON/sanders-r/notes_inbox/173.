California Attorney General Contact
 I spoke with Richard Rochman, Deputy Attorney General.  He told me
that he wanted a contact person for Enron for the AG's investigation.  I
told him that I would be that contact.  He said that in the next few days he
would be sending me a letter requesting that documents be preserved.  That
will be followed in 2-3 weeks by a subpoena.  He anticipated a 3 week period
to respond to the subpoena.  Enron is not the only entity that has been
contacted.
Summary of Known Investigations
 CPUC
 FERC
 EOB
 California State Auditor
 AG
 Brobeck is assigned to monitor developments in each of this
investigations and advise the group.
Enron Defense Team Contact Sheet Distributed
 Please check the contact sheet for the Enron Defense team
(distributed by email today) to make sure that all of the information for
you is accurate.  A more complete contact sheet with Enron witnesses,
experts etc. will be distributed in the next few days.
Defendants Contact Sheet
 Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby, Mike Day and I will try to figure out who
is representing whom in San Diego.
Removal
 Diversity
  Mike Kirby pointed out that even if we solved the
citizenship issue, it is unlikely that every class member will meet the
$75,000 amount in controversy requirement.  We also have the preliminary
reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is
selling electrical energy into the California PX market. (See December 1
status report.) I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources
has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue.
 Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument
  All of us need to understand the interrelationship between
the FERC/PUC/ISO investigations and this class action.  There is also the
pending challenge to the ISO MMIP's by Enron and others that has been
pending for some time.  Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily
implicate a federal question.
Change of Venue  (Additional Research by Peter Meringolo)

 I have researched case law involving class actions where class
members are jurors.  I found only two non-California cases, and both involve
change of venue motions.  See Beech v. Leaf River Forest Prods., 691 So. 2d
446 (Miss. 1997); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 704
N.E.2d 663 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1996).  These cases, however, do not change
the analysis required under C.C.P. o 397(b).

 In Beech, plaintiffs brought a non-class action lawsuit against
defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin.  Defendants moved for a
change of venue.  In addition to evidence of negative publicity, defendants
showed that of the 8,909 potential jurors, 750 were plaintiffs in other
dioxin cases against these defendants, and "even more were potential class
members in a class action brought against these same defendants" in another
county.  Beech, 691 So. 2d at 450.  The trial court granted defendants'
motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors
involved in similar litigation "would prevent the defendants from receiving
a fair trial."  Id.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, holding that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion.  Id.

 Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company.  Nationwide moved for a change of venue, arguing, among
other things, that because of the large size of the class "a significant
percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class
members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors."  Toledo Fair, 704
N.E.2d at 664.  Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of
the class.  Id.  The court denied the motion, holding that because of the
dispute regarding the size of the class, it was too early to determine
whether an impartial jury could be impaneled.  The court clearly left open
the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion.

 We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge
who would hear this case under Section 170.1, for cause, because the Judge
would be part of the class.  Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case
with this type of challenge.
Consolidation
 Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge
Amos under San Diego local rules, if that is what we decided to do.  Keeping
in mind that the 17200 claims are not jury claims, the selection of the
judge is critical.
Coordination with Defense Counsel
 Dave and Mike will be responsible with Robin for coordinating among
defense counsel in San Diego.  Right now, we do not intend to enter any
formal defense sharing agreements.
Coordination with Plaintiffs' Counsel
 Dave and Mike with Robin will be responsible for coordinating our
efforts with lead plaintiffs' counsel.
Analysis of FERC/PUC Enron Positions
 Robin will work with me to understand from Ron Carroll (FERC) and
Mike Day (PUC), what positions that Enron has taken with respect to
jurisdiction etc.
