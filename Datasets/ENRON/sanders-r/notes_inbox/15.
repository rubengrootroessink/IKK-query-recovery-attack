Richard --

I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of 
information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  
The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key 
California Republican leaders in a "private" meeting in Beverly Hills 
reported in the LA Times recently.

I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, 
but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our 
legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public 
and can be provided and other info will not be released.

Appreciate your help.

Jim
