Enclosed is my proposed response (which I intend to fax to Mr. Drivon 
tomorrow) to the May 30, 2001 letter from Senator Dunn's Committee regarding 
document retention.  As indicated, the letter does not say anything of 
substance, but we have at least acknowledged receipt of the letter.  My not 
getting a copy directly from the Senate Committee is a legitimate excuse to 
extend the time to respond (recognizing that the May 30 letter did not set a 
deadline for a response).  I will have a proposed response sent via e-mail on 
Friday and we can discuss it in Houston next week.  Given our strategy of 
proceeding with all deliberate speed, I do not want to respond any sooner 
than necessary to anything from the Senate Committee, particularly when we 
know that the subpoenas are going to be issued this week or next and will 
apparently call for a 15-day response time.  If you have a different strategy 
in mind, give me a call or e-mail a response.  MLK
