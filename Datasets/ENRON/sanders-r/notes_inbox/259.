NEW SEMINARS FOR THIS MONTH...

The following are brief descriptions of our new seminars for this month.
Full details on each are available on our Web site:

--> Legal Writing: Meet the New Citation Manual

We are pleased to introduce a new seminar this month from Professor Wayne
Schiess of the University of Texas School of Law on a cutting edge issue
facing lawyers in citations in legal writings.  This seminar is designed
to review criticisms of the most widely used citation manual-- The
Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation -- and to introduce attorneys to
the latest and most viable alternative to the Bluebook-- the ALWD
Citation Manual.  This seminar is accredited for 1.0 hour of CLE.

--> Selected Issues in Ethics for California Lawyers [2.0 ETHICS]

We are also pleased to present a new ethics seminar from another one of
our most popular authors and instructors on our site.  David Hricik has
produced a special online legal ethics seminar designed specifically for
California lawyers that will explore a variety of new ethical issues and
challenges facing California practitioners.  This seminar is accredited
for 2.0 credit hours, all in the area of legal ethics.
*********************************************************************

ARE YOU A MEMBER OF A BAR ASSOCIATION OR SECTION?...

If you are a member of a Bar association or Section that
produces traditional CLE seminars for its members, we would be greatly
interested in talking to you and your association/section about bringing
your CLE seminars online via the CLEonline.com Web site.

CLEonline.com can work with your association or section to bring your
seminars online through a collaborative agreement in which the fees
generated by such seminars are shared directly with your organization.
This allows your association or section to immediately get their CLE
seminars online and begin receiving additional revenue from existing
seminars... and without incurring ANY additional costs!

If your Bar association or section would be interested in such an
arrangement, please forward this information to them and ask them to
give us a call (1-800-522-7566) so we can provide them with more details.

*********************************************************************

Thanks again for your continued interest in and support of CLEonline.com.
We greatly value you as a registered user of our service, and we would
very much appreciate it if you could please spread the word about our
award-winning CLE site to other attorneys in your firm, company or local
area.

Best wishes to you and yours for a happy holiday season and a successful
New Year!


Best Regards,

Mike De La Rosa, Esq.
