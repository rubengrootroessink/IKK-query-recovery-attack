 Alvin Suggs, one of the El Paso Energy attorneys who is working on the A-S 
Line incident from last week, just told me that he called Richard Sanders 
last week (pursuant to Barbara Gray's suggestion)  about how to allow Enron 
people to be involved in the investigation without waiving the 
attorney-client privilege.  Alvin said they want to cooperate fully but need 
to be sure that El Paso and Enron aren't  disadvantaged from a privilege 
standpoint.   I have left a phone message with Richard Sanders asking him to 
call me.
 Richard, feel free to call Dave Johnson (Ext 67885) directly to discuss this 
with him.
