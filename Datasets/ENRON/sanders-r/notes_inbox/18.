Earlier today you asked what McKenna's damage figures are.  In response to 
interrogatories, McKenna contends that he is entitled to "$2,775,000 plus an 
additional amount of up to $1,000,000 depending on the MW capacity of Enron's 
plant."  Under the agreement, he would be entitled -  if the power plant in 
question fell under the contract's terms --  to $175,000 when the PPA was 
signed, $1.5 milllion five days after financing and another $1.5 million when 
the plant was completed.  In addition, he would be entitled to $4,000 for 
each MW above 200MW.
