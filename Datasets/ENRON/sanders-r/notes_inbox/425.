I think it would be very beneficial to pay McGrath to be present,  mainly to 
keep Hellmold honest.

Bruce MacLeod at Hennigan's firm has informed me that plaintiffs will NOT file
a summary judgment motion against ECT Securities.

Also, next week Ralph Hellmold will be deposed on 6/13 and 6/14, but we will
not be expected to produce McGrath until July.

Question:  Do we want to pay McGrath to attend Hellmold's deposition on 6/13
and 6/14 to help me out (and maybe keep Hellmold a little more honest by his
presence in the room)?
