Dear Bernard,

I am grateful for your reply.  I assume that you need nothing further in the 
way of documentation from me regarding the liquidator issue at this time.  If 
that is not correct, I trust that you will let me know immediately.  In the 
future, in order to streamline these matters, please include me in the 
communication loop.  I realize that you did not know that I would be involved 
in the the process of re-extending the liquidation of EGLE.

I need your (and/or Michel's) immediate help in substituting a new 
liquidator.  Please let me know what qualifications are necessary at your 
earliest convenience.  I want to have the necessary papers filed in France 
before year end unless there is a reason that this absolutely cannot be done.

Britt

Bernard,

Please call (or have your office call) or fax me Monday and let me know
whether you got the liquidator's documents that I had sent by Federal
Express to you.  I am concerned that since I heard nothing from you Friday,
you have not received them.

Britt
