Here is a proposed modification of the indemnification language based on our 
telephone conversation earlier today:

5. Indemnification. Company represents that it is a successor corporation to 
Enron Milford, Inc. and that the Certificate of Incorporation of Enron 
Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporations Files of the Secretary 
of State, State of Delaware, applies to Company.  Company further represents 
that it will act in good faith in investigating and making a determination 
with respect to any claim for indemnification made by Consultant pursuant to 
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation should an indemnifiable 
event arise.

Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
