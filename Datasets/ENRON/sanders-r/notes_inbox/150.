Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
To:       Grynberg JDT Participants
From:  Don Schultz for Coordinating Counsel Committee
Re:       Attached Draft letter
            Before notice of this week's status conference arose, Doug 
Robinson raised with the Coordinating Counsel Committee a suggested 
communication to Judge Downes as reflected in the attached proposed 
letter.    The Coordinating Counsel Committee is in favor of sending this 
letter, which has already undergone some circulation and editing among those 
who worked actively on the dismissal briefing.
            We would like to deliver the letter to Judge Downes in advance of 
the status conference, preferably on Wednesday, and so I would appreciate 
hearing of any objections or suggestions for revisions or alternate courses 
of action right away.   Thanks for your cooperation.  Don.
