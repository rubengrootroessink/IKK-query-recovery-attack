Britt,

Entity should be Enron Metals & Commodity Ltd., since all our contracts and 
invoices are issued on behalf of Ltd. .  If Scottsboro 
agree to sign this letter please go ahead.

Attached is a revised draft of the document I sent to you all earlier this 
morning.  Given Marcus's well-placed concern that this letter would probably 
not be privileged from discovery in this or other related matters, I (a) 
beefed up the confidentiality provisions and (b) eliminated references to the 
reasons that we are including a confidentiality provision.  I also mentioned 
that Enron would be billed directly by Scottsboro's outside counsel in this 
matter, which I know was a specific concern of Dean Varnek, Scottsboro's 
attorney.

Please let me have your other comments/authority at your earliest convenience.

Attached for your immediate review and approval is a proposed letter from 
Enron (please make sure I correctly identified the right Enron entity) 
agreeing to idemnify and defend Scottsboro in this matter.  I told 
Scottsboro's attorney yesterday that this would be coming once we confirmed 
that all the loads for which Scottsboro is being sued are our loads.  Nicole 
tells me that this is in fact the case.  I would like to send out this letter 
ASAP today, to give us time to make arrangements with Scottsboro's usual 
attorneys, who then will be asked to get an extension of time for Scottsboro 
to answer from the trucker's counsel.

I await your advice (Richard, per your instructions today, I will assume that 
you have no problem with this letter).

Britt
