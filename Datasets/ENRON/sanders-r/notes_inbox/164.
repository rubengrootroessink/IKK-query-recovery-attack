Gentlemen:

Tom Hall wrote me today saying (among other things) that he wants to take 
Steve Hamilton's deposition either the week of Dec. 18 or Dec. 25 (no, that's 
not a typo).  I have attached my proposed response.  Let me know if you 
cannot open it and I'll re-send the text.

Steve:  Since we will eventually have to present you, and I doubt we can push 
it off very far, start thinking about when you're available for depo. in 
early to mid-January.

Thanks,
- Doug
