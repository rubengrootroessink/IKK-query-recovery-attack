Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:  Grynberg JDT
From:  Don Schultz

        Yesterday's email (June 5) regarding the joinder of additional 
defendants to the motion to certify was suspended in cyberspace for many 
hours before it was delivered.  Consequently, we are extending the deadline 
to notify us if you have clients to add until 4 p.m. Central TODAY, June 6.
