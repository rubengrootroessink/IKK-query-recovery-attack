Subject: Responses to FERC Data Request

Attached are the cover letter and narrative responses ENA will provide this 
afternoon to FERC for the non-public investigation into California natural 
gas prices.  Please advise me as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  

These are basically requests for the same information as we have provided 
previously in the San Diego  and the CPUC complaint proceedings.  The main 
difference is in the time period covered.  The San Diego and CPUC data 
requests were for November-December, 2000 and January-April, 2001, 
respectively, and this request is for information from May 1999 for any 
contracts in effect on May 10, 2001. 

I am still waiting for the files with the actual data, and I will forward 
them as soon as available.
