After the completion of lengthy legal review (which concluded the invoices 
were correctly due and payable), please have Tenaska IV Texas Partners pay 
SWPC's charges for the February and April outages.  I show that these 
invoices total $1,627,541.81.  Additionally, these invoices need to be paid 
for us to file our insurance claim related to the outages (claims process 
currently underway, recoverable amount of the invoice totals less $500,000).

For everybody concerned, we will inform Tenaska of our decision by cc'ing 
their insurance representative, Doug Troop, on our claim notification letter.

If for any reason, we cannot immediately pay these invoices, please contact 
me immediately, as I have a meeting with SWPC tomorrow on other matters and 
they will be inquiring about the status of payment.

Thanks,  Chuck Ward
