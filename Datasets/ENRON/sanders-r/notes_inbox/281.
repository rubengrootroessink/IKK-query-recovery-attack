Subject: CORRECTION -- "THE NUTCRACKER"



All tickets should have the $.25 service charge, which you did not include in 
the cost of the ticket.  I have included that service charge in the amounts 
shown above.  However, you will need to collect that amount from each person 
for the remaining 52 tickets ($13.00).  The Club had to pay this service fee 
for all the tickets (59 x .25 = $14.75).  

A breakdown of that amount will be as follows:
Lois Black =   $1.00
Candy Willard =  $1.00
Paulita Olvera =  $0.75
Nicole Mendez =  $0.75
Tammy Kovalcik = $0.50
Paige Wilkinson =  $0.50
Valeria Hope =   $1.00
Susan Skarness =  $0.75
Bill Rogers =   $0.75
Leesa Hutcherson = $0.75
Blanca Martinez =  $0.75
Antoinette Forret = $0.75
Lupy Gonzalez = $0.00 (paid in check above)
Dianne Langeland = $1.00 (given to Margaret with paperwork)
Debbie Roman = $0.75
Tommy Garza =  $1.00
Richard Sanders $1.00
Sarita Garza =  $0.00 (included in above)

Please discuss this outstanding amount of $13.00 with Margaret.  I think the 
best is for you to pay this amount to the Club and then you will be 
reimbursed when you collect the outstanding service fees from the individual 
purchasers.  (I will give Margaret the $1.00 for service charge on my tickets 
and that will leave you a $12.00 amount to collect.)

If you have any questions, please let me know immediately.  

Thanks,

Dianne
