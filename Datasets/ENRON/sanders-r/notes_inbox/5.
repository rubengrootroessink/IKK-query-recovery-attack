After tennis yesterday with Dave Kleiman counsel to the creditor's committee 
our conversation turned to Heartland Steel.  You will recall that the 
committee  had launched a series of 2004 exams concerning activities of the 
company board.  It appears that the committee is looking at potential actions 
against the board arising out of decisions to create short term operating 
capital by stretching unsecured creditors.  David, intimated to me that they 
had discovered certain minutes of the board which discuss these issues 
specifically.
