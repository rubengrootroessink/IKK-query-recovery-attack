I assume that you have seen the attached letter from Grynberg by now.  For
some people it would be amazing.  For Grynberg, it is simply typical.

Working through the Coordinated Defendants group, it seems to me that the
two viable options are (1) telling Grynberg to get lost or (2) ignoring him.
If you have something else in mind, please let me know.  Thanks.
