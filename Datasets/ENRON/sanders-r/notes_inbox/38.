I talked to Claudia about this and she says that she has not seen it since we 
found it some two months ago and gave you the only executed copy we could 
find.  We checked with the vault to see if they had a copy.  They do not.  I 
searched your green files and miscellaneous papers in your office -- all to 
no avail.  Can you remember what you did with the copy I gave you?
