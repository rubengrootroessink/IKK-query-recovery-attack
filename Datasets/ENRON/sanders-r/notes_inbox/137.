I see no problem in obtaining a signature to the Statement currently drafted 
for
Eric Tan.  It is his evidence after all and I doubt if there will be much
substance to change.  We can keep it in our files as a privileged document
without any obligation to disclose it.  When we are firmly into the 
proceedings,
we shall have to think about disclosing a Statement of Eric Tan if that is 
what
we want to do.  It may be, as the case develops, we will want to either delete
or add to the Statement by asking more questions.  For this purpose, it is a
good idea to remain in contact with Eric Tan.  I do not think we need to have
anything as formal as a consulting agreement.  It is just important that one
person makes sure that we know where Eric Tan is at all times in the event 
that
we need to contact him.

In the meantime, SRT are going to appoint a UK chemist and are pressing
Mitsubishi very hard now for formal consent to the release of the samples.  I
think I shall firm up on the appointment of the arbitrator (now agreed to by
SRT) when we have the decision on the samples.  Obviously I have pointed out
again on the telephone the potential shelf life problem.

Regards,
David Best.
