Attached is a draft arbitration demand our outside counsel has prepared on 
the confidentiality issue only.  For what it is worth, outside counsel does 
have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, 
they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we 
might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this 
argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the 
arbitration statement of claim.  We will need to do some additional legal 
research to make sure that would do the trick.  Second, outside counsel tends 
to think the two claims together (confidentiality and the guarantee 
assignability) work better together.  Let's talk soon.
