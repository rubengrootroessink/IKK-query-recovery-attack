Attached are (1) highlights from the fourth, fifth, and sixth days of 
Stickler's deposition and (2) a summary of what I have learned so far about 
the fees that Enron received in the transaction.

Because Stickler is dragging on, Roland will relieve me at the end of the day 
Monday and effectively lower the cost of Enron's having an attorney covering 
the deposition.? We think we do need some continuing presence at the 
deposition, because Stickler continues to testify about Enron's roll in the 
offerings from time to time; and we want to go back at the end and press him 
for specifics where he has alleged general participation by Enron.? We think 
Stickler will not be able to come up with anything specific when pressed and 
his general testimony will be exposed as bluster.
