Richard: 

Mike Swartz was the sole questioner of Busse on Friday.? He focused primarily 
on the theme that the offering memorandum misreprested the use of proceeds 
(which, in hindsight we know, it certainly did--i.e., unscheduled pay offs of 
bank debt and lots of previously unscheduled fees.)

Neither Swartz nor any other questioner asked about the off-take agreements 
(though those agreements are featured in nearly all of the complaints.)

Swartz asked loosely if there were any Enron people at the roadshows, and 
Busse answered yes.? So I asked a few questions--brought out that only Brian 
ever attended any road shows and that he did not speak.

Roland will be in Fort Wayne next week for Nolan's depo and will continue on 
to New York for Izowar's depo (White & Case) on Friday, 7/21.? I will cover 
Goldstein (Oaktree) in LA on Wednesday.? We are going to skip a 
NatWest/personal jurisdiction deposition in New York on Tuesday.

Schultes will be deposed in NY during the week of 7/31.
