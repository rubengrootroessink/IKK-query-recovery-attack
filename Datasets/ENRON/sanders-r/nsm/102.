well, we finally received from counsel for one of the co-defendants - after 
much hounding - the key filings from the previous shultes case . . . and it 
looks like our decision not to pitch in for a lawyer for nsm managment co. 
("nsm co.") was a smart move.  it turns out that when the plaintiff moved to 
add nsm co., our co-defendants' attorneys (who we have every reason to 
believe are going to effectively control nsm co's counsel) actually opposed 
the plaintiff's motion on the grounds, inter alia, that if the court allowed 
the amendment, THEY would have to bring in enron!  thanks a lot.  now we know 
where the plaintiff got the idea to sue enron.  thankfully, however, 
plaintiff's counsel disputed that enron was liable and would have to be 
brought in! you can be sure we will figure out a way to get these helpful 
statements into the motions we are drafting.
