Subject:??????? RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 

Dear Mr. Ngodngam: 

I very much like your idea of ECT's amending its claim to add a "condition" 
to the claim to accommodate W&C's position about the unenforceability of 
indemnity agreements vis-a-vis certain types of securities claims and not 
others.? Would you like me to draft some specific language.? (The language 
that you suggest in your e-mail is an excellent start, but it may need a 
little refinement in order to get White & Case to drop their objection.)

Have you heard from W&C-Bangkok or W&C-US?? We have not.? I am available for 
a conference call almost anytime. 

I do not think it is practical for U.S. lawyers to get to Thailand for a 
conference on Friday in Thailand.? Thursday, Nov. 23, is a major family 
holiday in the United States (probably the second biggest holiday in the 
entire year here.)? I am extremely reluctant to ask any U.S. lawyer to 
disrupt major family plans to attend this conference.? Is there any way to 
postpone it?

Has White & Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity 
claims.? That memo should go a long way toward showing W&C that we can 
probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to 
Thailand this week.

??????? ??????? Dear Khun Peangpanor / Khun Kasemsi 

??????? ??????? We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday regarding 
the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement. 

??????? ??????? As discussed, we would like to have a telephone conference 
call among W&C Bangkok and U.S., Milbank and us.? With respect to the 
objective of the conference call, we would like to propose that we discuss 
and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable. 
Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of 
E.C.T. Securities. 

??????? ??????? For example, our statement to the Official Receiver may say 
that "The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can 
be enforceable to the debtor (NSM) only in case 
[..........................]". 

??????? ??????? We need only the exact wording to be agreed on between W&C 
U.S. and Milbank.? We are not sure that it is possible that we say that "... 
only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for 
reasons of fraud or willful misconduct."?? (We just put the condition in the 
application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has 
occurred or not.? This fact will be proved in the future.? In case where 
E.C.T. Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future, 
it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred.) 

??????? ??????? We note from W&C Bangkok that W&C U.S. may call Milbank for 
a discussion on this matter today.? However, if you please forward this 
email to W&C U.S. so that the US lawyers of W&C can discuss with Milbank via 
email also. 

??????? ??????? If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday 
evening, Bangkok time, it seems that all of us may have to ask W&C U.S. and 
Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this 
Friday.? It is very possible that, should the Official Receiver give an 
order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by 
the loser.? Such will incur lots of cost for both E.C.T. Securities and NSM. 
Therefore, an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all 
parties. 

??????? ??????? If you have any question, please feel free to call us.
