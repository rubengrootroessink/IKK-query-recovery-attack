Richard: 

Here is a report on today's deposition. 

Roland will cover tomorrow. 

Next week we are going to try something different; we will attend by 
internet:? we get video, audio, and transcript, all real-time.? If this 
works, we should be able to cut down on live attendance (and save money) in 
the future.? I'll let you know.

Steve
