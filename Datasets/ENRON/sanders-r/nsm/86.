Here is the passage from the first day of Brian's deposition in which Shawna
Ballard, of Hennegan's firm, asked Brian substantive questions about his
meeting with her partner, Mike Swartz.

As a result of Ms. Ballard's asking these questions, the other defendants
asked Brian many questions about his meeting with Swartz and about any
meetings with other plaintiffs' counsel, which brought out the meeting with
Kathy.  The defendants established that Mike and Kathy both took notes during
their meetings; and defendants have now demanded those notes.
