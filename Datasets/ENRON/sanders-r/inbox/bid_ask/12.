I spoke with Bid/Ask's lead lawyer Sam Baxter earlier today about getting
together in person to have an off-the-record "settlement discussion" where
we would try to persuade him to drop his suit because we do not infringe. He
suggested Friday morning. If you want me to attend, we have to do it early
so I can catch my SW flight to Houston for the Halliburton docket call.
Please let me know your availability on Friday, and if not then, when.

Also, Dr Phil MCGraw ("Dr Phil" on the Oprah show) and his company Courtroom
Sciences is on board for witness prep and jury consulting - if we want to
use them. He has been told that ENRON may prefer someone it has worked with
previously, so let me know.
