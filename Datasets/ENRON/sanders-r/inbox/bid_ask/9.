	Richard, Pete Peterson cleared conflicts to work on the non
infringement opinion last week based on the idenity of the litigants, but
another issue has arisen. Pete is special master in a case in Dallas in
which McKool Smith is representing one of the parties. Although not
technically a conflict, Pete does not think he can become involved in this
case since he is serving a quasi judicial function in this unrelated case in
which he must rule for or against McKool Smith.  As a result, I am not on
the hunt for another opinion writer.
