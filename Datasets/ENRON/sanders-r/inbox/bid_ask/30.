At Richard Sanders' request, we ask that you freeze destruction of electronic mail for the following individuals (effective immediately).  This request is made in regard to the Bid/Ask patent litigation.  We should retain their e-mail communications going back as far as possible.

	Jay Webb
	Kevin Montagne
	Jarod M. Jenson
	Mark E. Taylor (legal)
	Michael Guadarrama
	Louise Kitchen
	Marcello Romano (London)
	Rennu G. Varghese
	David Forster 

We will be sending an additional list of IT persons on Tuesday.  Please let me know what else I need to do to expedite this process.

Thank you for your help.
