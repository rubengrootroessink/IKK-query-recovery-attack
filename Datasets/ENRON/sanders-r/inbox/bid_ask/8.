The attached document outlines the current claim construction and
infringement issues for the independent claims of the Odom patent.  We will
want to go over this issue list with Jay Webb during our meeting tomorrow.
If appropriate, you may want to pass this memo on to Jay for his
consideration before the 2 pm meeting. Thank you.
