Richard: These are the newest documents we recieved from Jay Webb's group. I am printing the documents and stamping them privileged and confidential.  I will prepare a set to go to Peter Mims and Bill LaFuze via messenger.  

I understand Jay Webb is anxious about the distribution of these materials.  I have drafted a letter to Bill and Peter that indicates they should notify us before making any distribution of the materials.  Do we want to keep a log of which materials are sent to various individuals?  Let me know.

Leonardo, attached are three documents showing more detail information about the real time and non-real time parts of EnronOnline. Please note these are very specific to how EnronOnline works and should be very tightly controlled. Jay wants to know who gets these documents and to whom they are distributed.

   
Thanks,
Kevin Montagne
