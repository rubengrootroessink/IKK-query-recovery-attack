Richard,

Thanks for meeting with Paul and I yesterday.  As we discussed, I e-mailed
an initial request on 11/8 to Jenny Rub and Cris Sherman.  This previous
request (with some additions) is as follows:

     1.   Latest e-mail boxes and network file folders available for:
             Andrew Fastow
             Lea Fastow
             Ben Glisan
             Kristina Mordaunt
             Rick Buy
             Jeremy Blachman
             Anne Yeager
             Michael Kopper
             Kathy Lynn
             Chris Loehr
             Jeff Skilling
             Sherron Smith Watkins
             Joyce Tang (if an employee)
             Ace Roman (if an employee)

      2.   A list of all the laptop and desktop computers that have been
   secured by the company

      3.   A list of the dates that an e-mail backup tape has been retained
   for both lotus notes and outlook (Jenny         Rub mentioned that she
   has one backup at year end 2000 but there are others)

      4.   Access to Enron IT professionals in order to formulate
   procedures for identifying other network folders          of interest
   that would not be under an employees name (e.g., Ryan Siurek mentioned
   that Anne              Yeager may have maintained an LJM folder).

      5.   Access to the office contents of Ben Glisan and Kristina
   Mordaunt

      6.   A protocol for easy access to the office contents of Andrew
   Fastow, Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt.

      7.   A list of the documents that are being withheld for privilege
   purposes, or alternatively, redacted copies.

   We will also make additional requests shortly.  I will follow up with
   you later today.   Thanks for your help.

   Regards,

   Rick
