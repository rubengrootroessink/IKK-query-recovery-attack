Have been trying to run down Gordon White for several days regarding a
meeting. Finally talked to him today. He is out of town in North Carolina
the rest of this week and leaves for Sweden for almost two weeks this
weekend. THe earliest date we could set a meeting that accomodates his
schedule is Wednesday Dec 19th at Gordon's offices in Austin. I wanted to do
it earlier but Gordon is essentially out of pocket for almost three weeks.
Does this date work for you?
