	As you know, we received a letter from Rocky Mountain Helium ("RMH")  threatening litigation in connection with Enron's investment in Crescendo.  We believe that if RMH files suit, it will be in Federal Court in Denver. 
	Do you guys have a firm that you have used in Colorado (preferably Denver) that you would like me to call about this case?  
	Thanks in advance.
