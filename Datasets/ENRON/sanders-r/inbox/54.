BellSouth is offering us a great rate to Latin America which we can use if we move quickly.  I propose using their contract to buy from them -- they do not want to review the Enron agreement, plus theirs looks pretty light and allows monthly billing.  (If we ever sell to them we will use our contract).  The only business issues I have with their agreement are: (1) Rate increase should be 7 days; (2) All access and recurring charges on Exhibit 1 should be set to $0.

Please call to discuss.
