Following up on the earlier email I sent, it may make sense to delegate a
lot of the information gather than we will need for conflicts/disclosure
requirements (in the event of contingency planning) to Lisa Mellencamp. She
is so familiar with the informational needs that it will take some of the
load off of you.

If you think that makes sense, let me know -- or better yet, you can ask
Lisa to call Sylvia Baker at 713-546-5087, who has been charged with the
responsibility of getting this information together and into our system.

Thanks and I hope you get some sleep tonight.
