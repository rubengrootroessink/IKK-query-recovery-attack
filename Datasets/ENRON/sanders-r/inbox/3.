Cyndi --

Per your request, I attach a list of those individuals who are currently exempt from the electronic mail retention policy.  As I mentioned to you last week, we will soon be eliminating the EBS folks from this list (that is, all EBS employees will be subject to the e-mail retention policy).  I will give you more details later this week on when to put the EBS employees back on the e-mail retention policy.
Thanks.
