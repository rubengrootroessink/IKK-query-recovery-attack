The timing has become critical as to finishing the due diligence necessary
for us to formulate with some certainty our defenses and prepare for the
meeting requested by Bid/Ask to discuss the issues.  The answer is due a
week from today, and we still have the plaintiff's request that we meet on
Wed or Thursday of this week to discuss the merits of the case. We must get
the technical detail that we requested some time ago, have an opportunity to
review same, and probably discuss it with the Enron tech folks so that we
can prepare properly for advising you and meeting with the other side.  How
can we get this accomplished?
