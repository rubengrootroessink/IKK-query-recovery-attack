Attached is a preliminary draft of a memorandum on the Brazos damages issue. 
As was the case with the QF issue, I think that Brazos' position is not at 
all strong.

The memorandum needs to be authority checked and polished a little, but I 
believe that the conclusion is sound. Section 11.02 of the PPA is likely to 
be enforced as will the contract escalation provisions. We should discuss how 
much of all of this we should share with Tick.

Dan, could I get you to distribute the memorandum as appropriate? Thanks.
