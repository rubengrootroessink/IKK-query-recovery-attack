I agree on continuing to use the thin seal if row 1 blades are the root cause.

I spoke with various SWPC folks today and yesterday.  We should be receiving 
a comprehensive schedule by the end of the week with item detail and timing 
for the outage.  I mentioned that the lack of regular notification of the 
outage repair schedule was unacceptable.  We'll see.  I also mentioned that 
Brazos sent us a letter that was headed towards a "fit for usage" issue in 
the PPA and that ENA would look through any assertion to that as a SWPC 
problem.  Additionally, I mentioned that a CEO-level meeting was scheduled 
for next week to discuss the technical issues of various projects in the 
portfolio and that the SWPC situation (Tenaska and our delayed delivery) were 
item 1 on the agenda.  I also passed to SWPC that we bust the 65% before we 
bust the 80% test and that accordingly, a December finish is unacceptable.  
Fudges just a little, buit its frankly none of their business what the real 
date is.  I also reminded them that they owe me a fixed-price labor proposal 
by the end of the week.

Back  in the office on Friday.

Chuck
