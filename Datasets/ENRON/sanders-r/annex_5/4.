Dear Michelle,

Please find attached the Fee Letters Summary.

Regarding the proposal for other LDCs', we sent a letter to Sergio Assad on
09.25.01, in which we propose a 30% reduction in the fees we had proposed to
Elektro and CPFL, if another LDC decides to join Elektro and CPFL in the law
suits mentioned in the Fee Letters Summary. FYI, our proposed fees to CPFL
are on the same basis of the fees proposed to Elektro.

Please feel free to call me, should you need any clarification.

Regards,

Fabiano Robalinho
