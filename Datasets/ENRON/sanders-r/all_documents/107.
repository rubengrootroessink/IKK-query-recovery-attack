Richard --

Just spoke with Sheila Tweed.  She said the company filled the slot for
which we presented George Bernhardt and suggested I contact you about
the company's attorney needs.

We have an attorney who did a clerkship at Marathon Oil (Houston) while
a University of Connecticut law student.  Since graduating in '94, he
has gained legal experience solely in Moscow doing energy work while at
international firms (including the London-based Denton Hall firm).  He
has a project finance background which made me think of your team at
Enron.

Are these credentials which interest you and the company?  Please give
me a ring or drop a line letting me know when you get a moment.  I
appreciate.

Best regards,

Gm.
