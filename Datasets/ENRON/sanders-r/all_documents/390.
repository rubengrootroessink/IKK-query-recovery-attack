richard, thanks for your confirm as to filing.
what can we expect re the objection process? timeline, formal objection 
process etc?? how will our contingent indemnity claim be handled?
can you look to see what indenture trustee filed? whether other underwriters 
filed claims such as our indemnity claim? i am sure the documents are 
voluminous, but we would be interested in a summary.
thanks for your quick help and diligence.
feel free to email us as progresses. please copy both richard sanders and 
myself. richard.sanders@enron.com.
