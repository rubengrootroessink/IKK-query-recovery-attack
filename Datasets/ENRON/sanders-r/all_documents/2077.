One of my partners, David Schrader, was opposite Joe Dunn for four years in
litigation in Southern California.  He tells me that Joe's strength is his
presentation -- low key, sincere, effective in deposition, good with Judges.
However, he is not rated as being all that smart.  He still maintains an
office with Mark Robinson, a prominent heavy hitter plaintiffs' lawyer in
Southern California.  During this litigation, he was the coordinating
counsel for the plaintiffs in the breast implant litigation.  Thus, he is
very well connected to the plaintiffs bar and they probably funded part of
his campaign.  David believes that Dunn aspires to higher offices.

One other partner, Greg Williams, reports that he knows Joe Dunn very well.
I will report as soon as I have spoken with  him.

Thanks
Gary
