Hi Linda

I have just faxed to you the statement that reflects the various items 
charged by Watson Farley, which was attached to Watson's invoice.  My 
apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Angie

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.
