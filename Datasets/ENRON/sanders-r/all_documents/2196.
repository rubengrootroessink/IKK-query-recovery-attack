Steve,

I will have Lee, my a/a, call you and ask you and your colleague (the lady 
who came to our last meeting--with apologies, I forgot her name) to join me 
and Becky Zikes, my legal assistant, to review the file you sent me.  I will 
also give you my thoughts on further strategy and direction, which I have 
already discussed with Richard

Many thanks

Britt.
