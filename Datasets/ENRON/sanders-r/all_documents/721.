Attached are the volumes for 1999 that I sent to FERC in response to data 
request number 8.  I don't know if I kept a copy of the E-mail with which I 
forwarded these data responses.  

Also, I'm forwarding the response concerning the 2000 volumes.  FERC staff 
gave us additional time to provide this response as it took us a while to 
pull the WSCC information out of our national numbers.  As mentioned in the 
earlier E-mail I forwarded from Brian Harrington, FERC gave us confidential 
treatment of these numbers.
