I am in London this week for a hearing in the House of Lords on the appeal of 
a case we won last summer. It is a big case($130 million) and I am here with 
the General Counsel of Enron--- my boss's boss--- so I have to be on call and 
deferential at all times. We also brought along one of our top attorneys from 
Houston. Both he and the General Counsel are from Paschal High School in 
Cowtown.Tell me you won't be humming "Its a Small World After All" all day 
long. I have been traveling a ton lately. In the last ten days I have been to 
Portland, Calgary,LA, St. Louis and now London.  Julie has been a trooper. I 
suspect I would have heard more if her 8 week stay in Austin was not right 
around the corner. I will have all three kids for the entire time. We will 
only see Julie an the weekends---although I hope to take 2-3 Fridays off and 
go to the Perd to spend the weekend. Doug, John(we'll see) and I are meeting 
at the Perd in three weeks for a cleanup weekend. Everytime I go I get 
disgusted with the place.Lets face it, Mom and Dad are slobs and I am a more 
tidy person. The kitchen is so filled with crap it is hard to find anything. 
I can hear Dad now---"I want people to be able to come here and not worry 
about food" It was a good theory but he brought and bought lots of stuff. How 
many cans of anchovies do you need? On last count there were 20. 

Matthew is starting to say words---Mama, B for Ben, and on occasion Dada. He 
starts at Post Oak School next week.Julie has been substitute teaching and 
student teaching all semester so she will be down the hall from all 3 of the 
little monsters. Ben is reading and starting to ask question about 
uncomfortable things like why Uncle Jim and Nene(Aunt Jean) are not married. 
I have told him that it is morally wrong and repugnant for two men to have 
sex with each other, but women getting it on is a different story altogether, 
especially if it is on cable TV. He has also stated getting kisses from girls 
at school so I'm hoping the Parraguirre curse skips several generations. I 
know that is not PC, but homosexuality is not something you would wish on 
anyone,especially your child. Oh, by the way if you are hesitant to reveal 
something to me in light of these statements, just know that I love you no 
matter what.
