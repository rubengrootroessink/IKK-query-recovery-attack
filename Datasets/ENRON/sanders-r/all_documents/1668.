Richard,
     Nice to hear from you and about you and Julie and the kids!  What a
brood!  Three boys, must be good sperm (unlike mine I guess).  We also have
been keeping up with your family through Camille.  We haven't spent as much
time with you Mom since Fred died but that is more related to my lack of
free time since I moved my practice to Denver than anything else.  That and
the kids growing up and completely consuming any free time we do have.  Are
you still skiing?  If so you should get up here sometime and ski with us as
a family.  It's the one thing (other than reading) that we all do well
together.  We've been 8 out of the last 10 weekends which means nothing gets
done around the house!
     Yes, I caved and went where the money was but I only represent
recidivist fraudsters taking advantage of the irrational exuberance of poor
white trash retired school teachers!
     We hope you are still having fun.  Say "hi!" to the rest of the family
and lets figure out how to get together for a reunion sometime.  Do you guys
still go to Marble? Maybe we could work something out there like take over
the entire place!

All the best,

Roger
