Unfortunately, I will not be coming after all (it looks like we have it 
covered w/Jim,Robin Gibbs, and Mary Nell) However, I would like to sit down 
with you at some point and discuss Europe's litigation management strategy. 
Hope all is well.

Richard,

thanks for the voicemail.

We should definitely get together next week. Your assistant can coordinate 
this through mine - Tracy Foy on 44 207 783 7374.

If you are able to speak to the trading lawyers on lessons learnt from 
California, that would be great. Again, Tracy can coordinate.

I attach an org chart showing the lawyers in the group, for your info. Let us 
know if you want to meet up with anyone in particular. 



Litigation we have on going at the moment:

- ICI warranty litigation: legal: Jon Chapman, commercial: Matthew Scrimshaw

- CATS: legal: Mary Nell Browning, commercial: Peter Crilly

- Metals arbitrations: legal: Paul Johnson, commercial: various.

If you want to meet any particular commercial person, we can also broker that.

I'm in your hands. Let me know.



     Mark
