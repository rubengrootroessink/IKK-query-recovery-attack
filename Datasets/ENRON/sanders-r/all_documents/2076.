Diann,

Attached is the final copy for the letter to the California residential 
customers.  It has received everyone's seal of approval. 
There are two documents: document I with the telephone number of the customer 
representative for EESI customers (1-888-367-6610) 
and document II with the telephone number of the customer representative for 
EEMC customers (1-800-743-1700).  Diann, would 
you please double check those numbers to make sure I have them right.  Thank 
you.
