The 8th at 8:30 is good. The extension is fine as long as it is short.

		 Subject: Settlement Conference Call




The Trustee has proposed a conference call with Paulker on Nov. 8th beginning 
at
8:30 am our time.  Are you both still available and want to go forward at that
time.

Also, they have asked that we agree to delay the briefing on the arbitration
motion.  The request, from Jane, is that they would like to first see if we 
can
resolve this without the need to incur more legal fees and that a delay of a 
few
weeks to allow that process to continue will not prejudice either party.  The
schedule right now, as set by the court yesterday, is the Trust's response is
due on Nov. 13th. and our reply would be due on Nov. 17th.  The court is
scheduled to hear argument on Nov. 28th.

I like the idea of keeping pressure on them, but I don't view an extension as
unreasonable or as prejudicial to EPMI.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.
