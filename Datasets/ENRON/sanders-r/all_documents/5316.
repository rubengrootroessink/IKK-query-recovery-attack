Great -- I look forward to receiving your proposed reply. Once the "Enron" 
team is comfortable with its position, I have no objection to coordinating 
with the other defendants -- primarily because we would like to know the 
position of each of the Coordinated Defendants, but it would seem to me that 
interest in resolving these cases (or at least hearing what Grynberg would 
propose) should be an independent, company by company, determination.

In process.  We will coordinate this with the other defendants, as the
letter did not come directly to us.  Note also that we have served (but have
not filed) Rule 11 motions on Grynberg.  A reminder of that may be part of
the response.

Do we need to discuss an "Enron" response to Figa or do we already have
one?
