Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento
counsel to Senator Dunn.  In paragraph no. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how
small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.  He suggests that
the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the
market.  He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the
data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by
looking at the data of a few "generators".

This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland
gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have
been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron
should be included in the process.  It may be that the inference will turn
out not to be accurate.  That is all the information we have on the subject.


Thanks.
Gary
