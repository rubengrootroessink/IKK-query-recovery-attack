Matt,

Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best, given that we already 
put underwriters on notice that there was contamination, and given that we 
have worked closely with Minton's, underwriters' representatives, I would 
assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a  total 
quantum before the joint survey  takes place; in fact, it looks like the 
final determination of ECT's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the 
results of the joint survey (although I would not necessarily want to say 
that to underwriters at this point).  

My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which 
would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum. The policy 
specifically requires, under "INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS", that ECT file a 
claim in writing against the "delivering carrier holding him responsible as 
soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is 
not apparent; details can be furnished later.  Such action will not prejudice 
your insurance claim."  Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent 
policy; I have already sent a copy to David.  

I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the 
cargo currently in Thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00 
a.m. Houston time to discuss.  Although I know that is quite late for you, 
you are more than welcome to participate (just e-mail me a telephone number 
at which you can be reached, or give me a call at that time).

   Regards,
   Britt

Britt

With reference to Cliff Bennett's note, do you know whether our cargo 
underwriters require notice of the amount of our potential claim? As you 
know, previous figures were very rough estimates and only considered the 
rejected cargo and associated freight and demurrage. We have not computed the 
costs of the Thai cargo loss (if any) and the various testing and analyses 
costs.

Regards
Matt

FYI - Please see below Cliff Bennett's recommendations for joint testing.

I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in 
Thailand. He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some 
time end August/early September premised on delivery and acceptance of the 
first Elang cargo and subject to First Gas's consumption.

Cargo still not sold. Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the 
cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price, but will be giving it 
somethought to arrive at an estimate.

The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive, 
but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec, but principal reason for not 
delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D3605 as a test method.

Summary of Thailand samples test results:

6 July 2000 - Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was 
tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt. Filterable 
Dirt was off spec at 6.3; Carbon Residue 10% was off spec at 1.5. SGS 
Thailand suggested that the  Carbon Residue 10% result was questionable and 
recommended retesting. There were however, no other ship composite samples 
taken before discharge in Thailand. Shoretank samples tested by SGS Thailand  
for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt on the same date were on spec.

12 July 2000 -  Thailand shoretank samples brought to SGS Singapore tested on 
spec except for Lead which tested off spec at 0.3 (T-961) and 0.2 (T-964). 
"Ashing" test used for metals.

13 July  2000 - Thailnd shoretank samples brought to Caleb Brett Singapore 
tested on spec, but note different test method used (D5184/5185).

14 July 2000 - Thailand shoretank samples re-tested for metals by SGS 
Singapore:

Direct D3605
Vanadium off spec at 0.9 (T-964)
Lead off spec at 0.8 (T-961); 1 (T-964)
Vanadium + Lead off spec at 1.2 (T-961); 1.9 (T-964)

"Ashing"
Lead off spec at 0.3 (T-964)


Regards
Matt

Matthias,

As per my e-mail dd. 3rd August to Eric, from cargo Interests viewpoint it
is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options
open as possible. Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of
establishing the cause. To that end, I would recommend that you provide the
other Parties with the test methods (ASTM D-numbers) and state that these
tests will be applied to retain samples from each of:

1. Pacific Virgo before & after loading, Australia (all cargo)
2. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Batangas-nominated tanks, if
samples available)
3. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Thai-nominated tanks)
4. Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas (the samples upon which First Gas based
their rejection)
5. Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas (including bottom samples)
6. Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea (including bottom samples)
7. Pacific Virgo, any other samples that are available and that might
progress the investigation


Some testing may involve composites, some individual samples. This will to a
degree depend on the lab's ability to get any particulates into homogeneous
suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite. If that
can't be done, it will have to be individuals.

Insofar as identifying the particulates, should this prove necessary, I
think we need to keep all options open. While it is always possible to
perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise, better to keep the
Parties together if possible. But not at the expense of limiting the
analysis' ability to determine cause.

I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly. But if you limit at the
beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary, it can
all prove meaningless.

I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this. It is in
no-one's interest to do testing just for the sake of it and, as far as I am
concerned, that is not on my agenda nor, I am sure, is it on Enron's. But we
must be realistic. Depending upon the size of your potential claim (have
Underwriters been put on notice yet, by the way?), it might be worth
spending several $K to get to the root of the matter, rather than less to
learn nothing.

Best regards.

Cliff Bennett
