Brian:

As I opened my e-mail, I find that I did not receive the document.   However,
in an effort to move this forward, I am forwarding this e-mail with my
proposed changes.  I will have my secretary finalize this first thing
tomorrow morning.  In any event, the proposed changes are as follows:

    1.Under the "Strategy/Action" section of Comparable Contracts we should
add:
        ENA is seeking market quotes

    2.Under the "Summary" section of Price Reopener Cap, it should be changed
to
        It should be redetermined.

    3.Under the "Duke Position" section of the Shipping section, it should be
stated
        that this has not been addressed.

    4.Under the "Duke Position" section of the Applicability section, the
words "or
        should be redetermined" should be added.

    5.Under the "Strategy/Action" section of the Document Request Section,
the
        following should be added:

        ENA has agreed to some requests and Duke will respond to our letter.

    6.Under the "Economic Hardship" section, the following changes should be
       made:
        a.  Duke Position-Duke will declare hardship after the presentation
of
              Initial Positions.

        b.  Strategy/Action-ENA will research this issue for arbitration.

    7.Under the "Strategy/Action" section of Applicability, the strategy
should be
        ENA adopts a strict contract interpretation approach.

I hope this is helpful and I will finalize this early Monday.  Let me know if
you have any additional thoughts.  You can e-mail me or leave me a voice mail
at 713-853-6911.

Jeff
