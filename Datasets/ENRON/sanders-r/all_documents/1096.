Richard: 

Here is a report on the fifth day of Max Holmes' deposition.? The deposition 
is not complete but the next sessions have not yet been scheduled.? We are 
not inclined to return to NY for further sessions of this deposition, unless 
Bruce MacLeod tells us he is going to ask questions about Enron, and then we 
will try to go only for that day.

Steve
