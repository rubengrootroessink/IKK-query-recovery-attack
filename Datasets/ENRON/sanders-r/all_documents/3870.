Richard, did you ever have a chance to pull the July, Aug. phone tapes for
Ed Baughman? While we are waiting on service on Calpine I would like to go
ahead and review them if possible.

 Do you have lunch plans today? If not, do you want to meet at the new Post
Oak Grill (under Reliant's building) for a quick bite to eat?  Let me know.
Laura
