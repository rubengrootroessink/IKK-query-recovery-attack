I have reviewed the proposed filings with FERC, at least the latest drafts.
There were two issues related to the definition of market power and the
proposal for penalties for underscheduling load that I believed needed to be
changed and they were.  I believe those documents will be filed in the next
few hours.

As to CPUC, Harvey Morris has been tied up on the PUC's FERC filing and has
not called us.  Mike Day anticipates a call early Monday.   So far, no news
is good news.

If you need to reach me this holiday, I will be at our house in Inverness,
California.  (415) 669-1531 and I will check email periodically. Please have
a pleasant Thanksgiving with your family.

Thanks
Gary
