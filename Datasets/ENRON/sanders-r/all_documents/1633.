I took an online course last month and would like to take another. I have 
forgotten my password/id and I can't login. Can you send me an enail with 
this info. Also-- I have lost the course # for the seminar I took last month 
entitled " Ethics For Inhouse Lawyers" which was a 3 hour course. Could you 
send me this? Thank You
