I will be traveling quite a bit over the next few weeks.  I am here all
week, so it is good we are having several meetings this week, but I will be
in London all next week.  I will have access to both my E-Mail and Voicemail
from UK.  From Friday 11/17 through Thanksgiving week I will be out of town
but in the U.S. so in addition to E-Mail and voicemail, I will be reachable
by cell phone (713-515-3461).  I also will have my Blackberry so E-Mails
will get to me instantly. Thanks.
