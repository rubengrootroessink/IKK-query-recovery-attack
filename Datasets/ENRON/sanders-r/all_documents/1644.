Thought you ought to be aware of the following.

1. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board
DPC received a letter from MPCB asking it to cease generation until a Consent 
to Operate is obtained. Kraske and his team are dealing with this. We have 
heard that MPCB is likely to make a further visit to the site today to "dig 
up the drains" and clearly the water pollution issue could arise as part f 
that visit. The visit is rumoured and may not be fact as yet. Suhas has asked 
Atul R to start working on a petition re the ceasing of generation issue. My 
read of this is that the original approval given by MPCB clearly contemplates 
that DPC is allowed to generate electricity while it is testing without a 
Consent to Operate; it can do so under its Consent to Establish which was 
given prior to financial close. MPCB disagreed at the time of the testing of 
Phase I but seemed to have conceded the point eventually and DPC did test 
before obtaining the Consent to Operate. This time DPC wrote to MPCB and told 
them that it was going to test. MPCB wrote back and said that it should not 
do so until a Consent to Operate had been obtained. DPC seems to have ignored 
that instruction from MPCB and proceeded to test and export power to MSEB. 
MPCB then visited the site and discovered that testing was going on and that 
evening sent a letter to DPC asking it to stop generating. DPC may have to 
file a writ petition on the generation issue - a meeting has been requested 
with MPCB but has been declined.
On the rumoured site visit it seems that MPCB will turn up in force and no 
doubt will find a number of things however minor. 
My instinct is that this will end up in litigation in some form or other but 
that it is going ot get very nasty. The Chief Minister is reported to have 
gone on the offensive as far as the pollution issues are concerned.

2. Nagpur Petition
You will have read in the clippings that a GC Singh has filed a public 
interest petition in the Nagpur High Court. I am trying to get hold of the 
petition. DPC was apparently not a corespondent but the Court seems to have 
issued a notice to DPC (which has not been received by DPC as yet) requesting 
it to show cause as to why the petition should not be admitted. Atul R has 
said that there may be a possiblity of knocking this out of the Nagpur Court 
on the basis that that Court does not have jurisdiction over a matter which 
has at its root a project in the Ratnagiri district which district does not 
fall within the list fo areas that can be covered by the Nagpur Court. Atul R 
is confirming this with Atul S. The Court seems to have given a time limit of 
6 weeks in which DPC is required to send in an affidavit although some 
reports in the press say that (i) the petition has been admitted and (ii) 
that there is a hearing in 7 days time. Atul R's sense is that the petition 
has not been admitted and that we have a 6 week period. More will be revealed 
when we get a copy of the petition which hopefully is today. Press reports 
indicate that the petition alleges the usual bag of things. 

3. Invoices
Can Chris/Kelly please let me know if they have copies of the January and 
February invoices. On the declaration issue you ought to know that DPC has 
agreed a deal with MSEB whereby DPC waives the requirement of MSEB to 
dispatch a minimum of 180MW and instead DPC will supply Block B testing power 
instead of Block A power. Testing power is, under the PPA, to be paid for by 
way of a Commissioning Fee (basically fuel costs) which is payable once the 
Block has entered into ECS. The deal (recorded in letter agreements) is that 
in return for MSEB taking the testing power and not beong obliged to take the 
minimum of 180MW it will pay the Commissioning Fee monthly instead of at the 
end of the testing period. [I think that this has a negative impact on the 
MPCB generation issue as DPC is receiving income from the sale of power 
(albeit small) before it has a Consent to Operate - but I am not aware of the 
full facts and this may be wrong]
