The attached comments for ENA and EES will be filed with FERC this afternoon 
in response to their request for comments on reimposition of the maximum rate 
price caps on short-term capacity releases into California.  The request for 
comments was issued in the proceedings for the San Diego complaint and the 
LADWP complaint against El Paso.

In our comments, we briefly summarize our view of how the California natural 
gas problems developed, explain how a basis differential differs from 
transportation costs, and answer the Commission's five questions.  Our major 
points are that reimposition of the price cap will not do anything to further 
reduce natural gas costs, that the market is already responding to the 
pricing signals because several pipeline projects have been announced which 
would increase capacity into and within California, and that FERC should not 
reimpose the price caps.

Please let me know ASAP if you have any problems with this filing.  I will 
have to release it to the D.C. office for filing by no later than 2:30 this 
afternoon.
