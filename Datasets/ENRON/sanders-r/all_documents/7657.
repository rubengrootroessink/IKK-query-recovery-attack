Ron,

Attached is a more refined version of the affidavit. Also attached is a
short to do list.  The most notable item on it, which we may not have
discussed of recent, is that Mary wanted someone in Tim's organization
to work on the harm to commercial interests aspect.  Also, not noted at
all is that this needs some sort of review to ensure I'm not including
anything inappropriate.

I'm going to be out for the mid part of today.  Can we touch base on the
process from here on out?

Thanks,
Ellen.
