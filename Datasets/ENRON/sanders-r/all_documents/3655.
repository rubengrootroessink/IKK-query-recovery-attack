John had asked that I re-examine the issue of closure of Daesan port in 
relation to a possible claim against Hyundai. 

Below is the e-mail received from Jung-ah of our Korean office which I 
forwarded to WFW to comment. WFW has reverted to say that their opinion that 
we do not have an action against Hyundai does not change. I will forward 
their response separately.

Below is an e-mail from our Korean office on the closure of the relevant 
port. Please comment on whether your advice on an action against Hyundai 
changes in its light. 

Thank you

As per the Daesan port closing date,
according to the Port authority, Daesan port/ Hyundai Oil berth was closed 
from 0910HRS/ 20th to 1535HRS/ 21st.
Daedong Marine Service Co. said it was 0910HRS/ 20th to 1620HRS/ 21st.

I've asked whether they can provide this in writing already, but both of them 
were reluctant to give it us.
FYI, they don't receive any kinds of official letter regarding port closing 
schedule/ notice because 
supplier which is Hyundai oil decides upon situation case by case. 

Best regards,
Jung-ah

I have called Mssrs Daedong Marine Service Co. Ltd. to find out if the 
Hyundai Oil berth was closed during the period of 17/9-22/9 but unfortunately 
the person in charge does not speak English, he could only speak Korean or 
Chinese. Could you please get some one from your organization to call Mr Yang 
at the telephone number (82-455)-6605171.

Best Regards / Christos
