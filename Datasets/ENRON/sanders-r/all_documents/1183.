 Thanks for agreeing to help us preserve electronic communications and audio 
tapes pertaining to: George McClellan, Matt Arnold, Dan Reck Wayne Gresham, 
Tim Woj.,  Kevin McGowan and Richard Sanders.  As I understand it, all 
document destruction policies pertaining to their stuff will be suspended and 
we will ultimately be able to search through all of year 2000 for relevant 
information.  Please let me know where the information ends up so our outside 
counsel can get it when they need it.  In the meantime, please let me know if 
you need anything from me.
 Thanks again for jumping on this so quickly. Happy holidays.
