From the attached  email, you'll see that the litigation involving United
Illuminated does not involve Enron in any way.  Hopefully, this will clear the
way to retain Liz, and I will proceed on that assumption per your voice mail.
If Jim believes it is a problem, then we will switch.  Thanks.

I checked with my partner and he assures me that the claims against U.I. do
not in any way bring into question the conduct of Enron.
I am available anytime after 2:30p.m. E.S.T. to call Trustee's counsel.

By voice mail, Richard Sanders, Assistant General Counsel, does not believe
that
the United Illuminating will be a conflict provided that the litigation
against
United Illuminating does not challenge any conduct of Enron, which is the
power
manager for United Illuminating.  Could you check on that with your
colleague
and let me know.  Assuming that Enron's conduct is not directly implicated
in
the litigation your firm has against United Illuminating, then I think
you're on
board (Richard did want to get the General Counsel's sign off, but does not
anticipate a challenge).

 Enron has now received the complaint.  I would like to call Kaye Scholer
this
afternoon.  Are you available to be on the call, and  if so, what time works
for
you?

Thanks and I hope we get to work together on this matter.
