You should be aware that I was advised yesterday by Larry Charach of the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development that the Market Surveillance 
Administrator has prepared a "status report" on the Alberta electricity 
market which will be made public on Monday.   The Minister also disclosed the 
existence of the MSA Report during a speech yesterday and said: "As Minister 
of Resource Development, I will be taking a very close look at the MSA's 
Report when it is delivered in the      coming days".   Larry Charach told me 
that he doesn't know what the report will say or conclude but did say that he 
expects the report is "likely to raise some controversy".   I will circulate 
a copy of the report once I receive it.
