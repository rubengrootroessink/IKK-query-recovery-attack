Attached please find the draft letter we sent to EnBW end of last week 
summarizing our meeting we had with EnBW on March 8, 2000.

We are expecting EnBW to contact us this week to inform us about their 
progress regarding the network operator that defaulted on EnBW with regard to 
the Transaction Agreement between Enron and EnBW.

  



Regards,
Michael
