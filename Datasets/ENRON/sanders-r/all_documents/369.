Lisa,

This is the info from Laynie in accounting. She confirmed the number of 
equity shares (40,992,500) with Richard Lauer. Did you by chance add the 
number of C note units to the equity? That would add to around 51mm shares. 

The aschedule that Laynie has also calculates the principal and interest due 
to date. Call me if you have questions.

Brian,

I left you a voicemail about meeting to discuss the NSM information but in 
case we miss each other today, here is what we have.

-  Per Tab 25, page 2 and Schedule A of the contract, Enron owns 40,992,500 
shares.

-  The attached schedule shows interest calculated through July 31, 2000 for 
the Series C Notes.  On March 13, 1999, the interest rate was increased by 
1.5% per Tab 20, page 5 of the contract.

 

Please call if you would like to discuss further.

Thanks,
Laynie
