Thanks for the analysis, Mary.  It does a lot to clarify the context within 
which the PX is conducting their investigation.  If your analysis is right, 
it seems like the PX has virtually nothing to stand on.  But why do they 
continue to pursue a course of action that seems inconsistent with their 
tariff and FERC's recent rulings?  Why do you think the PX believes that they 
have a case (or the right to publish a letter about us) against us??  Before 
we meet with Sladoje, I'd like to get a better understanding of their 
legal/regulatory side of the argument.
