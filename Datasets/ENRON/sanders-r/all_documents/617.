Tom Hatch asked me today why Enron did not just settle cheap with Farallon 
and Legg Mason and walk away from all these cases.? I told him we were 
considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron 
by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom 
replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else 
would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most 
likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging 
conversation.
