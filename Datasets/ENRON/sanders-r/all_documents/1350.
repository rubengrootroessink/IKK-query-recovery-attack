> Following up our conference call with Richard Sanders earlier today, I
> have drafted a formal written request to California Power Exchange
> Corporation ("Cal PX") requesting release of a portion of the outstanding
> letters of credit posted by Enron.  As you will note by the bracketed
> material in the letter, there are a number of points that need to be
> checked.  I am not sure that we at Brobeck currently have sufficient
> documentation to write the definitive letter.

> There is no magic to the language of the letter.  Ideally the language
> describing the reasons why we are requesting the release of collateral
> should parallel the relevant provisions of the relevant Participation
> Agreement(s) and the relevant Tariff(s).  The only provision dealing with
> release of collateral that I have found in the documents that I have is
> Section 3.3.5 in the Information Guide for the CTS Markets, and that
> Section applies only to cash collateral.
>
> I suspect that Cal PX already has standard form notices concerning the
> release or reduction of outstanding letters of credit.  However, if a form
> is required, I can provide one.
>
> Feel free to pass the drafts and this email on to the client if you feel
> that it is appropriate.
