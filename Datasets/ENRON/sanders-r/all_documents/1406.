My lucky day; Bernie Glatzer called me tonight.  He wants to know what we
plan to do re his proposal.  I told him we were still considering how to
respond.  That took thirty seconds.  The rest of the twenty minute
conversation was not too different than an acid trip, as you can imagine.

Highlights:

1.  He may re-hire Boies & Schiller because Andy really likes the case
still.

2.  He just learned that the guy in the 2nd circuit clerks office whose
statement is in dispute was not really an employee or lawyer but rather a
student intern.

3.  He is preparing a "very complicated" motion, that may take some time.  I
can't wait.

He coughed a lot.  I told him we would probably get back to him week after
next.
