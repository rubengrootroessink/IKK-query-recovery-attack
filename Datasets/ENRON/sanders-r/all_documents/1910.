>   Total         $63,636,628.29
>

>   Market         $912,155,397.59
> 
> 
> Funds available for distribution to market participants are reduced by the
> GMC shortfall, accordingly, $40,586,687.91 ($59,136,334.68 less GMC
> shortfall of $18,549,646.77) will be available for distribution against
> February ISO market accounts payable of $952,742,085.50, and against prior
> months balances.  Due to this shortfall in receipts from market debtors,
> the ISO is required to perform calculations in accordance with ISO Tariff
> Section 11 and Settlements and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6 to
> determine the appropriate pro-rata distributions to market participants.
> Any potential distributions are reduced to pay previously defaulted
> amounts, or current month GMC obligations of that market participant.
> Distributions will be made upon completion of these calculations.   These
> figures also do not consider any amounts payable directly to market
> participants from the California Department of Water Resources.
> 
> As noted in previous communications, the ISO will provide a comprehensive
> reporting of the monthly settlement results after the cash clearing for
> the final (true-up) monthly invoices, and will thereafter distribute a
> current certification of amounts owed.   This report for January 2001 will
> be published shortly.
