As you are aware, there is to be a meeting on Thursday,  June 8 at Enron in 
Houston. The purpose of this meeting is to resolve the  matters regarding the 
rupture of the Citgo pipeline near Luling, Texas.?  Although I will be in 
attendance on behalf of Enron, I intend to also serve as a  moderator of the 
meeting and as a quasi-mediator.
?
I hope that all will come with an open mind and in a  spirit of good faith 
to?resolve any disputes as to potential liability and  damages.? We have made 
arrangements for a conference room large enough to  accommodate all 
participants as well as separate meeting rooms for each  company.? We have 
reserved all day in case it takes that long. If you need  to leave early, 
please advise.
?
I would appreciate hearing from each of you during the  week of June 5 
confirming your attendance and indicating attendance of anyone  else with 
your company.? In addition, I would like to visit with you  privately by 
telephone before the meeting. To that end, I will call each of you  during 
the week of June 5 to discuss the matters involved.? I am interested  in what 
your expectations are -- what you want to accomplish as a result of the  
meeting.? I will also ask how?you believe the meeting should be  conducted; 
what the agenda should be.
?
With regard to the procedure, I suggest that Citgo "lay  out it's case" 
first.? What happened, the facts, whose fault, if any, you  believe it is.? 
After that I would suggest the same from Wilde, then  Bechtel and then 
Enron.? After a general discussion, I would suggest I  visit with the 
companies individually.? I don't think this needs to be  overly formal but 
that should be?an understood and agreed to structure to  the meeting.? I will 
prepare a written agenda to hand out at the beginning  of the meeting. We all 
want to make the best use of our time as  possible.
?
I will ask of each of you if you have insurance to cover  the loss and 
whether an insurance representative will be present.
?
If you have documents you would like to distribute in  advance, let me know 
that as well.
?
I have spoken the?attorney for the landowner and he  will be available by 
telephone.
?
I will keep all information you convey to  me confidential, except with the 
understanding that I may share that information  with Enron.? Also, I will 
share it with other company representatives only  with your permission.
?
I look forward to working with each of you to get this  matter resolved as 
soon as possible.? Please do not hesitate to call me.  Thank you for your 
attention to this matter.
?
