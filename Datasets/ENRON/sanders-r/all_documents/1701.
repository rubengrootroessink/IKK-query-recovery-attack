This is the matter I have been working on for Enron Metals.  Enron Metals 
hired Pan Ocean as charterer.  Enron Metals needed to ship some metal from 
somewhere in Asia to Baltimore.  The ship was arrested in Hawaii in November 
and has not sailed since.  We are going to file an arbitration against Pan 
Ocean seeking to recover the damages we have suffered as a result of not 
being able to get our product to Baltimore.  Estimated damages: approx. $1 
million.  We hired Heallie & Baille back in January to assist (not Leroy).

Enron Metals is considering filing a breach of contract arbitration 
proceeding against Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America.

If you are aware of any reason that Pan Ocean Ltd. and Panobulk America 
should not be sued, please call me at 713-345-7105 or e-mail me by the end of 
business on Monday, March 26, 2001.  If I do not hear from you by then, I 
will assume that you have no objection to Enron Metals instituting this 
litigation.

Thanks for your assistance.
