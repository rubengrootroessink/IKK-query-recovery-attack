Subject: Proposed Answer of CMUA's Complaint

As you have already heard, California Municipal Utilities Association filed=
 a=20
complaint with FERC asking for cost based rates. The following is a brief=
=20
outline of an EPMI/EES answer to the complaint.  The answer is due Friday. =
=20
Please send me any comments ASAP.=20

? The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the=20
Commission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to require=
=20
cost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems=20
currently faced by the California markets.  We should attach our white pape=
r=20
to our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could b=
e=20
solved at little or no cost to the customers. =20
? I list here, for your information, the reasons CMUA claims that markets a=
re=20
not competitive (these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading).=20
? 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load.
? zonal constrained prices, even in the off-peak hours, do not reflect=20
competitive outcomes for low load conditions. =20
? even small players can be price setters
? The changes required are additional generation, transmission, and demand=
=20
response and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periods=
=20
of time to implement.
? There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates i=
n=20
the near future.
? CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring, the Commissi=
on=20
has increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at=20
market-based rates.  However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wher=
e=20
there has been market-based trading of electricity before electric=20
restructuring, since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool=01,s=

in the past, the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up =

certain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper.  The=20
problem is not the market-based rates.  The problem is the market rules.

for marketers that do not sell power from their own resources, let alone=20
reflect the trading of basis points.  Almost all of the power EPMI sells is=
=20
power it has bought from some other marketer or generator.  Many of EPMI=01=
,s=20
deals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identit=
y=20
of the seller until after a deal has been struck.  Accordingly, EPMI gets n=

? If FERC doesn=01,t try to fix the market but simply takes away our=20

we would go out of business.  Besides there=01,s no reason to take away our=

market-based rates because we are not exercising market power.  So if FERC=
=20
could fix the problem with a less onerous solution (as we=01,ve proposed in=

white paper), requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taki=
