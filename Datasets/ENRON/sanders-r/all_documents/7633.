Attached is a?proposed agreement reflecting  Brazos limited waiver of its 
right to object to V&E participating in the  Facilitation. Please review it 
with your respective groups and get back to me  with any comments you may 
have.
?
Shortly, I will be sending you a first draft of  what I hope will be an 
agreed-upon list of issues that need to be resolved in  order to effectively 
address the damage question. 
?
Tom, I don't know if Carl has had a chance to let  you know that Brazos would 
like to change the date of the meeting of counsel to  either?November 9 or 
10. Could you please find out if one of those dates  meets with your group's 
approval? The meeting will be in Houston. 
?
Pat, if you haven't already done so, you need to  send a copy of your memo on 
damages to Tom.
