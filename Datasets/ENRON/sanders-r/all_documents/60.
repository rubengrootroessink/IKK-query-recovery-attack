It has either been settled or abandoned, but I haven't heard anything about 
the dispute in weeks.

I asked Bob Williams and he stated that as long as the dispute has been 
settled then there is no need to keep documentation.  You might want to 
confirm this with Richard Sanders who worked with us on this issue.  
Regards,
Brent

Brent,

Sara asked me to e-mail you to see if we should purge all of the 
documentation in connection with the recent dispute?

Thanks!

Marie
