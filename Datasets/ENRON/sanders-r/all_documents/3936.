Peter,

Following a last read through last night, I now attach the final versions of:

(a) the letter to Christopher Jones; and

(b) the "unattributable" Memorandum.

I am just about to have the letter signed by Joe, when we shall courier it 
with the Memo immediately to Christopher today.

Hence, please now feel free to e-mail the letter and the Memo to Christopher, 
as we discussed.

With regards to copying the letter to Mr Albers at DG Competition, Clifford 
Chance Amsterdam have advised that we do have to be a little careful with how 
he views the copy - if he treats it as being more formal than simply 
informational, then it could cut us off at the knees with our NMa Complaint.  
Hence, I am going to draft a brief letter this morning also for signing by 
Joe, which will stress that the copy is simply for informational purposes 
following a request made of you in this regard by Christopher in your recent 
discussions with him (i.e., Christopher) and to emphasize that we are already 
pursuing a Complaint on the issues with the NMa.  I will let you have a look 
at the draft covering letter, before I ask Joe to sign it, for your approval 
/ comments.

Kind regards - and many thanks for your help over the past few days with the 
above.

Mark
