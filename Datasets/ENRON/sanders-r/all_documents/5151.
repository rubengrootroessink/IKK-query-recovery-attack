Richard-

I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see 
if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would 
like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a "side letter" agreement 
drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also 
like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Russ
