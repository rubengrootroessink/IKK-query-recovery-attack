I'll give you a call Monday morning my time to discuss what to do about the 
$65,000.

Britt:

 I have two new pieces of information to pass on to you.  First, Mark
Gately talked to Judge Garbis' chambers earlier in the week. After
consulting with Judge Garbis, the judge's law clerk told Mark that, although
they understood MG Metal's need for a prompt resolution of this matter,
there were a number of extremely pressing matters pending now. Mark's
impression was that we are unlikely to get a ruling in the relatively short
term.
 Also, Bob Klide (MG Metal New York) informed me today that one of MG
Metal's customers mistakenly wired too much money into the escrow account.
Essentially, they included payment for both "tainted" aluminum (@ $130,000)
and "untainted" aluminum (@ 30,000) in a single wire transfer to Miles &
Stockbridge. We had the same issue arise with a different customer before
you became involved in the case. At that time, we all agreed with Arthur to
simply let the relatively small amount of additional money ($35,000) remain
in the escrow for the time being. We were somewhat concerned that in raising
the matter before the Court, we would necessarily have to disclose
customer/pricing information that we would prefer to keep out of the hands
of our opponents and/or their attorneys. Now that we have funds
approximating $65,000 mistakenly sitting in escrow, we might want to
re-evaluate whether we should try to get Court approval to release those
funds.
 Please let one of us know if you have any questions regarding this
matter.

Thanks,
Scott
