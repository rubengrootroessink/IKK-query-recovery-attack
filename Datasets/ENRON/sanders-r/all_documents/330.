Hi Travis,

Rick asked me to send you our Kafus memos.  I am not sure the scope of what 
you are looking for, so if you need more information, please let us know.  We 
have compiled quite a bit of information on this deal, including formal 
memos, summaries of employment and consulting agreements and summaries of the 
company.  I will send you all three, but please realize that only the formal 
memos are finalized, as I will note below.  Please let me know if I can help 
further.

Thanks,

Sharon Sullo

if you need them):


The following are summaries of Kafus Companies that we focused on.  These are

diligence process, but thought they might be useful to you:
