You and I spoke about this in October and concluded that we'd revisit the 
document after the legal summit but prior to the end of the year.  I'm 
attaching a redline version of the document Hugh Lennox sent to Carl in 
October.  Let me know when you have time to discuss the document this week 
and I'll make the arrangements.

Carl:
I am forwarding you an e-mail that I sent you earlier on the draft interim 
tolling agreement for the 5 MW of Tenaska capacity.  We have not heard back 
from you on this and request that you send your edits to us.  If there are 
none please let us know also and we will prepare the final document for 
execution.
Thanks
Hugh Lenox
