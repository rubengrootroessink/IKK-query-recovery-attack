Randy & Richard:

I am working with Scott Turner in connection with the possible assignment of 
shares of CanFibre from Kafus to Enron.  Under Canadian securities law, a 
company is required to disclose a "material change".  A material change 
includes a change in ownership that may significantly be expected to affect 
the trading price of shares of a company.  As a result of the order issued by 
the British Columbia Securities Commission, we believe that there is a 
disclosure obligation that affects at least CanFibre, and may affect Enron.

We have therefore drafted a proposed press release for CanFibre for your 
review and comment, and would ask that you consider whether Enron is also 
required to disclose the potential assignment.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Tamara
