As I reported to you from Irvine on Friday, I attended the hearing conducted 
by Senator Dunn in Irvine, California. It was sound bite city, with no good 
press for any generator or marketer.  At the outset of the hearing Sen Dunn 
stated that his committee had been in lengthy discussions regarding 
confidentiality issues with the generators, without success, and that they 
would be sending out subpoenas for records starting on Monday(today) and that 
the production of documents from Cal ISO was to start last Friday.  Sen Dunn 
spent much of the day making his public record , posturing about the 
difficulty of getting any documents from any generator or marketer because of 
claims of confidentiality, and how unresponsive FERC has been. He got the 
FERC lawyer, Robert Pease, to testify that any confidentiality afforded to 
the bid data at Cal ISO under the FERC tariff would end after 6 months. As 
you undoubtedly read, the PUC chairwoman had nothing good to say about the 
generators. Since the subpoenas will probably be forthcoming shortly, do we 
want to have a conference call of the group to discuss what transpired at 
Friday's hearing ? I am interested in knowing  how everyone intends to 
proceed in response to any subpoenas from the Committee,particularly after 
the failed efforts with the protective order. Please call me if we have not 
talked by phone when you get this.
