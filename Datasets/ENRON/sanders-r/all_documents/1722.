Y'all:

FERC has requested (see attached letter) data similar to the data we have
been ordered to provide beginning 1/1/01 but for the refund period that
began on 10/1/01 (i.e., they need data for the front end of the refund
period: Oct-Dec). December is due March 30.  October and November due April
6. I am working with commercial attornies (Steve C Hall) and with traders
(Jeff Richter and others) to prepare a report.

We are ascertaining whether we can meet the March 30 deadline and may need
to request an extension.

An open question is the extent to which we need to submit transactions for
pricetaker bids.  Since Jan 1 we have only reported transactions where the
bid was above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Using that criterion, we had no
transactions to report. There is also an open issue of how we report costs
since we are not generators.
