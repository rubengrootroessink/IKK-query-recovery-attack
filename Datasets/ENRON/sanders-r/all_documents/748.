Some news from the weekend:


UTILITIES/ENERGY: Calif. officials investigating Reliant Energy's 
 finances

 Los Angeles --- Reliant Energy is the subject of an investigation 
 by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer on allegations of price 
 gouging in the wholesale power market, Dow Jones News Service 
 reported, citing sources working on the investigation. Dow Jones 
 reported the attorney general is investigating how Reliant, a 
 generation company, was able to boost its third-quarter net profit by 
 25 percent to 30 percent above analysts' estimates compared with the 
 same period in 1999, according to the company's earnings statement. 
 The company has indicated that third-quarter earnings available for 
 equity will top last year's figure by about $110 million. Reliant 
 officials didn't comment on the matter.

No but we found out what they want.  They don't really want all the other 
stuff they asked for.  What they really want is our financial information 
(profit and loss).
