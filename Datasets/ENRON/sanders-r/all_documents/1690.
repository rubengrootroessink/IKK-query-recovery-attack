Richard --

We are moving forward with pushing FERC as the "right" forum for the Civil 
Litigation.   I want to talk with you ASAP about this strategy - mainly to 
make sure that you realize the likelihood of success (not too optimistic 
about a complete victory).

Also, the key is to build the right set of allies in moving forward - we need 
Mirant and Reliant to carry as much if not more water on this fight - their 
access to right FERC staff and Commissioners is pretty good.

Also, want to talk with you about all of the FERC matters we have on-going.  

Thanks,

Jim
