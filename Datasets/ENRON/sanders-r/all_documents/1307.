Katrin,

This is indeed a sensitive matter and must be treated accordingly. I do=20
strongly suggest that before anything you talk to Michelle Blaine of our=20
litigation team who is very up to date on the class action cases the=20
Costamabar comunity has against SECLP. There are many half truths and many=
=20
lies involved. The plant team has for long been aware of the responsability=
=20
and are very diligent and careful to comply with the environmental standard=
s=20
applicable.=20

One problem here is that across the bay from where we are, there are two=20
other power plants (one of them which I managed) and also produce "noise" a=
nd=20
air emissions, one within applicable World Bank standards but no the other,=
=20
which belongs to a third group. The prevailing winds bring the emissions fr=
om=20
those plants directly to our plant and the Costambar community. Our air=20
emissions (within WB standards - monitored during the year) mostly go down=
=20
wind southeast away from Costambar. So there are many variables involved.

We must be careful with the shareholder letter since it is very likely the=
=20
person may be part of the class action and is fishing for something. But=20
Michelle can advice you appropriately. If you need any further data from th=
e=20
plant after talking to Michelle please let me know.

Many thanks,          Otto

Otto,

The following shareholder complaint about Smith Enron's plant in Puerto Pla=
ta=20
was sent to Investor Relations and today forwarded to our attention,=20
requesting assistance with this matter.  The gentlemen sending the complain=
t=20
owns a home in Costambar, a residential community, which, according to his=
=20
e-mail, has been  negatively affected by our plant.  He mentions a disturbi=
ng=20
noise level, decreased air quality, dwindling property value and power=20
outages worse than prior to the plant going online.  The fact that we take=

any shareholder complaint very serious, I am preparing a response to this=

letter and I am asking for your help.  Could you provide me with any=20
background information on the alleged complaints and confirm or deny the=20
issues at matter?  Are there any plans on the way to address any possible=
=20
issues?  It had been my impression that the Smith Enron plant not only had =
no=20
negative effects on the environment but that great efforts were made to=20
improve the local community through community relations programs like the=
=20
public park adoption, supply of school materials, shipment of medical=20
supplies and the municipal nursery support.  Can you expand on this? =20

I realize that this matter has to be managed with extreme caution.  I clear=

will coordinate my reply with you and seek additional approval from legal=

prior to responding to the gentlemen.

Thank you in advance for your support and cooperation.  Best regards.  --=

Subject: Smith Enron Cogeneration Plant - Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic

?
Iam an Enron shareholder through my holding company First Foundation=20
Financial Services Inc.

Five or six years ago Smith Enron floated in and installed a power generati=
on=20
plant at Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic generating power to sell to=
=20
the Dominican power agency. Presentations were made at the time to the loca=
l=20
(mostly American and Canadian) residents in the community of Costambar, whe=
re=20
the plant was to be (and was) built, that:

???????? The noise would not exceed =01&the sound of the ocean=018,

???????? That there would be no air quality damage, and=20

???????? That the power outs in Costambar would cease.

I have a home in Costambar about a half mile away and over a large hill fro=
m=20
the plant.=20

???????? The sound is audible in the entire neighborhood;=20

???????? When they clear the boilers it is oppressive/ear shattering for th=
e=20
entire community of 800 homes =01) in spite of the retrofit silencers;=20

???????? There is often molecular ash falling and on occasion =01) well=20
documented with pictures =01) total black soot coverage down wind for a qua=
rter=20
mile or more;

???????? Costambar is on the country=01,s grid and has power outs for an av=
erage=20
of two or more hours per day =01) worse than before.=20

In other words, all of the well-documented and witnessed undertakings have=
=20
been proven false.

I was proud of Enron at the beginning because there seemed to be a legitima=
te=20
attempt to do the right thing. As time has progressed, however, it has beco=
me=20
clear that there is no solution to the continuing problems. It is also=20
obvious that the ONLY right thing is to pull up stakes and float the plant =
to=20
the original alternate location down the coast =01) or to another country.=
=20

The problems are insoluble. You simply can=01,t plop a large energy burning=
=20
facility beside an upscale community without event. For a company as=20
knowledgeable as Enron should be concerning the effects to nearby residents=
,=20
it borders on inexcusable that the plant would have been built where it is =
in=20
the first place. Having attempted any number of solutions and now recognizi=
ng=20
the absence of solution, the continuing inexcusable action is to =01&carry =
on=20
regardless=018 as ahs been the case for the past two or more years.

Enron has been sued by the adjacent (large) hotel which, although only two =
or=20
three years old when the plant was built, had to shut down because of=20
unending guest complaints and refund demands. It now sits as a rotting=20
monument to the problems. Unfortunately for Enron, the owners are a promine=
nt=20
Dominican family. I am told they already have a large judgement - but are=
=20
going for more. If they haven=01,t already they surely will =01) and they s=
urely=20
should. What was once an attractive and productive facility is useless and=
=20
will remain fallow as long as the plant is there. Soon it will fall totally=
=20
beyond repair and there will be no alternative but to raze it.

Houses in the immediate area =01) say ? mile/100 homes =01) have fallen 50%=
 to 75%=20
in value, and houses in the community at large have fallen 10% to 50% in=20
value dependent upon their proximity to the plant. Whereas the hotel value =
is=20
in the low millions and the ultimate award will likely be commensurate, the=
=20
loss in value to the homes is in the tens of millions. Beyond these financi=
al=20
events, some of the people in the community are beginning to complain about=
=20
new respiratory and other pollution related ailments. The rough estimate of=
=20
damages ranges between US$100 million and $150 million without considering=
=20
the health issues.

The community has sensible and responsible leadership and has responded in =
a=20
sensible and responsible way.? Dissatisfied with the failure to solve the=
=20
problem in any approaching a timely fashion, the homeowners have recently=
=20
retained competent counsel. Nearly 400 homeowners have joined the class=20
action to recover their lost property value. The issue of determining lost=
=20
value is about to formally begin and the total loss calculated. Soon there=
=20
will be no turning back because of the homeowners=01, investment in the act=
ion.

If there were an announcement that the plant is to be moved the claim from=
=20
the community would almost certainly go away with the possible exception of=
=20
damages for? the few homes that have changed hands during the plant=01,s li=
fe=20
here. If the plant remains, the action will proceed =01) and all things bei=
ng=20
equitable, which they ultimately become in the Dominican court system, ther=
e=20
will be large claims awarded. I imagine they will massively overshadow the=
=20
few million dollars to move or dismantle the plant.

I now take off my homeowner=01,s hat and return to my position as sharehold=
er.=20
The following (italicized) statements form part of the Enron Mission=20
Statement. As noted above the company has so far failed to implement these=
=20
visions as noted.

?

environment=20
In everything we do, we operate safely and with concern for the environment=
.=20
The way we do a job will affect how our children and our neighbors' childre=
n=20
will live in the future. This is a responsibility we take seriously in all=
=20
the different places around the world where we do business.

The Costambar environment has been seriously effected from a noise and air=
=20
pollution point of view.

?

integrity=20
We work with customers and prospects openly, honestly, and sincerely. When =
we=20
say we will do something, we will do it; when we say we cannot or will not =
do=20
something, then we won't do it.

The community was seriously misled and Enron has been unable to develop=20
solutions to restore or correct their documented assertions.

?

creativity
We think the entrepreneurial approach stimulates creativity. It calls for n=
ew=20
insights, new ways of looking at problems and opportunities, and a strong=
=20
sense of urgency.

The problems have persisted for several years with no recent new initiative=
s=20
directed at solving them.

?

respect=20
We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves. We do not tolerat=
e=20
abusive or disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callousness, and arroganc=
e=20
don't belong here.=20

The Golden Rule has long since gone wanting in this situation.




?

It is simply not responsible for Enron to continue with a facility that has=
=20
and continues to damage a community, financially and from a health point of=
=20
view. And it is not financially responsible of Enron management to risk the=
=20
payment of tens of millions in claims arising from damages that can otherwi=
se=20
be avoided at quantifiable and much lower cost.=20

I=01,m sure the company has a thick file on this issue already. I=01,m equa=
lly=20
sure, however, that the measure of damages is reaching a new phase and is=
=20
approaching the point where there will be no will by the litigants to turn=
=20
back. The plant was constructed during the waning days of the environmental=
ly=20
insensitive Beleaguer government. The country has undergone substantial=20
changes since then including changes in The Rule of Law and the judiciary.=
=20
There is now a new liberal government that is likely to be very generous wi=
th=20
one of its previously model communities if the matter reaches the courts.

The loss to the shareholders of Enron from inactivity of management is like=
ly=20
to be immense =01) and is avoidable.

I would appreciate a comment on management=01,s views as quickly as possibl=
