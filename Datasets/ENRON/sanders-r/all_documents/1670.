As you can see from the attached this may not be the best week in San Diego 
for arguing the Stay motion. There were rolling blackouts in San Diego 
yesterday and the situation dominated the news. Because of unseasonably warm 
weather they may persist throughout the week. I've just been advised that our 
power will be going out shortly for at least an hour.

We have been informed by the building management that our building is on the 
list for power shutdown today.  We are No. 13 and they currently are on No. 
9.  We don't know exactly when this will happen and we probably will not get 
further warning.  Most likely it will last about an hour.  Be sure to save 
computer work product frequently.  Shut your computer off if you are not 
going to use it  and try to close out of programs when not in use.

We should have continuation of phone service as there is  a backup battery.  
You should stay and work if you can, however, we will not have HVAC so if the 
air gets too bad you are free to leave via the stairwells.  Please check back 
after an hour with building security to see if the power has been restored.
