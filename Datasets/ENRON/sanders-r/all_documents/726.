I enjoyed lunch today.  As you said, Jim is very good in outlining the
expectations of the relationship with outside counsel.  I hope and trust that 
I
will abide by them.

Following up on my voice mail of a few days ago, there is a joint defense
meeting on Oct. 17th in Chicago to further map out strategy to present to the
discovery magistrate, Judge Zampano, on Oct 25th.  The issues that will be
discussed and the strategy that will be mapped out will include, whether to
consolidate some or all of the adversaries for discovery/trial, whether to
bifurcate issues to try to get certain common issues tried early, how 
discovery
will proceed (especially if the adversaries are not consolidated for 
discovery),
what is the appropriate time needed for discovery.  The judge will also hear
argument on the 25th regarding the joint defense privilege.

As I said in my voice mail, I don't think it is imperative that I attend this
meeting, but if we don't get out of the case early, some of these issues will
affect Enron.  I would fly up in the morning and come back that night.  Based
upon my participation in joint defense conference calls to date, and I don't
mean to be blowing my own horn, but I do think that my participation would
enhance the joint defense effort -- many of the lawyers representing the
defendants are either straight bankruptcy lawyers without a lot of litigation
experience, or straight regulatory lawyers without a lot of litigation
experience, and I think the trial lawyers in the group are the most important 
in
shaping the strategy that the group will be presenting to the judge.

I truly don't think that I need to go to the hearing on the 25th.  As I said 
in
my earlier email, I believe Liz Austin is a very good lawyer who will 
represent
the interests of Enron very well at the hearing.  My view is that some of the
other defendants who have been involved in this case for much longer, have 
much
greater exposure, and  don't have as strong defenses will take the laboring 
oar
at the hearing itself.

If you'd like me to go to the Chicago meeting, I need to make the necessary
arrangements.  Sorry to keep bugging you with this, but I wouldn't want to go 
or
not go without your input.  Thanks.
