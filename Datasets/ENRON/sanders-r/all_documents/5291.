WPTF will be submitting a ton of data to the AG office tomorrow.  It
consists of all WPTF-related data -- no member-specific data.  It includes
a password to the WPTF web site so that the guy can read all the regulatory
filings we've made -- and the burritos (weekly newsletters to the
membership).  Also they are submitting all meeting minutes, Gary's day
planner and the bylaws.  This seems fine.
