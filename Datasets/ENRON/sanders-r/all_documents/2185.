Richard,

I have found the correct path of the data files requested 
\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\electric\west\incremnt\2000. The requested 
directory has numerous files, not just the real-time spreadsheets. The below 
attachment contains the file names of the files within the above directory 
(do not be confused by the \\enehou rather than the \\nahoutrd, they are the 
same). 


Are you authorizing the copy of all of these files? Please advise...

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

Dan -

Can you get with Richter or someone and try to make sense of the path 
mentioned below. Also quantify the amount of files we are talking about here.

Richard,
 Here are the specifics of what we need to get copied:

M:\NAHOUTRD\Houston\Power\Common\Electric\West\Incremnt\2000

We need all files copied from this directory.  These are the 2000 West Desk
Real Time spread sheets.

Thanks
Gary
