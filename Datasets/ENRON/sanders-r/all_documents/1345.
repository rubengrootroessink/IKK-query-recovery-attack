Attached are the admissions, interrogatories and document requests to the
PCA Trust.  We need to fax these by the end of tomorrow.  I will also be
reviewing tomorrow morning to catch formatting, conform all definitions,
etc.   I am traveling to Atlanta and will leave the office around 1:00 pm.
If you have comments after that, Melinda Jackson can incorporate them, but
I'd love to get them finalized and served before I leave.  As discovery
progesses, if necessary, we can ask follow up discovery as well.

 Thanks.
