Did you have a chance to continue developing your view on this issue so as to 
give me some legal direction (I note that my prior guidance wasn't 
illegal!).  I'd like to call SWPC tomorrow morning with a response/view/plan 
of action on this matter.  If we need, let's get a third-party litigator on 
this.  Thanks,  Chuck
