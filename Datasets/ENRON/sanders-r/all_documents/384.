Here is the rough transcript from Schultes' sixth day of deposition.? The 
deposition should end tomorrow.? I have hung on here, because I want to be 
present when the lawyers for Farallon and Legg Mason ask their questions.? 
They are starting first thing in the morning.

I will call you about the deposition generally or write you a report or 
both.? It has been a very valuable experience.? I know a lot more about the 
plaintiff's case than I did before, and I have had a very good opportunity to 
get close to the plaintiffs' lawyers and convey the message that Enron really 
does not belong in the case.? For the last two nights I've had dinner with 
the plaintiffs' lawyers--both nights with the Piper, Marbury and Robins, 
Kaplan lawyers, one night with the Farallon and Legg Mason lawyers as well.? 
I think we are making good progress.
