Richard,

I am the new Financial Settlements Manager working for Kim Theriot.  In 
reviewing our Account Receivable
Report, we noticed an $ 8.7 million dollar (May 2000) unpaid receivable from 
Badak Gas Marketing, Inc.
The explanation I received on this is  that legal is negotiating a 
settlement.   Is this an accurate statement?
If yes,  what is the status?   Your assistance is this matter is deeply 
appreciated.


Regards,

Angelo Miroballi
