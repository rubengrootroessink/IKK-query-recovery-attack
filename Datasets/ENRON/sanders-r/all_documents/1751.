See notes below per our meeting earlier today:

all Ecogas mail is currently received by PNE (Marie Cackler) who sorts and 
forwards Ecogas correspondence.  This process will not change.  However, 
effective immediately all mail forwarded by Marie should be sent to Donna 
Lowry in the Compliance Group.

issues going forward.
Andy Edison will coordinate details/process of eventual dissolution of Ecogas.
Mark Meier will continue to spearhead the liquidation of ENA's current equity 
position in DLGP.  Mark will coordinate w/ Accounting, Legal and Compliance.
Andy Edison will continue to be "point" re: Lyon Credit litigation.
Michelle Cash will continue monitoring the Victoria Sterling and Thomas Hall 
litigations.
I currently have the checkbook and will continue to pay incoming 
invoices/sign checks as directed by Donna Lowry, Herman Manis and/or Hope 
Vargas.
