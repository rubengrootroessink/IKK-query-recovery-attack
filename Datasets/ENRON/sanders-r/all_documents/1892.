matt said this got bounced back so this may be duplicate or not.
note the credit event letters (see brian's email to you with electronic 
version) are referenced and attached to the tranaction agreement which el 
paso signed and refer to the swap monetization.
the spread calculations referenced were tied to el paso medium term notes 
that had just been issued as the most comparable public debt with a term 
similar to those of the swap.
