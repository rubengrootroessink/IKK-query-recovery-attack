The proof of claim filing date is January 8, 2001.  I can have a junior
level staff person prepare ENA's proof of claim.  To do that, we will need
copies of any contracts, agreements upon which ENA's claim is based and
copies of any outstanding invoices that make up the prepetition claim.
Those documents should be attached to the proof of claim.  I will review
the claim and get it over to you for signing.

Perry Gas listed ENA's claim as $1,848,197.  The amount should be
confirmed.  I assume that the claim is against  Perry Gas Companies, Inc.,
as opposed to the other two debtor subsidiaries, but that should be
confirmed as well.

Let me know how you want to proceed on this.  FYI, Christy Finelli (a
paralegal) at Enron has been very helpful in connection with  EES and she
may be able to gather everything for you.

If you'd like me to work directly with someone else in connection with
ENA's proof of claim, let me know.  Thanks.
