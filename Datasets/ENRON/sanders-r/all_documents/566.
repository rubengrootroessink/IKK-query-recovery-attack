Richard,

You and I have spoken about the costs in this case previously.  Matt and I 
have asked our various attorneys/experts to bill us monthly from this point 
forward, in order to get a better handle on those costs.

Matt has offered to be the "billing contact" for all our attorneys/experts.  
I am also available to do the same thing, although I obviously would have to 
charge my time for it.  I do think that a central billing contact is a good 
idea.

Please let Matt and me know how you want to proceed with this.

Britt
