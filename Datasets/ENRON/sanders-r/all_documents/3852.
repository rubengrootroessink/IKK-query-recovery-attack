Michael / Jeff,

For your information, I attach below a paper which the Dutch Originators & 
Traders are putting together (and being reviewed by me) for our external 
counsel, Clifford Chance, on the Dutch situation.  Clifford Chance wanted a 
brefing paper on the anatomy of the Dutch electricity market as a background 
against which they could set the questions which we have posed to them on our 
potential remedies etc into context  - furthermore, if any of this ever went 
to litigation, this will provide the advocates with appropriate history.

Clearly this is a first draft although, in my view, it is pretty near 
completion at this stage.

Kind regards

Mark

Dear all,

Please find attached our first version of the industry structure/specifics. 
Please note that this will be a 'living' document that will develop over time.

Best Regards,
