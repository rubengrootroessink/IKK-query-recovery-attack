You may be interested to know that on July 20, 2000 the Alberta Minister of 
Resource Development signed the new Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation 
into law.   The new regulation made four changes to the existing Market 
Surveillance Regulation, namely:

(a) it gave the MSA the new authority to monitor the conduct of the PPA 
Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to 
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency 
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another 
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the 
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.   
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA 
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.
(d) it added a section relating to the MSA's authority to apply to the Court 
for an order authorizing it to take evidence outside of Alberta.

Attached is a copy of the Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation.
