Subject: Supplemental Research Memo


We have been trying, unsuccessfully, to send the attached memo to you via 
facsimile since yesterday afternoon.  The fax machine at your office gives a 
constant busy signal.
Accordingly, attached is Misty Smith Kelley's supplemental research memo 
regarding the effect of provision in TVA/distributor contract limiting 
liability.
Misty is out of the office today, but please feel free to contact me if I can 
be of further assistance.

Kasey L. Chesney
Secretary to Misty Smith Kelley
