This is to advise you that there are two nationwide private natural gas
royalty
cases that have been filed in the Eastern District of Texas before Judge
Hannah.
Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a defendant.  Both
cases
are class actions.  Neither is a Qui Tam action.  The allegations are
similar to
those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.

The first, in Civil Action 9:99cv255, was filed September 20, 1999.  The
plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.  The defendants are Mobil
Oil
Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing
Southeast,
Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas & New Mexico, Inc. and Mobil
Exploration and Producing U.S.

The second, Civil Action 9:00cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.  The plaintiffs
are
Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, WI.
The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration & Production
Company,
Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading Company.

Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the
plaintiffs in both cases.  Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming & Asso. of
Houston,
signed the Stirman complaint.

Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at
www.edtx.uscourts.gov.  Enter the site and look under "Frequently Requested
Cases".  You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.

Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker
told
me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had  been dropped as
defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were
named
in  Original and First Original Amended Complaints),  both are again named
as
defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed on June
13,
2000.    The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the plaintiffs, had a
conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron and EOG to
preserve
the case.  That conflict has now been resolved.  The June 13 complaint is
not
yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.
