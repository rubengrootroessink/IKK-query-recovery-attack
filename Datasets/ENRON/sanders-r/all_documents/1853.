Richard,
 We need to have an electronic copy of the Real Time spreadsheets for
EPMI located on the M Drive in Houston for the period 1/01/00 to date.  They
are needed for two purposes:  (1) to respond by next Wednesday to a FERC
request for data about Out of Market Transactions; and (2) to evaluate the
contents of those spreadsheets in the context of the California litigation.
The specific documents that we need have been identified by Jeff Richter.
We need approval to have these documents copied to a CD and sent via courier
to me today.  I believe that Dan Dietrich is also aware of the specific
documents that are needed.  If the approval is granted, Jeff Richter can
make the CD in Portland and have it sent via courier to me.  Alternatively,
if the CD is made in Houston, it should be sent to me for guaranteed
Saturday delivery at the following address:

Thanks
Gary
