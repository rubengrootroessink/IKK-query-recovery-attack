1. Rick,  are you the person to prepare the schedule?

2. It is not  readily apparent to me that we necessarily should feel under 
any obligation to"show cause" that we are not in default , although a civil 
non-inflammatory reequest to discuss the issue would probably have been well 
received..it seems to me that if we grovel now in a defensive and reactive 
manner it keeps them with the initiative (Q. Do we really think they are 
prepared to throw the dice and declare the default?)  

3.  How much was paid for the interests is none of their  #$@%& business. 

4. What Limited Waiver Agreement?  Did I get a copy? I can't find it in my 
email.

As agreed, I spoke with Clifton. He explained his  letter to me. I told him 
that I was under the impression that the issue over the  transfer documents 
was resolved in favor of a schedule. He said that he was not  aware of that. 
When I asked him point blank whether Brazos was declaring a  default, he 
referred me to Pat Long. 
?
I just got off the phone with Pat. I asked Pat if  the letter was a "default 
letter" or?a letter in the nature of "an order to  show cause why Brazos 
should not declare Tenaska in default".? He answered  that it was the latter. 
I also asked him if my recollection of how the transfer  document issue has 
been resolved was correct and he confirmed that it was.  Hence, you only need 
to produce a schedule showing who owns Tenaska and its  partners and what 
options exist to acquire ownership or additional ownership  interests in 
Tenaska and its partners. As Dan  thought that Rick would be the one to 
prepare the schedule, he asked me to send  a copy of this email to Rick. 
?
For your information, they would like to know how  much the new players paid 
for the interests in Tenaska.
?
Pat also said that?the Limited Waiver  Agreement that I sent out this morning 
was fine with him but that Phil had two  minor changes that I would receive 
tomorrow. Hence, please respond to that  document tomorrow so we can get that 
out of the way.
?
Finally, as some of you know, tomorrow I will be  sending out a draft of what 
I hope will become an agreed upon statement of the  issues that need to be 
resolved in order to properly analyze the damage issue. I  would appreciate a 
rapid turn-around on that document.
?
While I am in Houston, I would like to meet with  Carl and Rick. If you two 
are available, we could meet for diner on the night on  the 9th. The purpose 
of the meeting is to make sure that I understand the  options available to 
Brazos.
