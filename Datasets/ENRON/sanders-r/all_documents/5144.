Chuck,

The total SWPC outstanding invoices for the Feb. and Apr. wrecks which we
have received at the plant comes to a total of $1,641,273.54 which is a
little more than what you indicated. This figure includes SWPC: parts
credit; repair labor; balance instruments & labor; NDE testing.

On a separate note shouldn't the actual insurance claim include not only the
SWPC charges but also other costs absorbed by the plant such as bolting kit
parts, plant labor costs, consultants cost, etc. We have these costs broken
out as well as the SWPC charges.
