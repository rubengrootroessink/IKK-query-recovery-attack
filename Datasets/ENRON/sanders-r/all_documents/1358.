is the same.
Thanks

Steve, I have received notice of service in a lawsuit styled:  The People
of the State of California, etc. v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., et al.
(including Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc.)
that was filed in the California Supreme Court, County of San Francisco
(#318189).  I know that this is not in San Diego, but wanted to make sure
that it was not the lawsuit that you were tracking earlier.  It is a
complaint for unfair, unlawful and deceptive trade practices regarding the
deregulation of the California electric power industry.  Let me know if you
think it is the same.  thanks, Becky

Steve, not yet.  He did say that the complaint would be posted today on
this website:  ucan.org.  You can look there as well to see if it has shown
up.  I've got a couple of fires to put out and then I'll try him again.
Sorry for the delay.
