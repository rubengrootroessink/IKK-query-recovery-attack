Re:      Attached letter

          Attached is the latest revision by Doug Robinson to the letter to 
Judge Downes.  Doug has incorporated further committee comments, plus 
editorial suggestions received by email to the extent they were consistent 
with the consensus of input received.  I believe we are ready to finalize and 
deliver the letter, but offer you a further opportunity for input, and 
encourage  coordination by anyone else contemplating a separate letter.
