Protected - Attorney Client Privileged

Under section (d), I would consider elaborating to some extent.  The 
fundament issue relative to Mustang being able to take gas to which they 
might be entitled to under the Right of Way Agreement is that they would need 
to come to HPL with an indication of the amount of gas they would consume 
(minimum and maximum on a spontaneous basis) and the pressures required.  A 
letter simply stating their desire to connect is insufficient.  This would 
provide HPL with the appropriate information in order to determine the size 
of the meter and regulation required based on those parameters.  Until such 
time, HPL could not make that determination.  The issue of who pays for such 
equipment cost is silent in the agreement, but HPL would take the position 
that Mustang is only entitled to free gas, not free facilities, and only 
until the agreement is terminated.  Mustang could take the approach that such 
facilities are unnecessary since the gas is free.  This would certainly be 
contradictory to our policy of measuring all receipts and deliveries.  Your 
call as to how we should respond here.
