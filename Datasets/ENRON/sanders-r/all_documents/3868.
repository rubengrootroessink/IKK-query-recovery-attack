Richard,
 Did your office get everything it needed from David Best to do the wire 
transfer of the settlement funds?  Is there anything you need us to do on the 
remaining bit of the claim against the  underwriters?  I believe you all have 
retrieved the whole file; however, let me know if there is anything we can do 
to help.  I will be in the UK during the week of February 14 if there is 
something I can do  while I'm there, let me know.  Thanks.
        GAIL
