In process.  We will coordinate this with the other defendants, as the
letter did not come directly to us.  Note also that we have served (but have
not filed) Rule 11 motions on Grynberg.  A reminder of that may be part of
the response.

Do we need to discuss an "Enron" response to Figa or do we already have
one?
