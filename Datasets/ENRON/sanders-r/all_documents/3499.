hey freak.  next summer's activities is indeed the subject of most of my
daydreaming time as of late....and some hiking will definitely occur.  as a
good mate's  wedding takes place on july 8 in LA, a whole big hunk of
something is not altogether likely - but sections of the PCT have come to
mind, as has the colorado trail, which is some 400 miles or so, i think.
about the latter i have just written a card to roger davidson to sound him
out about it, but by all means next summer is an open book.

i wonder how long of a section that is and why you thought about it in
particular - are y'all planning on the july 4 thing in nevada?

if you reckon you can take a decent amount of time off, well i will move
heaven and earth to accommodate both of our schedules.  for the rolina it
shall be a summer of love ( or no work, at any rate)

so do not yank my chain on this, por favor - like our Pops i support an
obnoxiously serious uberplanning habit.  give it a thought and let us know
what is up.

on another matter, was reading the economist a couple of weeks ago and just
about had a stroke when i came across the name of Enron in an article about
prospective tie-ups and buyouts amongst utilities and energy companies.
Good Lord, i did not know it was that big of a company.

thoroughly enjoyed a letter from the julie not so long ago and would
appreciate it if you told her it will be answered one of these random days.

danna and mom, mom and danna.  what exactly was the gist of their
conversation about the pedernales, to the best of your knowledge?  i will
have to speak with our misguided sister about that, but i will tell you now
i do not trust our mother in regard to the pedernales whatsoever.  there are
times i really do not understand how her mind works - and i suppose i do not
want to.

well i gots to git.  hope all is well with you and yourn and may this
missive find all y'all in good health and spirits, lording over all you
survey -

cheers


the Ralai Lama
