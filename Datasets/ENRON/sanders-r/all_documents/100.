Paul:

I received your letter yesterday -- under the circumstances, I would 
appreciate it if you would draft, execute and forward to me a motion to 
withdraw prior to your departure on Thursday for Europe.  I have not been 
able to secure other counsel as of this time, but hope to do so shortly.  
When I am able to find other counsel, I will have the motion to withdraw 
filed with the court.  I would also appreciate it if you could forward to my 
home my case file along with the family photos I gave to you.  If you have 
any concerns with these requests, please let me know immediately.  Thank you.

Linda Guinn

Estates.

>1.  Please produce your paycheck stubs from each full-time and part-time job

>2.  Please produce your application for apartment lease at Pin Oak Estates

>3.  Please produce your lease agreement on your apartment located at Pin Oak

>5.  Please produce your credit card statements for all credit cards in your

>6.  Please produce all statements of the stock account in your name with the
>brokerage firm, Datek, and any other stock brokerage firm.
>7.  Please produce your 401K account statement from all such accounts both 
with

>8.  Please produce a copy of your current W-2 as filed with your current

>Like I stated above, we need to get his lease agreement and application 
before

else.
