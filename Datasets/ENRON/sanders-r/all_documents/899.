Richard,

In the 10/6/2000 email to Harvey Morris at the CPUC setting forth Enron's
proposed response to the subpoena, Enron stated that it would produce
documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  Does Enron still
intend to produce these documents and information?  If so, what types of
documents and information do we intend to produce and who will be gathering
it?

Thanks,

Peter
