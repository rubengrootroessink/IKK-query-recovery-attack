Richard,

I have not heard from you re this bill.  May I have your authority to pay 
it?  Casabonne has already called me about its status.  Thanks.

Britt

Richard,

I have just received an invoice from Christophe Casabonne, the former EGLI 
trader who is our star witness/consultant in this matter, in the amount of 
15,600 FF.  This represents 19 hours and 30 minutes at the agreed-upon rate 
of 800 FF.  Although I have not checked today, the USD/FF conversion ratio 
was about 1/7 a few weeks ago.  If something like this still holds, the bill 
is for about $2,230.00.

I have reviewed the bill, find it in order, and ask for your authority to pay 
it.

I await your instructions.

Britt
