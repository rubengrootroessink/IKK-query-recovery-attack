That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually 
anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI 
litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is 
it going?

 He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.  
 What happened at the meeting on Monday with Mark?  Do I still have a job?

Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky.
