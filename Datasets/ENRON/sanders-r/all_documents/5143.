1 PM would work best for me.  Does that work for everyone else?

The end of this week is complicated for me.  Can we do it early next week?

Best regards - Max

Thursday afternoon or all day Friday--does that work for both of you'all.

>>> <Bonnie.White@enron.com> 12/01/00 04:23PM >>>

Ileana:        I'd like to participate in the conference call, but right
now I anticipate being in a hearing in San Antonio most of the day on
Wednesday.  Do you have any other availability next week? Thanks.

Max, we agree with you 100% that there are much stronger defenses to
McKenna's claims and appreciate the importance of not involving the
offtakers into this dispute.  However, we want to be prepared for what is
likely to be McKenna's "strongest" argument, especially if he digs up some
affidavits from some of his cronies, or if he tries to take some
depositions.  Can we talk more about this next week?  Does Wednesday work
for you?  Thanks.  Ileana
