		 Subject: Enron-- Tom Lambert


Gary:
        I received a voicemail message from Tom Lambert this morning. He 
advised that he had been retained by Dan Lamb for Enron as an expert but now 
understood that he should be talking to me and not Dan. Parenthetically, I 
know Tom quite well having used him on a number of cases. He wanted an update 
on what was happening and then stated that he had been contacted by a number 
of other defendants including Sempra but acknowledged that he had already 
been retained by Enron. I sense that he is looking for an assurance that he 
has a real role in this case before its too late. Tom is basically a one-man 
shop and this case therefore  is probably pretty significant for him in terms 
of a revenue source and he doesn't want to get left on the sidelines. I 
haven't called him back yet and want to know what I can tell him about his 
role or level of involvment for Enron. Please advise or give me a call if you 
want to discuss. Thanks.

Dave
