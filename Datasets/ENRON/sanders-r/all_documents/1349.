FYI.  Attached please find a legal cite that indicates that the federal 
government would be the guarantor of the sales under the DOE order.  I have

is the constitutional basis for such orders, I wonder?"

I do not doubt that the government can order the utilities to keep supplying
electricity, but I think the federal government is now the guarantor of
payment.  See the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in the Winstar case.
