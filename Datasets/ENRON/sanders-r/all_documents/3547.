Dude,

You probably got my voice message yesterday.  I am still planning to come in
on Thursday.  Can you get together Thursday night?  Let's discuss any plans
you may have this week.  Call me on my GSM as I will be in Prague tomorrow
night (Sunday) through Tuesday evening.  I am in office Wednesday and
through thursday when I catch flight.

Brian
