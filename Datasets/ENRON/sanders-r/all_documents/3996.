Kenton, 
                You are correct about my meeting with Bill Muckle ( 
Broadwing's Director of OSP Eng & Constr.)  in Rock Springs Monday and 
Tuesday of next week.
They will have ten of their key field people there and we will have four of 
our key servillance people, including Bill and Paul Beamis.  We will go over 
accepatble construction and escalation procedures.  They are being  much more 
careful than they have been in the past, even changing sides of the road in 
tight right-of-way areas.  I'll update you after the meeting.  

Brad

Steve, a week ago today, the judge denied our request for preliminary 
injunction, but kept the proceeding open (so we can go back on an expedited 
basis if we need to) and warned Broadwing that its many cuts were very gross 
and that they should exercise extreme care ("digging with a hand trowel, if 
you can," he said) as they continue their construction.  He also said that 
they were facing some pretty significant damages, and that if they cut us 
again he would probably issue an injunction.  He was concerned that future 
cuts, after our system is lit, will generate much higher damage claims from 
us.

If you want a little more detail, the judge ruled that we had met 3 of the 4 
tests to get the injunction--likelihood of succeeding on the merits, 
likelihood of suffering irreparable harm, and satisfied the public policy 
protecting existing utility facilities.  But he found that on the 4th test, 
the comparison of damages, that the damages B'wing would suffer if the 
injunction were granted were similar to the damages we will suffer if it were 
not granted, but the 30 or so menial construction hands who would be laid off 
by the contractors, if the injunction were granted, tipped the balance.  

We knew that the chances of a shutdown were remote, and we were surprised we 
came so close.  Our goal was to get the judge's help to make B'wing use safer 
construction practices, to avoid future cuts (which they have done:  they are 
potholing now, constructing slower, and listening to our inspectors, although 
they still refuse to sign a Construction Coordination Agreement, which we've 
repeatedly offered).  Our outside counsel and witnesses did a great job, and 
the judge was very stern in his warning to Broadwing.  I think the Broadwing 
people realize that  Broadwing did not "win" this proceeding, and that a 
rather large hammer is now hanging over their head.

Next steps: I believe Brad is going to meet on-site with Broadwing's Bill 
Muckle, to explore future steps to prevent future cuts.  We are keeping the 
courthouse warm.  That's about it.

Please let me know if you'd like more info.

Kenton
