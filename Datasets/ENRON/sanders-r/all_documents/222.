Lisa:

Attached is a brief outline of our initial thoughts on the antitrust issues 
contained in Infineum's complaint.  Both Steve's and my home numbers are set 
forth at the end of the memo if you want to talk over the weekend.

I will see what I can do on the conflict front over the weekend.

John
