Today Don Ray talked to Donnie Rhodes.
 Donnie was aware the Beeson case had
come down, and contends "I told them all
along they should certify those excluded
from Dow Waiver as the class"!  At any
rate, Donnie said -- and as with all of
Donnie's info, this must be taken with a
grain of salt -- that Ronnie is no longer
getting along with Joseph and King, and
Ronnie is in charge of the case.  Donnie
is still owed $80,000.  Nonetheless, if they
asked, he would work for them on the
case.  I suspect we will see him at the
hearing working basically on a
contingency, and with a whole new Dow
Waiver theory of certification!
