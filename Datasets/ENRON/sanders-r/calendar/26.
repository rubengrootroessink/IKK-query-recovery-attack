	I have arranged a meeting at Enron's offices with Jim Derrick on
Monday May 7 from 10 to 11 for Stephen York, Ben Sheppard and other members
of Vinson & Elkins International Arbitration and Litigation Practice Group.
Stephen York who will join our London office as a partner in May is an
experienced UK solicitor who began his legal career with Slaughter & May,
spent 7 years in Hong Kong and most recently headed Hammond Suddards
arbitration practice in London.  Jim asked if I would contact each of you
about your availability that morning. Please let me know and I will work
with Stephanie Harris to arrange a location.  Thanks  Joe Dilg
