As just discussed, I attach a transcript of a taped conversation between 
Russell and Joseph Tan of Hyundai Singapore Pte Ltd. The conversation took 
place on 20 Sept 1999 at about 9.30am.




Please let me have your advice as to whether the conversation can amount to 
an election on the part of Hyundai such that they cannot subsequently rely on 
our breach of condition to rescind.

I think Yukong Line [1996] 2 Lloyd's Rep 604 is a relevant case which you may 
want to have a look at.

I look forward to hearing from you before the end of the day. 

Thanks and regards

Matt
