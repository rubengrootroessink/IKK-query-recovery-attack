Alan

Attached is WFW's opinion on the matter. You will note that it does not 
differ in any substantial manner from my earlier note to you.

Please let me have your comments. I will wait for your e-mail before I relay 
the opinion to John Nowlan, John Chismar, Russell and the other business 
people.

I will access my e-mail later tonite again. Please call me if you wish. Once 
again, my home number is (65) 779 4469 and my mobile is (65) 96919646. It'll 
probably be easier to reach me on my mobile if it's before midnite SGP time.

Thanks

Matt
