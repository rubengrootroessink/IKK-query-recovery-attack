Dear Richard:

This is the contact information of the two guys I mentioned at lunch.  I know
both of these guys and have worked with them.  As I indicated they are both
technically savvy and have been in the construction side of the business as
well as management.

Joe Richards is a trouble shooter.  He can go in to finish a project when it
gets into trouble.  He has a lot of experience in construction, startup and
recently as recovery specialist.  He was recently down in Columbia completing
the Termo Valle project for Marubeni.  He is currently on a job in
Connecticut and can be reached on his cell at 832-654-5070.  His hotel number
is 203 777-5337.  His email is: thestartup@aol.com

Upshur Quinby is a technical and construction guy that looks at designs and
can identify incorrect designs and potential areas for cost overrun.  He
started in construction with Bechtel and ended up as a President of an Ebasco
subsidiary. Phone is 757-874-9056;  cell 757-593-6100; email :
crsquinby@aol.com

These guys know a lot about the industry, the players, and history on a lot
of the projects.  They are straight shooters and will tell it to you as they
see it.

You should give them a call an introduce yourself when you have a chance. I
have spoken to them both so they will recognize the name and take your call.

Regards,
Jim
