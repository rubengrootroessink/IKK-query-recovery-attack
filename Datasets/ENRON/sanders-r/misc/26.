Richard:

I believe we had already sent your username and password, but just in case,
here it is again:

Username: rbsanders
Password: elvis

As for the course number for the seminar from last month, it is:  000011905.
We do show that you logged in the full amount of time for this seminar and
we did report this for you to the State Bar MCLE Dept.

Hope this helps, but if you have further questions about this, please give
us a call or send us another e-mail message.

Thanks again for your interest in CLEonline.com.   We would greatly
appreciate it if you could please spread the word about our online CLE
service to other attorneys in your firm/company and local area.  Also, if
there are other topics that you would like to see on our site, please let us
know.  And, if there are any attorneys in your firm or company who have
written or spoken on subjects that would be of interest to other attorneys,
we would very much like to talk to them about possibly producing a new
seminar with us on our site.


Best Regards,

Mike De La Rosa, Esq.
