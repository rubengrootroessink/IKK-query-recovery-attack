Following the meeting this morning I have typed up some notes and associated 
actions. Could everyone please look at the attachment and let me know whether 
I have understood the requirements correctly, and also who is going to action 
each point, either the project team or the legal department. 

Thank you for your assistance in getting this under way. 

Regards
