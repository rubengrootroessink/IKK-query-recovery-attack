Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.
