The agenda for the meetings is to discuss ways to address the four highest priority items raised in the offsite.  Jeff, as you recall, has asked us for our proposed solutions at the staff meeting in two weeks.  

As a reminder, here are the four:

1) Management skills
2) Metality/Dedication of employees
3) Manual processes
4) Development of analytical skills

Let me know if you have questions.
Greg

I have scheduled  two lunch meetings, per Greg Couch, to serve as  follow up meetings from this weekend's off-site.  These meetings will take place this Wednesday and next Wednesday, July 18 and 25, both in EB 3270 from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM (Houston time).

Brian, please reply to me with a number for us to reach you, via telephone conference for these meetings.


Thank you,

Irena
