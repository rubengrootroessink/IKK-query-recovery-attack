This looks like the macro problem we talked about.  Let me know what I need to do to fix.

Thanks,

Errol,

Is a Macro problem your final answer on this??

I need an answer on this. If the beginning balances were changed in error, please let me know this so I can determine what I need to do to fix this variance. Again, this change did not affect your P&L.

In the January 2001 PG book DPR, for the EOL Gas Daily Roll, you reduced your beginning Gross Balance for January by $9,066,220 and you increased your beginning Liquidated Balance for January by $9,066,220. So, the EOL Gas Daily Roll stayed flat in total and did not cause a problem P&L wise. However, this amount is falling out on my reconciliation for January. Could you please tell me what deal or deals were liquidated for $9,066,220, which in turn caused a reduction in your MTM?? We are concerned that these may be third party deals that Financial Settlements are not aware of.

Thanks!!
