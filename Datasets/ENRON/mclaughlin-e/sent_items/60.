Jeff,

I know you're pretty busy w/ everything going on, so this isn't top priority.  When you get a minute, could we talk about how Spec/Sr.Spec get into the Associate/Analyst program?  My guys (and myself for that matter) have seen and heard of people moving into the program and I am getting a lot of questions on the matter.  

Thanks,

Errol
