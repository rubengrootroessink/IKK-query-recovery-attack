There is no deal in system for a Cal `02 swap.  Can you give me details on the deal (when done, price, vol., etc.)?

Thanks,

Errol

THE POWER INVENTORY AND THE LISTING OF PJM TRANSACTIONS DO NOT SHOW A CAL02 SWAP, HOWEVER I HAVE A CAL02 IN MY SPREADSHEET. CAN YOU CHECK THE INVENTORY AND MAKE SURE IT IS CORRECT/UPDATED. ALSO, CAN YOU CLEAN UP THE INVENTORY SHEET TOWARDS THE FRONT BY REMOVINGTHE EXPIRED CONTRACTS AND THE ZERO POSITIONS.
THANKS
