Hey Errol,
 
I did a search in the NG-Price book and came up with these four deals to be flipped right away.
 
QN9713.1  	
QO0166.1  	
YE9269.1  	
YE9269.2  	
 
 
Please make sure the first two are flipped before the end of the day today as I need to invoice them first thing in the morning.
 
Thanks
Stacey
