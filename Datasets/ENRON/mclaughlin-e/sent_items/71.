Errol,

Have you or your staff had a chance to look into the remaining Mexico deals listed below?  If possible, we'd like to have these items granted to us by the end of October, which is quickly approaching.

Thanks,

NHV

Errol,

How are the remaining outstanding items on this list coming along?  I have not seen any other changes on the DPR after October 19.  Please let me know if you any have questions.
