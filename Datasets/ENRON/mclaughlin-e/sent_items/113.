I am sorry.  I wasn't trying to push Meliza into our lunch.  That's why I was asking how much 'shop' you wanted to talk.  I feel awful now.  I thought it would be fun.  We can grab a conference after we get back (or tommorow) and talk if you'd like.

Unfortunately, we have been put on a hiring freeze b/c of everything that is going on.  We brought on three new people on Monday, but they were interviewed and hired about 1 month ago.  We've lost three people since the merger announcement, but we cant fill their spots w/ new people.

Your resume looks good.  You're correct, these jobs are demanding on your personal time.  This is especially true when you first start.  This is something you would have to talk over w/ the manager that you interviewed with to see how demanding the book is that they wanted to put you on.  We can talk more later.

Thanks,

Errol

I actually wanted to discuss what opportunities are open in your area, as well.  I'd prefer to discuss this, for now, with just yourself.  Meliza had actually mentioned it earlier , that I should talk with you, so maybe we can casually discuss it during lunch.  I know that being in your area is quite demanding on your personal time, and I have 2 year old.  But I have strong background and I am just curious as to what else is out there.  This group is ok, but I am not being fully utilized.  I will attach my resume, for your review.

Thanks again for agreeing to sit me with.  It's getting pretty tight around here!!!
