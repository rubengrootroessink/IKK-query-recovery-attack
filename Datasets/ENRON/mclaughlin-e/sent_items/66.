Anne,

Can you give John a call and get him what he needs.  I don't know anything about the request.  I gave him some of ours and he needed one of yours.

Thanks,

Errol

Which book ?  I think the ENA part at the end is not correct.  It should be CAL or SJ or something like that.  If you give me the trader name or a specific deal to look at I can look it up.  Let me know if I can help you do this.

Thanks

Anne

Anne,

Can you please send John Swinney the post i.d for the "ENA-FT-WT-ENA" as of 09/28/2001.  He is fulfilling an Arthur Andersen request.

Thanks,

Errol
