Kam,

I don't know anything about CES trades being sold to New Power Co.  I looked in TAGG at the trades in the spreadsheet, and they look like normal swaps.  No one has called before this to say confirms were not signed or anything of that nature, so I can't see any reason they have not to pay.

Let me know how I can help.

Errol

Errol,

Apparently CES has stopped paying us for the attached deals.  Michelle Stevens in financial settlements is wondering if all CES trades were sold off  to The New Power Company but I have no idea if that's true.  Do you know anything about this?  The bottom 5 trades are in your books.

Let me know if you know more about CES.

Thanks

Kam

Kam,

Here is a spreadsheet that shows all trades that are being disputed.   << File: CES Trades that have not been paid.xls >> 

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help!
