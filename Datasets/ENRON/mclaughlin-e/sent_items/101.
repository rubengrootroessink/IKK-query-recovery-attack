John,

After we spoke tonite, I found an error on a Bravo Natural Resources deal we put in last week.  This is the deal where we spaced out the premium over Cal`02 & `03.  A premium was inadvertantly added on the sale leg of the deal.  Taking off this premium resulted in a $448,773 loss.  I apologize for the error.  We just found it today, when Derek was catching up from being out on Th & Fri.

Thanks,

Errol
