This book is for a VPP deal with the affiliate Star VPP, LP.  The Price desk 
has swaps with this counterparty and the other regional desks have basis 
deals.  The deals went into the system last night.  The Post ID's were 
1045874 (price) and 1045878 (basis).  Kori is running the book just like she 
does the other affiliate books.

Please call with any other questions,

Errol McLaughlin
