How are you doing?  I hope your day is going well.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember 
anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot 
that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and 
was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 
minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember 
picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm 
so sorry!).

Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.

ELM
