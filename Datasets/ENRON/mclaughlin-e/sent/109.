This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily 
position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position 
instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem 
and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the 
situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.

Thanks,

Errol L. McLaughlin
