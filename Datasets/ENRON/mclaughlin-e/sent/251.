Subject: GD and Price Options

Errol,

We are trying to make sure that everyone that is trading options with us off 
line are aware that we have both GD and Price Options on EOL.  Do you have a 
list of companies that are trading with us? If not a post ID would suffice.  
I still have some queries that I can run from my risk days.  Thanks for your 
help.
