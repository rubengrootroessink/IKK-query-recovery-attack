Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane
