Vikas,

Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
appropriate format.



Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
