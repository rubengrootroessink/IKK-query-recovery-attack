Dawn,

John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are 
booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the 
short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the 
deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically 
tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.

Thanks, 

Errol
