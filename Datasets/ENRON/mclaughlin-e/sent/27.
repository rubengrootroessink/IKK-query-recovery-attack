I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate 
Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not 
officialized).  Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put 
together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every 
book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these 
problems can be fixed before the morning.

The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.

Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,

Errol L. McLaughlin
