It looks like Bankers Trust Company (CP# 27) needs to be unsuspended.

Jason,

Per the below notice from Legal.  "Bankers Trust" is still a valid Trading 
entity, and we should continue to book Trades to this Entity.  Can you please 
change GCP from "Suspended" to "Active".

Thanks,
Joe

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.
