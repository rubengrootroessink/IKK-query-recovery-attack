ENA did an EOL deal with Cook on 11/1/00 (Q71102.1, EOL #539925).  Kevin, 
Cook, has called to verbal the reversal of this deal and I do not find in 
Tagg where this deal has been reversed.  Please  check and let me know that 
you find so that I can call Kevin back.  Thanks.

   Reversal: Cook Buys and pays $4.555
     20,000/day, December, 2000
     ENA sells and pays last day

Jean
