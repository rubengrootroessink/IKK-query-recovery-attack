Agustin,

Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is 
selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received 
a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and 
basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
