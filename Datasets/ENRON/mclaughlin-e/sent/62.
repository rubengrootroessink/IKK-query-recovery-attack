Jim,

I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
settle down.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin
