Sharon,

Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that 
there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not 
find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a 
call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.

Thanks,

Errol
