Subject: Mexico March Originations

Errol,

Please review the following file (the tab marked "2001 Summary") and help me 
answer the following questions for March:

1.  Two additional originations "corrections" of $379.50 each were granted to 
Mexico, but I don't think they belong to us.

2.  The $338,955 Vitro Corporativo Deal #QW8224 was not granted to Mexico, 
but my originator, Agustin Perez, says it should have been.  Please let me 
know if you are responsible for this deal.

I will be in Monterrey from Wednesday through Friday but will be checking my 
voicemails & e-mails periodically, so please feel free to contact me.

Thanks,

NHV
