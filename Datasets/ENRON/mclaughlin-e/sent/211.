Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).
