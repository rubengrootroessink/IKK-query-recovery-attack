>Brown Says Applewhite, Freshmen WRs Will Start at Colorado
>
>The quarterback shuffle is over and the blue-chip freshmen wide receivers
>are
>ready for prime time, coach Mack Brown said Tuesday in announcing Major
>Applewhite as the starting quarterback against Colorado and Roy Williams
and
>
>B. J. Johnson as the starting wide receivers.
>Brown said sophomore Chris Simms probably will play, too, but he said
>Applewhite will be the starter.
>He also said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but said
he
>
>and sophomore Kenny Hayter will alternate.
>"When you play as poorly across the board as we did Saturday, you need to
>make some changes to try to improve what you are doing," he said.
>Brown said the team also showed a lot of spark in its first workout since
>the
>devastating loss to Oklahoma Saturday. "They have a lot of pride," he said,
>"
>and they are not pleased with the way they played in Dallas."
>The Longhorns might have four starting wide receivers because they worked a
>lot on the shotgun formation with four wideouts Tuesday. That has been the
>team's most productive formation because the Horns haven't been able to run
>the ball consistently and that formation gives the quarterbacks more time
to
>
>pass.
>Brown also  said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a
>sprained ankle, will be able to play. He still isn't participating in
>contact
>drills, but Brown said he should be available to play at least part of the
>game.
>With Williams and Johnson moving into the starting lineup, the Horns now
>have
>three true freshmen starting because Kalen Thornton has been starting at
>defensive end for the last two games.
>Brown said he wanted to address the offensive changes Tuesday, and said he
>will announce any defensive changes on Wednesday. The defense had been
>playing well all year, but it had a bad day against Oklahoma.

>Texas won its first four games against Colorado, but has lost six straight
>to
>the Buffs since 1989. Brown was asked why he thinks Texas has had trouble
>with Colorado in recent years. Noting that Colorado won a national title in
>1990, Brown said, "They probably were just bettter than we were in some of
>those years."
>Texas has not played Colorado since Brown came to Texas.
>The Buffaloes are a 1-point favorite over the Longhorns this year.
>* * * *
>BUFFALO NOTES: Colorado coach Gary Barnett, noting the 63-14 whipping
>Oklahoma put on the Longhorns, said he asked his players Monday "How would
>you like to be in that (Texas) meeting room today?" He said one of his
>players replied, "Coach, we were in that meeting room a week ago." Kansas
>State had handed the Buffs their fourth straight loss the previous week. .
.
>
>Colorado is one of only four schools to ever win six straight games against
>Texas. The others are Oklahoma, Texas A&M and Southern Methodist. If
>Colorado
>wins Saturday, the Buffaloes will be the only school to ever beat the
>Longhorns seven straight imes.

>RECRUITING NOTE: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch  told me tonight
he
>
>might take until Monday to make his decision on a college choice. He said
it
>
>will probably be either Texas or LSU, with Colorado and Tennessee also
still

>BASEBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Michael Hollimon, 6-1, 170,  of Dallas Jesuit,
>the
>state's top shortstop, and Ryan Olivo, 6-2, 175, of Grapevine, one of the
>state's top second basemen, have committed to Texas. Hollimon hit .400 last
>season and also was recruited by Stanford, LSU, Baylor and Texas A&M. He
>narrowed his choices to Texan and Stanford and committed to the Longhorns
>Monday night after visiting Stanford last weekend. Olivo hit .450 and
>blasted
>three home runs in summer league play with the Arlington A's. He also
>considered Texas A&M, Texas Tech, Baylor, Kansas and Oklahoma State.
