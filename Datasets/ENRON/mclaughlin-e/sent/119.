Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're 
pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag 
him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do 
you have left?  

I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.

What's up with the 'old' crack!  Baby, I'm just aging like fine wine!!! : )
