Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the 
others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for 
everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and 
Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.

Thanks -- I know it's a pain,

Errol
