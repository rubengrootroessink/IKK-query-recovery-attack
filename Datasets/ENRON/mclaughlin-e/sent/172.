Bob,

I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.




Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
