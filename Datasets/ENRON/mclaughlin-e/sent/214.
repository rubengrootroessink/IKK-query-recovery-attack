BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the 
deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer 
Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.

Thanks, Errol

Errol-

There are two Bankers Trust Deals that you changed to Bankers Trust 
International. I pulled the trades from EOL and they say Bankers Trust. The 
Deal Nos are QT6916 and QT7116. Were these changed in error?

Thanks. Julie
