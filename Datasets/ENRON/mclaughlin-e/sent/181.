Subject: Option Logic

Now that the tagg test environment is running, I have tested the option logic 
with the new NG-Exotic book.  Please review the following deals in tagg stage 
and let me know if this is correct.

QQ7966 Call Option
QQ7967 Hedge

If this is the way it should be booked in tagg, it is all contingent on Mike 
Maggi deleting the current option suites active on option manager, recreating 
them and selecting NG-Exotic as the risk book under the auto hedge 
selection.  We will be more than happy to provide assistance, if needed.  If 
you approve, we will place this logic into production this evening after 
trading.

If this does not look correct or if you have any further questions, please 
contact Dawn (3-9353) or Tara (3-4523).  

Thank you for your help!

Dawn
