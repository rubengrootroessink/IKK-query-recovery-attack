Frank,

I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.

Thanks,

Errol
