Shannon,

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol

Errol,

I received a book request for the NG Options Book (Code ZH). Will this be a 
new roll in the NG Price book, associated with the PG book code? Also, I 
noticed that the PG book has three DPR's in the February folder. Should I be 
using the 022001NG DPR or the 022001NGmike and 022001NGjohn? What did you and 
Todd decide to do with the January variance from the NGP&L? Too many 
questions!!

Thanks!

Shannon
