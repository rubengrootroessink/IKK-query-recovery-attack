Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI - 
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas 
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig 
Group should be the new name.  
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas 
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the 
web. 

thanks,
brad
