Any luck with this request ? 
The auditors are chasing the information.

Errol,

I've had an audit request from Swift Energy Company, and they want the MTM 
value as of December 31, 2000 for the following trades:

QA0515.2
QA0515.3
QA0515.4

Could you, or someone in your group, please forward it to me.

Many thanks !
