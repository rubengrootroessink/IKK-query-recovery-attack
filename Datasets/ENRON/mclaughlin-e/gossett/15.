Subject:	RE:  ERMS discounting project

We met this morning to discuss ERMS Discounting testing.  

It was agreed that:

Jeff, Todd and Kevin will provide a listing of Friday's COB Post IDs to Jeremy/Karima by Monday noon, July 16th.
Jeremy will produce a comparison Report from the Post ID listing, comparing Gross Book Balances for current production and revised production.  This report will be available on Tuesday morning, July 17th. 
A test port calc will be available to run individual books to test both calculations against the production database, July 17th.
AA will be advised of this change once we have been able to quantify the GBB impact anticipated. 
No impact is expected in Infinity since ERMS will pass the revised settlement date with the notional cash flows.

Sheila

Scott,
This has no impact to you currenty since you are not using ERMS in production; but, we did want to make you aware of this change.

Kevin, Jeff, Todd,  

The discouting change to ERMS of moving the assumed cash flow date from the 1st of the production month to the end of the production month is in progress and targeted for production on August 1.  

IT is ready to begin user acceptance testing this week and next week.  IT is producing a spreadsheet to quantify projected calculation impact.

I will have Kelly set up a meeting for this Thursday so we can all meet with IT to discuss the testing process.  Please feel free to bring someone along who may be assisting your group with the testing process.

As discussed, no change will be done for Financial Settlements.  Both contract and calendar will continue as is with the first day of the month assumption.  The Monthly Reserve Calculation will quantify the impact to the gross book balance as if cash flows had been discounted to the correct date. 

Please do not hesitate to call with questions or suggestions.

Thanks. Sheila
