Please make sure that no one is talking about these things within earshot of others.  Make sure that everyone understands that all the information that they see is strictly confidential.

Please remind everyone to be mindful of elevator talk.  A consultant I know working in the Enron building overheard someone the other day saying talking about positions, price and pnl being lost?

Thanks,
Frank
