Subject:	Houston Excel Spreadsheet change for Counterparty Identification

All,
We are in the process of changing the Houston Based Excel Spreadsheets to require the use of the Global Counterparty ID (which is a number) instead of the ERMS Shortcode (also known as CP Code, or shortname) which is a legacy based identifier.  This will alleviate the unmatched exposure problem that we currently have in CAS and also get us going in the direction we have always wanted to go (being globally compliant in the data we receive).

Therefore, we are currently changing the spreadsheet template so that the spreadsheet will require the duns_link_id of the internal and external counterparties instead of the short codes which are currently used.  Wei Hu is modifying the spreadsheet table structure to handle this change.  We will provide someone to assist in the initial population of the CP_IDs and we will be working with the users to test the change and move the loader to production.

Once in production, the book administrators will have to obtain the GCP CP ID for these two columns.  My suggestion is to have them get accounts to view the Global CP application where they can see the duns_link_ids, names, etc.   Who can provide a listing of all the people that will need access to the GCP application?

Once this is in place, then we will look into turning on the validation requirement that does not allow the spreadsheet to be submitted until the various validations (of which IDs are one) have been passed.

We will provide a template early next week to some group of users so we can begin testing by mid to late next week.  Moving to production will happen soon thereafter.

Any concerns or issues? 

Thanks
John
