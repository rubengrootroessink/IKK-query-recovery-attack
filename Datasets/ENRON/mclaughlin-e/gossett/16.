Per Jeff Gossett,

	Being so that we have a new member to our team, Jeff wants to discuss the Goals and Objectives that you will/have set to accomplish for your individual group this year.  In doing so, he  wants you to think of  the following two things:

	1) How Jeff should measure what  goals/objectives you are planning to accomplish?

	2) What impact do you feel this should have on your review?

		Jeff wants to hear these two things verbally.  Do not include these two anwsers into your Goals and Objectives Presentation!!!

We will keep the same format, as per out last objectives meeting.  Please see the attached documents to print and reveiw; then give me any updates or changes you may have for your objectives.  If you have any questions or need any additional information, please let me know.

 

Thank you,

Irena
