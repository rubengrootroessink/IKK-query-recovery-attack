The listed books are all showing an Active status on the website, but do not have post id's for the 1st.  Could you please do one of two things: 1)Change the status to Inactive or Archive, if the books do not have any trades  or 2) if they should be officialized and should have a post id, work with Burton's group to resolve the issue.

We will be reporting on a daily basis all active books that did not have a post id show up on the website.  Therefore please manage the status of these books accordingly.  

If you have any questions about the website, please contact Chris, Burton, Jennifer, Susan or myself.

Thanks,	
		Jason W. Jenkins
