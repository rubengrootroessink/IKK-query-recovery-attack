Errol/Kam

For the meetings that I have scheduled with yourselves is it possible to have copies of the DPRs that you produce on a daily basis for the traders?

Also, a deal listing - I believe it is called "Forwards' details" - if this is not possible because the deal volumes are so big an alternative would be appreciated.

For Eastern - I want to look at the Structured deals, amount of deals, types of deals, how they are entered into the system and valued - the hand offs between structuring, risk, settlements and logistics for these non-vanilla deals.  Any deal booking documentation would be an advantage.

For Financial - I want to look at the calendar and basis option portfolios, how these are entered into the systems, captured, fed to risktRAC, spreadsheet models, research sign off etc.

Hope this helps but I will give you an overview at the start of the meetings to ensure you fully understand what the doorstep review is and why we are doing them.

Thanks
Rob
