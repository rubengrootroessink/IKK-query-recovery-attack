It is that time again.  Unfortunitily, we don't have a cooridinator at this time.

After talking to Brian Heinrick, the major driver is head count.

I am meeting with Brian, to go over what the time line looks like (very short I am sure).

PLease look at your head count numbers for the 2001 budget, head count today and what you think you need for 2002.

I will try to make this as painless as possilbe.

thanks

bob
