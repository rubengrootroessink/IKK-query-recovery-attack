Jeff,

The two NG-Price books were added per John's requeset, but have no trades in them.  I have changed their status to inactive.  The FT-Transport-Basis is an excel spreadsheet (according to the rac website), but I don't know why it is showing up under our desk -- I am calling Chris Abel to find out why.  In the interim I have changed the status to inactive.  I am checking on the books under Kori's name, but preliminarily it looks like there are no deals nor post id's for them, so I have changed there status to inactive.  I will keep you updated with anything else I find.

Thanks,

Errol

The listed books are all showing an Active status on the website, but do not have post id's for the 1st.  Could you please do one of two things: 1)Change the status to Inactive or Archive, if the books do not have any trades  or 2) if they should be officialized and should have a post id, work with Burton's group to resolve the issue.

We will be reporting on a daily basis all active books that did not have a post id show up on the website.  Therefore please manage the status of these books accordingly.  

If you have any questions about the website, please contact Chris, Burton, Jennifer, Susan or myself.

Thanks,	
		Jason W. Jenkins
