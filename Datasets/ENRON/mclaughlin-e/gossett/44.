Subject: Spreadsheets using the old method of loading

Please see  the request below.  Current spreadsheets users  using the old 
method to upload positions should get with either Susan Trevino or myself, 
between now and Friday,  to get familiar with the new upload method.  
Effective Monday, Dec. 18th all spreadsheet will be required to be uploaded 
via the new method.

These are the spreadsheets still using the old method of processing. These 
need to be processed with the new method as early as possible so that I can 
get rid of the older processsing methodology.
