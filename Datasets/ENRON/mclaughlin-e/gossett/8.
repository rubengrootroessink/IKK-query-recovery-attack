These should work just like the broker deals . There will be an EOL report that will list the origination that needs to be picked up from the trading desk. We apologise for not letting you'll know before this was released. However no mid-marketers have been set up yet and are not likely to be set up or start trading for at least 10 days. We have a training session for Mid-Marketers in 27 C2 tomorrow 8/23/01 at 4p.m. to discuss the funs=ctionality. If it will help please feel free to attend or have one of your people attend. We can also set up a sparate meeting asap to discuss this. Thanks.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.


It sure would be nice to know about these things in the future.  How is this going to work?  How will we pick up the orig?  As you know,  the system does not calculate orig.  What about the controls issues related to EOL confirms going out on originated deals?
