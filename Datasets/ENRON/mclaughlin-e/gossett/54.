 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.
