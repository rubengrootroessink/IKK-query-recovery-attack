Errol,

We think that we have discovered an error in the system.  Elena has been valuing the San Diego Gas & Electric position.  It looks as if the mid for Dec 01 NGI Socal is in the system as $-.046.  The actual index however was $2.27.  Could you or someone in your group pls look into this and let us know asap.  We need to value this deal correctly so that we can unwind it.

Thanks,
Craig
