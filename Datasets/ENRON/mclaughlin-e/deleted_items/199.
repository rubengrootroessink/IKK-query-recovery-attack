Hey guys,

I received this resume from someone in my group and after reading his resume, I thought he might be a good candidate for either OA or Risk.  Use at your discretion........

Rita, attached is the resume of my former co-worker who is looking for a new opportunity.  He is in Power Accounting on the retail side currently but he has also worked in Complex Deals the area where Eric was working breifly.  Thanks!
