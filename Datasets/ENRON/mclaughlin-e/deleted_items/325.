During a telephone conversation with Margaret Brooks, on May 15th, you
agreed to change the terms of deal #1246131  buying 10,000/day Gas Daily
HHub @$4.49 and replace it with a buy of 10,000/day NYMEX Swap @$4.495. We
still have not received a confirmation with the corrected terms.
Would you correct the price in your system or inform your contract
administrator of the correction.
If you have any questions please feel free to contact me or Margaret brooks
