Jeff,

Laurel sent me a spreadsheet w/ a list of deals w/ Royal Bank of Canada.  It appears we had 4 deals, totalling $3,843,422.  I have contacted (left a voice mail) Brian Gillis in the Canada regarding the remaining deals b/c they're GJ deals.  Kam's group ran minibooks to look for them and came up empty.  I let Laurel know all of this as well.

Thanks,

Errol
