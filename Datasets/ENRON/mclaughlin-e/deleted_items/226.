I am very pleased to announce that Inja Chun has been selected to head up the ENW EBS-IT Organization.  All parts of EBS-IT activities including Origination, Trading, Mid-to-Back office systems, etc. will report to Inja effective today.   Inja Chun is currently a Senior Director and has been with Enron since 1995.  She has been in charge of Mid-to-Back Office and HPL/LRC Pipeline Operations computer systems as well as other ENW systems.  Previously, she worked at Transco for 10 years and was in charge of the Transco Marketing Company's IT effort.  She has a Master's Degree in Computer Science from Kansas State University. 

We would like to thank Sue Klinke for her work as acting leader during this interim period.  Sue will be pursuing another opportunity in the Net Works organization. Any additional changes in this group will be announced soon.
