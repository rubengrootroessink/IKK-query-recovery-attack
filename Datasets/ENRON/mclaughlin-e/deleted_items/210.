Dear All,

	A PortCalc Production Fix ( v 4.1.9.1 ) executable (    /prod/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr.new     ) has been released.

	This executable is based on the last Production PortCalc. ( pwrcalc_slr  :  v4.1.9  08/20/2001).

	Version 4.1.9.1 .	

	Changes Affecting All:

Asian Options - Fixed the issue that single-average-period Asian option did not get correct the liquidation value.

Asian Options - Fixed VATR table issue for Risk Trac.

Volatility Smile - Fixed the issue in volatility smile calculation for previous day, so that the prior day MtM matches the results from the Prior Effective Date calc.

	Changes Affecting East:

Added support for Simulation Trading Portfolio - this will evaluate deals like the East portfolio.


	Changes Affecting Emission:

Added support for COAL Portfolio - this will evaluate deals like the East portfolio. This is for handling Power deals, not coal deals as the name implies.
