Subject:	RE: KStarr - Swiss Re Rebooking Update

To all,

I got clearance from the lawyers that the KCS-Swiss Re transaction did closed on Friday afternoon.  PLEASE END-DATE THE EXISTING DEALS JULY 31, AND "UNTEMP" THE NEW LEGS  TODAY (AUGUST 20th) as discussed last week.

Attached is a spreadsheet Russell put together with the history of the TAGG #s for your reference.

Call with any questions,

Eric

PS - After you calc today, I would appreciate a mini-book with the new legs.  Thanks in advance for all your help!

Just to be clear,

Please DO NOT "untemp" the new legs to Swiss Re until you hear from Russell or myself.  Our lawyers are still negotiating the ISDA and will inform us as soon as it is signed.

We understand that if the documents are signed after 4:00 pm today (CST), the deals will not be moved over until tomorrow.  However, this does not appear to be an issue as nothing will be settling on the swaps until the end of September.

Please call with any questions.
