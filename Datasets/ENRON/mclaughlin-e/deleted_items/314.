It has become necessary to devote a key resource to the review and resoluti=
on of the outstanding currency issues for the Calgary office.  The developm=
ent of potential solutions requires an individual that has a high level of =
technical knowledge in the risk area, is knowledgeable about the capabiliti=
es of our existing systems, understands the commercial implications of pote=
ntial solutions, and has a complete understanding of the accounting issues =
as well.  Because of her experience and background, I have asked Kathy Reev=
es to take the lead role in the development of solutions to our currency is=
sues.  Because of the time commitment that this requires, I have asked Bria=
n Gillis to assume responsibility for all risk activities for gas and for r=
etail.  Kathy will continue to have responsibility for the risk activities =
for power.  These changes will be effective immediately.  Please join me in=
 congratulating these individuals on their new responsibilities.  If you ha=
ve any questions, please let me know.
