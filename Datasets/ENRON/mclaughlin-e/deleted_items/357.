We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing - within Enron Americas. The Asset Marketing group will have responsibility for the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas. Joining Don's group will be Stuart Zisman.  Stuart was formerly in ENA Legal, having most recently worked on the sale of ENA's peaker plants with Don.

Please join us in congratulating Don and Stuart in their new roles.
