The NG-PR-OPT-PRC was erroneously placed in INACTIVE staus.  The position is flat and will stay flat, but there are positions in the book.  I will have the BA run the book and officialize it.

The NG-PRICE-GDL book was calc'd and officialized on Friday.  The website did not pick it up.  The post id was 1456207.

Please call me with any questions you may have.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274
