eProcurement

I am pleased to announce the launch of iBuyit eProcurement for Enron Wholesale Services.  Effective today, employees throughout EWS will be able to use eProcurement to purchase IT hardware and office supplies.  

This is a significant milestone in the Enron-wide cost saving effort.  This new tool enables us to reduce our expenses by taking advantage of preferred suppliers and automated approval routing.  The use of eProcurement will help ensure that our company dollars are being spent wisely.  

This is only the beginning!  eProcurement has the potential for unlimited growth by adding other products and services to the system.  Please feel free to provide the iBuyit team with feedback to ensure that future eProcurement enhancements and upgrades will make this a valuable and integral tool for your purchase activities.

I encourage you to visit the iBuyit Portal today and logon to eProcurement, to access training information and materials, and to learn more about Enron's business-wide cost savings opportunities:  http://ibuyit.enron.com
Note:  To logon enter your User ID (P number) and Password (initial password is ENRON1).
