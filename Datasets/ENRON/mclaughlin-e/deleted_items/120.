Kori:

During 2001 Kori had the following commodities added to her regular job duties of running Gas,Prepay, and Affiliate books:  1)  Steel 2)  South American Power 3)  Currency Swaps 4)  Canadian Power 5)  Resid Options 6)  Physical Power 7)    Deals w/ Canadian Gas Daily Logic.  Each of these commodities required significant time spent learning about the new commodity, training with the groups that handle these commodities, and learning a new P&L reporting format for each new commodity.  Kori did an excellent job of building on her previous experiences and integrating that knowledge with the new skillsets to meet the increasing demands of her high profile internal customer, who trusts her completely.

Laura:

During 2001 Laura was asked to increase her work from just standard, manual deal entry, to running our automated deal upload system and is a key contact for training others on it, as well as a contact when I.T./programming issues arise regarding the system.  Laura has become proficient w/ the TAGG/ERMS systems and can book and valuate the basic deal types we do.  In addition, Laura has become a backup for our brokered deal confirmation position, and she has developed reliable contacts at the brokerage houses we deal with.
