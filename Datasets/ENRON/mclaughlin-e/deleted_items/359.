Subject:	Revival of the Risk brown bag sessions

I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions.

I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in the training modules while you are compiling your lists.

Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first session.

The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum.  Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, who will present each topic.

I am also sending this note to John and Russ.  

John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a couple of topics to us.

Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, please let me know.

I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me know your opinion on this.

With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your people.

I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Greg
