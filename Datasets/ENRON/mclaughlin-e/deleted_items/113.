Hey everybody I have a friend doing a NFL playoff
pool. Here is how it works:

Rank every playoff team from 1-12. 12 being the team
you think is going to win the Super Bowl and 1 being a
team you think will lose its first game.

You get points based on the number of points you put
on each team that wins a game.

For instance if you put 12 points on the Steelers this
year and (they will do this by the way) they win the
Super Bowl they will give you 36 points. 12 for the
divisional round, 12 for Conference Championship and
12 for the Super Bowl. 

The cost of the pool is $20 and you can send me your
money and picks and I'll pass it on to Brian. I will
need your picks by Wednesday if possible.

Jimmy
