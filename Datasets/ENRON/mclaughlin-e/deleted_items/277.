Due to several changes in personnel over the last month or so, I thought it would be good to clarify reporting lines in the Global Data area.

John (Toby) Ellis has joined the Global Services group as Director Global Data Management reporting directly to Beth Apollo, VP Global Services and Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale.  Toby will play an instrumental role in the effort to assimilate EES contracts and information and records management functions into EWS - Global Risk Management Operations.

Reporting to Toby will be Collette Weinrich, Manager Global Contracts - EES, Carolyn Gilley, Manager Information and Records Management and the Global Outsourcing group that includes Karen Lambert, Tammie Huthmacher and Tracey Kozadinos.

James Scribner will continue to lead the Global Counterparty, Global Rates and the Operations Pricing Desk groups.  Reporting to James is Bill Hare, Manager Global Counterparty Projects and Integration, Tandra Coleman who recently joined the group as Manager Global Counterparty Houston Operations, Karen Snow, Manager, Operations Pricing Desk and the Global Rates group that includes Kelly Lombardi, Willie Harrell and Jenny Helton.

The efforts of our team continue to play a key role in Wholesale Operations.   The success of our organization and the impact it has on so many cross-functional organizations is very dependent on the continued adherence to excellence in our communication, systems support and customer service commitment.  I look forward to working together to achieve our goals.
