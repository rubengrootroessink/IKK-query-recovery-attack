Joey,

Check this one out for me.  Make the change if we haven't already done so.

Thanks,

EM

Errol,


Deal V92728.1, was traded on 5/11/01 by John Arnold through EOL.  The Counterparty, which is Bank of America, claims that John has agreed to change the terms of the deal from nymex vs. gas daily henry hub to fixed for float nymex.  Could you verify that with John so that can I make the corrections to the confirmation.

Thank you,

Patrick
