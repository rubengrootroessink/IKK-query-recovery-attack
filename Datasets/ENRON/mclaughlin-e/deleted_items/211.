Tanya,
Errol asked me to save you a copy of the basis options file.  It is in a dropbox at:

O:/_dropbox/riskmgmt/exotic pipe options101001.xls

All Basis options are on the Basis Options tab.  The files that we export out to RiskTrac are on the TXT File-P and TXT File-D tabs.

If you have any questions please let Errol or I know.
