	Welcome to iwin!
	
	...and a big old thank you for registering...
	
	 Now you are eligible to win prizes just for playing games. No gimmicks. No 
purchase necessary. No  fine print.* 
	
	We have all of these nifty things we call iCoins (some people  still call 
them "points". Weird, eh?) 
	
	Did you feel that? You just earned 10 iCoins for registering.  Wasn't that 
easy? You can earn more iCoins by playing games at: 
	iwin Games 
	
	You then use your iCoins to join drawings for HUGE prizes,  like vacations, 
electronics, or $20,000 in cold, hard cash. To see all the great stuff you 
can win, go to: 
	iwin Prizes 
	
	* When I say "HUGE", you know what I mean, right? Some of the prizes are 
actually HUGE. Meaning - you can't lift them. The other  HUGE prizes are HUGE 
in the AMAZING sense of the word HUGE. Does that make sense? I suppose I 
could go back and change HUGE to AMAZING. But that would interrupt my flow. 
But I ask you this: Who would really want to interrupt my flow? 
	Yes, this is fine print. But it's not about anything important.
