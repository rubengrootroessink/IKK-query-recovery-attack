Please have your "needs improvement" reviews submitted to HR and Legal by 
Friday,  January 19.  Let me know today if for some reason you will not be 
able to complete them by that date.

Dutch - Can you get with Errol so that he can write the goals and 
expectations portion of Sherry's review.

Thanks
