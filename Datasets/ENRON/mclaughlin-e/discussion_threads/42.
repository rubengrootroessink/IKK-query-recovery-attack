Subject: Hedges not linking to sitara deals

Dat and George, risk informed me of 2 additional sitara deals that are not 
"linking" the hedges to the primary sitara deal.  Dat, can you please look 
into this and let me know if this is a quick fix or not.  Risk is inquiring.  
EOL #719279 and #713548 are the one's on question.

Tara and Torrey, what is happening is risk is not seeing a hedge attaching to 
the sitara deal and manually booking the hedge.  But, the hedge is being 
created, just not linked to the primary physical deal.  

Jeff,  I will let you know when this is corrected.  Please advise your group 
not to manually hedge the deals in sitara.  If in doubt if it is hedged, have 
them type in the next number after the sitara number which should be the 
hedge.  For example, the physical deal is 547092, the hedge will be 547093.  
Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Dawn
