John:

We are testing the new version of the Asian model from Research, and there 
are a couple of issues
we need to resolve with Paulo.  We should have a version ready for your 
testing by the end of this week.  
I will inform you and Errol when we complete our testing.

Thank you,
Jeremy

Here is the file for the Asian function. I am sorry about changing the 
comments to a C++ style. 
You may easily change it back to C style by using the replace function in 
MS-Word or from any other editor.
