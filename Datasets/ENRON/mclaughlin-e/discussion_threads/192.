Errol,

Could you please make the following adjustments in your NG Price DPR's, in 
order to correct the NGP&L January problem? In the 012001NG DPR, reduce the 
liquidations in Roll 4 by $2,898,246. This should bring your total hedge 
management number on your report page to $109,744,754, which will make the 
DPR tie to the NGP&L for January. Then, in your February DPR take an income 
adjustment of $2,898,246. You can add this adjustment to the PMA file that I 
sent you last week. If you make these two adjustments, it should get us back 
to where we need to be for the NGP&L tie out. Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Thanks!

Shannon
