That's great for Maurice and Demetris!  Maurice will make such a good
dad!

I am doing the U of H Exec MBA program.  I go to school all day Friday
and Saturday every other weekend.  As you can see, this is my weekend
off from class.  The most attractive thing about the program is that
it's only a year long!  So, we started in Jan and graduate in Dec.  This
year has already been intensive though with working full-time and trying
to study, read, and write case studies.  FYI-Enron's VP of Corporate
Finance (Dan Castagnola) is in my class and he is very funny. The class
discussions have been pretty interesting so far and since I am the
youngest person in the class I have learned quite a bit from others.
Almost everything is done in these teams that you stay in all year.  I
know it will be worth it though come December.  I would have liked to
have done UT's program because of the name and recognition but with me
being in Houston already this was most feasible. So, pray for me and I
know everything will be ok.

And yes, you are getting old but I am sure you look as young as you were
in high school 'cause I know I do! (smile)
But no, really, I do! :)

Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that
they're
pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to
drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How
long do you have left?

I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing.

What's up with the 'old' crack!  Baby, I'm just aging like fine wine!!!
