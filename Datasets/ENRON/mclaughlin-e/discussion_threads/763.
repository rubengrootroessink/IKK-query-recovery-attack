Stacey, I will out of the office from May the 2nd to May the 21st. Amy 
Cavazos will be flipping out all Canada deals while I am out. Amy knows how 
to run the macro report to insure all deals have been flipped out.   You may 
reach Amy at 713-345-4074 if she is unavailable you may reach Laura Vargas at 
713-345-8197 and Errol 713-345-8274.  
Thank You,
Sherry
