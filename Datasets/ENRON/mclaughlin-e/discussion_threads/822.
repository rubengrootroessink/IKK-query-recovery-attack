FYI:  there may be a dup in the system from December.

Dutch is checking it out on his end and Jennifer is looking into why it may 
have been settled last month w/ no questions.

It looks like Jean verballed a non-brkerd deal that should have been brkered 
but the deal was never "actioned".
And Bianca verballed the bkered trade, which was "actioned" and then removed 
after it was corrected.

Thanks,
Sheetal

Can either one of you help me...

Calpine- does not know Deal QF1735.1-traded by John Arnold.

Deal QF1336.1 is the exact same trade terms, but is brokered through GFI and 
traded by Mike Maggi.

Calpines thinks these are duplicate trades-and only knows the QF1336.1
Their trader is Thomas McAndrew @ 713 830-8640

Calpine has short-paid by 136,990 due to this trade.

Please let me know if the trade by John Arnold is valid-
Thanks so much
