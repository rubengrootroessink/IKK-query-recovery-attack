Dear Errol,

We have still not received the Affidavit form from you. I have tried calling 
you
both in the office and at home but was not able to get through. Kindly send 
us the affidavit form
by the 3rd of December, Sunday - which is Monday in Korea - so that I can 
request for shipment immediately.
If we do not receive the Affidavit by this week, I am afraid that we will 
have to forfeit your prize.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or inquiries.

Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon.


Best Regards,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
