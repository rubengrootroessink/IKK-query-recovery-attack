Dear Errol Mclaughlin Jr,

Your December 2000 Citibank statement reflected a higher credit line 
than your November statement, because your account earned a credit 
line increase in December. 

An email sent to you on January 15, 2001, was intended as a 
confirmation of that December increase. 

Congratulations once again on your credit line increase. 

Kendall E. Stork 
President and CEO 
Citibank (South Dakota), N.A.
