Experience a New Level of Internet Security

Wish that shopping on the Internet could be safer and easier? Sign up for 
Discover deskshop(SM) and graduate to the next level of Internet security. 
Shop with the ease and the ability to fill out online checkout forms with 
just ONE CLICK!

Here's how it works:

Each time you use the new Discover deskshop 2.0 virtual credit card to fill 
an online checkout form, it can automatically generate a single-use card 
number and fill the form.

This means your actual Discover Card Account number, which appears on your 
card, is not used when you check out and the purchase appears on your monthly 
Discover Card statement.

Your single-use card number works for one or multiple purchases at online 
stores and for recurring charges such as your monthly Internet Service 
Provider membership.

Sign up for Discover deskshop 2.0 today!

It's simple. It saves time. It saves money. And it's FREE!
