Errol,

Could you take a look at these two Option/Call deals that successfully 
bridged into Tagg( 750242/QK1859 & 750296/QK1897).  Also, take note that the 
swaps did not bridge into Tagg as requested ( 750297 & 750243), and will 
remain in failed status until further notice.  Everything looks great on our 
end!

One deal failed simply because John Arnold logged in as the buyer and acted 
as the seller.  This only happened once. ( 750209 Option, and 750210 Swap)

Torrey,

What is the plan for all swaps that have been requested to end up in failed 
status ?  

 ( Look under Torrey and Errol Tab)



Thanks
TARA
