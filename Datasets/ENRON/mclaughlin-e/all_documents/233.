Torrey/Dawn -

Do you guys really think this is a reasonable reqeust.  Looks like there are 
in excess of 1500 deals.  If you guys need this field covered,  we need to 
come up with a better process than manually changing deals in TAGG.  Let me 
know how you would like to handle this or if we need to discuss further.  We 
will be happy to assist you any way we can,  short of manually going into 
1500 deals.

Thanks

Subject: EOL Broker Clean Up

Jeff,

I am attaching a list of EOL transactions that we need your help "cleaning 
up".  With the new Broker-Client application that EOL is bringing on this 
weekend, we need to remove EOL from the broker field.  What we have run into 
is:  there are many deals in Tagg that have EOL in the broker field but no 
EOL number.  We are requesting that risk go through and add the EOL deal 
number to the tagg legs where there is none listed.  The reason for this is 
that if we remove EOL from the broker field and there is no EOL deal number 
reference, then there is no way to no if that deal is an EOL deal.  For audit 
purposes, no one could tie back to the deals.  

Please give this list to the appropriate risk groups (by index).  Let me know 
if you have any further questions.  ALSO, this list is in addition to the 
list that I provided Errol yesterday.

Thank you,
Dawn
