Errol,

I am still interested in selling the car; I have a couple driving in from
Austin next weekend who are really serious about buying the car. I started a
new business (see below) and need a 4 door car.

The specifications:

1998 Porsche Boxster, Metallic Blue, Black top with black interior, 23,400
miles, $37,500, 17" wheels, CD player, cruise control, heated mirrors, power
seats, automatic climate control, factory alarm, 5-speed, power top, power
windows, remote trunk release, gold Porsche badges (on wheels as well).

Performance:  0-60 mph 6.4 seconds / 150 mph top speed / 201 hp 2.5 liter
flat six engine

Errol - if you are interested let me know ASAP; Jennifer (Austin couple) is
pretty serious about the purchase. I also have a 1995 Triumph Speed Triple
with 8,200 miles (bought new in 8/96) that I am looking to sell for $4,800.
Comes with lots of accessories.

The story:

I bought the car in 10/99 with 5,300 from West Side Infiniti (Houston). An
older gentleman traded in the car for a Q45 (he had the Porsche for a year;
had a hard time getting in and out of the car). The record (call Momentum
Porsche in Houston - all record on file) show that the car had an oil change
at 2,000 miles, 4,200 miles, 14,000 miles (15,000 mile check up). The car
currently has 23,400 miles on it. I have had no problems with the car and is
in perfect running condition.

The original Pirelli P-Zero's lasted me until 21,555 (quite a feat
considering that they run out at 14,000 - 18,000 miles). I replaced the
tires with Pirelli P7000 Super Sports (better 4 season tire and longer tread
life without sacrificing handling). I also had the shop align the car to
factory settings.

The car has been garaged all of the time. I used to work in downtown and
live in downtown so the car barely was driven during the weekdays. The car
is driven more on a daily basis. I used to own a BMW Z3 so taking care of
German cabriolets is comes second hand. The car has never been in a wreck
and is in perfect condition in every aspect. The interior color is black and
again in perfect condition. Please let me if you are interested and I will
be more than happy to let you test drive the car or take it to your mechanic
for an inspection (or arrange a screening with one of the Porsche dealers to
inspect the car).

Please feel free to contact me at either numbers below.
