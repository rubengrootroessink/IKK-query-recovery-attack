Mark,

Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch 
Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal 
tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were 
included in the information picked up Friday.

I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the 
Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 
713-853-0430.

Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book 
for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.



I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as 
soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards 
details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not 
have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.
