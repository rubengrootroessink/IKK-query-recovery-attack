Durch,

It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 
netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal 
NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.

Errol

Errol,

Check this in the system and see if he is being billed for the original deal 
and an unwind deal to net him to the correct position.
Let me know or contact Perry please.

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Thanks and call if you have any questions.
