Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage 
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk 
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job 
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are 
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now?  
When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 
'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage.  
Call me when you get a minute!!

Hey Errol,
Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought I'd
say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
Well, holler back when you get a moment.
