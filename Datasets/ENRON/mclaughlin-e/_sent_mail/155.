John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274
