The deals in the worksheet below have been flipped out.  In the future please 
cc: myself on any of these E-mails and I will make sure they are taken care 
of promptly.  In addition, Laura will be out until Feb. b/c of maternity 
leave and Sherry will be out through Monday -- she is stuck in Arkansas b/c 
of the ice storm there.

Thank you,

Hi guys,

I took the liberty of looking in the NG-PRICE book to see if any deals were 
missed,
and came across a lot.  Here are the deals that need to be flipped to the
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book before 2:00pm Houston time as I need to get invoices
off to the customers today.



There are about 40 other deals in this book that still need to be dealt with 
for January
settlement, but these ones need to be fixed right away.  I've left a phone 
message with
Laura, but haven't heard back yet, and I think that Sherry is still out of 
the office as she
hasn't changed her outgoing message to say that she's in the office.

If there are any problems with this message, please let me know.

Thanks for all your help
Stacey
