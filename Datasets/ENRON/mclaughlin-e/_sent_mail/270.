These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, 
T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we 
did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided 
explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these 
companies.

Thanks,

Errol
