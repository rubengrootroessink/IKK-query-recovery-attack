Vikas:  We can do this -- just have Todd call me with the deal number and we 
can book a pass through deal.

Guys:  Do you know where we came out on our ability to do this?

Thanks, Vikas

Sherry/Errol:

I just got a request from Todd Lambert at EES to retroactively do a trade for 
expired months.  The details are:

EES sold NYMEX gas contracts to a customer named Springs Industry for futures 
months October, November, and December 2000.

However they were not supposed to sell to the customer directly at that 
point.  He wants to know if we can work out a deal where he instead sold 
those contracts to us and then have us sell to the customer.

There would be no net position and we would just serve as a pass through for 
their deal.

I'll come by later today to see if we can do it.

Vikas
