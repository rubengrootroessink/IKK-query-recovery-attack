Hi Errol,

I understand you are having some trouble getting into the view on the sample 
option trade from this morning. AI'm able to get in, so I have attached 
screen prints of the trade and its auto-hedge.

Please verify that these are correct and let either Dawn and Tara or myself 
know..

Thanks,
Torrey
