It looks like Saturday, November 18 is the best day for this event. I have 
heard back from the East, Texas, Central and Benchmark groups as to how many 
players they will have. I still need to hear back from the West and Price 
desks about this date. Please let me know by the end of the week so that I 
may book the field.

Thanks,
Pat
