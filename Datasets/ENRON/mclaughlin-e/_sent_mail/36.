Irena,

The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of 
improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your 
team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come 
up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic 
supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that 
would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last 
minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we 
won't have as many space issues in the future.

I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard 
to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.

Thanks,

Errol

Per our off site meeting,

 I would like each of you to send a list of your administrative needs to me.  
Also, what do you feel 
that the administrative team can do/improve for your group(s), that can 
cause  a substantial change for the best?  

 After I receive these listings, I will be meeting with each of you to 
discuss.

Thank you,

Irena
