Sue,

I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after 
you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book 
administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the 
counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk 
are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because 
there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing 
up on your report.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
