Jeff,

I wanted to give you an update on George's start date.  He is finishing up a 
project currently, and is looking at February 19th as a start date.  However, 
he feels that there is a strong possibility that he will finish earlty and be 
able to start on Feb. 12th.  I will keep you updated.

Thanks,

Errol

Hi, Errol:

I am doing great because I am going to join your group soon.  

I have a project in hand.  It was expected to be finished by mid Feburary and 
my current unit would let me go on Feb. 19.  
I am pushing hard to finish this project by the end of next week.  But I 
cannot guarantee it now.  Later this week I will have a better idea of 
whether I could report to you on Feb. 12.  Do you think this is OK?

I look forward working with you soon!  Have a great day!

George,

How are you doing.  Well, I hope.  Could you just give me a quick shout and 
let me know when you think you will be able to start in our group.

Thanks,
