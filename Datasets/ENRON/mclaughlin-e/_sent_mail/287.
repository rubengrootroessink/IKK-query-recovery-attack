Attached is a forwards detail model in Excel format that will allow you to 
view and manipulate new deals for a particular date.  You will need to enter 
the Post I.D. for the date you wish to view (see below) in cell B4 in the 
worksheet titled "Run Query" and then click the "Fetch Detail" macro button.  
The deals can then be viewed in the "Results" worksheet.
