Subject: Harassment Avoidance Seminar

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
