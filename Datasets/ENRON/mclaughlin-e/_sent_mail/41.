Errol,

There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
TAGG deal numbers.
 
When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
broker, no deals were found.

Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
settled as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mechelle
