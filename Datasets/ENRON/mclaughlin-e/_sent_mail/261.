Subject: Monthly MTM

Hi Everyone,

I just wanted to let you all know that we will need the end-of-month MTM 
numbers from each group by Thursday of next week. The MTM values provided 
should be as of close of business 9/30/2000 and should be broken out between 
physical and financial. Just give me a call at x36218 if you have any 
questions or need any additional information. Thanks!

Torrey
