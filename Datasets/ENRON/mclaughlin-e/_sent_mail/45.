Subject: Windows 2000 Migration for the RM-Finance and Administration 
Business Unit

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.
