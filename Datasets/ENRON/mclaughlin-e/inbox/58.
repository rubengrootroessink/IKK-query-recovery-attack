800-711-8000 Code 3454709) will be open during the testing times. We reques=

Subject: Status report of NETCO integration testing from Friday, Jan. 18th =
and next weeks testing...


Status report of integration testing from Friday, Jan. 18th (executed subse=
t of Gas/ Power scenarios to test that all platform components are setup)
=20
Thanks to all those involved in user integration testing last week.  Numero=
us issues were identified and resolved throughout testing, and many people =
worked late Friday evening (and weekend) to resolve outstanding issues.  In=
frastructure made super headway with creating the NetCo nc_t_xxxx id's and =
quickly addressing the startup script issues.
=20
A spreadsheet is attached of the outstanding/ resolved issues.  Issues coul=
d be resolved but not confirmed through testing, or not communicated back t=
o the test team.  If any testing issues are missing and not reflected, plea=
se email Terry Sanvido or myself to assist with tracking and resolution.
=20
Canada/ Portland testing
Some users were able to test/ validate their startup/ applications.  The Ne=
tCo terminal server ( <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) is available=
 (Trading Cluster, GPC).  We are requesting for the Canada/ Portland users =
to test according to the schedule below.  Richard McKeel will assist with e=
scalation to Houston.
 <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com/>=20

Where we left off with testing:
Gas testing                       Unify volume management, logistics, and S=
ettlements; awaiting data replication fix.
Power testing                   Kelley Huntley/ Unify Settlements; awaiting=
 data replication fix.
Financial testing                Mechelle Stevens/ Unify Settlements; await=
ing data replication fix.
Canada/ Portland testing   Some testing conducted; awaiting any issues=20
=20
Schedule for Tuesday 01/22 - resolve issues and complete subset testing scr=
ipts
9:00am daily IT status meeting.  Review spreadsheet and discuss any issues =
outstanding from testing.  Work to resolve all issues before user testing s=
tartup at 1:00pm.
=20
1:00pm - 4:00pm Continue with subset testing scripts
     (1) Continue with testing left off on Friday - mainly Unify and SAP
     (2) Canada/ Portland to continue pre-testing and report issues
     (3) Re-validate any open issues from last week that are resolved but n=
ot confirmed
     - Bridgeline open to discuss issues (800-711-8000; code #3454709)
=20
4:00 pm - IT to continue with testing of deletion/ truncation scripts to pr=
epare for Wednesday
=20
Last week's testing - not all systems have removed their estate data
Given application unit testing was crossing the same schedule as user integ=
ration testing, not all systems have completely deleted (truncated) their e=
state data (contracts, desks/ portfolios, estate data, addresses).  The nex=
t user test needs to be conducted in an environment that emulates a 'go liv=
e' for Netco.
It's requested for all IT systems to have completed removal of data (trunca=
tion scripts) by 10:00am on Wednesday.  Global will have to repush the NetC=
o data before the testing.

Schedule for Wednesday 01/23 (complete set of scenarios to be tested)
(1) By 11:00am - all IT systems to have deleted any estate data & backups c=
ompleted
(2) 11:00am - Global to repush any setup data if needed
(3) 12:00pm - global data setup by users
(4) 1:00pm - 5:00pm User integration test of all test scenarios.  The goal =
is to test 'end to end' to ensure the all issues are resolved, and data rem=
oval and resetup is valid.
- Bridgeline open to discuss issues (800-711-8000; code #3454709)
=20

We appreciate your support as we work towards setting up the NETCO!
