We probably need to talk about this to figure out who is going to be responsible for this task.

Thanks

Jeff, I was notified by Beth Apollo (VP-EES), that I am to stay with Enron Estate, which I suspect may be an error.  I am (EA). The Natural Gas Settlement Group is going with the New Company, NG Traders, and NG Risk Desks. I am the only one left from the Rates Group responsible for daily and monthly maintenance and management of all commodities posted rates. I would appreciate your feedback to Beth Apollo or Sally Beck or whomever in  your  opinion  which company I would be the most valuable.  Happy Holidays!  Willie Harrell (3-9226)
