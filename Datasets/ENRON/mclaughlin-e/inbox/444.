I actually wanted to discuss what opportunities are open in your area, as well.  I'd prefer to discuss this, for now, with just yourself.  Meliza had actually mentioned it earlier , that I should talk with you, so maybe we can casually discuss it during lunch.  I know that being in your area is quite demanding on your personal time, and I have 2 year old.  But I have strong background and I am just curious as to what else is out there.  This group is ok, but I am not being fully utilized.  I will attach my resume, for your review.

Thanks again for agreeing to sit me with.  It's getting pretty tight around here!!!
