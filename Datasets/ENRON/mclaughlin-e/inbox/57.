Errol,

Could you refresh my memory on who you sent the Canadian gas deals to for valuation?  Sheila Glover is requesting that we gather the valuations and documentation for those transactions this week.  As RBC owes Enron the settlement amount, we'd like to move quickly on this one.  Thanks very much for your help.  Please call if you have any questions at all.
