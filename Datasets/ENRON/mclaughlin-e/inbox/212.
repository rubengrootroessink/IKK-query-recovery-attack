Shannon,
Attached are the files before the changes and after.  The changes made were to NGI-Socal and NGI/Chi. gate Index price for Sep-01 options.  The net change is -18,500.  I will take that PMA this month.  This change will nullify the need to take 4 PMAs on the current schedule:
1. Occidental: Deal QI6807.1
2. AEP: QI4559.1
3. Southern California: V40750.1, V53712.1
4. Virginia Power: QV7793.1, QY8669.1, V27240.1

b/c of these changes the total PMA I take this month will be +34,143 instead of +8343.

Thanks,
Brad
