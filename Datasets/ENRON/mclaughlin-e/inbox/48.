Subject: Monday 01/28 - Status report of integration testing, remaining, ou=
tstanding issues, going forward


Everyone - updates from testing last week, and communication of information=
/ going forward.
=20
Thanks to all involved in last weeks testing.  Much has been accomplished. =
 We did encounter a legal mandated 'test freeze' on Friday given a legal co=
mmunication came down to halt all data entry/ code changes, but as of Frida=
y evening, it was eventually lifted.  Any unfinished testing can continue.
=20
We've completed:
- Integration testing of 25 transaction type scenarios - from EOL entry, Si=
tara, TDS, Tagg.  This includes the sample testing of scripts, and the end =
to end testing to SAP.
- EOL has sent 13 gas and 4 financial transactions through downstream syste=
ms.
- Over 50 integration issues identified and resolved!  Majority were data s=
etup issues, but code changes were identified, incorrect hardware being use=
d, reports not running, start-up scripting issues resolved, replication iss=
ues resolved.
=20
What's remaining to test and status:
1) EDI testing - Tammy Jaquet, Robert Virnau are expected to complete the E=
DI test by end of day today (01/28)
2) Financial Settlements/ EOL deals - Mechelle Stevens is completing her ve=
rification of EOL deals into Unify.  Testing is expected to complete the ED=
I test by end of day today (01/28).
3) SAP testing - SAP is still in requirements analysis with regards to GL a=
ccount setup, profit centers.  A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday afterno=
on with the UBS, SAP, Netco leads.  SAP testing can be conducted between Un=
ify and within SAP once decisions are determined.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Outstanding known issues:
1) Unify custom reports (SQR) not working.  This was not part of integratio=
n test, but testing by Kelley Huntley on Friday resulted in failure.  Infra=
structure expected to resolve by Monday noon.
2) There is some data setup that is being completed Monday morning and shou=
ld be complete by now.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Going forward:
1) The Netco EOL (or new OLT?) team will be testing all week deals into Net=
co environments.  You may see these in downstream systems.
2) Analysis of what estate data still resides in Netco, and what needs to b=
e there to go forward.  Namely curve data for EnPower.
3) We will perform regression testing to determine if there are any cross d=
ependency of hardware.  Testing scenarios include:
    a) Application messaging that use Tibco (port, multi-cast addresses)
    b) Estate execution with Netco hardware inactive
    c) Netco execution with Estate hardware inactive
=20
Notice/ FYI - All Netco (UBS) employee's LAN NT user-id's will be changed t=
o a new file server (anticipated Friday 02/01). =20
The impacts are mainly the O:\ drive, W:\ drive will be split between Estat=
e and Netco.  All authorized (legal) data is being copied now to the new fi=
le servers.
For example, if Netco employees need specific files on the O:\ drive, if th=
ey are missing, they would have remained with estate.  If you have files in=
 progress, they
may missing the batch file copy which is occurring this week.
=20
Updates to follow later this week!

Status report of integration testing from Wednesday, Jan. 23rd=20
    - (16 gas/ power types of transactions to test)
=20
Overall, there were no infrastructure or major application issues.  Unlike =
the prior testing, we've included many more gas transaction types and testi=
ng with all non-essential Netco data removed (aka baseline for Netco go-liv=
e).=20
=20
In today's test, we had numerous data setup related issues  that resulted i=
n downtime (ie EOL- Dynegy information, TGP address information, bad credit=
 counterparty/ contracts,  or database issues with data sync/ replication).=
   These were mainly attributed to the massive cleanup/ removal of data not=
 needed.  The  remaining issues open are being addressed Wednesday night. =
=20
=20
Given the deferred 12:00pm to 2:00pm start time and data setup/ sync issues=
, we were unable to complete downstream processes (mainly Settlements, conf=
irmations, SAP).=20
=20
Continuation of testing into Thursday
We are requesting the testers with tasks remaining to complete the script e=
xecution Thursday (morning shift and afternoon shifts given UBS offsite mee=
tings).
We will try to balance the testing activities given some will be out in the=
 morning, and some in the afternoon.  The bridgeline will be active from 9 =
- 5 for communication/ status.
