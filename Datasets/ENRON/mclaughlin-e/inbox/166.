We had just completed moving the request deals into the bankrupcy book.
As requested, we only moved the following deals:

	- Financial deals only
	- NG or NGGJ commodities only
	- Active deals only (Greater than or equal to Dec 01, 2001)
	- ENA Deals only - We did not touch other deals
	- Live deals only, no killed deals.
	- no book to book deals.

The changes are now in TAGG and in ERMS for valuation.

Attached is a new list of Counterparty Deal terminations for Financial Natural Gas.  Please move all the Financial Natural Gas transactions for the Counterparties to the Bankruptcy Book.  I have included the Counterparty IDs for your reference.  Please let myself and Jeff Gossett know when the move has been completed.  Please call with any questions.
