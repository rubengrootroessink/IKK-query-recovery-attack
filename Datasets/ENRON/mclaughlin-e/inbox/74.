Tanya, Cynthia, Frank

I do not know the appropriate G/L account code to which negotiated unwinds prior to the bankruptcy should be applied.

Can either of you please provide the appropriate coding.

Thanks.

This was a negotiated unwind prior to the bankruptcy.  When the deal was input into TAGG, it should have resulted in a liquidation. Thus this disbursement should have been a debit to the payable account to clear that account.

I spoke with Kevin Bosse in our group who said that Tanya Rohauer is the one that initiated the wire.  Patricia Bloom called me and I gave her this information.  Is Tanya no longer with the company.  I don't really have any idea where this should be coded, but if Tanya is not here any longer, then I will try and find out.

Cynthia,

Frank Cernosek suggested I contact you regarding the application of $4,040,916.00 payment on November 30, 2001 to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund via Citibank New York 407801075.

Can you advise the appropriate G/L account coding against which to record the expense.

Thanks.
