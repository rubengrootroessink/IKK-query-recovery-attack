Errol,

Torrey sent us a file with all of the EOL products and the old book assignments.  He need us to tell him the new trader name, book name and global ID today. 

The file is saved in Netco\controls\Trader-Book template (US gas)_EOL new books.xls

the global ID's are saved in your book request also in the controls file
