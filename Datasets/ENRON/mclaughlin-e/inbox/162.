Outstanding Request from Vusal.
I just found out that there is an outstanding request
from Vusal Najafov to change the option expiry date
of WTI (Crude Oil) Options deals for delivery on Jan 2002
from Dec 14, 2001 to Dec 13, 2001.

Should I do the changes in production or NOT?

Vusal,

	we have prepared the program that will change the option expiry of
	all WTI deals for Jan 2002 delivery from December 14, 2001 to December 13, 2001.

	Please confirm and approve this and we will run it the first slot we get.

Francis
