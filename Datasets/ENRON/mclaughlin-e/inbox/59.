Status report of integration testing from Friday, Jan. 18th (executed subset of Gas/ Power scenarios to test that all platform components are setup)
 
Thanks to all those involved in user integration testing last week.  Numerous issues were identified and resolved throughout testing, and many people worked late Friday evening (and weekend) to resolve outstanding issues.  Infrastructure made super headway with creating the NetCo nc_t_xxxx id's and quickly addressing the startup script issues.
 
A spreadsheet is attached of the outstanding/ resolved issues.  Issues could be resolved but not confirmed through testing, or not communicated back to the test team.  If any testing issues are missing and not reflected, please email Terry Sanvido or myself to assist with tracking and resolution.
 
Canada/ Portland testing
Some users were able to test/ validate their startup/ applications.  The NetCo terminal server (<http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) is available (Trading Cluster, GPC).  We are requesting for the Canada/ Portland users to test according to the schedule below.  Richard McKeel will assist with escalation to Houston.
 <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com/> 

Where we left off with testing:
Gas testing                       Unify volume management, logistics, and Settlements; awaiting data replication fix.
Power testing                   Kelley Huntley/ Unify Settlements; awaiting data replication fix.
Financial testing                Mechelle Stevens/ Unify Settlements; awaiting data replication fix.
Canada/ Portland testing   Some testing conducted; awaiting any issues 
 
Schedule for Tuesday 01/22 - resolve issues and complete subset testing scripts
9:00am daily IT status meeting.  Review spreadsheet and discuss any issues outstanding from testing.  Work to resolve all issues before user testing startup at 1:00pm.
 
1:00pm - 4:00pm Continue with subset testing scripts
     (1) Continue with testing left off on Friday - mainly Unify and SAP
     (2) Canada/ Portland to continue pre-testing and report issues
     (3) Re-validate any open issues from last week that are resolved but not confirmed
     - Bridgeline open to discuss issues (800-711-8000; code #3454709)
 
4:00 pm - IT to continue with testing of deletion/ truncation scripts to prepare for Wednesday
 
Last week's testing - not all systems have removed their estate data
Given application unit testing was crossing the same schedule as user integration testing, not all systems have completely deleted (truncated) their estate data (contracts, desks/ portfolios, estate data, addresses).  The next user test needs to be conducted in an environment that emulates a 'go live' for Netco.
It's requested for all IT systems to have completed removal of data (truncation scripts) by 10:00am on Wednesday.  Global will have to repush the NetCo data before the testing.

Schedule for Wednesday 01/23 (complete set of scenarios to be tested)
(1) By 11:00am - all IT systems to have deleted any estate data & backups completed
(2) 11:00am - Global to repush any setup data if needed
(3) 12:00pm - global data setup by users
(4) 1:00pm - 5:00pm User integration test of all test scenarios.  The goal is to test 'end to end' to ensure the all issues are resolved, and data removal and resetup is valid.
- Bridgeline open to discuss issues (800-711-8000; code #3454709)
 
 
We appreciate your support as we work towards setting up the NETCO!

Hi, 
Attached is schedule for NETCO testing for Friday afternoon. The objectives for tomorrow will be to: 

1. Test logins for NETCO users and drive mappings 
2. Execute a subset of the Gas and Power scenarios to test that all platform components are setup. 

The complete set of scenarios will be tested next week. We appreciate your support as we work towards setting up the NETCO platform which has a number of moving parts that are coming together.

Thanks 
Aftab
