User Test Schedule
Please review the attached user test schedule; I've updated for the name sw=
aps as needed.
The timeframe for SAP confirmation Tuesday 1pm, and I've moved Gas Settleme=
nts to Tuesday am.  If time permits, we may be able to settle gas on Monday=
 pm.
=20
Test Cases & Global Data
The attached spreadsheet has the current global data and on tab page 2, the=
 test cases.  We will still use the detailed test scenarios for entry.
The global staff is updating the counterparties now/ and contracts to redis=
tribute.
=20
I'm requesting for the deal entry users to please comment/ revise as to wha=
t specific test cases are needed, and can be omitted.
Unlike previous testing, we will be using real (active) counterparties, and=
 need to test intercompany scenarios (UBS London to UBS Canada).
We would like a subset for Power (ie 4), and a subset for Gas (6-8) that we=
 can perform during this time.
=20
Can the respective Deal Entry groups discuss and send me your feedback toda=
y?  I'm hoping to save calling a meeting.

Thanks,

Everyone,=20

The attached document outlines the Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4=
th & Tuesday, Feb 5th.  There have been many decisions/ setup changes from =
the last test, and the majority of global data is now known.  This is the l=
ast week to test and validate before go-live.   =20
=20
The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=
cluding SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading sessi=
on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
3) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
4) pilot the (real) NetCo logins, and no longer the nc_t_xxxx logins.  As y=
ou recall, there can be start up menu issues with porting user ids.
=20
Canada/ Portland/ Toronto
The NetCo terminal server ( <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) will b=
e available during this timeframe for your testing.  =20
We have test scripts for Houston scenarios, but need your participation to =
develop scenarios for your area (ie CAD dollar scenarios).
=20
Your input is needed by Friday noon (ASAP):
1) To confirm/ update the test participants on the attached schedule .  Ple=
ase reply with others that will be testing.=20
        Attachment Doc ' 0204 User_Test_ Schedule Netco.doc' -=20
=20
 2) Assist/ provide feedback with what global data setup is required.  Down=
time from previous testing was largely due global data missing that was nee=
ded for processing. =20
       Attachment Doc ' 0204 Global Data Setup requirements.doc' - developm=
ent in progress, update to be provided later today.
=20
The Bridgeline (800-711-8000 Code 3454709) will be open during the testing =
times. We request that all application owners be dialed into the bridgeline=
 to expedite the resolution of any issues that might come up.=20
=20
Thanks again for all your support.

=20
FYI - The EOL business is planning a mock trading session tentatively sched=
uled for 2/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The=
 traders will be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. T=
he originators will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accoun=
ts. It should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am).
