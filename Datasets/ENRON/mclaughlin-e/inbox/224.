Attached is the October LTD reconciliation for Zipper Power Book.   Please review the variances that are currently outstanding.   Your total variance for 2001 is 423,818 of expense that should be taken to the DPR. We would like to get these variances cleared as soon as possible.  Please let me know when we can expect to see these adjustments in your DPR.
 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please let me know.
 
Thanks
Tracy
