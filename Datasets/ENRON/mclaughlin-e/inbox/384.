Hello,
	Could you please review the attached template and provide us with any input you may have. We are contemplating of splitting the template into 2 section. One for the structuring group and one for the book admin. Many thanks in advance. Please call me at 3-4243 with any additional questions or concerns.

Have a great day,
Marcus
