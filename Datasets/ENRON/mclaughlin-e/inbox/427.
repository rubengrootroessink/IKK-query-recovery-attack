Kori, Errol --

After speaking with Enpower IT, I was informed there were 2 calcs performed for Lavo's power books yesterday.

14370 - 4:11 PM (officialized)
14378 - 4:17 PM (not officialized)

14370 didn't have the positions, therefore, nothing is being picked up in RiskTrac. 14378 had the positions, but it was not saved as officialized, so RiskTrac is not picking it up as well.

We need to have 14378 saved as official so RiskTrac can pick up the positions.
Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks.

- Tom
