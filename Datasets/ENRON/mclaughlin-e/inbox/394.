Errol,

Apparently CES has stopped paying us for the attached deals.  Michelle Stevens in financial settlements is wondering if all CES trades were sold off  to The New Power Company but I have no idea if that's true.  Do you know anything about this?  The bottom 5 trades are in your books.

Let me know if you know more about CES.

Thanks

Kam

Kam,

Here is a spreadsheet that shows all trades that are being disputed.   

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help!
