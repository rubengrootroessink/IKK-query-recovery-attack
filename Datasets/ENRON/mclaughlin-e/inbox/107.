Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.
