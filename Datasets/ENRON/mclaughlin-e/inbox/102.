If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer. Thanks.
