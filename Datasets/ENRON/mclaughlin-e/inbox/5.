Have you had an opportunity to meet with the UBS people (Kam, Phillip, Daron, etc) to make sure we have someone here to cover all tasks that they may be doing for us now?  If you haven't had the chance to meet with them yet, I believe the sooner we meet with them, the better.  We don't need to drop the ball on anything during the transition and I'm guessing their level of availability to us will seriously diminish over the next few days.  Plus, if there are tasks outstanding, it may take a day or two for training.
 
Just as an example, it appears we have no one trained right now on how to load the price curve.
 
Please let me know if I can do anything to help you get this accomplished quickly or if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,
Greg
