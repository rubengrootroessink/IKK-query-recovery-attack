Sir,

We need the softcopy of the spreadsheet of counterparties which are to be moved to the Bankruptcy Book. We would forward this to Kim so that she could fill-up the list with the corresponding Duns_Link_IDs.

Thank you,
Dan

I really need the spreadsheet that Errol provided to Francis before I can get started.  Francis that Errol provided him one spreadsheet and I would like to see that.

Hi Kim,

I'm Dan Arellano and I'm working with the TAGG/ERMS team under Francis Lim. I am tasked by Francis to take care of the books to be moved to "Bankruptcy". Please forward to me the list of counterparties with their corresponding Duns_Link_IDs and/or Counterparty codes as soon as it is ready.

Thanks a lot,
Dan
