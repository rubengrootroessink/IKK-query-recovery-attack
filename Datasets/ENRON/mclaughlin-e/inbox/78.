Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).
