Hey.  Can you forward this on to the correct book admin?  We moved a bunch of Merrill/Allegheny trades a few months ago, and some stragglers remain.  Thanks.

Hey Lady!! 

Needing your help once again.  I have a trade NM9419.1 that is currently booked to Merrill Lynch Capital Services that belong to Allegheny Energy Services.  When Allegheny acquired all financial trades from Merrill Lynch, this trade was not updated with the new information.  Can you please help me wih this.

Much appreciated, 
Mechelle
