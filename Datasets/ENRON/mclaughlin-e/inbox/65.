Legal has informed us that we will need to collect all of the confirmations for all of the terminated transactions.  If you and Brian can give me all of the deal numbers associated with the commodity trades, I'll take care of pulling the documentation.  

Thanks again for your help.

Errol,

I need the RBC valuations as of 12/4/01 which is the date they terminated their contracts with us.  Thanks for your help!
