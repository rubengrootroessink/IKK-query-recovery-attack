Errol, thanks for writing.  I discussed this matter with George Huan this morning, in person, and he tells me that he rebooked the deals originally booked to El Paso Merchant Energy Gas - L.P. to El Paso Merchant Energy L.P. correctly in his spreadsheet pretty late last night after you spoke with him and so it did not get into our system last night.  He has assured me, however, that everything is in order for tonight's run and that the problem should be fixed Monday.  I will advise you if the situation is unresolved Monday.  Thanks for your follow up.  Sue.

Sue,

I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing up on your report.

Thank you,

Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274
