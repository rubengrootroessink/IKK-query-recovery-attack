Guys:  I changed the counterparty name on deal # Q04117 

This deal was in the NG-Price book.  All I did was change the counterparty name. It was part of a list I received from Dianne Anderson.

If you have any issues with the change, let me know.  


Thanks

Anne

Anne, could you please swing one last deal from Merrill to Allegheny?  Q04117.1.  Thanks.

PS - We heard down here that you're getting a promotion. Congrats.  You deserve it.

Thank you so much for all your help.  I spoke with Joe (Hunter), and he said
that it's OK for the names to be different between EOL and TAGG - I guess your
could put a "assignment/novation" type comment on those 2 deals.  I will
also tell Tana Jones (who probably already knows, since she did the assignment) - 
she handles our EOL documentation issues. 

Thanks again,
Diane

Dianne:  I changed all of the deals you listed that were not already done.  My only question relates the last 2 EOL deals,  Deal #'s QP5025.1 and  QS8044.1.  I just want you to verify that it is OK to assign an EOL deal.  I will need to send EOL some type of decimation for their audit trails.

Here is the list of deal that I changed:

NB7639.1
NI5963.1
QP6244.1
NE1435.1
NN5441.1
QE5010.1
QE5020.1
QE5030.1

and the 2 EOL deals 

QP5025.1
and  QS8044.1

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks Anne

Anne, 

I'm not sure who can help me with this since Michelle no longer handles that book.  Would
you be able to either take care of this rebook, or direct me to the correct person?

Thanks,
Diane

Diane-

Sorry but I'm not in Risk Management in Houston anymore. I'm not sure who is handling this book now.  

Michelle
