We have communicated practically weekly on the above deals since December 13, 
and, if possible could we resolve this issue this week?  This item is 
appearing only aging report and  Management is looking at it daily.  Please 
let me hear from you.  Thanks.  

To refresh your memory, these two deals were done on Dynegy Direct, but only 
one was on the report  I pulled up.  I also called Dynegy and they only know 
of one deal.    You have my spreadsheet from this period and I would like to 
have it back,  pleaseeeee.

Jean
