GOOD NEWS:

It is a go!!!

-  Per Susan Bailey, we have received executed docs from Aquila and plan to 
have the assignment effective tomorrow.  In addition, EOL is all set up so 
all financial trading should occur out of Aquila Risk Management beginning 
tomorrow.

Thanks for everyone's help !!

Good News/Bad News


Good News (First):
Aquila, with much help from our EOL group, has set up all of their users to 
begin trading tomorrow.

Bad News:
At this time, we have not received the executed assignment from Aquila.  I 
just spoke to Angela (their contracts person) who told me their VP has yet to 
sign the assignment.  Until we get the docs in, Utilicorp will continue to be 
the counterparty.

I will keep you all updated.

To All:

As most of you all know by now, Utilicorp is assigning their ISDA to Aquila 
Risk with a proposed effective date of tomorrow Friday, Feb 9.  My concern 
with this is if the ISDA is executed with an effective date of Feb 9, then we 
are not going to be able to trade financially out of Utilicorp including 
EOL.  They are having trouble setting up/transferring their EOL users, 
although I have been assured by my Credit contact and the Contract Person at 
Aquila that the assignment is still going to be executed with this effective 
date.  If this is the case, then tomorrow Utilicorp will be shut down on EOL 
and if they have not set Aquila Risk up correctly, they will not be able to 
trade on EOL at all financially. I have notified my contacts of this scenario 
and they are comfortable with this.

I will keep you all updated as I hear more throughout the day.

Russell
