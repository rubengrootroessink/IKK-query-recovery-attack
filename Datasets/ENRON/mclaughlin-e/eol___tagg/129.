Erol/Joey,

Here is the counterparty for Barclay Bank PLC, just in case there was any confusion.  The finance group (Chris Herron) is confirming that the wiring instructions that are currently in the system are appropriate for this new deal.

Will let you know.

Eric

Per your request, this is the bank info we have in GCP for Barclays Bank, plc out of New York.  I hope I understand you correctly.   If you need to submit a request to include wiring instructions, we normally get them from the CP.  If the CP in this case is an internal entity, the same would apply.  We ask for request for wire set up with written instructions to include the bank info, benf. acct. name and acct. number attached (sent via fax).  What is below will help because in addition to location, it includes the swift address and domestic key.  I hope we're on the same page, if not please let me know.
