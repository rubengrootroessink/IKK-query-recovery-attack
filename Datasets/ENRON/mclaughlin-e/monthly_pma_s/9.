Attached you will find the outstanding PMA's, as of March 2001 accounting. You will see adjustments requested by financial settlements. They have finally provided us with reconciliation's for the contract periods of Dec00 through Feb01. Financial settlements thought that reconciling current months and working backwards would be best. So, you should continue to see PMA's, from financial settlements, for previous months as they become available to us. Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks!
