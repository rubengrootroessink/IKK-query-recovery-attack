Hi, Errol!


Your prize has been processed and sent out to you on the 26th of January.
Can I check with you again if your have received it this time? Please let
me know as soon as possible so that if you didn't receive it again this time,
I really need to work something out for you. :)

Thank you and have a great day!


Best regards,
