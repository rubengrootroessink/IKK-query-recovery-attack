Hey,
I have been sooooo swamped with school and work this week!  Hope your
week has been lots better than mine.  It looks like you have a great job
doing exactly what you've always wanted to do.
Well, Jana is 11 yrs old now so you should feel pretty old 'cause you
are. :)  And she acts like a little lady too.  I know your cousin Lauren
must been close to college by now.  I don't even want to know how old
her brother is.  Wow, how time passes...
Jina is at UH about to graduate this May.  Don't ask me what she is
going to do with a sociology degree but she likes helping people and
working with them.  My parents are doing fine.  My dad is living in
Baton Rouge now.  How are your parents?  Has your father retired yet?
I also wanted to ask you about your boy, Maurice.  I heard he got
married to Demetris and I was kinda hurt he didn't invite me to the
wedding, but C'est la vie.  Tell him I said hello and give me his e-mail
address if you have it.
Well, I just wanted to see how you were doing.  You know, make sure you
were still alive and well. :)

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I
manage
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great
job
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How
are
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna
now?  When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I
said, 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking
advantage.  Call me when you get a minute!!

Hey Errol,
Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought
I'd
say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
Well, holler back when you get a moment.
