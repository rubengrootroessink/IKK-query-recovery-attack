Hello alphaman_2001,

Welcome to Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Golf.

You have created a team called E Force, and are now ready to
participate in Fantasy Golf, a weekly game that let's you
compete against other fans from around the world.

Your goal is to earn more points than other managers by
selecting the players who perform the best in actual
professional golf tournaments. Each week you'll pick a team
consisting of two A players, four B players and two C players.
Of these players you'll select a foursome (one A, two B, and
one C) to activate for each round.

The deadline for picking new players for the week's tournament
is Wednesday at 11:59pm PT. The deadline to set your foursome
for each round is 11:59pm PT the night before that round.

Thanks for joining. See you on the green.

--Fantasy Golf Commissioner
