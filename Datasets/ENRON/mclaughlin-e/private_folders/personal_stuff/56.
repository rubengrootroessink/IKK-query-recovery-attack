Job Seekers
Are you an energy industry job seeker who wants to find a better career
position?

Hello! I am Matt Richards, President of Powerhighway.com. Powerhighway.com
is an Internet job board that brings you energy industry jobs. We have
recently joined the Energy Jobs Network (EJN) allowing us to offer you
job opportunities from different industry sectors. We decided to partner
with EJN because it gives our members direct access to the entire EJN
jobs database and gives us a steady stream of new job postings every day.
Therefore, if you are an applicant looking for a new career position in
the energy industry, Powerhighway.com will help you quickly find what
you need.

Registration on Powerhighway.com is an easy three-step process that should
take less than five minutes. Once your registration is completed you will
be taken to your personal home page (my desk) where you will be able to
access all of your information and manage your search process. This simple
registration process will allow you to find your ideal job without having
to wade through a list of non-energy related positions. Privacy is a very
important issue when you are job-hunting because you don't want your resume
to show up on your bosses' desk. With our new job board your level of
privacy is your choice with an option to control all of your personal
information.

Our services are free to job seekers with no hidden costs or obligations.
Why not visit us today and let us help you find your dream job. http://www.powe
