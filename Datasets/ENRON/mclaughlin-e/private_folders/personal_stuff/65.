PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW TO THE LETTER, yes the bolded and unbolded letters.
I was in the room when Lavorato said that if something was "top levelled" it 
was fraud, so lets not
be the ones defrauding the company and having to explain that in Lavorato's 
office.

Thanks
Dutch

If you are asked to top level any dollar amount for any reason by anyone,  
John Lavorato needs to approve that top level before it can go into the 
books.  Absolutely no exceptions.  Please forward this to all people in your 
groups.
