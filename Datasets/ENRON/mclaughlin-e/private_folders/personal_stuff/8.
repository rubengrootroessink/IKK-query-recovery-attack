Dear Errol,

Hello from Amazon.com.

I've requested a refund of $3.50 to your credit card.  This reflects the
difference between second day air and standard domestic. This refund
should go through within the next few days and will appear as a credit
on your next credit card billing statement.

Thank you for writing us at Amazon.com and please feel free to contact us
if you have any further questions or concerns.


Best regards,

Anderson C.
