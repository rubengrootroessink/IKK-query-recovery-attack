Dear Errol,

I'm sorry for the delay. As mentioned in my previous email, your prize was 
requested to be
delivered out late December. However, it seems that there was a confusion on 
our vendor's side
regarding the shipment. I'm checking on it at the moment and will work my 
best to resolve the
problem asap. We seek you kind understanding and patience on this matter and 
will let you know
once the problem has been resolved.
Thanks and though it's already 10days past.. Happy New Year!



Regards,
