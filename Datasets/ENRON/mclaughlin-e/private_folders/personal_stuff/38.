Dear September Vincent,

Just a reminder that your current Reliant Energy HL&P statement is ready
for you to review at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/  If you
participate in the Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account will be
automatically drafted for the amount due.  Remember, with Auto Pay no
action is required to ensure your bill gets paid.
If you do not participate in Automatic Payment Plan (APP), you can pay
your bill immediately or schedule payment for a later date.  As with paper
bills your payment is due about 2 weeks from the statement date. The
online bill replaces your paper bill, a paper copy of your bill will not
be sent.

Should you need to modify your account information, go to
https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/  log into eBill and select User
Information. There you can update your information such as your email
address, change your password and add accounts.

As you use our eBill service, please do not hesitate to provide comments
through the Contact Us section of the site. Check out the Frequently Asked
Questions section for a quick reference.

Again, thank you for choosing Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.
