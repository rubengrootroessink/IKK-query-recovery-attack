Dear September Vincent,

Thank you for enrolling in Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.  We are pleas=
ed
to offer this new service to you.  eBill allows you to view and pay your
Reliant Energy HL&P bills through a secure site on the Internet. There are
no checks to write and no postage is required.

Each month, you will receive an email notifying you that your Reliant
Energy HL&P bill is available at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/
for viewing and payment. You may choose to pay your bill immediately or
schedule payment for a later date. This will be the only monthly bill you
will receive. Paper billing will discontinue with enrollment to online
billing.

Your bank account will be debited only after you have autorized each
payment. You can confirm payment by checking the status of your bills
through eBill. Your bank statement will also verify payment. All
transactions are secure and convenient. If you participate in the
Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account will be automatically
drafted for the amount due.  Remember, with Auto Pay no action is required
to ensure your bill gets paid.


As you use our eBill service, please do not hesitate to provide comments
through the Contact Us section of the site. Note too, our Frequently Asked
Questions section.

Again, thank you for choosing Reliant Energy=01,s eBill service.
