Errol,

Below is the PVR schedule that is passed on to me by gas accounting. The 
dollar amount of $79,646.37 needs to be passed through the NG Price book as a 
liquidation and an offsetting origination for Charlie Otto. In the past, 
Dutch used to handle this process, so I am sure that he could answer any 
questions that you may have. The line items that are highlighted in blue 
total the $79,646.37 that needs to be passed through the DPR. The other line 
items in the schedule have already been taken.

Thanks!!
