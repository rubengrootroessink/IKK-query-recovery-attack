Investing Resource Center: A must-read for today's investment climate
Investing today is more challenging - and potentially more 
rewarding - than ever before. Got questions? Our Investing Resource 
Center is the place to go for answers, whether you're new to 
investing, experienced at managing your own investments, or prefer 
working with an advisor. And when you're ready to act, discover Wells 
Fargo Online Brokerage, ranked in the top 10 by Gomez.com for the 
One-Stop Shopper segment. Or look into Wells ShareBuilder(TM), a 
simple, flexible and affordable way to invest over time by making 
weekly or monthly investments, using the strategy of dollar-cost 
averaging to help smooth out the peaks and valleys of the market. 


Home Resource Center: Homeownership made simpler
The welcome mat is out. Our Home Resource Center is your one-stop 
solution for all your home-related needs, whether you're buying a 
home, selling, refinancing, or renovating. Here you'll find truly 
useful interactive tools to help you choose your options wisely. 
Afterwards, take a look at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, with home buying 
and home refinancing options to meet your specific needs. And with the 
recent drop in interest rates, now's a great time to refinance.

Tax Resource Center: Planning now can help reduce taxes for 2001
Now that you've finished last year's taxes, it's a good time to start 
thinking about next year. How would you like to ease your tax burden 
for 2001? Our Tax Resource Center can help. We have tips on 
investments that can actually minimize your taxes. And we can show you 
how a home equity loan might lower your tax bill. There are lots of 
tax benefits in the areas of income, investments, homeownership and 
income in retirement that you may not be aware of. One place to start 
is with your IRA. For many, it can be a significant tax-reduction and 
retirement planning tool. See for yourself. 
??Which IRA is best?
??Home equity tips: Did you know the interest on a home equity loan is 
??tax-deductible? 

Tip: Investing in your 2001 IRA right now instead of waiting until 
April 2002 means you'll potentially have a whole year's worth of extra 
earnings. It just makes good investing and tax sense. Especially while 
the market is low.
