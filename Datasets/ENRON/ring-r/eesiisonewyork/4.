Thank you for your call and I look forward to getting the list of account transfer dates you promised to send me.  Please remember that while we need to have meter-read dates for all customers, we must have information on the three hourly metered accounts by early tomorrow morning (Friday) in order to send an appropriate schedule to Connie.  I will investigate your question about the remaining four accounts and advise you of any appropriate actions.  Thanks again.
Michael
