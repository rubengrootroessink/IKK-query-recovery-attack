Nichole,

The payment information for the Performance Bonds is as follows:

Gas:  	EID# 10028620, Company# 1596, Cost Center# 150255
Power:	EID# 10002583, Company# 1596, Cost Center# 150256

I will also need to know the specifics for Bond 81538327, PG&E $30,000,000 (Premium $60,000).

Thanks,

Richard
