My name is Richard Ring and I work with Narsimha Misra at Enron Energy Services, Inc.  Narshiha indicates that he was speaking with you, about one month ago, regarding ICAP within the PJM Control Area.  If you still have the ICAP available please conatact  me via e-mail or by telephone 713.853.3561.

Look forward to speaking with you at your convenience.

Regards,

Richard Ring
