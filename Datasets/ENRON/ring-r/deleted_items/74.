All,

It looks like NYISO has completed its implementation of virtual bidding for
11/1/01.  Note that activation of the capability is still pending FERC
approval.

Dear Market Participants,

The following software update will become active on November 1, 2001

Customers who have completed the Virtual Bidding registration process
and have met all requirements will be able to begin submitting virtual
Transactions in the NYISO Day Ahead Market (DAM).  A Virtual Transaction
bid, if accepted, is the financial committment to buy(sell) energy
at the DAM zonal LBMP price and sell(buy) it at the Real-Time Zonal LBMP
price. No phyiscal delivery or consuming of energy will occur.

This program has been developed at the request of Market Participants.  It
will provide an additional hedging mechanism for customers with physical
loads and generation.  It will also open the NY wholesale electric market
to more participants.

For additional information, please see Technical Bulletin #74 at:
