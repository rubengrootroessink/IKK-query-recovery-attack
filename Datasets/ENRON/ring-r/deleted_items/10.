Intertie De-rated

Amid a backdrop of mild weather and steady to falling loads across the
region, Western peak power prices held steady in Friday trade.  The volume
of trading was exceptionally low and price ranges tightened across every
trading hub, usually with the low end coming up to meet the high.  "Heavy
load volume went way down, but I'm at a loss as to why off-peak demand
continued to trade," mumbled one bewildered player.  One analyst speculated
that with daytime highs near comfortable levels, "heating demand should only
be kicking in at night."  The market did indeed appear unusual throughout
the West on Friday.  Contrary to norms, power at Palo Verde and South Path
sold at a premium to Mid-Columbia pieces.  One possible factor for this
anomaly could be the de-rating of the California-Oregon Intertie from
between three- and four-thousand megawatts to 600 MW for scheduled
maintenance, which will last through October 28.  "This could have
effectively isolated the Pacific Northwest with lower load demands and
near-normal generating capacity, only with nobody to whom to export," one
analyst postulated.  While NYMEX made up for Thursday's losses, spot gas
prices at the Southern California border fell by almost 25 cents on Friday.
The Henry Hub natural gas contract for November climbed 10.3 cents to close
at 3.041$/mmBtu, while December gas trailed along, gaining 8 cents on Friday
's trades to close at 3.183$/mmBtu.

On Friday, Mid-Columbia peak power traded at a discount to power in the
Southwest.  Heavy load pieces traded in a tight range, between 31.5 to
33.4$/MWh on Friday, and this included the usual premium that comes with
trading three days out. One player speculated that the lack of volatility at
Mid-Columbia was due to the "loss of transmission capacity at the
California-Oregon Intertie."  Temperatures were forecast to hover near
normal in the Northwest through the weekend, with reservoir-building
precipitation called for on Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  The latest
six-to-ten predicted near-to-above normal temperatures would prevail from
November 1 to 5, which suggested that daytime heating demand would not be
likely in the week-and-a-half to come.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph held
steady at 45 kcfs for Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 65 kcfs from Monday through
Thursday, and 60 kcfs on Friday.  No specific unit news was forthcoming,
although aggregate output of northwest hydro units was reportedly down by
over 1400 MW due to curtailed flows.

Golden State electricity prices were mostly flat for the Sunday/Monday
package to Thursday, with off-peak prices edging up on the usual all-day
Sunday premium.  Light load energy costs at SP15 and NP15 climbed 2.1 and
3$/MWh, respectively.  SP15 prices were seen at a slight premium to NP15 in
a light trading session, as many players sat on the sidelines, covering
their loads, but otherwise out of the spot market.  In political news,
California's State Board of Equalization voted to switch tax jurisdiction of
power plants from the local to the state level in 2003.  The state reported
it will tax the plants based on "fair market share", and predicted that more
revenues will be raised under the new system.   Also in the news, California
will not build new transmission lines, used to import power from neighboring
states Nevada and Arizona, until at least 2008.  The generation landscape
was little changed on Friday.  The Shasta hydro units (526 MW) were
completely off-line.  "The reservoirs are probably too low to support any
generation right now," speculated one analyst.  Temperatures in California
were expected to range from the low-70s to low-50s through Tuesday,
producing little weather-related electricity demand in the state.  Keeping
hope for more demand in the near future down, the latest six-to-ten from the
NWS called for normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.

Southwest peak power was a hot commodity in the WSCC on Friday.  Peak goods
for Monday delivery fluctuated between 33 and 36.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, which
boasted a higher volume of trade than its neighboring hubs.  Some players
speculated that the "Palo premium" was based on high natural gas prices that
caused many California gas-fired plants to remain dormant and buy power from
outside the state.  "Without the California-Oregon Intertie, nobody could
access Northwest hydropower, so everybody lined up at Palo Verde and SP-15,"
commented one seasoned marketer.  Temperatures ranged from the high 80s in
Phoenix to the mid-60s in Salt Lake City, with forecasts calling for
temperatures to continue to hover just above normal through Tuesday.  The
latest six-to-ten extended the above-normal forecast through November 5.  On
the generation front, Navajo #1 (750 MW) returned to the grid on Thursday
night as expected after completing water pump repairs.

___________________________________________________________
In an active Friday trading session, peak power prices for Monday delivery
strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on cooler weather and
increasing natural gas prices.  "This week the power markets are following
gas up.  Some Hubs, like Entergy, were simply too cheap before, and those
have made particularly strong gains," opined one market analyst.  The
mercury dropped all across the East Friday, and was expected to remain in
the nippy range through Tuesday.  Forecasts were calling for daytime highs
only in the 40s and 50s, and overnight lows in the downright chilly 20s and
30s were expected.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas contracts traded actively on Friday,
a day ahead of expiring November contracts on Monday.   November climbed
10.3 cents to close at 3.041$/mmBtu, and December also edged up 8 cents to
end at 3.183$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy costs in the Mid-Atlantic rose in Friday trade, amid
higher predicted loads for Monday and strong natural gas markets.
Generation was healthier on Friday, with off-line Megawatts dropping.  Nuke
Indian Point #2 (965 MW) was off-line, entering a 20 day maintenance outage,
and rumors indicated that Peach Bottom #2 (1,152 MW) might have returned to
the grid a day ahead of schedule on Friday.  Western PJM goods were trading
from 31.4 to 32.9$/MWh. With a mean of 22.5$/MWh through 15:00 EDT, LMPs
were very stable on Friday, fluctuating within 4$/MWh of the average all day
after the usual early-morning spike.  Overnight lows in the 30s were
expected through Tuesday of the new week, kicking up heating demand.
Nonetheless, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal
temperatures from November 1 to 5.

Like the rest of the Eastern spot market, peak power prices in the Midwest
were natural gas dependent on Friday. No new outages were reported and gas
costs were expected to outweigh weather-related demand for the new week.
Electricity prices edged down slightly, with Into Cinergy goods changing
hands between 31 and 32.5$/MWh, losing 1.45$/MWh on the high end, but
tightening the range on the low.  The Midwest was expected to be the coldest
region over the weekend and into the new week, with temperatures not
expected to reach any higher than 59 degrees through Tuesday, with overnight
lows in the 20s and 30s.  However, the latest six-to-ten predicted
above-normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.

In the Southeast on Friday trading was particularly active, with heavy load
electricity prices gaining ground yet again, as a brief bout of winter
weather was expected for the new week and strong natural gas costs pushed
prices higher.  Into Entergy pieces traded between 25.55 and 29$/MWh, with
the day's low seen right out of the gate and the high reached late in the
session.  Some market players mentioned that cash gas (inside the month
trades) were really moving the Entergy market on Friday.  Into TVA was a
less liquid market, with deals done between 30 and 34.5$/MWh.  Temperatures
were expected well below normal through Tuesday, with overnight lows solidly
in the 30s.  The weather trend was expected to reverse though, with
above-normal temperatures predicted from November 1 to 5.
