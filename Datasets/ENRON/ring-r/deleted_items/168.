Our company number is 1596,cost center is 150256. Your EID# is in your eHRonline website. Each employee has their own EID# its used for ordering equipment, supplies, pagers, etc. If you have an invoice you need to give them your EID# for (POC) Point of Contact when sending to accounts payable for payment. On the eHRonline website under profile click on other on the right side should state External ID thats your EID#.

Thanks,
Kathy
