JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

There is an ICWG Meeting scheduled for November 1 from 9AM-3PM.  There is
also a Demand Response WG Meeting planned for November 2.  I would like to
meet with any, or all, SCR RIPs to discuss the form and substance of SCR
Certifications, Event Reporting, Metering requirements and expectations,
Deficiencies and charges, derating methodology, UCAP, etc....ALL RIPs
should participate, if possible.

It seems possible to meet on the afternoon of October 31, before or after
the ICWG meeting on November 1, or prior to the Demand Response WG meeting
on November 2.  Please advise of your availability.
