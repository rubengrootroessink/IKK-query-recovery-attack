Alan,

I have several ways to structure a potential deal for the purchase of ICAP(UCAP), but I will need to know some more specific information regarding the location of your generating unit (i.e. interconnection with which utility and PJM LMP Point).

Thanks,

Richard Ring

Richard,

We are still selling our ICAP into the short-term market.  Narsimha was
going to send me a description of how the sale to you would work so we could
get comfortable with the details of a longer term sale.  That would be the
first step in any discussion we might have.
