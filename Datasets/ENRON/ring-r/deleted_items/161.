Michelle and I need to discuss the BGE product with you at your convenience.

Bob,

I think that for the moment the $0.25/MWh for the scheduling fee component is fine to utilize.  Michelle is in the process of reviewing all BGE scheduling requirements and within the next few days should have be able to determine the accuracy of the $0.25/MWh scheduling fee component.

Good Morning....

As a placeholder, Narsimha previously suggested $0.25/MWH for the scheduling fee component of the fixed "Management Fee".  Do you think this is still a reasonable number to use?  If so, we would use it in our notional estimates, and Deal Management would use the same value for executable pricing.   

Thanks!
Bob
