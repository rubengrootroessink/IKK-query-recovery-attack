Dear Microsoft .NET Passport Member:

Thank you for using Microsoft
 .NET Passport. Because Microsoft recognizes the importance of security and reliability when using Internet software, we have now made available free browser security upgrades to better protect your online information. We strongly recommend that you check now to see whether your browser needs one of these security upgrades by going to: http://securitycheck.passport.com/default.asp .
 
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 
You can read more about these browser security issues at: 
 http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-055.asp .

IF CLICKING A LINK DOESN'T WORK...
 
Copy it, and then paste it into your browser's address bar. 
Select the entire link (which starts with http:// and may include more than one line) and then copy it, usually by clicking the "Edit" menu item and then clicking "Copy". Next, open your browser and click in the box where you usually see the Web page address. Paste the link into this box (usually by clicking "Paste" in the "Edit" menu) and click "Go" or "Enter". 
 
.NET Passport is committed to protecting your privacy. We encourage you to review our privacy statement at: http://www.passport.com/privacypolicy.asp .
 
 
As with all security issues, Microsoft is committed to keeping its customers informed. Again, thank you for using your .NET Passport.
