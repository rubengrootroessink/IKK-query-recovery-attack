The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 16:00, 17:00 and 23:00 in the
January 4, 2002 Real-Time Market.

The NYISO is reserving all locational reserve prices for hours beginning
7:00 and 23:00 in the January 4, 2002 Hour-Ahead Market.

Prices in the January 5, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.
