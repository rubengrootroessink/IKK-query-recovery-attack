Alex,

If there is some password assigned to me I am not aware of it.  Let me know what we need to do to receive additional password information.

Richard

I called MECO to get the password to the list of customers that is available on the web and they told me that the only person listed to get the list is Richard.  

Richard,
Do you have a password?
