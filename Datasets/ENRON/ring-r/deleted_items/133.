Michelle,

PECO Energy Company has advised us that due to an error in calculation there will be an additional charge made to EESI's PJM bill, if we agree and sign the attached letter.  Can you take a look at and see if you agree or even if there is a way that you can ascertain if the correction made by PECO Energy Company is valid?

Thanks,

Richard
