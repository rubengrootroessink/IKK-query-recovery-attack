Richard:

We need to start sending our Ohio label with the contract to new Ohio customers (CG&E starting in Dec according to Nicole Schwartz).  I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does.  Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me?

Thanks.

Heather
