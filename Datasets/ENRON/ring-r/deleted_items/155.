Stephanie,

Sorry I missed you again. I was hoping to obtain some business requirements in order to facilitate implementation behind the following utilities. JCP&L, PSEG and Connectiv.

To that end, please expect over the next few days - questions from me.

Round One - 

1) Please advise customer types we are pursuing in these markets - 

Industrial

Commercial

Un-metered

Government

Other

2) Please advise the specific UDC rate classes these customers represent.

IE -  LPL, RS, etc. etc.


3) What is the sales method?

Direct? Aggregator? Telesales? etc. 

4) Will you be launching Mass Market (small commercial) agent sales behind these utilities if so, when?

5)Will you want the ability to provide for an off-cycle switch?


PLEASE ADVISE AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

Thanks, call w/ questions.

Rebecca
