Denise:

Richard Ring suggested that you were the appropriate person to contact regarding filling in some blanks on the Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement between EES and A'lones.  I have attached hereto a copy of the Agreement.  The Cover Sheet (see p. 2-3 of the attachment) has a series of elections and blanks for amounts, guarantor credit ratings, etc.  I would appreciate your assistance in getting these items completed.  If you have questions regarding A'lones, background of the transaction, and party expectations, please give Richard Ring a call.  Thanks for your help.

Scott L. Franck
