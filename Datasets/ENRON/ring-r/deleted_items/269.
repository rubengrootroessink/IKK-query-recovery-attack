EARTH DIALOGUES - LYON, FRANCE - Feb 21 to 23

The Earth Dialogues were launched by Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong to
provide a forum for constructive debate on the most pressing issues related
to global sustainability. Representatives of civil society, government,
international organizations, finance, business, religion, media and
academia, along with members of the public, will convene to exchange their
views on how to reinvigorate the ethics debate within the sustainable
development and globalization agendas and propose concrete actions to
address environmental degradation and poverty.

The 2002 Earth Dialogues will examine key issues related to the ethical
challenges of global responsibility, rights and social justice as related to
sustainable development, and propose concrete measures to ensure that the
benefits of globalization are more equitably shared throughout the world.
The conference will address the following questions:

1.    What are the factors that have impeded the implementation of existing
codes of environmental conduct and practice?


2.    Why are the tools already available to overcome these barriers to
sustainability not fully used or implemented?


3.    What role could universally agreed ethical standards for sustainable
development serve in eradicating poverty and spreading the benefits of
globalization
more equitably?


4.    What should be done to encourage the value and behavioral changes
needed for the implementation of environmental, economic and social best
practices?


5.    How can the Earth Charter contribute to framing a new ethic of global
responsibility?

Up to 1000 people are expected to attend the meetings, which will also be
widely broadcast and available on the Internet. In addition to the panel and
plenary debates, The Earth Dialogues program includes: An Earth Fair with
eco-efficiency displays from industry; Earth Art Exhibition, including the
work of children from around the world; Press Conferences; and an Earth
Music Concert, with top artists playing to tens of thousands of people.
