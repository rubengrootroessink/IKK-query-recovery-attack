WIN a PRO-AM SPOT at PGA SHELL HOUSTON OPEN

GolfQ.Com has purchased 4 PGA Shell Houston Open Pro-Am Spots (valued at $10,000), which will be held on Wednesday March 27th... Here is your chance to play with PGA Touring Pros:

Whether you can shoot in 70's or 100's, you'll have an equal chance to win 1 of these 4 spots, which will be given away in a tournament held at River Ridge Golf Club on Saturday March 23rd... One Spot will be given away as a Door Prize, one spot to the lowest gross score and the remaining two spots will be given to the top 2 net scores... Established Handicap IS NOT REQUIRED.

*** Place: River Ridge Golf Club 
*** Date: Saturday March 23, 2002
*** Registration: Register at the Pro Shop or by phone (800-553-7517) between Feb. 11th and March 18th.

*** Entry Fee: $125 per Person, payable in advance during the registration since the prizes are guaranteed and not based on number of entries... $5 per entry fee will be donated to STPGA and NTPGA Junior Golf Programs... This will be a non-refundable entry, but transferable to other players... If for some reason the set date is not playable due to lightening only, we'll be giving away all 4 PGA Pro-Am spots and all of the door prizes in a drawing and every one will get a pre-paid round of golf at River Ridge good any time... 

*** Practice Round: River Ridge will also be offering a practice round during the week of March 18th at a reduced rate. 

*** Format: Individual, shotgun starts at 7:30 AM and 1:30 PM, Pairing/tee times will be posted on March 20th at GolfQ.Com Web site. 

*** Handicap System: Modified Peoria System - You don't know your day's handicap until you've finished the round. The tournament committee secretly selects 6 holes, a 3-par, a 5-par and four 4-par holes. Your 18-hole handicap will be calculated based on your scores on the selected holes.

*** Tee Box Assignment: Ladies (Green) - Seniors 55 and above (White)- Men 49 and below (Blue) 
*** Buffet Lunch
*** Hotels: Info will be posted at a later date.

As always, please help build the Qcommunity by forwarding this email to your golfing friends so that we can bring more preferred golf courses on-line for your playing pleasure.
