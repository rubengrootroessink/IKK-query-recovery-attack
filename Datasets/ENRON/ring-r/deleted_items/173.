Elliott,

Based on your request I have taken the opportunity to modify your Renewable Product Description, see attached.  I hope that your are not offended by the quantity of modifications.  Actually, the PJM region is located within the "MAAC" region and not "MAAP".  I would also like to see a product for each region that represents (i) 50% wind (ii) 50% wind 50% biomass.  In addition, we could have two sets of prices (i) utilizing new renewables and (ii) utilizing existing renewables.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Richard
