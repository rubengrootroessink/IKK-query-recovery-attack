Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.
