Growing Green Power Demand:
Tools, Tactics and Metrics for Accelerating Sales

In cooperation with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
and the Center for Resource Solutions, XENERGY presents the
first green power conference devoted to the tools, tactics
and metrics of selling green power.  This is a how-to
conference designed for green power program managers to
answer questions like:

- What's our score on the Green Power Index?
- How do I maximize the value of the market research I can
afford?
- Fuzzy critters, kids, windmills - what sells green power?
- Direct mail, PR, how do I reach the customers who want
green power?

Register today and join your colleagues from around the
globe to learn the specifics of benchmarking green power
programs, buying and using market research, selecting sales
channels and developing message strategies and critiquing
creative.  You'll leave with a framework for marketing green
power as well as tools and tactics for selling and measuring
your success.

Please plan to stay Thursday afternoon for a Renewable
Technology Update hosted by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory.

Your conference leader will be XENERGY Vice President, Julie
Blunden, a founder and former Western Regional President of
Green Mountain Energy Company.  Please click on the linked
