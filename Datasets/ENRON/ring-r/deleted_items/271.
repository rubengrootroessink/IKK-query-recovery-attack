Hi Richard  Ring,

My name is Chris Kulseth. I am the president of C3IPros.  We are a
company that specializes in Energy Management software. We have
been in this business for six years and know what electric utilities
need and want.

I am contacting you to let you know about our ETag 1.7 products and
about our transaction scheduling product. The Etag 1.7 deadline of
March 6 is looming fast.

Both products are based on Java technology. This allows us to run these
packages on almost any platform. The great benefit of this is that
these products can run on existing platforms thus freeing up machines
and user's desk space. No more multiple keyboards! Cut and paste
between applications becomes available.

Both products offer many features such as logging, user security and
email alerts.
