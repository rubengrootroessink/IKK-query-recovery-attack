Food for Thought.... 








 After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which 
killed six and injured 1,000, President Clinton 
promised that those responsible would be hunted 
down and punished.    
 After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which 
killed five US military personnel, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished.    
 After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi 
Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 US military 
personnel, Clinton promised that those responsible 
would be hunted down and punished. 
 After the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Africa, 
which killed 224 and injured 5,000, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished.    
 After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which 
killed 17 and injured 39 US sailors, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished. 
 Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 
7,000 people would be alive today. 

This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in 
show. Without casting stones, it is a legitimate 
question. 
There are two men, both extremely wealthy.  One 
develops relatively cheap software and gives hundreds 
of millions of dollars to charity. The other sponsors 
terrorism. 
That being the case, why is it that the US 
government has spent more money chasing down 
Bill Gates over the past ten years than Osama bin 
Laden?
