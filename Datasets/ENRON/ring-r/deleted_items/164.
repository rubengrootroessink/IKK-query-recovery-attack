Bill,

I looked over the attached spreadsheet and have a couple of observations for you.

First, the analysis representing "Existing Contract:  VAMC Cogen Project" looks sound as far as coming up with rough numbers, however if a slightly different analysis would be need to be performed to arrive at the actual numbers.  I am not sure of the power prices that you used but I will assume that the numbers are accurate.

Second, the analysis representing "New Energy and Water Conservation Project:  To be closed December 2001" I know nothing about, therefore can't comment on such.

Richard,

Here is my first take on the analysis you wanted and acc't numbers.

Please do not show this to anyone before we talk.  I need to get to a meeting in Boston now so I don't have time to write something up which I need to do.  So please keep this just between us.  I'll call you this afternoon.

Thanks, 

Bill
