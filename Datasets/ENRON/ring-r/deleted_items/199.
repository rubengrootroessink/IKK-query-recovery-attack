The daily LMP posting for hour ending 0100, December 30, 2001 contained an
incorrect LMP for the SUNBURY 13 KV UNIT03 Node. The incorrect LMP was $14.07
and should have been $16.98. A corrected file was re-posted at 09:40 on January
4, 2002.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
