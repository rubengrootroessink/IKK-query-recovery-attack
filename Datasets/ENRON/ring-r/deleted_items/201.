On January 23 we'll be conducting a one-day Marketplace Overview seminar in
New York City. This course provides a quick preview of our business and how
you can participate in it. It offers a very understandable explanation of
"LBMP", the two-settlement system, hedging mechanisms and the associated
charges involved. It's very useful for potential customers exploring
options. It's also a great way to get your feet wet, if you're now involved
in our market, but haven't been able to take our three and one-half day
"NYMOC" yet.

The Overview is designed for busy people who need a basic understanding of
our market.
This one will be conducted at 48th & Broadway in New York City.
Details on the program can be found on our website at:
