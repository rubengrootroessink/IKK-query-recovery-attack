Dear MSWG and S&P WG Members,

The NYISO will be introducing a new Web Conferencing service
at the 10/23 Joint MSWG/S&P Meeting for members who will be
participating by conference call. This service will enable the
conference call participants to view meeting presentations
"real time" via the internet.

To participate in this service,an internet connection and standard
web browser is all that is required. No software download will be
necessary.

If you are interested in joining Tuesday's meeting as a
Web Conferencing participant, please RSVP to Monica
Ryan-Taber at mryantaber@nyiso.com. Upon receipt of your
RSVP, log-in instructions will be provided.


Regards,
