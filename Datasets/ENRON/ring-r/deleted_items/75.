Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.
