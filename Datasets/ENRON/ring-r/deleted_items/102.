Here is information taken from the City's website.   From my interpretation, MWBE participate is a consideration and encouraged, but not necessarily required.  

 Request for Proposals (RFPs) - Request for Proposals are used to solicit equipment, goods, and services of a highly technical nature. 
RFPs are taken in accordance with State law provision under Vernon's Annotated Civil Statutes (V.A.C.S. ? 252), which is a unit of the Texas Legislative Council's statutory revision program authorized by the Texas Local Government Code. As an example, the City will solicit requests for proposals for information processing equipment, software and hardware used in conjunction with information processing equipment, telecommunications, radio and microwave systems, electronic distributed control systems and technical services related to this equipment. RFPs are also reviewed for MWBE opportunities.
Formal Bids - Written solicitations exceeding $15,000 for goods and nonprofessional services. 
These bids are taken in accordance with State law. Bids are advertised for two consecutive weeks in the Houston Business Journal and minority papers, then received by the City Secretary's Office on the advertised bid due date, opened and publicly read in the City Council Chambers (unless place of opening has been transferred in accordance with Section 15-3 B(5) of the City of Houston Code of Ordinances.) The City Purchasing Agent recommends awards for formal bids to City Council. Prior to issuing a bid invitation estimated to be in excess of $100,000, Strategic Purchasing reviews and researches each for the purpose of determining subcontracting possibilities. When it is evident there is MWBE subcontracting potential, a goal is assigned to give certified MWBE suppliers additional opportunity to participate in City business.

Construction - Projects involving improvement to City facilities amounting to $500,000 or less. 
Sealed bids are taken in accordance with State law for various construction projects amounting to $500,000 or less. Bid Bonds are required on all Construction Projects. Projects exceeding $25,000 require bidders to submit a payment bond and those exceeding $100,000 require a payment and performance bond. The City Purchasing Agent recommends award of contracts to City Council. Certified MWBE's are encouraged to bid as prime contractors.
