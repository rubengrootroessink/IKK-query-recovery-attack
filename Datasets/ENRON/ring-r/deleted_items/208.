The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 01:00-07:00 in the January 1, 2002
Real-Time Market to verify prices.

Prices in the January 2, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.
