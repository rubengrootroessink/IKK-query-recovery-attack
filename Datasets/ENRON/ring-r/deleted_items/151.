Michael,

I need to know what the total consumption for Fetzer for the month of September 2001 is.  I know that we did not deliver physical power to them do to the DE-DASR and subsequent RE-DASR for some period of time however I still need to provide renewable energy equal to one hundred percent of Fetzer's load, even if we are only serving them on a financial basis for some period of time.

Thanks,

Richard
