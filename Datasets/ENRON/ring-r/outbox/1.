Please see the note below from Richard Ring.  He is currently the ERCOT System administrator and it is causing some problems and he does not want to do it anymore.  We need to figure out who would be the best person to control this.  DICK:  Do you have any suggestions?

Good afternoon. 
I think there are 2 ways - SR on the portal or Notice of Change of Information form (my preference). http://www.ercot.com/mkt_part_apps/market_participant_application_f.htm  
Who - probably someone in your IT department. 
Thanks 
Karen

How do we change our security administrator?  What is the process?  How 
do we choose who in our company should fulfill this responsibility - any 
hints?  Thanks.

Nancy, 
I would like to be removed as the "designated security administrator" 
for ERCOT.  What do we need to do to change the representative? 
Thanks, 
Richard

Nancy, 
I'd like to point out one more thing!  Richard Ring is the designated 
security administrator for Enron.  Ercot will only deal with Richard in 
providing information regarding encryption keys and security 
information. 
The Ercot protocol recommends that if you're using a third party 
provider 
that a third party security key be obtained.  I don't believe that this 
was 
done and that we got the original.  I don't know how/if we can correct 
this.  Do you want to investigate? 
Thanks, 
Allyson

We need to talk about this.  Why is he involved with ERCOT in talking 
about 
this stuff.  Allyson is working on this and getting our transactions 
through.  They do not have anything to do with EDI transactions.  This 
is 
the kind of stuff that once again gives us a bad name.  Let's discuss 
ASAP. 
Thanks.

   RE: testing fee invoice 
   Thanks Preston 
   Rebecca - Please let me know on the ISA/GS numbers that you used in 
   Certification testing, and what you have setup for Production.  We 
may 
   need you to change the GS number, so that it matches what we have on 
   file for you, in order for our registration systems (Siebel) to 
   correctly process your files. 
   Thank you,

   Hi Preston - left you a voice mail about this. 
   Once you find out from your accounting department, when the check was 
   mailed, we can probably move forward to get Enron Energy Services 
setup 
   to begin to submit switches (814_01). 
   One other thing, someone (I think from your IT area) contacted ERCOT 
IT 
   department regarding the DUNS that are being setup for sending the 
   ISA/GS for the EDI transactions.  Please note, the certification and 
   production environments at ERCOT use different ISA/GS numbers. 
   Please let me know who you would like me to work with on this. 
   Thanks
