ABRAHAM LEAKS A GLIMPSE OF BUDGET; FULL PICTURE DUE MONDAY
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham offered a limited taste of the FY '03 
Energy Department budget last week when he announced a new $800 million 
program to expedite environmental cleanup at the department's nuclear 
facilities. On Monday, the White House will propose the new program as part 
of its $6.7 billion environmental management (EM) budget, a marked increase 
from last year's $5.9 billion budget request for EM programs.
