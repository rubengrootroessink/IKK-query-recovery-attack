Tina - Please move Richard Ring to ECN 623a.  Liqun Pan is also on the fifth floor in ECS.  You can move her to ECN 680a.  Oliver Jones has already communicated his move location to the move team.  

If you have questions call me at x.35330.

Richard, Rick, and Paul:

Can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ECN as soon as possible (today).  Please notify Tina Holcombe of the location so that she can designate for the upcoming churn (computer and telephone move). Once on ECN6 Deb will work to finalize a permanent floor plan.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,
Rogers
