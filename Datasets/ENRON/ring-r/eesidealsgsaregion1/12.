Scott,

You may want to speak with Garret and/or Will about this.  I think the way that we were headed was to not put any requirements in these sections as A'Lones would never be able to satisfy our requirements.  We were going to look to the Unconditional Guaranty of Performance to cover these type of items.

Richard

Karen is working on getting the contact information together.  Will Denise fill in the blanks on Cross Default Amounts, Credit Protection, Collateral Threshold, Downgrade Events, etc.?  Thanks.

Scott,

Karen Cordova should be able to provide you with all of the "contact information" for the cover sheet.  The distribution list for approval of the documents should include Legal, Desk (myself) and Credit (Denise Furey).

I am getting very near completion.  Do you know who would be able to provide all of the contact information that goes on the cover sheet?  Also, who is on  the distribution list for approval of the documents prior to shipping to A'lones?  Thanks.

Scott

What is the status of your efforts regarding the A'Lones Group documents?
