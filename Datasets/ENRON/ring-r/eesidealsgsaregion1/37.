Tonya,

Any news on a proposal for the DOT?  Attached are the interval data for the accounts.  They called yesterday wondering about the proposal.

Please let me know.

Tonya,

Here is the interval data you requested to do a pricing proposal for DOT behind NSTAR.  Please let me know if this is sufficient and when we can expect to have a proposal to submit to the GSA.

Thanks,

Bill

Thom,

I've attached 2 spreadsheets containing 18 months of hourly interval data
for 1 D.O.T. account.  The period is from 01/01/00 to 06/25/01.

Account number 1150-064-0021 has 2 contributors of interval data.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
