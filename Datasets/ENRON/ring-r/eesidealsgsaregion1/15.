Rogers,

Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. ("EESO") and General Services Admini=
stration ("GSA") entered into an agreement, effective November 1, 1998, whi=
ch provides for commodity pricing and value added services, specifically re=
lated to GSA Region 1 -New England and runs through October 31, 2003.  EESO=
 agreed to provide a "Discount to Standard Offer" commodity price for GSA's=
 "Core Load" associated with facilities in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and=
 Rhode Island at such time as the utilities met certain conditions regardin=
g deregulation (State commission formally approves UDC's restructuring plan=
 and State Commission formally approves the UDC's sale of non-nuclear gener=
ating assets).  Individual agencies that have elected to participate under =
the GSA agreement are: Veterans Administration, Coast Guard, National Parks=
 Service, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Agriculture, National Arc=
hives and Records Administration, Hanscom Air Force Base, and Department of=
 Labor, with the total core group consisting of approximately 60 MW's.  The=
 UDC's that have met the above referenced criteria above are Massachusetts =
UDC's (MECO, BECO WMECO, Fitchburg Gas & Electric, Eastern Utilities, and C=
ommonwealth Electric, Cambridge Electric Company) and Rhode Island UDC (Nar=
ragansett Electric).  The only location where EESO currently delivers physi=
cal commodity is Massachusetts - BECO, which represent approximately fifty =
percent of the total "Core Load" or approximately 30 MW's and commenced in =
October 2000.

The agreement has provided other commodity upsell opportunities such as (i)=
 physical delivery of comodity GSA accounts and Coast Guard accounts in Mai=
ne behind Central Maine Power (June 2000 thru October 2003)  and (ii) sale =
and delivery of "renewable energy" to GSA and Hanscom Air Force Base (Octob=
er 2000 thru December 2001, with opportunity to extend thru October 2003).

Value Added Services under the agreement has been responsible for (i) solar=
 panel project development and installation (ii) cogeneration project devel=
opment and installation (in progress) (iii) chilled water project and (iv) =
maintenance agreement, all which total additional 50-55 million dollars.  E=
ESO had asked GSA to allow the contract to be split between commodity and v=
alue added services and GSA refused. A decision was made that would allow E=
nron Facilities Services (EFS) to perform the value added services portion =
of the contract, on behalf of EESO.  To the best of my knowledge the cogene=
ration projects would affect only the Veterans Administration sites, behind=
 Massachusetts-BECO only. =20

There is another issue that we can discuss at your convenience which relvol=
ves around the Master Subcontracting Plan and the requirement, in the last =
two years of the agreement for EESO to spend 1 million each year of the las=
t two years of the agreement utilizing small business concerns, small disad=
vantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns.

Let me know if you would like to discuss any of the above referenced inform=
ation.

Regards,

Richard     =20

No acceptance.

This is not enough info for me to accept anything.  We have a process which=
 you will need to follow.  I suggest you talk to Sean Holmes and ultimately=
 EWS' structuring group will have to get comfortable with all/any of the is=
sues before I accept.  I expect better documentation than just an e-mail.

Richard what are the issues - this is the first thing I have EVER heard abo=
ut this?

Rogers

Rogers & Richard,

We are in the process of selling (transitioning) the Projects piece of the =
GSA Region 1 Deal to Enron Facility Services, with the commodity piece to r=
emain the responsibility of EES. We would like to confirm that when EFS com=
pletes a project, the resulting reduced consumption figures will not advers=
ely affect your commodity risk position.

Please indicate your acceptance of this transaction by responding to this e=
mail.

Regards,

Chris Wheeler
