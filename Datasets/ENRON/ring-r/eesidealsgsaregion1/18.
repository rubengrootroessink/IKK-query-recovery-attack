Roman and Karen,

Dyaniese put together this great Excel analysis for you which I have reviewed.  It shows a comparison by billing period of the old invoice without renewable billing with the correct invoice amount with renewable billing.  The net difference for calenday year through August (most up to date info) is $14,410.90.

Please review the analysis.  If you have questions, please give me a call.  (And, Dyaniese, great work.)

Thanks,

Bill
