Subject:  GSA: Urgent Need for Pricing Correction in STAT

Pam,

I just had a conference call with Bill Hatch and Richard Ring.  They have
advised me that we are pricing one of our GSA accounts incorrectly.
According to Change Request number 0458-Rev 3,  the pricing should be
tiered.  This is not currently happening.  Who do I contact in Order
Provisioning to assist me with this correction?  Also, please advise as to
the ETA of a change such as this.

Thanks,
Dyaniese
