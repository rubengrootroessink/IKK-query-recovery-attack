Bill ... Marie told me of your conversation last week regarding decision on
moving vas's ... too bad ... hope you guys can still deal with it
internally.  Also, just making sure that you had received this interval
data for the DOT.

Thom,

I've attached 2 spreadsheets containing 18 months of 15-minute interval
data
for 1 D.O.T. account.  The period is from 01/01/00 to 06/26/01.

If you  have any questions, please contact me.
