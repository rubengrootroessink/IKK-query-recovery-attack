August 7th at 4pm is fine.  I am located on Mirant's trading floor and do
not know which conference room or office I will be using for the conference
call.  Would it be possible for you to provide a phone number?

seem to be a good time for all parties(Enron/A'Lones) to speak.  Give me a
call to let me know or another  time and or date.  We will be talking about
cover sheet, comfort letter and proposed guaranty of performance document.

Please leave a number.

Untill then,


A. Bernard
