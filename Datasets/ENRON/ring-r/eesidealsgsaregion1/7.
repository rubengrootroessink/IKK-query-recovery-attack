Richard,

Here is my first take on the analysis you wanted and acc't numbers.

Please do not show this to anyone before we talk.  I need to get to a meeting in Boston now so I don't have time to write something up which I need to do.  So please keep this just between us.  I'll call you this afternoon.

Thanks, 

Bill
