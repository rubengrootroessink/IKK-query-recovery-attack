Karen is working on getting the contact information together.  Will Denise fill in the blanks on Cross Default Amounts, Credit Protection, Collateral Threshold, Downgrade Events, etc.?  Thanks.

Scott,

Karen Cordova should be able to provide you with all of the "contact information" for the cover sheet.  The distribution list for approval of the documents should include Legal, Desk (myself) and Credit (Denise Furey).

I am getting very near completion.  Do you know who would be able to provide all of the contact information that goes on the cover sheet?  Also, who is on  the distribution list for approval of the documents prior to shipping to A'lones?  Thanks.
