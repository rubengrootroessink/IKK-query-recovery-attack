Richard who is the attorney drafting this document.   I need to ask him a few questions before I can give him the credit language.

I spoke with Denise briefly and I believe she was looking into the EEI issue with Ed Sacks.  I would contact Denise directly on this one as I believe Dana has not been involved to date.

James,

Thanks for your help with A'Lones Group and Mirant Energy Americas, LP.  I have not heard anything from Denise Furey or Dana Smith regarding our conversation from Monday August 20th.  Do you have any additional information or should I contact Dana Smith?

Regards,

Richard
