Deb,

We need a product change on an account in STAT.  The account number is
25963461006 and the utility is NSTAR/BECO (Boston Edison Company).  Please
let me know what, if any, information you need from me such as a copy of
the change request, etc.  I am new at this stage of the process, so I'm not
quite sure what my role is...let me know what assistance you need.

FYI...I confirmed during a conference call with Bill Hatch and Richard Ring
that the pricing on this account, for the calendar year 2001, should be as
follows:

   tier one: 175,000 kwh @ $.055
   tier two:  225,000 kwh @ $.0525
   tier three:  remaining kwh @ $.049
   Enron Discount computation should remain as it currently is.

Please let me know when we can expect completion on this as the customer is
looking for a resolution date.

Thanks,
Dyaniese

Pam,

I just had a conference call with Bill Hatch and Richard Ring.  They have
advised me that we are pricing one of our GSA accounts incorrectly.
According to Change Request number 0458-Rev 3,  the pricing should be
tiered.  This is not currently happening.  Who do I contact in Order
Provisioning to assist me with this correction?  Also, please advise as to
the ETA of a change such as this.

Thanks,
Dyaniese
