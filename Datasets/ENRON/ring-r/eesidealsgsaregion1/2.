Per email from Steve, I understand that the Service Group is now responsible for the commodity portion of the GSA contract.   Please let me know to whom I should refer calls of a Service Manager nature re: GSA commodity questions.

Dyaniese,  Please note that there will be a new person responsible for the management of this commodity account.  Good luck.

Bill
