Dyaniese,

I forgot that it's so close to the end of the fiscal year so no problem with me waiting.  If I can have it by the end of the week that would be fine.

On a more important issue, I hope you and/or Mat is researching how we're billing the renewables for the GSA.  There seems to be a problem.

Please let me know about the renewabla pricing as soon as you have some information.  This really is important to the GSA.

Thanks,

Bill

Bill,

I don't know off hand (I recognize some of the abbreviations as part of the
site address)...I simply forwarded a spreadsheet that was given to me.  If
you don't mind waiting until tomorrow or Wednesday, I can look them up and
send it to you again.  It's the end of the month, end of GSAs fiscal year,
I'm trying to make everybody happy...  You're included on that list so I'll
make sure I get the info. to you asap.

Thanks,
Dyaniese

Dyaniese,

Can you send me the guide to the new BECO account numbers?  What I need are
the
old numbers by Agency and the corresponding new account numbers.

Thanks,

Bill
