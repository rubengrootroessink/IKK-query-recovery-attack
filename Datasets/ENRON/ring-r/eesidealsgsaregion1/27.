Dyaniese,

Per my voice mail, I suggest we have a conf call with Richard this afternoon to discuss the GSA renewable billing.  It is incorrect to charge three GSA accounts for the renewable power.  

The proper GSA Renewable invoicing is as follows:

Charge JFK Building (57-1695-094001) 175,000 kwh/month at 5.5 cents and 225,000 kwh/month at 5.25 cents.  This equals 400,000 kwh/month and 4.8mm kwh per year which is the minimum amount they contracted for.

The proper Hanscom Air Force Renewable invoicing is as follows:

Charge only HAFB Acc't # 516488321650,   200,000 kwh/month at 5.5 cents. 


The problems I see ahead are the adjustments CSC needs to make to past invoices in order to properly re-calculate the monthly total consumption price.  I'd like for Richard and me to review with you what CSC now needs to do.

Will 2:00 Eastern be ok with you?  The dial in number is 800-711-8000; the passcode is 26060#.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Bill
