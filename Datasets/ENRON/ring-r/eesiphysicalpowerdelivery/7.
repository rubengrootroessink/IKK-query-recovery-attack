Hi Rebecca.

In ConEd's Phase 4 Retail Access Implementation Plan and Operating Procedure, under section 5.3.7. Customers Requesting Con Edison Bundled Service, it reads (Page 20), "D. Con Edison reserves the right to establish a minimum term of service for customers under the Schedule for Electricity Service in connection with transfers from retail access service to bundled service..." What is ConEd's minimum term of service? The NY UBP establishes that it should not exceed 12 months. I thank you in advance for your assistance, Vinio
