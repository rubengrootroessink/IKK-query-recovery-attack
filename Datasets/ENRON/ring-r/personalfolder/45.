Electricity Is Not Cyclical!

* A reminder, electricity demand is non-cyclical
In 35 years, electricity demand has decreased in only 1 year,
despite 5 years of negative GDP growth.
* Industrial demand is only about 30% of total US electricity
consumption
And has fallen from about 40% of total consumption in 1980.
* Unregulated power should not trade in sympathy with cyclical energy
Inside we show the volatility in natural gas & oil consumption vs
electricity demand stability. Further, shortage supply conditions,
L-T sales contracts & wholesale market growth differs.
* What will get unregulated power up and running again?
A supportive FERC decision on El Paso's affiliate ruling,
visibility on '02E EPS in 3Q01, stabilizing natural gas prices,
and industry consolidation. Favorite names are MIR & CPN.
