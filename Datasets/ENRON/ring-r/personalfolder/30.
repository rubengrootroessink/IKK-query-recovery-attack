Weather-Risk Management for the Cold Beverage Industry

beverages. Enron's new retail weather-risk management product provides compensation for 
lost revenue due to cooler than normal summer temperatures or a shorter than average summer
season.  The structures are based on customers' historic financial information and National
Weather Service data. To learn more, click here .
