Enron Energy Analyzer
 Unnecessary-or inefficient-energy use eats into the bottom line. 
But companies can't cut out the waste until they understand where and why it's happening. 
Enron Energy Analyzer is a service that lets companies view, analyze and 
compare-online-energy demand, usage, weather conditions and other 
energy-related information, across individual facilities and equipment, and company-wide 
as well. Energy Analyzer also allows benchmarking of energy performance 
versus comparable facilities and equipment.  To learn more, click here.
