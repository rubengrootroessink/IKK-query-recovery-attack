Enron customers expect competitive pricing, and this product delivers. 

Targeted at current small commercial customers enrolled in one of Commonwealth Edison's 
bundled rates, the Illinois Fixed-Price Incentive Plan provides up-front incentives through 
February 2002, followed by fixed-price retail generation through end of contract. Bottom line: 
this is EES's lowest price offering in the Illinois market. NOTE: Enron is offering limited 
PHYSICAL delivery in March 2002!  Want to learn more? Click here.
