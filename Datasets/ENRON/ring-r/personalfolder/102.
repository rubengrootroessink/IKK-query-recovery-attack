Kenron's business is to create value and opportunity
for its senior management. We 
do this by combining our employees' personal financial
resources and restricting the 
flow of information to the market  to create
innovative accountancy solutions to 
challenge the US financial regulations. We are best
known for our lack of respect 
and truthfulness and single minded ambition to stray
from our core competencies of 
natural gas and electricity products into all kinds of
unprofitable markets and hair 
brained ventures. 

Today we offer vast diversified product range, 
including office space in many major 
US and European cities, second hand computer
equipment, and useless IT Helpdesk 
promotional gimmickry. In fact we have the largest
stock of nearly new Compaq and 
Sun computers in the world. These products give
customers the flexibility they need 
to lose all their money and achieve into the highly
sought after status of suing our ass 
in a class action. 

It's difficult to define Kenron in a sentence, but our
senior executives have been 
described as "incompetent", "arrogant" and " a bunch
of thieving bustards" by many 
top tier financial institutions. We falsify commodity
markets so that we can deliver 
physical commodities to our customers at a
ridiculously unsustainable price. It's 
difficult, too, to talk about Kenron without using the
word "screwed." Most of the things 
we do have never been done before, like going from a
market capitalisation of 
nearly $90 billion to $199 in the space of a year!!!!
We believe in the economic 
benefits of secret, underhanded insider trading, and
we play a leading role in ripping 
off our investors. We initiated the  wholesale
bandwidth markets in the United States, 
and we are helping to build similar markets in Europe
and elsewhere. Shame we 
lost billions in doing so :-( 

Every day we strive to hype up our share price to
unrealistic highs, with the sole 
purpose of suckering the investor community and lining
our own pockets. Our passion 
has enabled us to completely mismanage risk. No wonder
Misfortune Magazine 
surveys have named Kenron the most innovative company
in America for six years in 
a row. Our emloyees think Kenron is such a wonderful
place to work, thousands are 
leaving every day to spread the word around the world.


Knron's four business units -- Wholesale Services,
Energy Services, Broadband 
Services and Transportation Services -- ARE NOW
CLOSED.
