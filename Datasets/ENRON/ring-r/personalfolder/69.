Net Generation Year-to-Date 2001

During the first 4 months of the year, total U.S. net generation of=20
electricity was 1,214 billion kilowatthours, 2.3 percent more than=20
the amount reported during the corresponding period in 2000.  More=20
than half (53 percent) of the generation was produced by coal-fired=20
plants.  This was followed by 20 percent from nuclear, 14 percent from=20
gas, 6 percent from hydro, 4 percent from petroleum, and 2 percent from=20
other renewables.

Net Generation and Utility Retail
Sales-April 2001

Net Generation.  Total U.S. net generation of electricity was 282=20
billion kilowatthours, 1 percent more than the amount reported in=20
April 2000. Electric utilities generated 200 billion kilowatthours=20
(71 percent of the total) and nonutility power producers generated=20
82 billion kilowatthours (29 percent of total generation).  At=20
utilities, fossil fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 73 percent=20
of net generation, followed by 19 percent from nuclear, and 8 percent=20
from renewable resources (including hydro).  At nonutilities, fossil=20
fuels (primarily coal) accounted for 68 percent of total generation,=20
followed by 21 percent from nuclear, and 11 percent from renewables=20
(including hydro).

Utility Retail Sales. Total sales of electricity to ultimate consumers=20
in the United States were 255 billion kilowatthours, 8 billion=20
kilowatthours (3 percent) more than the amount reported in April 2000.
The residential sector had sales of 83 billion kilowatthours, 10=20
percent more than the amount reported in April 2000.  Retail sales=20
in the commercial sector were 6 percent higher while sales in the=20
industrial sector were 5 percent lower than amounts reported a year=20
ago.

Utility Fuel Receipts, Costs, and
Quality-March 2001

Coal. Receipts of coal at electric utilities totaled 64 million =20
short  tons, down 5 million short tons from the
level reported in=20
March 2000.  The decrease from the prior year level is due partly=20
to the sale and reclassification of utility plants as nonutility=20
plants.  Plants recently reclassified as nonutility and no longer=20
required to report fuel receipts on the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission (FERC) Form 423 include those operated by Atlantic City=20
Electric Company, Baltimore Gas & Electric Company, Cajun Electric=20
Power Cooperative, Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company, Duquesne=20
Light Company, PECO Energy, Pennsylvania Power & Light Company,=20
Potomac Edison Company, Potomac Electric Power Company, and Public=20
Service Electric & Gas Company of New Jersey.  In addition, data for=20
the Tennessee Valley Authority was not available at the time of=20
publication and is not included in this report. =20

Petroleum.  Receipts of petroleum totaled 10 million barrels, up=20
nearly 6 million barrels from the level reported in March 2000. While=20
the sale and reclassification of plants has reduced fuel oil receipts=20
over the past year, this increase in petroleum receipts is due partly=20
to utilities switching from natural gas to a less expensive fuel oil=20
as a replacement fuel. Also, the increase in consumption of fuel oil=20
during December through February required some rebuilding of stocks.=20
The average delivered cost of fuel oil was $4.20 per million Btu, up=20
from $4.03 per million Btu reported in March 2000.

Gas.  Receipts of gas totaled 142 billion cubic feet (Bcf), down from=20
191 Bcf reported in March  2000.  The average cost of gas delivered=20
to electric utilities was $5.74 per million Btu, compared to $2.93 per=20

   sample; see Technical Notes for a discussion of the sample design

      4/  Represents total pumped storage facility production minus
   energy used for pumping. Pumping energy used at pumped storage
   plants for April 2001  was 2,326 million kilowatthours.
      5/  The April 2001 petroleum coke consumption was 53,224 short
   tons for electric utilities and 307,009 short tons for
   nonutilities.
      6/  The April 2001 petroleum coke stocks were 140,428 short
tons.

   and retail average revenue per kilowatthour do not include taxes
   such as sales and excise taxes that are assessed on the consumer
   and collected through the utility.  Retail sales and net
   generation may not correspond exactly for a particular month for a
   variety of reasons (i.e., sales data may include purchases of
   electricity from nonutilities or imported electricity). Net
   generation is for the calendar month while retail sales and
   associated revenue accumulate from bills collected for periods of
   time (28 to 35 days) that vary dependent upon customer class and
   consumption occur-ring in and outside the calendar month.

   farms for irrigation, and interdepartmental sales.
