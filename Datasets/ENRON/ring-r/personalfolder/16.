Introducing a product that will help Massachusetts customers compare apples to apples. The 
Fixed Price with Congestion Pass-Through product is comparable to products being offered 
by our competition, but with a twist. With Enron, customers will not be put back on 
default service once the congestion management system comes into effect in 2003. 
They will continue paying a fixed price for generation, with the congestion portion of 
the bill reflecting current market pricing. To learn more, click here .
