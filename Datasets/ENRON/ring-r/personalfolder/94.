	Dear Elliot,

	How are you?  You may remember that we met last fall when you came
to SOM for on-campus recruitment.  At that time, I successfully completed
the first round of interviews with you and Dwight, but unfortunately I was
unable to attend the second round.

	I graduated this May and am currently looking for a full-time
position starting as soon as possible.  I am very interested in talking with
you about current or future job openings at Enron.   I have already received
a couple of job offers in my home country (Venezuela) and one in the U.S.,
and I am also aware of the difficult market conditions right now.  However,
I have decided to take the time to find the most challenging position
available. 

	Please let me know when might be the most convenient time to call
you.  I have attached my resume for your review.

	Thank you, Elliot.


	Best Regards,

	Oscar Stefani
