> PJM SUCCESSFULLY MEETS
> RECORD HIGH ELECTRICITY DEMANDS
> Thanks public for conservation efforts
>
> (Valley Forge, PA - August 10, 2001) - With a six-day heat wave ending, PJM
> Interconnection, LLC, the electric grid operator for the mid-Atlantic region,
> today recognized the great efforts taken so the company could supply a week of
> record-breaking electricity demands.
>
> "This week's accomplishment is testimony to how effective markets and
> efficient operations work in harmony to reliably serve the electric customer,"
> said Phillip G. Harris, president and chief executive officer. "We greatly
> appreciate the conservation steps taken by the public and for the support from
> PJM's members, especially the generation owners who provided outstanding
> performance, as well as state commissions and agencies."
>
> Harris paid special tribute to PJM employees, who worked tirelessly to ensure
> a reliable supply of electricity to the more than 22 million customers in the
> mid-Atlantic region. "Our ability to supply the record-breaking electricity
> demand is a reflection of our talented, dedicated staff." Harris noted that
> PJM's employees train, through simulation programs, for all types of
> circumstances, which include the situation encountered this week.
>
> The area's intense heat wave drove system-wide electricity use to successive
> all-time records -54,176 MW Thursday, 53,910 MW Wednesday and 53,464 MW
> Tuesday. This week's electricity peak was more than 2,400 MW higher than the
> peak experienced during the July 1999 severe heat wave.
>
> To maintain the region's electric supply in time of historic demand, PJM first
> took steps that had the least impact on electricity customers. During periods
> on several days this week, the company activated programs that included:
> curtailment of industrial customers through incentive programs; implementation
> of its pilot demand-side response program; request for back-up supply at
> commercial locations; and request for voluntary curtailment at industrial
> locations. On Thursday, the company directed its members to institute "voltage
> reductions" - which equated to about a 2 to 3 percent decrease in electricity.
> These electricity reductions, which are generally undetectable to the user,
> assisted PJM in maintaining overall reliability of the region's electric grid
> during its peak on Thursday.
>
> PJM, the country's only fully functioning regional transmission organization,
> operates the world's largest competitive wholesale electricity market and one
> of North America's largest power grids. The company currently coordinates a
> pooled generating capacity of more than 58,000 megawatts and operates a
> wholesale electricity market with more than 200 market buyers, sellers and
> traders of electricity. PJM has administered more than $5 billion in energy
> and energy service trades since the regional markets opened in 1997. More than
> 70 nations have sent delegates to PJM to learn about the market model and the
> operation of the grid in the mid-Atlantic states.
