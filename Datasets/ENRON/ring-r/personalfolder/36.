Narsimha,

Couple of other time periods that Nick Politis is asking about:

"I have a couple of other time periods for this same customer.  They are naturally long and I think I could work something out if you guys are natural buyers.  The other 2 periods are: Jun-Dec02 (starting one month later than your last quote).  The other period is the PJM planning year Jun02-May03.  The amount could be higher if that works for you guys.  Let me know if you want to do more than 100 MW and I will see what I can do."

Any interest and at what level?
