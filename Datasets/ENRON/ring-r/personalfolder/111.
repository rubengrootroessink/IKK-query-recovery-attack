Super Bowl Party!

When:		Feb 3rd at 3pm, the game starts at 5pm
Where:	16319 Hickory Point Rd

What:		Bring something to drink and optionally your favorite dip

Fish, Potato Salad and Fun in abundance.


The perfect combination will take place on Feb 3rd at the Bledsoe residence.  We are combining a Fish Fry with the big game.  Due to the fantastic fishing the past few months the freezer is full of Trout and Redfish and it's time to make some room for the excellent fishing coming up in the next few months.  Please RSVP via email or call 281-855-4252 so we have an idea of how much fish to cook.  

Looking forward to seeing everyone and having fun with the football and commercials!
