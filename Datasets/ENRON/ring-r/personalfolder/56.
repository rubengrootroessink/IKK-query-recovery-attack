i thought i'd have a little get together on saturday if you guys are interested.  a little celebration to welcome michelle and vin down to houston.  nothing big - figured we would cook out or something, then either hang out and drink at my house or head out downtown to party.  we would start around 6 pm.  bring your significant others.  i think everyone knows where i live, but just to be on the safe side directions are below.

take smith street south.  turn right on drew.  cross brazos, bagby, and baldwin.  the house is on the right immediately before helena.  it's 207 drew street.  my phone number is 713-523-0170.
