Introducing a product that allows customers to create revenue 
using their emergency power generators.

Many Enron commodity customers have emergency power generators that normally sit idle. But with our new 
Dispatchable Generation Program, our customers can turn their power generators into revenue generators. Enron 
monitors the wholesale power market, and when prices spike, we notify our customers to operate their on-site
generators. The power they generate displaces a portion of the load we would normally supply. We then 
sell that displaced power on the wholesale market--where the prices are high--and share the revenue 
with the customer. Want to learn more? Click here .
