You've Got Some Great Ideas-We're Banking On It!
Ever had a great idea for an EES product or service that you wanted to share? Now you can, through the new Product Idea Bank. At the Product Idea Bank, you can "deposit" ideas for direct review by the EES Product Management Team.

We know that everyone at EES has great ideas, so the Product Idea Bank is open to everyone. And if your product idea is selected and launched, you'll get more than just the satisfaction of a job well done-you'll get company-wide recognition.

The Product Idea Bank is easy to use. Just visit http://home.ees.enron.com/vision/comm/ideabank,  which is accessible from the EES home page. Fill out the brief form, click on the submit button, and you're done!

Remember-don't let your product ideas go undiscovered. Bring them to the Product Idea Bank.

Note: The Product Idea Bank works best with Internet Explorer.
