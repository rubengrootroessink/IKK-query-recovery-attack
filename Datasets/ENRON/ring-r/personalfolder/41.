Thanks for the price, he will look at it and get back to us.  Also do you have an idea where ICAP in New York Zone J is trading for the next couple of years, (Cal02 and 03)?  Nick

Nick,

I spoke to Narshima about this deal.  EESI would be bid at $46.00/MWD for Unforced Capacity Credits for Cal02.  Are you asking if we would have a bid for the energy as well?  If so, I would need to know the specific location for this generator (i.e. what point does this energy enter the PJM system).

Regards,

Richard

Richard,

Did Narsimha have a bid for 20 MW of Unforced Capacity Credits in PJM for Cal02?  My customer would like to sell this as well as energy.  I need to show him a price this morning.  Nick
