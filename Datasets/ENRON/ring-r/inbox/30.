All, 
In the future, please refrain from parking in the area on the west side of the building when working at or visiting the Austin Facility.  This area is reserved for General Motors.  It is easily identified.  The lot has blue striping and is marked "GM Parking Only". In most cases, there is ample parking in the front, rear and on the east side of the building. In the rare instance that parking is unavailable, please check in at the security desk and you will be directed to an overflow parking area. 

Thank you for your cooperation.
