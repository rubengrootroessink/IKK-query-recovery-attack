Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be
delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.  Issues associated with new
computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure
that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead
Market (DAM).  The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and
virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Account Representative
or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations
