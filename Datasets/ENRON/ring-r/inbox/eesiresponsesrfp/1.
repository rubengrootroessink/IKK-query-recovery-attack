Subject:	Re: Maryland Market Entry

I have spoken with Greg Sharp and Jim Wood today about Maryland.  I have received authorization to get the ball rolling.  Greg is anxious to start selling yesterday and has idle resources that he would like to deploy.

Can you please develop a TC for the product described in the attached Product Approval Template?   

Additionally, based on Jim's request to move up rollout to before Labor Day, I have also attached a revised timeline.

Thanks.

Gillian
