Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by 
issuance of Performance Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond 
in the amount of $8,000,000. 

On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating 
that EESI's current Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to 
$11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  

In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default 
the matter needed to be resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001). 

By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, 
but encountered delays in working with the bond company.

EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request 
to the bond company for revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve 
the matter.

Following resolution of delays with the bond company, a bond increase was issued by the bond company on 
October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE 
on October 23, 2001.  

EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due 
to delays with the bond company as mentioned above. 

On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to EESI by NEPOOL indicating that EESI had not maintained the 
required level of financial assurance for 10 days or more and that this information was being forwarded to the 
NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action.  

However, according to Protocol for the Initiation of Membership Termination Proceedings the issue should be 
resolved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE.
