Dear Market Participants

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations
