GSA issued an RFP for one of their Houston facilities.....might be a good opportunity for us.  Check it out <http://www.eps.gov/spg/GSA/PBS/PNE/GS-00P-02-BSD-0001/listing.html> 
 Chart depicting probability for RPS in states that EES is considering delivering physical power  (attachment below) 
 I finally had a chance to look over the fundamentals map.  Great way to organize the information.  I have a few questions/observations that I've listed below.   Many of the below comments might be premature as I don't know what stage you are in as far as filling in the information.  I also don't know if I have the most current link.  I used the following link <http://wnapdx-01a390/Renewables/DeregulationMap.htm>

 
1.  California:  Legislation - Is it accurate to say the legislation is "pending".  I thought it was highly unlikely that CA will go into another special session this year.  I believe the legislation will have to be reintroduced next session.  As far as risks/opportunities - Elliot could probably recap all of the wholesale opportunities associated with aggregating green for munis.
 
RPS
2. Nevada:  I'm assuming this just hasn't been updated yet?
 
3.  Arizona:  You might want to note that the renewable requirement is placed on utilities only until 2004.  Competitive supplier's obligation begins in '04.
 
4. New Mexico: Same as NV.
 
5. MN:  Make clear this requirement is on utilities.  I believe there is also a green pricing program requirement.  
 
6.  IA:  I believe this requirement is obsolete.  You might want to verify.  
 
7.  IL: Not sure this information is relevant as it is not an RPS, and doesn't apply to EES. 
 
8. CT:  The RPS applies to all competitive entities.
 
9.  MA:  Just passed final draft RPS.  While the definition you have is correct for renewables in MA, the eligibility is limited for compliance with the RPS to new renewables, coming on line after 12/31/97.  The definition is: Solar PV or Solar Thermal Electric; Wind; Ocean thermal, wave or tidal; fuel cells utilizing an eligible renewable fuel; Landfill gas; Low-emission advanced biomass power using the following fuels: agriculture and food waste, energy crops, biodiesel, organic refuse-derived fuel that is collected and managed separately from MSW, landfill or digester methane case.  The RPS applies to all competitive suppliers.
 
10.  Texas:  For some reason, TX is left off of the map as having an RPS.
 
11.  I thought you guys were concentrating on competitive states, so I was surprised to see IA, MN and HI on the list.  If you list these states, you'll need to go into a lot more detail as there are currently 220 utility green programs.  WI is probably the leading state for utilities with a mandate.  For the sake of simplicity, I'd limit it to competitive states.
 
 
Incentive funds:  I saw that your map included a space for incentives for renewables.   Below are the competitive states (albeit CA is no longer competitive) with renewable energy funds.  I don't know if you want to include all of this information.
1.  States with renewable incentives: CA, CT, IL, MA, MT, NM, NJ, NY PA, RI, 
 
 
Last:  I know you probably used the wording from Gov't affairs for the status of dereg.  You might want to update the information is the state is already open.  For example, IL says the state started restructuring in '99 and will continue to phase in customers until Dec 2000.  I believe that was written prior to Dec 2000.   You could just say that it is open.

 Hope this is helpful.  Jenny and Jesse, I know you've guys have put a lot of work into the fundies and it will pay off!
 
Cheers,
