Stacey,

Elliot and I would like to discuss a few issues with you regarding the MS R=
PS Comments.  What time do you think that you will have to discuss?

F-1:  Need to require that all current renewable facilities, including all =
current existing boimass facilities are certified prior to the start date R=

F-5:  Not sure that I understand the issue surrounding compliance on a prod=
uct level - let's discuss

F-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, w=
e do not understand the need to restrict the limit on how much Supplier's a=
re allowed to bank as the shelf life for Renewable Energy Credits is alread=
y limited to the two compliance periods immediately following.  We would al=
so ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Rene=
wable Energy Credits during the allowed compliance periods.  We feel that t=
he Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable=
 Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding tran=
sferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel=
 that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential ma=
rket power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit ma=
rket be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it =
is determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to th=
e market can and should be implemented.  We feel that markets operate best =
with few restrictions. =20

F-9: Section 4. Not sure I understand the difference between the percentage=
 of sales versus the actual MWh's - let's discuss

F-9: Section 5. Not sure that this language makes sense - let's discuss=20
