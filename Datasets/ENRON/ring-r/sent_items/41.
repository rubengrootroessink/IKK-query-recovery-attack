Stacey,

I enjoyed visiting with you at lunch.  Enron, as we once knew it, is not the same without you.  Here is the URL address for the Hewitt Associates LLC, Enron's Savings Plan Administrator that I promised http://resources.hewitt.com/enron/

The telephone number for Hewitt Associates LLC is 1.800.332.7979.

Take care.

Richard
