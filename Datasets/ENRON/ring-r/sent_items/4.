Kay,

Based on our conversation it looks like Kinko's would be interested in purchasing approximately 8,800 MWh's per year for a three year term (approximately 26,500 MWh's) over the term of the deal.  Our offer price for Texas Renewable Energy Credits (sourced from within the State of Texas) would remain at $6.00 MWh.

Richard

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU
and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area.
I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,
some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes.
Thanks
Kay
