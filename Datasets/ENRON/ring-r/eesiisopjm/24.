Mike,

We have been reviewing the TC with other groups and a question came up from Chris Riley and Richard Ring.  We want to make sure that you are okay with the TC not being specific on the source of costs for the ancillaries, ICAP, Congestion, and other uplifts to the index price. 

The description of the "EESI Energy Price" is currently generic enough so that Enron can be certain that all applicable costs can be included, but Chris and Richard have a concern that the lack of references could lead to interpretation differences and billing disputes.  Unlike with the LMP component, we don't refer to the information posted by the ISO, for example.

We met with the Service Management group and they seemed to be okay with the index product from a billing perspective.  They will need specific data sources for the uplift components but they didn't seem concerned that the component sources are not specified on the TC. 

Are you okay with this current interpretation latitude in the TC?  

An alternative might be to add more specific references, possibly like those in BGE's "Schedule DS" (also attached).  Or, we could try to sell the TC the way it is.  And if customers won't sign because they want more specifics regarding billing calculations, then we consider the needed additions at that time.

Also,  Mike...any TC update available yet for our current MD fixed price product?

Thanks!

Bob
