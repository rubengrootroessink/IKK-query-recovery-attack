Here's a marked-up draft of the MD Index Product confirm reflecting our recent discussions, and incorporating Richard Ring's comments.  This version continues to assume a real-time pricing approach, it includes language for a quarterly true-up of ancillary service costs, and has more details on the ancillary service cost sources.  This also includes some minor revisions to the billing section.

Let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks!
Bob
