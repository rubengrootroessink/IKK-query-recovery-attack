Here is the BG&E file I mentioned.  Sorry to be so long.  Rahman siad that for most of the website one does not need a password; however, for the portion that contains the information used to determine load profiles, some certification is required.  He was hoping you had access or knew how to obtain it.  He will be back tomorrow.
Thanks
Michael
