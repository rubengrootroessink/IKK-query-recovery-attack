Richard/Michele,

Here's a slightly revised version that should reflect your changes.  This version should be consistent with the latest  index TC language too.

Richard...I'll ask Mike Smith about your proposal to change the TC language (to eliminate what the EESI Energy Price "does not include").  This change is not reflected here yet.

I'll attached this PAT version to the latest TC and continue routing for final approvals.  Let me know if you see any further problems.

 

Thanks for reviewing!
Bob
