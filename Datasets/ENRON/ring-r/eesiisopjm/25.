This may interest you due to the fact that it involves PECO.

FYI... This can perhaps provide us with additional leverage when we next decide to negotiate with ComEd.

FYI re: execlon - note that the Power Team buys wholesale power on behalf
of comed as well.

Yesterday the Commission issued a Show Cause Order directing Exelon
Corp, PECO Energy Company, and Exelon Generation Company, and Exelon Power
Team to show cause whether they violated Section 205(b) of the FPA and the
standards of conduct in the Commission's regulations by operating PECO's
transmission system in an unduly preferential manner and sharing non-public
information regarding the timing of maintenance outages in PJM's system or
both.
