Richard,

I wanted to get this out to you so that you can get started with your
analysis.  However, there is one account that we're looking into in more
detail - it's highlighted in yellow.  The spreadsheet is split into two
tabs - one for open, the other for closed accounts.  I'll send you an
update when I get an answer on the account in question as to whether it
should be in the open or closed category.

(See attached file: newEnronEgyPECOChoice.xls)

If you have any questions, please give me a yell,
Allyson
