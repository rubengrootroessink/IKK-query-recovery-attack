Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of  revenue meter testing at Green Power.  Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.  

All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment.  If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.  

I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.  Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site.

If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter, please forward their contact information to me.

Thanks
