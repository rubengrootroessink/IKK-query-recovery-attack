I hope to get your feedback on what we have so far.  
 
Note we still need some info.:
 
1. Info. on potential RPSs for IL, MD, NH, NY and OH 
2. "Opportunities/Risks" for EES states (CA, OH, PA, NH, ME, RI, NY, MA, TX) and other potential EES states (MD, NJ, IL, NY)
3. Finalized RPD product offerings
 
Any other comments?  We hope to launch this by a week from Wednesday.
 
Thanks, 
 
Jennifer
