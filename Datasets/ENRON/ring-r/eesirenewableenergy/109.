Subject:	Corporate Responsibility Report

Many, many thanks to all of you who contributed to this effort either directly or indirectly.  We could not have gotten where we are without your support and contributions.  Please extend this appreciation to all of the operating companies who provided performance data and clarified information.

I am happy to report that the report is now available electronically via the following links:

http://ehs.corp.enron.com/Documents/AnnReport/CRANNUAL.pdf

http://home.enron.com/ ---- Under New and Notable.  The links to enron.com and the EHS intranet site will route you to the link above.  You can also do a search on www.enron.com for it.


We are composing an internal and external distribution list for the distribution of the hard copies.  We are trying to communicate the electronic availability of this report as the primary method of publication and are printing a limited number of hard copies. If you have not already communicated the external parties who you plan to give a hard copy to or site managers, please let me know by the end of this week.  Copies will be distributed at the upcoming EHS Managers Conference.

Thanks again for everyone's cooperation and assistance in getting this report completed.  If you have any questions or suggestions about next year's report, please let me know.  I will be hosting a coordination meeting for next year's report in the next month or so and will be asking some of you to represent your organizations or otherwise participate.
