Below are updated charts and maps for renewables.  Can you please update the EHS website with the below attachments?  Also, we should delete the willingness to pay study.  Let's replace it with the below 5th annual NREL report.   I've also listed several other studies for the site.
 
Many thanks.

All - 
 
Here is a start:
 
Fundamentals
1. Chart that lists states w/ RPS and EES impact (whether they have physical delivery in the state).  
2. Federal and State incentive funds (will need to be kept updated
3. Map of RPS states
4. Map of REC programs (emerging and existing)
5. Projected Wind (Texas) <http://www.awea.org/projects/texas.html>
6. Projected Wind (US - AWEA) <http://www.awea.org/projects/>
 
We need to package the above into Comprehensive Regulatory Snapshots in order to determine top target states:
 
1. Comprehensive Regional Regulatory Snapshots with:
        a. Competitors

      Developers 
      Marketers/Wholesalers 
      Suppliers

        b. Regulatory Demand

REC Programs 
RPS and Disclosure Requirement 
Government Mandates 
Green Pricing Programs

        c. Competitive Demand

Product Offerings 
Competitive Sales (Jenny) 
RFPs

        d. Supply Picture


Existing Supply (Jenny)

Projected Supply
