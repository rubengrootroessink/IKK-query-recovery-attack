Hey gang,

We are making solid progress on a number of fronts. From a 10,000 foot pers=
pective, our main goal is to pull together all of the systems, curves, prod=
uct descriptions/offerings, internal communications, and external communica=
tions of a fully functional business unit for presentation to Belden, Richt=
er, Herndon and Presto by November 15. This morning, I spoke with Juli Salv=
agio who manages marketing for Enron Wholesale about getting the Renewable =
Power Desk space on the enron.com website. Take a look at the products and =
services offerings section of enron.com, and check out emissions trading or=
 weather derivatives. The goal is to draft language (with photos -- ideas??=
) for an RPD site along those same lines. I will take an initial shot at th=
e language (with a fundamental breakdown between wholesale and retail servi=
ces) and then send around drafts for your comment the week of October 24.  =
I think we will be listed under the heading "Renewable Power Marketing" or =
"Green Power Marketing" (Which do you think is better?)=20

On other fronts:

Team Fundies is cranking along well.
Richard and I are working to clean up all of our existing positions (scrubb=
ing old EES contracts, managing inter-book issues so that any existing gree=
n tag positions fall out to the Green Desk).
Our Product Description has been professionalized by Enron Counsel (Richard=
 Ring) and we are talking to wind, biomass, landfill and geothermal develop=
ers with good offers on tags.
We are working with EWS counsel and EES counsel to prepare a formal green t=
ag contract that can be attached to either a standard EWC commodity contrac=
t or an EES commodity contract.
Stacey is roaming the country making the world safe for Green Tag trading -=
- she is preparing a regional summary of green tag/Green issues/protocols.
We continue to negotiate with LADWP for a services contract for their new r=
enewable resources.
I haven't heard back from all of you on the proposed offsite location/dates=
.
