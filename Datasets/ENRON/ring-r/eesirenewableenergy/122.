Subject:	Renewables directive finally adopted

Please see below the press release regarding the adoption by the European Council of the renewables directive. Having already gone through the Commission and the Parliament the Directive has now been formally adopted and has legal force. The final text should become available very soon.

Olivier Deleuze welcomes the adoption of the directive on renewable
sources of energy

The European Union Council adopted today the directive on the promotion of
renewable energy sources. For Olivier Deleuze, State Secretary responsible
for Energy and Sustainable Development, President of the Energy Council,
this final adoption gives the green light for the development of clean
energies in Europe while responding to the concerns of the citizens
regarding the safeguard of their environment.

The directive creates a framework for an increase of the production of
green electricity. It encourages the Member States to take the measures
needed to guarantee the development of renewable energies in line with the
national and Community objectives. It responses to the challenges
concerning the reduction of the EU 's energetic dependence, the
preservation of its capacity to choose its energy in the future while
limiting the greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants dangerous
for the health.

"In Bonn, Europe has saved the Kyoto Protocol. Now, it has to give to
itself the means to achieve it", said Olivier Deleuze.

The directive defines two global objectives for 2010 :
1) the share of gross internal energy consumption at Community level will
have to reach 12%
2) 22.1% of the consumed electricity will have to be produced from
renewable energy sources
The Member States committed themselves to set national objectives for
domestic consumption of electricity produced from renewable sources of
energy (RSE). In Belgium, for example, the share of electricity produced
with those energy sources will have to reach 6% in 2010. The European
Commission will have to monitor the conformity of the actions taken at
national level. Four years after the implementation the directive, the
Commission will have the opportunity to propose a more harmonised system
of aid, on the basis of the experience of the Member States.

Other measures introduced by the directive are : the introduction of a
system of certification of green electricity, the creation of accompanying
measures designed to create suitable conditions for the introduction of
RSE on the domestic market while respecting rules of competition, to
ensure a certification within two years of entry into force of the
directive, to accelerate the authorisation procedure applicable to the
establishment of production centres for green electricity, to guarantee
that the calculation of connection costs for new producers are
non-discriminatory.

The main sources of renewable energy are : water power, solar energy, wind
power, biomass, biogas (for example from mud coming from waste treatment,
biological fuel).
