Hi Jesse,
What's the start date for the data request?  1/1/02 hasn't occurred yet.  
Thanks,
Maria

Maria,

Can you do me a favor and get some prices for me. In order to restructure a contract currently under PX pricing, I am looking for the SP15 DJ Daily index from 1/1/02 through current. If you could dump that in a spreadsheet and send it to me asap, I would be super, super appreciative. Any question, let me know.
Thanks
Jesse
