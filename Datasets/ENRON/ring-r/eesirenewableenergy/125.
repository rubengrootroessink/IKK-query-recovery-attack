Richard,

Attached are the reports for EES and EEMC.  I have added the July's purchases we removed from last month's report.

I am waiting to get EEMC's sales figures.  Did you receive the BizMix and Fetzer reports from Annette Tafallo last month?  I have left her several phone messages and she has not returned my call.
