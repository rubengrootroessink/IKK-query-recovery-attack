Murray,

After our meeting on Wednesday, I spoke with Richard Ring concerning the customer reporting requirements for environmental/generation mix disclosure.  He has been and plans on continuing to address this issue.  Accordingly, you can remove this from your list / or coordinate requirements with Richard.

Thanks,
Jeff
