Richard:

This is a long memo - don't worry about reading it all.  However, at the en=
d you will find the Maine Disclosure Label.  I need to pick your brain on w=
ho would be the best person to track down the "per kWh" information that is=
 on this and the Mass label.

Thanks.

Subject:=09ME Direct Mini Form


Sarah --

Attached for your review are (i) a clean version of ME direct mini form; (i=
i) a redline of the ME direct mini form, marked to show changes against the=
 TX form provided in your 7.26.01 email; (iii) a terms of service document;=
 (iii) a disclosure label; and (iv) a customer authorization statement.

The following is a brief explanation of changes and a few provisions of the=
 Maine Rules we wanted to draw to your attention:

Direct Mini Form

* As discussed, we've updated the term under Section 2.1 (and under "Durati=
on and Kind of Contract" in the terms of service summary) to reflect the cu=
stomer's option of a 24-month, 36-month, 48-month or 60-month term.

* In Maine, certain consumer protection provisions (such as customer rescis=
sion rights and provision of the disclosure label and terms of service summ=
ary) apply to residential and small commercial customers (less than 20 kW o=
f demand) only.  As it is our understanding that the direct marketing campa=
ign will target small commercial customers, we have drafted the direct mini=
 form, terms of service, and disclosure label with that customer class in m=
ind.

* We've left the requirement of concurrent execution of the customer author=
ization form in Section 2.1(i) and Section 3 unchanged although the Rules o=
nly require that this document be obtained prior to initiating service . Se=
e WCMR 65-407-305(4)(D)(2)(a).  As the goal of the direct marketing campaig=
n is to simultaneously obtain an executed agreement and customer authorizat=
ion form, we believe this is a clean way to manage the administration of do=
cuments and avoid confusion.

* On a similar note, and as discussed in connection with the MA direct mini=
 form, we've drafted the five day customer rescission period in Section 3 t=
o run from the execution of the agreement, with a notation that the terms o=
f service and disclosure label are provided concurrently with the agreement=
.  The Rules, however, provide that the rescission period runs five busines=
s days from the customer's receipt of the terms and service summary which m=
ust be received by the customer 30 days following execution of the agreemen=
t.  (i.e. the MPUC envisions (i) the execution of the contract, (ii) a time=
 passage of up to 30 days; (iii) the delivery of the terms of service summa=
ry and disclosure label to the customer, followed by (iv) a five business d=
ay right of rescission running from that date of the customer's receipt of =
the terms of service and disclosure label) See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(C).  As d=
iscussed in connection with the TX direct mini form, we believe many commis=
sions, including the PUCT and MPUC, envision the terms of service document =
to behave and function more in the manner of how we would typically conside=
r a contract to behave and function.  Our thought process in drafting the r=
escission period in the ME form to run from the execution of the agreement =
is provide a clean way for EESI to manage the administration of the documen=
ts due to the unique mechanics of the transaction (the simultaneous deliver=
y of the agreement, terms of service, disclosure label and customer authori=
zation statement by the sales rep to the customer followed by the immediate=
 execution of the agreement and customer authorization statement).  We want=
ed to point out that as drafted, however, this provision is technically inc=
onsistent with the Rules.

*  To provide uniformity across forms, we have not changed the language und=
er 2.6 Security which provides that EESI may request security " as provided=
 in the Rules"   We wanted to point out, however, that the ME Rules do not =
restrict the amount of deposits required by competitive electricity provide=
rs (CEPs).

* We've revised Section 3 "Your Signature and Notices" and the Representati=
ons and Warranties section under the GT&Cs to model the ME Rules by deletin=
g references to "Your Rights as a Customer Statement" (a document unique to=
 Texas) and changed references to "electricity facts label" to "disclosure =
label" (ME's description of the label, as opposed to TX's).

* The ME Rules require a 30 day notice to the customer in the event of term=
ination due to the customer's default.  See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(G)(1).  We'v=
e updated the "Default and Early Termination" section of the GT&Cs to refle=
ct this requirement.

* By obtaining a license as a CEP in ME, EESI thereby agrees to (i) submit =
to jurisdiction in the courts of the state of Maine; (ii) that all legal pr=
oceedings relating to disputes will be maintained in ME courts or before ME=
 administrative agencies; and (iii) that all contracts for generation servi=
ce in ME with a demand of 100 kW or less will be interpreted according to M=
E law.  See WCMR 65-407-305(2)(B)(8)  We've updated the governing law provi=
sion to reflect Maine jurisdiction.

Terms of Service

As discussed, the Maine Rules were modeled after the Massachusetts Rules an=
d many items, such as the terms of service summary and disclosure label, ar=
e practically identical in format and content.  As such, we've modeled the =
ME terms of service summary and disclosure label after the documents provid=
ed in MA, with a few notable exceptions:

* The ME Rules require a listing in the terms of service summary of "condit=
ions under which a credit reporting agency is contacted for an applicant's =
credit history or under which the Competitive Supplier reports the customer=
's payment history to a credit reporting agency".  See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D=
)(2)(d).  Under "Credit Information", we've provided general information th=
at the agreement will not be effective unless and until the credit standard=
s established by EESI are met, that it is EESI's practice to perform credit=
 checks on all applicants whereby EESI may contact a credit reporting agenc=
y to obtain the customer's credit history, and that in the event of nonpaym=
ent under the Agreement, it is possible that EESI would report such nonpaym=
ent to a credit reporting agency.

* The Rules do not restrict the amounts of deposits nor is the CEP required=
 to pay any interest on deposit in ME.  The terms of service, however, requ=
ires the CEP to notify the customer as to deposit requirements and interest=
 on deposits (most likely as a measure for the customer to compare services=
 offered by competing CEPs). See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(e).  As currently=
 drafted, the terms of service provides that security deposits may be requi=
red and interest will not be paid to the customer if such a deposit is obta=
ined.

* The Rules require that the terms of service, if applicable, notify the cu=
stomer of the CEPs ability to assign the agreement to another CEP without t=
he customer's consent. See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(m).  We've provided und=
er "Assignment" that EESI will notify the customer in the event of an assig=
nment which in any way affects the customer's rights and obligations under =
the agreement.

* The Rules require the terms of service document to conspicuously disclose=
 the customer's right of rescission and how it may be exercised. See WCMR 6=
5-407-306(2)(D)(2)(i).  We've drafted the "Information on Rescission Rights=
" section with a box around it to satisfy the requirement that the disclosu=
re be conspicuous.

* Please note that the Rules require the terms of service to list, and we h=
ave left brackets around, the toll free number and hours that a customer ca=
n contact the CEP for customer questions and complaints. See WCMR 65-407-30=
6(2)(D)(2)(j)

Disclosure Label

* As the ME label is almost identical to the MA disclosure label, we've mad=
e similar changes to convert the label to a fixed price rather than variabl=
e price product.. Heather Mathis is coordinating with the commercial team t=
o verify the accuracy of the data (esp. the avg price per kWh of 5.08 cents=
).  As discussed with Heather, please note that EESI must file all new prod=
uct labels with the MPUC. See WCMR 65-407-306(3)(D).  The Rules are silent =
as to the timing of this filing and it is unclear whether the filing must b=
e made prior to or concurrently with the distribution of the new label to c=
ustomers.  Please let me know if you would like us to seek clarification on=
 this point.

Customer Authorization Statement

The Rules regarding the content of the customer authorization statement are=
 identical to the MA Rules and, as such, we have modeled the ME form after =
MA.  The only change is the correction of the rule referenced in the openin=
g sentence of the letter.  Although, as we may have discussed, the referenc=
e to such rule is not a requirement and is therefore probably not essential=
 in either the MA or ME forms, we've left the reference in for uniformity's=
 sake.


If you have any questions about the attached or would like to discuss furth=
er, please give me a call.
