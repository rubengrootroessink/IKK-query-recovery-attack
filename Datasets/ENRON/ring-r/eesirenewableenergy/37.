Stewart
We have looked at our inventory of small hydro that was available during the
time we sold you the hydro resource in May and June of 1999.  We had more
than enough inventory of <30 MW hydro available for the time of the sale.
So you are welcome to use that label for the 50MW we sold you.  The
spreadsheet below contains the background information on the small hydro
inventory available at the time.  Hope this provides the additional
clarification you need to describe what we sold you.  Have a nice weekend.
