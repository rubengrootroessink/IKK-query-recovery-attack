Jennifer,
 
Sorry, I lost track of your message.  I am not aware of anyone at EESI compiling any sort of information regarding green power offerings by any competitors.

Richard:
 
Elliot asked me to pull together some competitive intelligence re: green power product offerings (including retailers, marketers/wholesalers and developers).  Before I start researching, I wanted to check with you to see if you know if anyone at EES has already done this kind of analysis.
 
Thanks, 
 
Jenny
