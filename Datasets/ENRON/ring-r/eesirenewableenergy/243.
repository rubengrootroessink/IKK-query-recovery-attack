Jennifer --

Attached is a MA disclosure label tailored for the mid-market physical product with price variability (excess and deficiency usage bands).  The only difference between this label and the label distributed for the direct mini product is language in the "Generation Price" section.   If average prices vary by volume of sales (as I understand the mid-market product does), the MA rules require a verbatim statement on the label as follows:

"Your average generation charge is based on the terms of the Agreement.  As the Rules require, the information provided above is the average price per kWh for EESI customers for the last month of the prior quarter."

The direct mini form, in contrast, did not require this language as it was a fixed price product with no price variability.  The attached incorporates the updates to system resource mix that I just received from Richard Ring this morning and the updated emissions chart (formatting only).

Let me know if you have any questions.
Sandy
