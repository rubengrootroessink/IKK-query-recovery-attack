I wonder if this was the Minnesota project that developers like Community Energy are suspicious of them using the power for the green pricing program -- although they deny it.  It would be interesting to see how Excel is "advertising" their commodity purchase and if their customers are paying a premium.  I"ll do a little "sniffing" and see what I find out.

Good morning to you too, pardner.

Good morning  Stacey,
I came across  the following blurb (see below) in a NREL electronic newsletter ---  would the concept conveyed here cause you any concern??????   To  me, this smells of double-counting, but I was curious as to your  reaction.
Have a great  morning,
SMS

Green Power Marketing Monthly  Update (NREL) - September  2001
Navitas Selling Wind Certificates
Navitas Energy, an independent power  producer and an affiliate ofwind  developer Northern Alternative Energy, is selling "WindWatts"green energy certificates on the Internet. Each  "green tagcertificate" represents one  megawatt-hour (MWh) of wind generationand is sold for $15, or 1.5?/kWh.  The certificates represent the
environmental attributes of the power  generated from two Minnesota-based wind projects commissioned in mid-1998: the  11.25-MW LakotaRidge project and the  11.88-MW Shaockatan Hills project.   
 
According to the State Energy Office, the  energy output of theprojects is being  purchased by Xcel Energy (formerly Northern StatesPower) to meet a legislative requirement to  build or contract for425 MW of wind power  by the end of 2001. Navitas claims that itretains the rights to the wind  energy attributes and only the
commodity energy is being sold to  Xcel.
