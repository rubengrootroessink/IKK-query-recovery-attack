Here are all the EES Mass labels to date:

     

This is the only EES Label I have for this round (Mid-10.01).  Is this the GSA label or the other customer label?  Let me know so I can make sure to send the correct ones & number to CSC.

PS - I also left a message with Frank Simonetta at CSC to see who the GSA label is being sent to.
