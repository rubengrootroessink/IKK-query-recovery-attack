Richard:

To recap our conversation today, those customers that are switching from financial to physical are already on contract and their existing contract allows such a transaction to take place at our discretion.  However, these customers would not have been receiving a label in the past.  Can you please send, via e-mail a list of LDCs that this action is taking place under, and please indicate whether we have had physical customers in this LDC in the past.  Additionally, is someone keeping track of these customers so that when it comes time to send labels we have a list to send to CSC?  Thanks.

Heather
