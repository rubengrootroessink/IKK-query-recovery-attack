Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9
thanks
Kq
