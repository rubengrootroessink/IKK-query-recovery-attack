Sarah,

As discussed, I've revised the Terms of Service summary to incorporate the new contract lengths offered and the disclosure label to reflect the emissions data provided by Barry Perlmutter of the MDTE.  Mr. Perlmutter confirmed, by trying to walk me through the ISO website (after first telling me that he was certain the data was on the website), that the data is, in fact, not available.  He wanted the label to have the emissions information available, however, and gave me the information over the phone.  I have transferred the data into the label.  Mr. Perlmutter promised that he would personally update the MDTE website with the emissions information soon (as well as the other missing information that I have been bugging him about for a few months).

Heather -- you may want to pass this information along to Richard Ring, if that's helpful:

             New Units      Regional Average
CO2      760                  780
NOX      0.1                   1.5
SO2       0.01                 3.9

The data is in pounds per MWh.

Let me know if you have any questions about the edits.

Sandy
