It sounds like we want two sites for our group:
 
I. Fundamentals
*Accessible to: traders, etc.
*Information supplied
    For all states
    -Status of deregulation
 
    For EES states
    -RPS (percentages and who it applies to)
    -Total state load
    -EES position (physical or not)
    -Products offered 
 
 
2. Competitive Intelligence
*Accessible to: only our group
*Information supplied
    For all States or EES states ??
    -Competitive analysis (products offered, prices, etc.)
    -Supply/demand
    -RFPs
 
Any thoughts??
