Let me know your thoughts/additions and changes?
 
 

Jerry:  

It was a pleasure to meet you in Portland.  Per our discussion at lunch, I've talked with Elliot Mainzer of our renewable power desk as well as Richard Ring who manages the supply for the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract regarding the potential aggregation of RECs to DOE's and NREL's facilities/labs across the US.   We are glad to work with you and are glad to get you preliminary pricing information on the sourcing of RECS, however, we first need to get a little more information from you expressed in question format below.  

1. How long are you seeking for the length of the contract (5 -20 years)?  The GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract runs through October 2003; the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract also covers Value Added Services, which includes byt is not limited to preliminary audits, comprehensive audits, feasibility studies, design reviews, engineering and design,  construction and installation, operation, maintenance, training and emergency response for Value Added Services .  Therefore, any of the facilities located in Region 1 could be directly negotiated and contracted through the GSA Region 1 Contract.  Agencies covered under the GSA Region 1 Contract include:  Veterans Administration, Coast Guard, National Parks Service, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Agriculture, National Archives & Records Administration, Hanscom Air Force Base & Department of Labor.

2. Approximate demand (MWh) for facilities and labs across the US?

3. What percentage of your demand do you ideally want to come from renewable energy (sourced by tags)?  Do you intend to ramp up over a number of years, or want to initially hit a certain percentage target that remains constant over the life of the contract?

4. Would you consider purchasing tags from recently announced projects with additional increments coming from unannounced new  renewable energy project(s).  If not, what percentage is required or desired?

5. What percentage of the tags need to come from new wind?  

6.  Is it your intention to source all of the certificates from the new wind facilities located on Native American Reservations in ND or SD?  If not, what would be the percentage you are seeking?

7. What is the timeframe in which you are looking to make your purchase decision?

8. Do you want the product to be Green-e certified?

9. Are you interested in coupling energy efficiency tags with renewable energy tags?

10.Would you need to put together an RFP?  If so, would you need one national RFP or many localized RFP's?
