Richard:
Two questions that I could use answers for ASAP- 
1.  Approximately how many physical EES customers did we have in Mass prior to this summer (before the financial to physical switch took place)?
2.  When did the financial to physical switching start approximately - May? June?  Did anyone track which customers these were?

Thanks.

Heather
