Sandy:

I'm still very concerned about the NJ aspect of things - I was under the im=
pression we are not going physical until 2003 in NJ.  Rebecca - can you con=
firm this for me?  If we are indeed continuing onward with this direct mark=
eting campaign (and it is for a physical product) is everyone on the busine=
ss side (back office) in on the loop?

Otherwise, I will take a look at ME - Richard - I presume the cost again ca=
me from the same type of calculations that you threw together for Mass?  Sa=
ndy - what changes should I make to our current label overall (not necessar=
ily for the Direct Mini) based upon your research that still apply to our c=
urrent customers?

Heather --

Attached for your review are two new disclosure labels that we're working w=
ith Sarah Dietrich to prepare for the ME and NJ direct mini forms (same pro=
duct that we discussed several weeks ago for MA...direct marketing campaign=
 of fixed price, physical product).

The NJ label was adapted from Exhibit C of the NJBPU's posted Environmental=
 Standards http://www.bpu.state.nj.us/wwwroot/energy/envi.PDF using emissio=
ns and resource data from system power.  Please review and run it by your c=
ommercial team as well.

The ME label is adapted from the version you forwarded to me on Friday.  As=
 this is a fixed price product, similar changes were made to the language u=
nder "Generation Price" as were made in MA.  As this product does not have =
the excess and deficiency usage bands, EESI is not required to list languag=
e from the Maine Rules that explains price variability (as is the case in w=
ith the label you are currently using).  I've placed the product name in th=
e title of the label so that you will be able to differentiate it from the =
other product(s).  The only other changes I made were (i) removal of the tr=
iangles under "Air Emissions" that appear to be a carry-over from the MA la=
bel; the unit specific symbols are not required on the ME label; (ii) the f=
ootnote for "Power Sources" has been moved from the bottom of the page to d=
irectly under the power sources table; and (iii) removal of the bracket on =
the second page under "Power Sources".  Please review and let me know if yo=
u have any questions or comments about the changes I've made.  Also, please=
 confirm that the data reflected (for example, the 5.08 cents under avg pri=
ce per kWh) is current.

Thanks for your help.
SC
