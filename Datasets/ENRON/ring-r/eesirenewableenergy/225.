There is always something around here!!!!!  Isn't there anyway to keep the product?
The last thing we are doing is sending a letter.

Hi Peggy:

This group met this afternoon to discuss a number of issues related to California retail disclosure; most importantly, the issue of the discontinuation of our BizMix product offer was discussed.

You will recall that we notified our CA C&I customers late last year that all were receiving BizMix (Including the EEMC customers which we acquired in 6/00) and that in conjunction with our providing this product, we would be making claims for credits through the CEC Subaccount Program.  Since that time, we have apparently sent all of our customers back to their respective utilities, and we now understand that we be switching all of these customers back to Enron service in the near term, but that BizMix will no longer be offered upon their return to Enron physical service.

It is our recommendation that we notify these customers that given the current circumstances in CA, upon their return to Enron service, we will no longer be able to offer BizMix and that they will instead receive system mix from us on a going forward basis.  I think it is important to note that because the offer of BizMix involved a "claim" through which we received Subaccount credit moneys, it is imperative that we somehow communicate to our customers that we are no longer able to provide this product given the current situation in CA.  

We ask for your thoughts (pro and con) regarding the issue of notifying these customers regarding this matter, and also ask for suggestions as to how to best communicate this message to the customers (e.g. bill stuffer, separate mailing, etc.)  

Hope all's well.  Thanks in advance for your input.

Marianne
