Richard Ring can fill you in on the details, but you guys are switching some MA customers from finicial to physical.

I know nothing about this.  Our MA customers get a label with their K.  Let me know if there issues here that I need to consider.

Heather:
 
Frank Rishe, Government Affairs for MA, got a call from EES origination regarding your switching customers to physical delivery and disclosure requirements.  You'll most likely be getting a call as we let them know you handle the logistics for disclosure.  It would be helpful, though, to get a brief update on the status of MA customers and the disclosure label.  I'm assuming that the customers being switch to physical delivery already have a label with their contract, and are on the list to receive a quarterly label.  Is this correct?  
 
Also, I have a copy of the label that was for 9/1/00 to 5/31/04.  Is this the latest label?   Thanks so much for your help.
