Below is the general description that I use.  
 
Power has two components: the electrons and the attributes associated with generating these electrons (e.g.  fuel type and emissions).  A REC represents all of the attributes associated with generating renewable power.  RECs can either be bundled with the actual electrons or sold separately.

Do you have a good generic description of RECs?
