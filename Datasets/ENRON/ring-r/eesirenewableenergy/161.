It's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.

First - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).

Second - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.

Thanks.

Heather
