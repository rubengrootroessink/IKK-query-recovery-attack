Richard and Lamar:

Fetzer e-mailed me recently and wants to begin discussions on extending
their fixed price renewable power deal with us.

Their current fixed price expires in 5/02 with and index price going out to
2009.

If this is below your radar, Lamar I would be happy to work it with the
customer and Richard on the renewable energy side.
