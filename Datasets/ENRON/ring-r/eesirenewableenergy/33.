All - 
 
You should all now have access to a shared folder in the O drive.  Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to.  
 
Check it out - 
 
O:\StateGovAffairs\Renewables
 
Let me know if you have any problems accessing this.
