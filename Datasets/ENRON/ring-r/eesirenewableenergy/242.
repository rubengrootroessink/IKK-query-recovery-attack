That is my understanding.  The new label has been forwarded to Jennifer Hillegonds, Marianne Castano, Heather Mathis and Sarah Dietrich.  They are working to make sure the correct label is distributed with the proper product.  Thanks for your help.  SC

I will make the assumption that the "Revised Disclosure Label" will be
attached to the appropriate MA contract forms.

Subject:  new system power #s for MA disclosure label


I just received a call from Richard Ring with new system power #'s on the
MA label.  Sarah -- I think we've blown by your deadline to make changes,
but attached is the most recent form.  We also tweaked the emissions graph
to show the bar chart lines even with system power.

Jennifer -- I owe you a label for the mid-market physical product and will
get that to you shortly.
