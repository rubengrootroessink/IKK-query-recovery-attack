HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, is in talks to sell its wind turbine unit for more than $723 million, the Sunday Business newspaper in London reported, without citing sources. 
The negotiations may falter, inviting other bids, the newspaper said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer wouldn't comment on the report. 
Enron has said manufacturing might not be part of its future strategy, Palmer said. Enron Wind makes and operates wind-power turbines. Houston-based Enron bought the business, based in Tehachapi, Calif., in January 1997. 
"There is a tremendous potential for a wind or renewable energy market to develop," Palmer said. "We don't know that we need to be in the manufacturing business to participate in that." 
Credit Suisse First Boston is handling the sale, Sunday Business said. Private equity firms that may bid include Doughty Hanson & Co. and Candover Investments, both of Britain; Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Germany; and Nomura Securities Co. of Japan, the paper said. 
Possible industry buyers include Vestas Wind Systems and NEG Micon, both of Denmark; Gamesa of Spain; and Nordex and Enercon, both of Germany, the paper said. 
Last week, Enron Chief Executive and President Jeffrey K. Skilling abruptly resigned. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has taken over his duties.
