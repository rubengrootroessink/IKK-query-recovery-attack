Many thanks.   Want to discuss the contract language this morning?  I've got an 8:30, but should be back at my desk by 9:15.

Richard,

I forgot one conversion:  To convert from MT of CO2, multiply by 1.1.02 to get to tons of CO2.  (The trees planted and miles driven are based on tons of CO2.)

Also, Catherine McKalip-Thompson is working on a spreadsheet with several conversions that might be helpful to you.  It should be complete in the next day or so.  While it might be too late for the letter going out this week, it may be useful to keep in your files for future reference.

Thanks,
Heather

Richard,

The California CO2 emissions factor is 0.343 MT CO2/MWh.  The source is below.  As I mentioned during our phone call, there is some debate over the appropriate emissions factor to use, given emission differences between peak/off-peak utility generation vs. purchases, etc.  However, most groups accept state level emissions factors as the best available.  Also, it is my understanding that the emissions factors are supposed to be revised sometime during 2000.  However, I haven't seen any announcements regarding the release of new numbers, nor did I see mention of it on the DOE Voluntary Reporting website.

 

I found a page on the Green Mountain web site that has conversions for trees planted and miles driven.  While it does not list a source for the conversions, I did notice that the numbers are the same as the ones used by the Environmental Law and Policy Center.  I will bring a copy of both by your desk.  Let me know if I can help with anything else.  FYI, in the past I've been a little hesitant to express GHG savings in terms of number of trees planted because of the difficulties involved in measuring the carbon absorbed by trees.
