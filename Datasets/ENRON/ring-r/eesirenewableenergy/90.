Kay,

To the extent that "green" power is invoiced and/or credited by the Utility via a Utility Invoice Credit, Enron Energy Services, Inc. should be entitled to such credit so as to avoid Enron Energy Services, Inc. providing more Renewable Energy than provided for in the Agreement (100% of energy requirements, up to the Anticipated Usage for each Account).  Enron Energy Services, Inc.'s obligation cannot be increased via any Utility Invoice.

Let me know if you would like to discuss the response to Kinko's comment regarding "green" power credits.

Regards,

Richard

I have to provide Kinko's a written response to their 4 page contractual comments document. Can one of you draft a response to their comment below? I have said we cannot accomodate this language and need a reason why from one of you guys.
Thanks
Kay

2.8 Last few sentences
Change "(including, without limitation 'green' power)" to "(excluding, without limitation 'green' power)". Does not make sense that Enron would charge Kinko's a premium for renewable power, and then keep any potential invoice credits that arise from our decision to purchase renewable power.
