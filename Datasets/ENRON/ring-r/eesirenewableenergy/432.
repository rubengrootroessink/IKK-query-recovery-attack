Richard - Here is a dial-in number for Friday. I will send you an agenda for the meeting on Thursday and you can decide what you'd like to participate in.

I just called Edgefield and arranged for a speaker phone to be put in our room.  
 
If Richard wanted to call in, he should dial: (503) 669-8610 - the main number, and ask to be connected to the "Study" meeting room.
 
Also, were you planning on using powerpoint presentations or any other audio/visual?
