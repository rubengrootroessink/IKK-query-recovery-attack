This place looks like it has just the right combination of location (8,000 feet, 1 hour from DIA in Evergreen), practical meeting space, a restaurant nearby, and reasonably affordable. I suggest we go for it. The biggest question is the best time to go. Does that Nov 7-9 timetable work for everyone?
