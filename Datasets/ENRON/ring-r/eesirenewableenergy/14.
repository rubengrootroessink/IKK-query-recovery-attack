Hi Richard,

I am emailing you a spreadsheet that summarizes the generation information that we have recorded for the Monthly Performance Reports that listed generation produced in 2000. The spreadsheet that has the information is titled "Facility Breakdown". Please feel free to call or email me if you have any questions regarding the data. 

If your records do not match the information provided, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resolve the discrepancy. Thank you for your time and assistance.
