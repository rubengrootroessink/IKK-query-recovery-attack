Hi Richard, 
I know this is an old question, but someone had asked if the utilities in Massachusetts were sending out Environmental Labels to the customers we supply energy to.  I confirmed with all three utilities and this is not the case, so we need to be sending those labels out.  John Milton at NSTAR said that they might be willing to work with us on this and maybe do a mailstuffer for us if we provide the labels; his phone number is 781-441-3499.  No one offered any help at the other utilities.

Alex
