After speaking with Chris Boster, it was noted that we can not pass the imbalance charges back to riverside.  

I will be working with Jim Reyes to find out what charges/revenue EPMI is invoicing EES.  Richard, I will let  you know as soon as I find out the details on the amount of time it's going to take to pull those numbers out  of our total ancillary services invoice.
