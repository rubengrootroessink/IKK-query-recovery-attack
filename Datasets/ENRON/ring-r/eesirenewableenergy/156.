Please call if you have any questions.  I would like to know what everyone wants to accomplish by this meeting.  I know that Richard and Elliot have constructed some "Renewable language" in a contract we are currently working.  We will bring the pricing with the $6.00 adder that Richard has suggested that we use for the power.
