I just received a call from Richard Ring with new system power #'s on the MA label.  Sarah -- I think we've blown by your deadline to make changes, but attached is the most recent form.  We also tweaked the emissions graph to show the bar chart lines even with system power.

Jennifer -- I owe you a label for the mid-market physical product and will get that to you shortly.
