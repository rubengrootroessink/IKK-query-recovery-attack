Title: Aftermath: A Shift in the Environmental Strategy Landscape

***********************************************************************

ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY: NOT A TIME FOR SECOND-GUESSING

The events of September 11 are having a clear short-term impact on the pace of
environmental initiatives--at least in the United States. In the long run,
however, a shift toward greater recognition of the value of global
relationships has significant implications for the development of global
environmental strategies.

*  Environmental issues may be sidetracked but will not go into extended
hibernation.

*  The international response to terrorism will have some influence on the pace
of the Kyoto process.

*  Security concerns will continue to elevate the profile of renewable energy.
