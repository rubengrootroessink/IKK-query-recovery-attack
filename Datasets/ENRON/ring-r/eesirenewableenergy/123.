Richard,

Afer checking the last report was for two months June and July.  The 4,407
was not kWh but is Dollars instead.  Sorry for the confusion.

Regards,
Michael

Michael,

It looks like there may be some problem with the Fetzer Vineyards
Greenpower Consumption Report.  You may want to review the report and
determine what is wrong.  Reportable Consumption is 352,536 kWh's and Total
Consumption is 4,407 kWh's.  Total Consumption should be more than
Reportable Consumption.

Also there is no consumption for the month of June 2001.

I can be reached at 713.853.3561.

Regards,

Richard
