John:

I thought it might be helpful to expound on several important principles th=
at we have learned through experience regarding RPS/disclosure.   I've been=
 working on these issues for about 2 years, and they have a long and often =
complex history.  After you've had a chance to digest the below, I'm glad t=
o help out in our response.
1. RPS and disclosure requirements need to be developed together.  Further,=
 since environmental disclosure is a requirement in 14 states and RPS in 7 =
states, it's important that we don't have overlapping, redundant requiremen=
ts on a national level.  This can ultimately add to the customer's bill bec=
ause of the administrative cost to comply with these requirements.
2.  For disclosure, the label calculation (how you derive the fuel mix) is =
the most crucial. Suppliers need the following:=20
=09a. the ability to project what they will deliver to customers over a spe=
cified "settlement period" (we greatly prefer annually) if they are differe=
ntiating their products (either with bilateral contracts or claims about th=
e environmental benefits of the product). Otherwise, suppliers would submit=
 a label with the default mix for spot market purchases.  (As Kevin pointed=
 out below, this allows flexibility in determining how the products will be=
 sourced -- either through bilaterals, spot and/or renewable energy certifi=
cate (REC) purchases).
=09b. For suppliers purchasing from the spot market, there needs to be defa=
ult fuel mix data provided to suppliers.
=09c. After a calendar year, suppliers would provide customers with an annu=
al label based on actual fuel purchases  ("historic label") for differentia=
ted products (including REC purchases and bilaterals). For system mix produ=
cts, the projections and historical would be the same. The latter has worke=
d well for EES.
=09d. There needs to be a lag in-between the timing of label distribution f=
or projections and historic label for the product claim. This will allow an=
y necessary true up between unanticipated customer usage and the amount of =
power purchased for the customer.=20
3. For RPS and disclosure:  It is extremely important that any national RPS=
/disclosure requirement be developed with a certificate trading program.  A=
 certificate is usually defined as one MWh of renewable energy that has bee=
n generated, and represents the attributes or environmental benefits of the=
 generation separate from the underlying power.  This should be a tradable =
instrument separate from the power.  Renewable energy certificates "RECs" c=
an be bought sold, traded separately from power, and allows vital flexibili=
ty to get renewables to regions of the country where the supply might be co=
nstrained or where renewables such as wind and solar are not conducive to b=
eing sited.  RECs also provide verification for the purchase of power attri=
butes for RPS and disclosure. As Christi was stating below, it is impossibl=
e with our sophisticated wholesale markets to track all electrons from gene=
ration to end use consumption.  The beauty of certificate trading programs =
is that they create a secondary market by which the attributes of power can=
 be tracked through various trades. Certificates trading programs are not a=
lways limited to renewable energy.  In New England, they are developing a f=
ull certificates based system by which all generation would be issued certi=
ficates.  This helps support the disclosure requirements in the East.

Stacey et al,

I thought you should see Presto's comments on the Bingaman energy legislati=
on as it relates to environmental disclosure and renewable issues. If you h=
ave additional questions, you might want to follow up with Christi Nicolay =
or Susan Lindberg.

Subject:=09Kevin Presto comments on the summary of Bingaman bill

John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, "NERC should b=
e eliminated."

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the "=
uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known ene=
rgy sources" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements =
for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose h=
ow to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an a=
head basis or purchases in the spot market. =20

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill m=
ay alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  S=
everal years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clea=
n energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller o=
f clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean cre=
dits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generat=
or was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount o=
f credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a c=
lean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, =
portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don=
't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron=
 experts on this (used to be Janel G.)  Thanks.
