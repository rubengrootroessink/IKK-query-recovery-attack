Glad you got that stuff off to Elliot.  There's another huge reorg happenin=
g in EES that will affect Ozzy's group (reorg in EES...no).  Might want to =
feel out Dave for info if you haven't already.  Lianne is moving to structu=
ring under Sean Holmes, so the env. product offering is likely being taken =
up under Blackman's group (will work closely with origination).  The strate=
gy is changing to have product offerings that can be presented to customers=
 during the deal process (hum....sounds like this should have been in play =
all along).  Thus having a premium clean product line will be ideal to get =
before the product development folks.  Jay Lewis will be over commodity pro=
duct offerings most likely, and Ken Gufsaston will be over integrated commo=
dity offerings (not sure what that means).  Lianne said that Constantine ("=
Dino") Damaskus, chris Wismann and Tom Adams will be good folks for us to f=
ollow up with on the environmental product end to include EECs.  It will al=
so be good for Elliot to make sure these folks know of the Green Power Alli=
ance and Green offerings.  She recommended waiting until mid-August until s=
ome of the reorg shakes out.

Richard, have you gathered any further intelligence?

Elliott,

I apologize for sending this at the last minute, but wanted to see if you m=
ight be able to incorporate some information regarding the Energy Efficienc=
y Credits Program Stacey and I have been working on in PA into your present=
ation for next week's Green Power meeting.  I have attached the latest draf=
t (there are some minor changes that are not reflected) of the program prop=
osal which we hope to have approved by the Green-e Board in September, and =
three power point slides.  I think we're made real headway in PA, and we ho=
pe to use this as a template for other states.  Please call Stacey or me if=
 you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heather
