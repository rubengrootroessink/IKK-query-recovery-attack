Richard, I spoke with Chris Boster(EPMI) and Jim Reyes, they agreed that  we are schedulling the Riverside Generation.  However, we are not passing the charges back to them for not meeting their obligation.  If you would please give me a call so that I may further discuss this matter with you.

Thanks,

Pam
