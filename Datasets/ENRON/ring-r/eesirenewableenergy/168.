My understanding is that we used to have investments.  I don't think this group still exists.  I believe this is back when we had Solarex.  The only investment that I'm aware of is the Fuel Cell Energy investment.

Stacey,

What, if anything do you know about Enron's investment in twelve (12) different alternative energy companies?

Richard

Hello, Richard:

We met a couple of months ago.   I was working with Bill Hatch in Boston, MA; I am now with the Product Management group in Houston.  I was wondering if there are any new developments regarding Enron-Renewable Energy ventures.  I read that Enron has invested in 12 different alternative energy companies (which was news to me).

Hope that you are well.

Kind regards / Krista Kisch
