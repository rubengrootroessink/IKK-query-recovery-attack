If I remember correctly, the volumes were equivalent to something like .5MW. Sort of off our radar screen, and now that EPMI no longer has its TX tag position, hard to believe that we'd be the low-cost bid. Have you come across anything on the supply side in NV? Jesse, can you check once again with Foster and see if any of his Cali biomass guys have NV positions?

Elliot,

What are your thoughts?  From the wholesale perspective do we have anything to offer to EPA?

Richard

Kay,

I was informed that EESI is no longer interested in doing "any" deals that involve the Federal Government.  Do you have any insight?

Regards,

Richard

Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9
thanks
Kq
