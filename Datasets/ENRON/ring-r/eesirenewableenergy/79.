Hey Stac.  The dial in number for your conf. call is 800.998.2462.  PIN is 5478626.  Don't forget to press the pound key after entering the PIN number. 
  
We have rectified the problem and I am the process of getting us credited for the calls you were not able to log on to.  If anything else is needed, please let me know.
