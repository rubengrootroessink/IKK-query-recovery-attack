All - I heard that National Grid is actively lobbying the Governor against =
signing the implementation of the RPS, (based on the universal applicabilit=
y to utilities) scheduled to begin in '03.  The legislature passed the RPS =
as part of the restructuring package, and it went to the Division of Energy=
 Resources for implementation.  Many of you recall that we served on the ad=
visory committee to the DOER and were actively involved with the draft reg =
to ensure fair implementation.  The RPS regs as they were drafted by the ad=
visory committee are currently before the Governor Swift's staff for evalua=
tion.  The RPS requirement as defined in statute is placed on all retail se=
llers according to the following percentages of sales: 1% by 12/31/03; an a=
dditional .5% of sales each year thereafter until 12/31/09; and an add'l .5=
% of sales for every year thereafter until a date TBD by the Division of En=
ergy Resources from new renewable resources.  Unless there is legislation t=
o overturn the statute, the RPS will go forward.  However, the implementati=
on regs might be delayed.

I'll keep you posted as to the outcome.
