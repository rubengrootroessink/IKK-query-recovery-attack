Yes they do - the auto reminder system sends this particular message for every label, for instance, California as well.  I'm working on changing & updating certain aspects of it to indicate different types of labels.

Heather,

Doesn't the utilities (First Energy) supply the information for the labels and/or actually supply the labels for the MSG Customers?
