Welcome to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission's Online News

Background - The Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition is hosting a
press conference today at Philadelphia City Hall to announce the near

will provide power to Pennsylvania homes by this fall. The 10 turbines
will generate enough power for approximately 5,700 homes a year.
