Can you please verify this statement will still apply for the next round of labels for Columbus Southern?

Thanks.

Heather,

EESI only deliveres physical energy to customers in Ohio behind "First Energy" and only through the "MSG" program.  There should be no difference between the "projected" and "actual" labels for Columbus Southern.

Regards,

Richard

June 1 is fast approaching, and as I understand it, we are responsible for providing actual versus projected label information in the state of Ohio.  I know that the projected labels have been completed, and now I must gather the actual information for first quarter of 2001.  It is my understanding that FE/MSG will be providing us this information on actuals for the customers we have there, but who provides the info for Columbus Southern?  If I am incorrect in any of these assumptions, please let me know.  Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Heather
