Wanted to give you a heads up that there is a strong likelihood that CA will enact an RPS, requiring retail providers to include up to 10% of NEW renewable resources to customers.  The proposed RPS begins on 6/1/2003 and ramps up over the following 7 years.  By 2010, the requirement will be 10 percent.  Since EES is currently signing on customers in California, this might effect the length of contract you want to offer (i.e. limiting contracts to 3 to 5 years would mitigate your potential exposure). 
 
Please pass this along to Rogers et. al. so you guys can let the folks out in the field know.
 
Thanks.
