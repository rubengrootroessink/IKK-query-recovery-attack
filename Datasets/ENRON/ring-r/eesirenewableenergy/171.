Richard:

My contacts at Patagonia are:

Rich Costello 805-667-4653  (facilities)
Christie Kelley 805-667-4692 (director of retail)
Jil Zilligen 085-667-8616 (VP of environmental programs)

I have worked mostly with Christie and Rich on operational and budget issues.  

I have met with Jil once.  Her attitude seemed to be haven't we already taken care of electricity.
