Hello again.  Based upon our outside counsel's interpretation below and what Richard did last time, this needs to be a historical price, based upon what we've done in the past.  Is this now an operational issue?  Someone will have to help me with this, as I have no idea.  Basically, I need to get an price per kWh for the various classifications on the label that Enron charged for the past month/quarter.  There seems to be some room for estimation however.  Whoever's role this falls under can e-mail me or call me at x39006 for more information.

By quickly wading back through the regs (a bit murky), my understanding is that the average price reported on the disclosure labels is historical, although an estimate can be used (is that what you meant by projected, or were you thinking of the price going forward?).

Specifically:

In MA, the regulation requires that CRES Providers report an average unit price in cents per kWh for "service tied to spot or other variable prices that would have been charged in the last month of the prior quarter".  See 220 CMR 11.06(2)(1)(a)(c)  Although the price looks back to the last month of the prior quarter, the "would have been charged" language suggests that an estimate can be used.

In ME, "service based on spot or other variable prices shall be shown based on the average prices that would have been charged in the prior month"  also reported on an average unit price in cents per kWh. See MPUC 65-407-306(2)(a)(iii).  Note that ME uses the same "would have been charged" language.

Hope that helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello all.  I need some help on this matter ASAP, as I must have the Maine label
updated by August 30th and the Mass label updated by September 7th.

Richard - in the past, I believe you had used historical information to come up
with this number.  Is this to be historical price per kWh information?  If so,
perhaps it is an Operational issue afterall.  I've included Sandy Cofer, our
outside counsel who assists with this project.  Sandy - do you know if it is
historical or projected?

I appreciate anyone's assistance in this matter.

Thanks.

This is not an Operational issue.  This should be determined by the "Product
Development" department.   Michelle Juden should be able to assist you with the
correct person.

Hope this helps, Richard

Subject:  Maine and Massachusetts Price per kWh Information

Richard:

Richard Ring suggested that I contact you to try to determine some information
that is required on our Disclosure Labels to customers and the PUCs in
Massachusetts and Maine.  Please see below a sample label in Maine.  You will
note the "Generation Price" section requires Price per kWh information for
various usage levels.  Richard has in the past thrown together some numbers - he
can explain how to you in further detail.  However, we believe there is a better
way and that you can assist.

There will be two different types of labels in both states, dependent upon the
customer size (a Mid Size contract vs. a Mini contract).  If you are indeed the
person who can help me determine this type of information, I will send you the
various labels for your assistance.

These labels are required to be sent out with the initial contract and every
quarter.  My next quarterly label deadline for both states is the end of
September, but I would like to get the current rate on file for the labels we
send out with the contracts.

Thank you.
