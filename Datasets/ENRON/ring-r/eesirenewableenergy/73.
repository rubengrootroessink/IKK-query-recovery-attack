Bill,

What I would propose that EESI pitch to Starbucks would be that EESI could provide "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in their own backyard, the Pacific Northwest.  EESI could offer 100% "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in the Pacific Northwest at a price of es at a price of approximately $9.00/MWh to $9.50/MWh.  In the event that Starbucks is willing to accept "renewable resources" sourced from wind generatiing facilities located in the State of Texas for some portion or all of its load the price could be as much as $1.00/MWh to $2.00/MWh lower than the approximate price indicated above.  

In lieu of the above suggested scenarios if EESI could determine Starbucks desired target for "renewable attributes" (price per MWh), EESI could offer pricing which takes into account some blend of wind generating facilities and biomass generating facities and/or some other generation sources which qualify as renewable. in order to meet Starbuck's target.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Regards,

Richard

Dick,

Unfortunately this is in the preliminary stages and I don't have a good handle on this deal yet (especially given q3 rush), but I know each store uses about 120,000 kWh per annum.  Based on some really rough calcs, I have these annual estimates by state.

We are looking at 3, 5 and 7 year deals.

 

Of course, Origination would love to have green power for all the volumes, but that will depend on what the pricing turns out to be.

They also have a particular interest in green for TX.   Does Enron own any green power sources?

Bill,

Can you provide any information regarding total load, by state, assuming that Starbucks would want 100% renewable, and the approximate term of the proposed deal.

Dick,

As we discussed before, the Starbucks deal is discussing some green power options with the client.

As I understand the deal currently has sites in the following regions:

TX
MA
IL
NY
NJ


Can you give me an indication of the pricing of green power in these regions.

Also, let me know if there are any other issues surrounding green power that would be important.

Thanks,

B
