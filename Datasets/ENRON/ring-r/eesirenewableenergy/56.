	Aaron,

	Could you provide me with the monthly spend for both gas and
electric on this account.  I am assuming you have the gas spend.  We will
make a determination from there.  

	Dick ,

	I know you have been trying to reach me about the other renewable
opportunity we discussed a couple of weeks ago, however, I just don't have
the resources at this time to work that opportunity.  Please feel free to
work the opportunity with your contact in Portland.  I apologize for the
delayed response. 

	Aaron please get back to me with whatever information you may have
on Fetzer.

	Regards,

	Lamar

	Richard and Lamar:

	Fetzer e-mailed me recently and wants to begin discussions on
extending their fixed price renewable power deal with us.

	Their current fixed price expires in 5/02 with and index price going
out to 2009.

	If this is below your radar, Lamar I would be happy to work it with
the customer and Richard on the renewable energy side.
