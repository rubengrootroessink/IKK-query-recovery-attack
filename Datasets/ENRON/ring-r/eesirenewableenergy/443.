As you are likely  already aware, the Ohio environmental disclosure rules require that the  disclosure forms contain certain regional environmental information (in  addition to the supplier-specific information).  
 
Attached is a  Word document that conveys the regional environmental information which is  to be included in the environmental disclosure forms focusing on activities  during the year 2002.
 
Please feel  free to contact me if you have any questions concerning this data  or how it is to be utilized.
 
Thank  you.
