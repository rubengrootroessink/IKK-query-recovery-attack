Yikes....hope you are surviving!  You'll need coffee after this product lau=
nch.  Here's the lowdown w/ labels in TX.  Your 1st label will be a project=
ion or guestimation of what you anticipate delivering to customers.  I'd ge=
t w/ Richard Ring on the desk (under Rogers Herndon) to verify that you guy=
s will only be purchasing system mix.  You might already have done so.  On =
the fuel mix label (do you have a copy?....I'm attaching if you do not), re=
place the heading "Sources of power generation" with "Projected sources of =
power generation".  Same w/ emissions....replace "emissions and waste per k=
Wh generated" with "projected emissions and waste per kWh generated".  EES =
must then practice "due diligence" in its acquisition of power to ensure yo=
ur projection is as close as possible to your actual.  You will change to h=
istorical data on the label after one year (12/31/02).  You have some leewa=
y during the pilot as the final label calculation rule has not been adopted=
 yet -- though it is unlikely that these requirements will change.

I must get in one other plug.  You might seriously want to consider a green=
 product option.  In Texas, we have a system by which it is more cost-effec=
tive to purchase renewable power.  That is how entities such as Green Mount=
ain (label attached below) have been able to launch a 100% wind product.  R=
eliant (label attached below) is offering a 100% green product in TXU's ter=
ritory for only 1 cent more per kWH.  Reliant's offering is for residential=
 only.  EPMI and Enron Wind have 135 MW wind facility and you might want to=
 price a premium option for the smaller commodity customers from this facil=
ity or from the market in general. I am GLAD to hook you up with the intern=
al folks that can help you w/ purchases for renewable energy.  We're having=
 a meeting on Thursday from 12-3 to discuss renewable origination and tradi=
ng opportunities in EB 8c1 if you can tear away.  Lunch will be served.  Le=
t me know.
