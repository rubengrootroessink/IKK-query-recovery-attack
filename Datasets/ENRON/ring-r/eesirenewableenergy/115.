I thought the below would be meaningful for you all to see.  Has EWC set up a memorial fund for Nick?  I'd like to get back with Bob on where he can send condolences as well as our continued sponsorship of the NE Wind issues workshop.  I had encouraged Bob to touch base with Bob Gates, but also thought you guys might have suggestions.  I thought it might be a meaningful to provide EWC wind tags for the conference in Nick's honor as well.

Stacey - I am personally very saddened and shaken by Nick's demise.  I was
just starting to do a consulting job for Nick, and literally spent hours
crafting a scope of work, contracts, e-mails that I e-mailed to him
Wednesday, with the heading "I've been unable to reach you by phone, having
left a few messages over the past week, so let's try by e-mail."  To hear a
short time later that he had been on that plane.  Wow, that blew my mind.

But more importantly, Nick was a friend.  We had kayaked together on several
occasions, and had planned when I saw him last (8/30) over breakfast to meet
and kayak together as a regular thing.

He had told me at that time about having just dropped his son off for a
multi-week, back-country wilderness excursion in some remote canyon in the
Rockies (Utah?)... I don't know if his son even knows yet.  How awful.  Nick
lived near me, but I don't know of where his survivors are to be found (He
was divorced; I've met his brother, who lives in DC).  Are you aware of what
is being done in his memory, or where and to whom I could send a note of
condolence?

I am heading up the planning committee for  New England Regional Wind Power
Issues Workshop, to be held in Boston in late October.  Nick had volunteered
to speak, and offered Enron Wind to sponsor the event (which neither I nor
NREL, the organizer and primary event sponsor had yet followed up on).  As
Nick was involved in and supporting a number of regional wind development
efforts, and was well known in much of the local wind community, I think it
would be very appropriate to do something to honor his memory, associated
with the event (perhaps in connection with an Enron Wind sponsorship, if
they are still interested in doing so... I guess we'll have to bring it up
with Bob Gates?).  Your thoughts?


Regards,

Bob Grace

All -

I'm resending the below because I don't believe everyone received the
notification I sent on Monday.  In light of the tragic events of this
week, I think it would be better to wait until later next week to
organize a call.  I sincerely hope that all of your family, friends and
colleagues are accounted for.  Enron has suffered a great loss by losing
one of our Enron Wind directors, Nick Humber.  He was on the AA flight
from Boston.  I'm sure that many of you knew Nick or knew of him.

Best regards,
