SH informed me that beyond 3/01 there was no volumes reported for Lost Arrow.  Therefore, no need to break out that volume.  

Mary - as a double check, please contact Deb Weakley 1-877-737-1272 at CSC  to verify that Lost Arrow was de-DASR'd.  DASR means Direct Access Service Request which is the terminology used when signing up a customer.  Obviously, the de-DASR would mean when we cut them from direct access service.  

Thank you.
