Heather,

I am in receipt of a letter from you addressed to Richard Ring dated September 19, 2001.  Richard has asked me to verify the true-up calculation shown on the letter.  Therefore, will you please provide copies of the spreadsheets that show how you arrived at the calculation?  

Thank you very much.
