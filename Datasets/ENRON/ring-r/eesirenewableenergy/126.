Kay,
Thanks for this information. It will be useful. My our VP of Purchasing, my boss is going to Europe for 2.5 weeks starting next Wednesday. She has asked me to prepare a deck for our new CEO, a native Texan, on this deal. So, I'm now thinking we could get the deal done early October, and start getting services from Enron in November.

I will be forwarding comments on the terms on Friday.
Thanks again,
lr

Larry, got your voice mail and have attached several slides we use in presenting
our Texas products.
Please review these to see if they meet your needs internally. Due to the volume
of customers that are
locking in fixed rates due to the low gas prices, unfortunately I do not have
time to further search historical pricing.
I am also working on the refreshed proposals you need for 1 and 3 year terms. I
should have this tomorrow for you.
In addition your comment about your legal group having 'a number of comments on
our terms' does alarm me
due to the time and resources already expended on getting both our parties
comfortable with the risks. Please
let me know if we can just wrap this up with my manager and 1 legal person on a
conference call.
What is our new expected close date for this transaction?
Let me know.
Kay
