Hi Scott,

	As we discussed, I will be flying to London on Monday to spend some time in Enron's London office.  I am really looking forward to meeting you and the others I have corresponded with via email, phone, VC, etc.

	On yesterday Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I discussed my stay and London and the desire to make this trip a productive one.  Hence we came up with the following "wish list" of things I wish to accomplish while I am over there.


	If you think of any other important items to add to this list, please let me know.  After that, we can forward the list to the parties involved to find out if they will be available to meet with me during my stay in London.

Thanks,
Iris
