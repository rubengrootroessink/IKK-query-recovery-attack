Vince, I was just thinking about the subject project that you were trying to get off the ground (even though no commercial support existed!) that I worked on initially.  I know you were trying to get this done before I arrived and then followed my effort with at least one other person. I think the reason we could not complete a comprehensive project was we did not have the mandate from the CEO office to do it so that relevant commercial and functional entities can provide the required information.

Perhaps the reason there were no major thrust from the management was that most people knew the answer was going to be less than desirable.  However, such information would have correctly priced the risk (to the shareholder not its agents--the management) so that we could have better managed the $20 Billion or so company specific (taking systemic market down turn, including telecom exposure, out) market value that perished.  

Great intuition on your part in trying to get such a risk measurement tool implemented. I wonder if you were able to advance that project and I now wonder if Greg Whaley would be interested sponsoring it from his office.  I would love to be the 'commercial' lead interfacing with you to get such a project done now since it may help us with relevant (risk worthy) disclosure.
