Matt,

I am sending you as promised the PowerPoint presentations about different units
of the Research Group. As you know, the current plan is to transfer 4 meteorologists from
my group and 2 pure quants to the new company. I have no commitments from the pure
quant side at this point, so I cannot give you any specific names.
