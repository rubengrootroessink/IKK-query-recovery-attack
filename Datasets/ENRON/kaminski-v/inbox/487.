Today's focus: Extra secure

By Dave Kearns

Novell has announced some new biometric-related partners for
its Novell Modular Authentication Service, or NMAS. SAFLINK,
AuthenTec, Iridian Technologies, Biometricate and Precise
Biometrics have recently released technology to integrate their
products with NMAS.

NMAS allows you to specify different methods of authentication,
either singly or in any combination, with the possibility of
basing authorizations on the authentication method used. The
traditional Username/Password combination is supported, as well
as smart cards (or tokens), proximity cards, digital
certificates or biometrics.

The new partnerships announced are all in the biometric area,
covering iris-scans and fingerprints, adding to the already
large number of biometric-security vendors supporting NMAS.
Vendors and their products include:

* AuthenTec - AuthenTec's FingerLoc and Entr?Pad fingerprint
  authentication products read fingerprints below the surface
  layer of the skin, resulting in more accurate acquisition and
  recognition rates.

* Biometricate - Biometricate's fingerprint authentication
  software will generate a complete audit trail of every
  authentication transaction. Whether the authentication attempt
  is a success or failure, a record is created incorporating
  details such as server and client IP addresses, date and time,
  and the user's logon credentials, including the finger that was
  used for the authentication.

* Iridian - Iris recognition from Iridian Technologies is based
  on the rich detail of the iris of the eye and scales to support
  millions of users.

* Precise Biometrics - Precise Biometrics' Precise 100 product
  family for fingerprint recognition has been on the market since
  1999.

All of these new partners function with NMAS via SAFLINK's
SAFmodule, which integrates a variety of biometric technologies
into the NMAS authentication infrastructure, including
fingerprint, voice, facial and iris recognition. SAFmodule also
provides specialized features such as support for user self-
enrollment, a biometric tutorial module and a disconnected
login capability for mobile users.

The partners join previously announced NMAS security
partnerships that include ActivCard, Applied Biometrics, Arcot
Systems, BioID, Biometric Access Corporation, Cherry
Corporation, Compaq, Entrust Technologies, Identix
Incorporated, RSA Security, SAFLINK, SecuGen, SmartTrust,
Systemneeds, VASCO, Veridicom and VisionSphere.

Authentication and authorization have gone way past simple
password control. Find out more about protecting your network

You may be very glad you did.
