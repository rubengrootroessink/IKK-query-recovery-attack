Hi

I've attached a couple of files summarizing our progress and current status on modeling the bid-ask spread.  The first summarizes characterization of the EOL Crude data and the second describes a bid-ask spread model based on options theory developed by Zimin (The figure from the paper is included separately).  I am now setting up an Excel spreadsheet to test this model with the EOL data.

Let me know when you would like to meet to review this.

Thanks, Bob Lee
