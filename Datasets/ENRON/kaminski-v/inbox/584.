Hi Jim:

Yes Vince is still planning on coming.  He probably will leave
Houston at 6:00 AM.  We have already rescheduled his project
review meeting from Thursday to tomorrow, so I know he still 
has it on his calendar.

Regards,

Shirley

Dear Shirley,

I thought it might not be a bad idea, in light of all the turmoil these 
days at Enron, to doublecheck one last time to make sure that Vince is 
still on for this Thursday and Friday.  I am planning on meeting him at at 
around 10 a.m. in my office on Thursday.

Thanks,

Jim Garven
