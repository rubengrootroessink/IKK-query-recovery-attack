Michael,

To follow up on my first message, I want to inform you that I decided
to appear before the SEC investigators without a legal counsel. I simply feel
that your highly competent help is not required in my case.

I want to thank you for the time you spent with me on Wednesday.
My only regret is that I shall have no opportunity to spend more time
with you and learn from your experience.


Vince

Michael Levy will be out of the office on business until on or about January 22, 2002.  He will have some limited access to e-mails and will respond as quickly as he can.  In addition, please feel free to contact his secretary, Megan Morgan, at (202) 295-8416, if you need to reach him immediately.  You may also leave him a voicemail at (202) 295-8414, and he will get back to you as soon as he can.
Thanks.
