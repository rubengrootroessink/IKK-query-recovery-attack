Hi, Vince,

This is Slav Fain - Oracle DBA  and I hope you
remember me. We've met at the infosession in Berkley
and have talked about Houston, rotation program or
other possible openings Enron might have.

Today I've saw an add for the Junior DBA position in
Houston and I was wondering  if it might be in your
company. I beleive I told you, that I'm pretty open
for different position. I was doing a lot of
development projects in Berkley and enjoyed it. I've
also found DBA work also very challenging and
rewarding. I would be very intersted in joining the
rotation program to see different possibilities and
aspects of IT department.

I'm opening for relocation and I think with knowledge,
experience and my enthusiasm to learn and ability to
work under tight timeline - I think I can be a good
match for Enron.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Slav
