I am pleased to announce that the GARP 2002  Convention, which will be held in New York on 12 and 13 February 2002, will be  held at The Roosevelt Hotel.
 
The hotel is situated at:
 
Madison Avenue at 45th Street
New York
NY 10017
Tel: 212 661 9600www.theroosevelthotel.com 
 
I am sorry for any delay in informing you, but  we have only just managed to finalise the details and locate a venue that could  hold the GARP Convention.
 
I will of course be in touch again in the near  future concerning logistical matters, as well as sending you copies of the  printed brochure.
 
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me. I look forward to meeting  you in New York next year.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
