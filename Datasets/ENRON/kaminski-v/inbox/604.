Gwyn,

As we discussed earlier, there are no firm due dates  set for  asset models mentioned in my curve request. I discussed the timeframe with Andre again and we agreed that our best estimate would be that we should have all models by end of this month.

Thanks again for working with us on a rather "vague deadline"!
