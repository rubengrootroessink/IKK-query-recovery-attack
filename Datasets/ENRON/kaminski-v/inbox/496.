Vince,

You had asked if there was an English language description of the regulatory changes that have taken place since rationing.  I seem to recall reading something in a wall-street analysis, but I can't find anything in my files.  I asked one of our analysts to take a look, but so far he's come up empty.  I'll keep trying.

It was really good to have you down here; everybody was happy to have your attention for a couple of days, and I think that we identified some promissing areas of collaboration.  I look forward to staying in touch.
