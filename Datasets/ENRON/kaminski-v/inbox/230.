Vince, based on the email below, it looks as if the curve demand for June-July could be heavy, based on the extensive review of international assets taking place in August.  FYI --- Gwyn

Gwyn,

Did you receive my voice mail message regarding the monthly request for updates to the curves for the Brazil office?  I feel this should stand as a recurring monthly request as long as they hold the positions which must be revalued each month.  If I recall correctly, they need:
	FX
			IGP-M
			CPI (include monthly data)
			PPI  Finished Goods  (include monthly data)
			PPI Industrial Commodities  (include monthly data)

What is your status on the preparation of these curves?  We will be revaluing assets extensively for the next BOD meeting (August) so I will prepare a list of curves needed for the next several months.

Please let me know about the curves for Riccardo.  Thanks again!

Cindy
