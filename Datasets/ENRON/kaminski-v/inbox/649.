Vince,

I am attachings the revised Employment Agreement forms for Mike, Vasant, and Krishna so that you can review the numbers with Whalley.  Please just let me know when you are ready to pull the trigger or if any changes need to be made.  Additionally, I am attaching the final ratings for all of your people.  Some people have NR by their names, but that is only because they have not been here long enough to be reviewed.  If you need any additional info from me, please let me know.  Thanks.
