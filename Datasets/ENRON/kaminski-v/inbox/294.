Best,

John,

Great to hear from you and thanks for the article.  Did you send it to Vince?

By the way, Vince has signed on for the July 27th class in Dallas so we can
all three get together and hopefully I can make some progress on getting a
paper underway by the three of us.

I'll get you more info as the time nears but it's shaping up like a great day.

John
