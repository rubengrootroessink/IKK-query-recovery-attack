Dear Vince,

Sorry to bother you again, but I would need the report on the paper "Let's
swing again (pricing non-storable commodity options)".

I have received the report from the other referee some time ago and I cannot
send it to the authors if I do not receive yours too. The authors are
continuously contacting me asking for the reports.

Please let me know when it is possible for you to complete it.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Best regards,

Paolo
