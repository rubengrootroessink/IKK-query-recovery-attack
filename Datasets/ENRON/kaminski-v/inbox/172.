 Hi Vince,

        My name is Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon, I forwarded you the emails from Dr. Kloucek a few weeks ago.  I know that you must be very busy, but I was wondering if you would have time to meet with me sometime, perhaps over lunch.  See, I graduated from Rice (majored in Applied Math) a couple of years ago, and I am considering a PhD in Financial Math. I would like to work in idustry afterwards, not academia.  But I am wondering what type of jobs there are for people like that in companies like Enron, and I figured you would be a good person to ask.  So if you find yourself with a little free time I would be very grateful to be able to ask you a few questions.

Thanks!

 Maria Teresa
