I'm already having lunch with a few of the guys, but I would love to take
you and Shirley out for dinner.  I'm flying in Saturday morning, and
leaving after lunch on Wednesday.  I'm free just about every night but
Monday.

I'll be happy to check.  Great to hear from you.  If you are available
for dinner, I'll try to get some of your friends together.

     Hey.  I'm going to be in town next week, and was wondering if Vince
would like to do lunch on Wednesday October 3rd.  Could you check his
calendar and let me know if he is available?  Thanks.
