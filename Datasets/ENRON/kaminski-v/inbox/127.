To whom it may concern: 
I would appreciate if you could forward to the editors my formal complaint regarding 
the behavior of one of the reporters working for your organization. 
Complaint 
My name is Vince Kaminski and I was quoted by Ms. Kristen Hays in her 
article on Enron (the link is provided below). Her behavior represents in my view a 
violation of ethical standards that every journalist should observe. 
I did not talk to Ms. Hays. She did not ask me any questions. She 
might have been the lady sitting at my table at the luncheon and she 
may have overheard bits and pieces of conversation I had with my 
friend. I shall be glad to submit the name of a witness who was talking to me  
and sitting next to me through the entire meeting and who walked out with me from 
the building. 
I am not sure if an organization of your reputation can tolerate similar 
questionable practices of collecting information. Eavesdropping on a 
private conversation is not an acceptable behavior in a civilized 
society. If you would like to endorse such behavior, you should 
provide Ms. Hays with a hearing aid. Yahoo - Analyst: Enron Crash a 'Morality Tale'
