Vince,

I am attaching the most recent versions of the "business plan" relating to
the Energy Markets Institute (EMI)---this includes a detailed concept paper
with curriculum of the degree and specialized programs, a note on resource
requirements, the marketing plan, and the execution time-table. The EMI has
recently been established at the Bauer College, and we would like as soon as
possible to get together with crucial people in the industry and get
feedback and suggestions.  Our aim is to make this into a world class energy
education and research center as expeditiously as we can.  Your input and
help will be absolutely central to our efforts.  We are proposing to hold a
presentation and discussion session with key industry executives, and trying
to firm November 14 as a date for this meeting.  I will contact you soon
about your availability for this date.  Thank you.


Best regards,

Praveen
