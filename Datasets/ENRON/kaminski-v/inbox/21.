John, 
Let's meet at the hotel at  6:00 p.m. We can have dinner across the street from Galleria - I know a good  restaurant in this area. Stinson will join us for dinner. Please, confirm the  time to my Enron E-mail address as well (vince.j.kaminski@enron.com). My cell  phone number is 713 410 5396 in case I am running late or you have to contact  me.
