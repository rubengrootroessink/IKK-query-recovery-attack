Hi All,
The full requirement dispatch application version 0.9 is now available.
To install, copy all three files in O:\Research\Common\from_cs\fullReqDispatch\installation
into a directory and click setup and follow onscreen instructions.
The document will follow shortly.

A stochastic programming application that optimally trades power and operates a portfolio of generators to satisfy load commitment contracts, with uncertainties in power prices, fuel prices, and loads. Under transmission constraints, we can trade some amount of power with the market at bid-ask market prices. In this model, we also take into account the minimum up time and minimum downtime constraints as well as the startup costs.
