Dear Mr. Kaminski,

we met a few week ago in Houston (I was the previous speaker on
modifications of Black-Scholes). As I mentioned, there were in your
talk several issues in which I am interested in.
I would be happy if you could send whatever related material you have:
slides, papers, etc.
At some point you mentioned also the possibility of sending some
time series. It would be very interesting to have them and apply our
pricing model to compare results.
Thank you very much,
Pablo Padilla
