Gayle,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your message.

I will have the LDC projector and an overhead projector available.  I
suggest that Vince arrive around 10:30 -10:45 a.m. and I will plan to be at
the location to assist him.

The exact address is:  JPMorgan Chase Center, 601 Travis, 18th floor.

Parking is available in that building with entrances on Travis, Texas and
Capital.  The garage elevators bring you to the lobby level.  A Security
Guard Station is on the lobby level where check-in is required before
proceeding to the 18th floor lounge where the meeting will take place.  The
Security Guard will have Vince's name and will allow him access.

I can be reached that morning by cell phone at 832-752-6257.

Hope this is all the info needed, but if not, let me know.  See you on
Wednesday.

Regards,
mecoffey

Please give me a few hints:

   Please let me know what equipment you will need for your presentation,
   so it
   will be available in the room in advance.  The location has changed to
   the
   18th floor at the Chase Center. I'll forward the address.  All else
   remains
   the same. Thank you.

      Vince, NACM tells me all they need to approve CEUs is an outline, so
      that's
      all we need.

      Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press.
   Hopefully,
      this
      has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.
   The
      title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting
   notices.
      If
      you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this
   toward
      the
      attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have
   something
      to
      provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
      appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
      needed
      as soon as possible. Please advise.
      Thank you.

         Gayle,

         November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be
   leaving
         later
         that
         day for our annual  management conference in San Antonio (around
   3:30
         p.m.).
         My recollection is that the presentation is from11:30 till 1:00 so
   I
         should
         have plenty of time to get to the airport.

         Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall
      send
         you
         the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

         Shirley Crenshaw, my assistant, will send you my bio.

            Vince, I want to be sure the Houston Energy Group is still on
   your
            calendar
            for Wed, Nov 14.  The National Association of Credit Managers
      (NACM)
            main
            Houston office has asked if we could invite credit managers
   from
         other
            industries to attend your session.  I certainly would like to
   do
      so.

            Can you send me the title of your presentation to be included
   in
      the
            meeting
            notices?  It would also be helpful if you could send me a bio,
   so
         that I
            can
            introduce you Properly.
            Thank you very much.
