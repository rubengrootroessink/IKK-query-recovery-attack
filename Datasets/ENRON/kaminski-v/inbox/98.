Hello Vince--- Have a request for you. We're preparing our Annual End of Ye=
ar Issue this week and wanted to ask for your participation. The issue is a=
 sort of combo issue merging all of our publications (The Desk, The Risk De=
sk, New Power Exec and The Bandwidth Desk), and takes a look at trends, rev=
iew of the year in about 20 categories (tech, policy, VC stuff, market tren=
ds, credit, strategies, risk, book reviews, weather) and of course a look a=
head. Most of the submitted pieces we run are in the form of commentaries o=
n specific topics -- we're trying to stay away from the usual broad, mushy =
stuff you read about this time of the year -- translation, we're looking fo=
r a detailed view of things -- open with a short take on key bits that occu=
rred this year, how it may have altered the course of the market or a parti=
cular sector (why or why not with details) and finally what's ahead. The ge=
neral formula works well we've found; we expect the issue to be at least 40=
 pages this year. I'm sure you remember the drill from last year. Anyhow, b=
ack to you. What I'm looking for is this -- the fall of the Big E has certa=
inly put more focus on better risk management -- great, but what does that =
really mean? Consider some of the commentaries or interviews you're run in =
the past on the strategy/tactics side, and rethink the juicy bits. What hav=
e we (the traded markets, or retail for that matter) not yeat fully learned=
 or embraced? Do you think next year will see an altogether different power=
 market? Why or why not. Specific changes in your space? Each year for the =
past 5 years, there has been one big event that has seemingly changed the w=
ay we do or think about things. What will this year mean to 2002? Whether i=
n terms of systems, credit, ops, venture investment, risk management, marke=
ting, managing the book, whatever. The key in this, is detail and specifics=
. What's it going to take to get people to play smarter? Need about 1000 wo=
rds (more or less, your call), which you can probably do over cheerios in t=
he morning. The deadline is Dec. 18. We'll be spinning out the issue to abo=
ut 5,000 people, so the exposure should be very good for you--we'll include=
 contact names and numbers etc. If this is doable, please let me know asap.=
 Otherwise, hope you and the fam is well, hey -- don't be such a stranger f=
or Gods sake. Again, Dec. 18 deadline.
Best,
John
