Dear Speakers:

In preparation for the upcoming, above-mentioned conference; I am in the
process of compiling the conference course book material before it is sent
off to the printer.
At your earliest convenience, please email me a copy of the following:

Short one page biography
Written presentation for the course book
Audio visual equipment needs -- our on-site representatives do bring an LCD
projector to the conference.  All you need to do, is bring your respective
presentations loaded on your lap-tops and we'll run the presentations from
there.

Also, a kind reminder that the reservation cut off date at the Marriott West
Loop by The Galleria is October 5, 2001
Telephone number to hotel is: 1-(800)-613-3982
The special rate contracted by Infocast is $149.00 single or double
occupancy, excluding taxes, per night.
Please be sure to mention that you are attending the Infocast Gas Volatility
& Storage Valuation Conference to obtain the special rate offered to us.
If you have not made your reservation yet, please go ahead and do so, to
ensure that everyone receives our special rate!

Thank you very much for your kind understanding.  I do look forward to
receiving your materials.

Sincerely,

Luke Eleftheriou
