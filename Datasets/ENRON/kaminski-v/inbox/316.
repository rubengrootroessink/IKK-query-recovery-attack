Vince,

here is John's resume and a cover letter.
I have read the resume, and it looks impressive.
Let me know what you think.

Jason,
 
I enjoyed meeting you and Connie at Kate's loft gathering this weekend and very much appreciate the assistance.
 
Attached please find my resume and cover letter .  As I had mentioned, I am pursuing an opportunity in maintenance/operations in the cogeneration or power generation industry here in Houston.  My cover letter outlines my interests and abilities in greater detail.
 
If there's anything I can do for you, please ask.
 
Thank you, 
John
