Dear Faculty,

On Jan. 31, the new web-based faculty reporting system -- developed to
provide a mechanism for faculty members to file electronic annual reports to
the Dean while also updating their Jones School web pages -- will be
launched. This system will allow you and/or your staff assistants to 1) file
annual report to the Dean; 2) maintain individual faculty web pages; 3)
output entries into downloadable Rich Text Format, so that entries into the
system can be used to update CV's.

Although the system is designed for ease of use, you are invited to join
staff at the training session from 2:15 to 3:45 p.m., on Thursday, Jan. 31
in Rm. 101. Staff assistants will be trained to use the system in order to
provide you with assistance if you need it. The session will provide a
walkthrough about how to use the system, make, change, and save entries for
the annual report to the Dean.

Attached is a detailed user's manual in MS Word and Acrobat PDF for your
records. On Jan. 31, we will send you another e-mail with the site admin web
address and instructions to log in so that you may begin using the system.

Many thanks,
