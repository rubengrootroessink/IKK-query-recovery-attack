Dear Zimin,

Attached are a FEA Add-In Price list and a quote form for a subscription license of @ENERGY/Storage.

I spoke with Jeff Ford who will install the new version of @ENERGY2.2 on your network; he will contact you with the map to the drive for installation on your local machine. The license demo key for Storage will begin tomorrow.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Regards,
