Dear Vince
I know that you are always looking for good  prospective hires so I am brin=
ging this to your attention. Armando Ugarte who is  a former Ph.D. student =
of mine is currently working for i2 in Texas but told me  recently that he =
is considering a career move. Armando has a very interesting  background co=
mbining excellent training in economics and operations research  with exten=
sive practical experience in IT working as software architect and  applicat=
ion developer for HP, Oracle and i2. I know Armando for over 14 years  sinc=
e his undergraduate studies in our department and was always fascinated by =
 his broad spectrum of talents and experience. I am enclosing his resume. I=
 do  not exactly know what his immediate plans are and if he has already an=
other job  lined up. He told me ,however , that he would like to make bette=
r use of his  education. He took the job at i2 after deciding, for personal=
 reasons, to  repatriate from Colombia where he held a faculty position. I =
highly recommend  him as a hard worker, solid and mature researcher and a v=
ery likable person. If  you are interested you should contact him directly.=
 His contact info is on his  resume.
Regards, Shmuel.
