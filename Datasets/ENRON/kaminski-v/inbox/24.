Every move you make on your computer is being logged. From the Internet sites you visit, to the documents you open... you are being tracked. Even if you attempt to delete these tracks, Windows retains secret log files. Deleting Internet Caches and searching for history files would take hours of work manually.
Clean Drive deletes all these items from your computer... automatically, as often as you like!

No more worring about what people will see on your computer.
