Vince,
Attached you will find one or more quotes I have selected from your interview with me a few weeks ago, to be used to put together the Research Group profile or story.  In many cases the same point was made by more than one person.  The similar comments helped me decide what was important, but I selected just one version to include in the writing.  You may notice that I have edited your statements to reflect past tense and otherwise to improve the flow of the overall text.  My intention is not to change the meaning of what you said.
Please look the quotes over and let me know if these words can be used as they are written as part of the writing or if you want to change anything.  In either case, please let me know by email or by phone ((713) 871-8345 before January 30th).   
I have assembled a great description about your group using your collective words.  As of now, the sections include:
Beginning Efforts 
Maintaining Effectiveness in Client Services 
Guiding Principles of the Operations 
Leadership 
Personal Characteristics and Interpersonal Dynamics 
Reflective Thoughts at the End
Once I have approval from each of the 20 people who provided quotes, I will send an edited draft to Vince for his comments.  After that, I'll send the document to you for your comments.  Then I will focus on publication, although in the end, I expect that the document will have to be further pared to have a chance of being published.  
I still believe that the experience of the Research Group was extraordinary in itself.  At the same time, the current publicity related to the larger Enron debacle may override the Research Group's story for a while.   In case you're wondering, I have not attempted to relate the Research Group story to current Enron issues in any way.    
Thank you for your involvement,
Ann Thomas
