Dear Vince Kaminski,

This is to inform you of the release of @GLOBAL v5.0.3. FTP download
instructions are available immediately. The download instructions are
included at the end of this email. If you wish to receive a CD, please send
an email to info@fea.com. Please see below for more information regarding
this new release.

Here's an overview of the new and changed features since version 5.0.2.

Bug Fixes

A bug was fixed for window barrier options (@GLOBAL Barrier & Digitals). The
bug affected results when the window period starts at time zero, or has
already started, and different yields are specified over and outside the
window period.

Here's an overview of the new and changed features in version 5.0.2 since
5.0.1.

Bug Fixes

MCEQUITY_ASIAN and MCEQUITY_ASIAN_CLIQUET can now be evaluated on expiration
date. A bug was fixed in MCEQUITY_ASIAN_CLIQUET that affected valuation when
value_date was equal to the last averaging date of any reset period.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..

Regards,
Michelle Mendoza
