TheMarket for Lemons and the Price of Dishonesty=20
The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded thisyear to three economi=
sts: George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Spence,who made significan=
t contributions to modeling markets with information asymmetry.In many case=
s in a given market sellers or buyers may have exclusiveinformation that is=
 not available to the counter party. The best-known examplecomes from the [=
paper by Akerlof, The Market for "Lemons": QualityUncertainty and the Marke=
t Mechanism, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84,(1970), pages 488-500. =20
An owner of a used car can form a good idea of the qualityof his vehicle. H=
e has much better information if his car is a lemon. As bothgood and bad us=
ed car have to sell at the same price - it is impossible for anaverage buye=
r to distinguish between good and bad merchandise - they sellers ofgood use=
d cars are driven out of the market. Most traded used cars will belemons. O=
f course, there are ways to mitigate the problem: an owner of a goodused ca=
r may send signal to the buyer by offering him a guarantee or absorbingthe =
cost of inspection.=20
Hiring is a similardecision. As Michael Spence wrote in his paper Job Marke=
t Signaling,Quarterly Journal of Economics, 87, (1973), pages 355 - 374, to=
 hire somebodyis frequently to purchase a lottery ticket. The employer cann=
ot directlyobserve the productivity of a potential hire. "What he does obse=
rve is aplethora of personal data in the form of observable characteristics=
 andattributes of the individual, and it is these that must ultimately dete=
rminehis assessment of the lottery he is buying." The observable characteri=
stics of an individual may be immutable (raceand, generally, sex) but in so=
me cases certain attributes are alterable. A candidatecan modify such chara=
cteristics as education and job history. Some economistssay, tongue-in-chee=
k, that some candidates who attended top schools and spentmany painful hour=
s studying useless subjects signal their willingness to dowhatever it takes=
 to succeed. Another way to send a signal about one's qualityis to find a j=
ob with a top firm at the beginning of one's career and tosucceed in this f=
irm before moving on. This provides a useful lesson to anybodywho plans to =
be in the labor market at some points in his or her life: thereputation of =
the current employer is critical to future employmentopportunities and shou=
ld be defended at any cost. Honesty, at the end of theday, is an imperative=
 dictated as much by morality as by one's self interest. =20
