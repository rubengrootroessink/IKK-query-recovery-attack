Dear Zimin,

Please find attached a document explaining the three valuations of
@ENERGY/Storage and a document containing speed enhancement suggestions.  I
am working on an  optimal value/hedge example template now that I will send
to you once completed.  This will show the relationship between the optimal
value and hedge strategy.  I will talk with you soon.

Regards,
