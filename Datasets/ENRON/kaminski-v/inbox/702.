I'd stick to the Research and leave the puns to the professionals if I were you.  I've spoken to IQPC, and will soon receive all details of the conference.

Steve,

Thanks. Shirley will give you the details.

The travel agency messed up  and I am in Buenos Aires fighting hopelessly slow
network connection. Not a bad place in general, but it's early spring here (English
March). Don't laugh for me Argentina.

Hi Vince

Sorry I didn't get back to you regarding the conference, I've been out sick for over a week, and only got back to the office today.

Why don't you give me the details of the conference, and Matt Williams and I will see what we can do.


Cheers,
Steve
