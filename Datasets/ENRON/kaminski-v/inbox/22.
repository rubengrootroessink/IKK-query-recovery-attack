***********************************************************************

THE REVIVAL OF LNG IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

Recent developments confirm the revival of LNG in the Mediterranean. Will this
pace of activity be maintained? A brief assessment of key markets suggests that
there is a risk they will be oversupplied in the medium and longer-term. LNG
producers may need to look to alternative markets for the next generation of
supply contracts.

*  A rash of LNG contracts is fast filling up the Iberian market.

*  Pipeline supplies have cornered the bulk of the Turkish market.

*  LNG developers may now target the Italian market, although the obstacles for
LNG in Italy remain significant.
