Dr. Kaminski,
 
Richard, who I understand is a previous intern at  Enron in your group, suggested that I contact you. I'm Albert Demery and a 1st  year MBA at Haas. I am writing a term paper on real options pricing methods and  wanted to incorporate real-world examples (under a guise of anonymity, of  course) and was wondering if you would mind answering a few questions regarding  how Enron has tested, implemented and validated the methodology.
 
Thank you in advance for your  assistance,
 
Albert Demery
