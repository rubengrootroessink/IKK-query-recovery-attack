Shirley,
Thanks for the update.  While I am disappointed about the delay, I appreciate you and Vince staying on top of it for me and keeping me informed of what is happening.  I guess I will just have to wait my turn with the others going before the court and hope that I will eventually be paid.
I hope you and Vince have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year despite all that is going on around you at Enron.
Sincerely,
Deborah

Just an update.  I understand the check was entered into the system, but then has to go before the bankruptcy court for approval.
I think you will eventually get it, but there is no time frame.  They are paying the invoices to keep the company running first.  
 
I know you wanted this for Christmas and I really apologize for this, but I think you will get it sooner than later, hopefully.
 
Have a very Merry Christmas and I will keep you updated as I learn things.
 
Regards,
 
Shirley Crenshaw

 Shirley,
No, I have not received my check yet.  Thanks for checking.  And thanks to you and Vince for your efforts in staying on top of the invoice process to see that I am paid.  I really appreciate it.
