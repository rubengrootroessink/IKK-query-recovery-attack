Dear  Friends and Family:
=20
It  was Saturday morning at 5:30AM when I arrived at Tully Stadium, the sta=
rt for  the MS 150.  The weather was the  warmest of any of the 3 previous =
MS 150's I road.  By 6:30AM, 9,000+ riders were lined up  looking forward t=
o our 100-mile journey for the day.  This year there was a lot of press  co=
verage as the ride was dedicated to Maxine Mesinger.  Maxine, a long time s=
ufferer of MS, and  society columnist for the Houston Chronicle, died this =
past year of  complications from MS.  British  Petroleum had 580 riders edg=
ing out Enron as the first corporate team to go  out.  Enron had the second=
 start  with 450 riders and I was among one of the first people out along w=
ith the other  Enron top fundraisers including Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron =
and two riders with  MS.  Enron was the top fundraising  team from the 2000=
 MS 150.  =20
=20
The  cannon went off and I kicked into high gear.  I flew with the fastest =
riders and after  about ? a mile I could not keep up with them.  I was able=
 to maintain a speed of 22  miles an hour, crossing the Katy prairie while =
the race teams that started  behind us were passing me.  My first  stop was=
 break point three, 39 miles into the ride, and 1 hour and 45 minutes  late=
r.  The weather was already  feeling hot and humid.  I  replenished my wate=
r supply and continued the next 15 miles to lunch.  It was hilly but we sti=
ll had a tail  wind.  I arrived at lunch at 10AM in  Bellville, TX, 55 mile=
s from the start.   I found the Enron lunch spot with our catered lunch. =

After  a quick lunch I headed up to Industry, TX, population 475, which doe=
s not  appreciate 9,000+ riders going though their small town.  You need to=
 make sure you stop at the  one stop sign in town or you will get a ticket.=
  Luckily there was a police officer  directing traffic, as there was at al=
most all intersections along the route of  country roads.  I made my third =
stop  of the day in Industry at breakpoint five, where I had to stretch.   =
The hills were getting harder and  the tail wind was now a crosswind.   Com=
ing up on breakpoint seven 90 miles on route, a truck and crosswind  almost=
 blew the bikes off the road.   The sign said it was now 7.6 miles to the f=
inish of the day.  The next 7.6 miles were fine, but it was  an additional =
3 miles to the finish with hills and a strong head  wind
=20
Last  year I upgraded to a new bike with a triple.  I was able to keep a sl=
ow but steady  pace up the hills by getting into the granny gear.  I arrive=
d in La Grange, TX at 2:20PM, 7  hours and 20 minutes later to many cheerin=
g supporters.   I was done for Day 1!
=20
I  headed over to the Enron tent, the largest tent in La Grange.  After che=
cking in, I gulped two large  bottles of ice water, and signed-in for a mas=
sage.  Enron had 30 massage therapists working  to sooth the tired and wear=
y riders.   After my massage I felt totally relaxed.  Ilene found me in the=
 Enron tent having  a beer.  It took Ilene about an hour  to find me since =
our cell phones did not work well in La Grange due to limited  cell capacit=
y.  Every year Enron has  a large barbeque in the Enron tent and this year =
the food was even better.  While in the tent I was talking to some  other E=
nron riders and I learned that some came in as early as  10:45AM!
=20
The  next morning at 4:45AM, it was time to get up.  Ilene and I arrived at=
 the fairgrounds  at 5:30AM.  I headed over to  hydration station to refill=
 my water bottles and stretched before the 7:00AM  start.  I was one of the=
 first 50  people in line.  At exactly 7AM, we  were let out; normally we a=
re delayed for fog.  It was warmer than the day before and we  had more hil=
ls ahead of us.
=20
The first 20 miles  were relatively uneventful except I was able to carry o=
n 20-minute conversation  with Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron.   Then came the=
 downhill where you can reach speeds over 40 mph without  trying, the park =
is now only 3 miles away.   The park has a very hilly, curvy, and dangerous=
 route lasting 10  miles.  I stopped right inside the  park to refill water=
 and get some snacks.   I was really glad that I had the new bike with the =
triple, as I was able  to get up hills with little effort while others were=
 struggling or walking their  bikes.  That was until killer hill,  which I =
did not remember being too difficult.  After the downhill there was the  up=
hill.  I tried to shift into that  wonderful granny gear but it was too lat=
e.   I noticed the pedaling was extremely easy and I was slowing almost to =
a  stop.  I looked down at my chain and  it jumped off the gear.  I yelled =
 "oh no!"  I was able to get my foot  out and prevent myself from falling. =
  The hill I fell on years past was easy.  I headed out of the park to lunc=
h at the  50-mile point, it was 10AM.  When I  pulled into lunch I saw Ilen=
e who was working the lunch, she was very happy to  see me and I was happy =
to see her.   I took a short break and headed out to Austin.
=20
After lunch, the cloud cover  was gone and it was hot.  I stopped  twice in=
 the remaining 35 miles for water.   The last 15 miles were into the wind o=
r with a very strong cross  wind.  At approximately 12:30PM,  five hours an=
d thirty minutes later, I pulled into the finish line with many  supporters=
 cheering the riders on.   I saw Ilene several minutes after I arrived.  I =
was elated that I completed the  175-mile ride from Houston to Austin for t=
he 4th time and now I was ready for a  beer or two and some lunch.
=20
This year's ride was  magnificent!   It was a real  pleasure to see several=
 people with MS ride the bike tour.  The law enforcement personnel directin=
g  traffic was helpful as they kept safe and us moving.  The support staff =
and volunteers that  provided water and food at breakpoints and lunch were =
awesome.  Not to mention Ilene supporting me all  the way to Austin!  I wou=
ld also  like to thank my donors that have helped me raise over $21,000 for=
 MS and I am  still counting.  I would like to see  this number reach $30,0=
00 towards a cure for MS.=20
=20
If you still would like your  contribution to help send a check by May 11 i=
t should be made out to the  National MS Society and sent to the address be=
low or drop it by 2604A in  the Enron building.
