RiskNews Update - week ending 1/6/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

The top news of the week came as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision received widespread criticism from banks, trade associations and academics regarding its proposed implementation of Basel II, the new capital accord for internationally active banks.

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association criticised the proposed introduction of rigid capital floors. The leading swaps trade body also criticised the internal ratings multiplier and controversial "w" charge on credit derivatives, and was supported by the US' Bond Markets Association (BMA). The BMA also said the proposals would increase regulatory capital costs, and impair liquidity in repo, securities lending and margin lending transactions. US investment bank Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, said it is concerned the accord could adversely affect banks that concentrate on trading activities rather than lending. Multilateral lending body, the IMF, called for the new proposals to be applied to all banks in all countries and not just internationally active institutions, while others raised grave concerns that the proposals would have a significant detrimental impact on loans to emerging markets.

RiskNews (www.risknews.net) has produced eight stories on the subject of Basel responses and will continue to investigate replies in the coming weeks.
