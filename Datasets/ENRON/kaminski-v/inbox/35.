hello Vince--had a question for you--do you know these guys by any chance? Sam of course is a known quantity, but the firm is unknown to me. The attached paper they submitted for the risk desk I think is compelling and we're working to have it included in this week's issue--any comments?
Best,
John

Hi:
 
I would like to submit an article on a fast Risk Evaluation and Profiling methodology to the Risk Desk. Fast REP is a powerful graphical method to compare risk management policies. It focuses on extreme potential losses and potential pain points. While having some similar characteristics with the VAR (Value at Risk) framework and the Nobel-prize winning Markowitz model of variance minimization for a prescribed mean rate of return, it shifts the focus from an investment orientation to a risk management perspective extremely appropriate for a variety of industries, such as energy or telecom.
 
This methodology has been created by Stanford University Prof Sam Chiu and myself, and is now being applied as consulting services by Oncept. Attached is a copy of an unpublished article on the subject. We will adapt it or modify it to fit your editorial constraints, should you be interested. Please see below for a partial list of other articles published by the same  authors.
 
Thanks,
 
JP Crametz
