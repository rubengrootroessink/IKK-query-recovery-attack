Dr. Kaminski,

I called the number you gave me.
yesterday I couldn't reach you,
and today, the assistant told me that you will be back on Friday.
I'll call again on Friday.

Regards,
Jinbaek

   Subject:  Hi,

   Dr. Kaminski

   How are you?
   The process for starting summer work is going well,
   and there will be no problem we start work
   on May 30.
   I got a place to live, and reserved a flight.
   I'm going to leave for Houston on May 29
   (expected time to arrival is around noon)
   I am very much excited to have opportunity
   to join the project making an exchange platform.

   I think it's time I'd better remind you
   of scheduling a meeting with me,
   sometime on May 30.

   I hope you let me know what to to
   after I arrive at Houston.
   And please let me know if you have anything
   you think I prepare, to get better outcome
   from the summer work.
   If you give me a brief on the work,
   it would be a great help for me to decide
   which material I should carry from here to Houston.

   I look forward to the date we meet,
   Warm regards,

   Jinbaek
