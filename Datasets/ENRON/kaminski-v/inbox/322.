Dear Vince

I am currently producing Risk 2001 Australia (Risk and EPRM magazines'
annual Australian derivatives and risk management congress) which is taking
place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. I understand that you spoke at our
Australian Energy Risk 2000 conference last year.

I have now put together the draft programme and I am at the stage of
inviting people to speak at the event in August. I would like to invite you
to speak at this year's congress and I attach a copy of the draft programme.
I particularly had in mind the presentation 'Case study: learning the
lessons of the Californian electricity crisis - could it happen here?' (talk
number 7 in stream three of the programme which focuses on pricing, trading
and risk management in the Australian energy markets). However, if there is
another topic that you would be more interested in presenting then please
let me know.

This year's event combines last year's Australian Energy Risk 2000 and Risk
2000 conferences to create Australia's most comprehensive risk management
and derivatives congress. This year the congress will also include two
one-day post conference seminars on 22 August. Should you require any
further information about the programme or the event generally, please don't
hesitate to contact me either by telephone on +44 20 7484 9866 or by email
at pannesley@riskwaters.com.

I very much hope that you will be able to accept this invitation and I look
forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards


Philip Annesley
