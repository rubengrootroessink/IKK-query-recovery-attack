Rakesh, 
I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4 
that I cannot sign off on any analysis 
done by our group without looking at full set of 
legal documents related to the LJM 
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore 
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past. 
I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support 
the valuations based on verbal and 
often conflicting information, without doing  full due 
diligence. 
Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but, 
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis 
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict 
between 
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in 
my view, 
mutually exclusive. 
Vince

This is the latest version of your Raptor valuation memo that we have. 
Is 
there a more recent version with the changes we discussed (i.e. UBS 
shares 
are not in a forward contract, 4 year restriction, etc.)?
