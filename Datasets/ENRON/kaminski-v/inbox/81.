Dear Dr Kaminski:

Best Wishes for the New Year to you and your family!

Some time ago I sent you a letter with information on the Bachelier
Finance Congress. I never received a feedback from you and I am concerned
that perhaps it never reached you.

In any case, please let me know if you need any help with your travel
plans to Crete for you and/or your family.
( You may visit the web page of the Congress
(www.ma.utexas.edu/Bachelier2002) for information on location, plenary
speakers etc.)

On a different note, I would like to ask you if you would be
willing to come down to Austin and give us a seminar. Our workshop meets
on Fridays.

I sincerely hope to hear from you soon and to meet you in Austin.

Best regards,

Thaleia Zariphopoulou
