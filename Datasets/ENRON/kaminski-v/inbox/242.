Dear Vince,

It is my pleasure to invite you to speak again at "EPRM 2001 Europe", Energy
& Power Risk Management magazine's fourth annual European energy risk
management congress which will be taking place in Amsterdam on 6 & 7
September 2001. As you know, last year's congress attracted over 200
attendees and provided the ideal opportunity for leading institutions to
discuss the key issues and latest developments in pricing, trading and risk
management strategies for power and gas.

Please find attached a draft copy of the conference programme. I have left
the invitation open as I was unsure of your specific topic of interest.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from
you.

Yours sincerely,

Victoria Kerridge
Senior Conference Producer
