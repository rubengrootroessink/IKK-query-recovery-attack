Katrin,

	Thanks for all your hard work. I think the more coverage the better, so I would definitely like to put together something for GEB. (We do have some other paper by one of the structurers in the group on the same topic that we could use as a fallback.)

Joe

Joe,

Your paper on power demand swaps is in high demand with the trade press:  The Journal of Derivatives: Use, Trading and Regulations will run it in their August edition; Derivatives Week published it Monday 28; Derivatives Strategy and Risk Management both consider publishing it.  

In addition, Global Energy Business and Electric Light & Power are interested in running the paper, but only one will at the end feature it because both target the same audience.  However, your friend Ann Ku currently is working on a story on weather derivatives in general for Global Energy Business and she proposed to feature Enron's power demand swaps as part of the article if you would be willing (and your schedule permits) to create another example including quotes and graph (different from the one used in the paper) on how this tool works, for instance, for a golf club, manufacturer, etc.  This way, we would receive coverage in Global Energy Business and could pitch the story to Electric Light & Power.

Please let me know your thoughts regarding this matter.  Thanks!
