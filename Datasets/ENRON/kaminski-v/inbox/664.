No problem, Vince. I will certainly put you on the  programme on the following subject:
Measuring energy risk

Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research,  Enron N.A.
Are your details correct? Also, would you like to  expand on the topic title? Maybe include something about VaR, regulatory  requirements and/or price volatility?
 
Regarding the workshop: Mark's  e-mail is MTWilliams@edisonmission.com , his  telephone is 617-912-6000. Since I am due to go to press this week (inevitably,  it always comes down to a mad rush!), would it be possible for yourself and Mark  to devise a programme for the brochure? Or, please send me, and Mark, your  half of the programme and I will get his half of the agenda. If at all possible,  maybe you (or we) could have a telephone conversation and decide on an agenda  for the brochure.
 
I very much look forward to your response in due  course and to working with you once again.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

Andreas, 
I take  advantage of the weekend to catch up with my mail. A few points: 
1. I  would be glad to speak at the energy risk stream. I can cover either 
point  1, or 8 or 6 (in this order of preference ). 
2. Regard Mark Williams,  I would be glad to work with him on "Setting up a 
credit risk function for  energy companies." I can send both to you and him a 
reprint of a paper on  this topic that I co-authored (to identify some issues 
of interest to me)  and I am sure that we can split the territory between the 
two us. Please,  send me your and Mark's mailing addresses. 
The second topic (RAROC) is  more fuzzy and we may need to hold a 3-way 
conference call on this  subject. Everybody defines RAROC differently. 
Please, feel free to  forward my message to Mark.
