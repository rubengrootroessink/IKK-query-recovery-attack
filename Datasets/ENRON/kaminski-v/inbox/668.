We are pleased to announce that the Center for Research in Regulated
Industries will be hosting another research seminar on Public Utilities.
These seminars are  held annually.  The papers are published every two
years as a book.  Although the subject matter may be technical,
presentations at the Seminars are designed for a general audience of
professionals and regulators.
Another Research Seminar will be held in May 3, 2002.  This year's seminar
will be held at Engelhard Hall, Rutgers Newark on October 26.

There is no charge for full-time academics, government employees, and
employees of sponsoring organizations.
