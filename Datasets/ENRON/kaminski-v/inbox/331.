Wade,

Hope you and the family are doing well.  I just wanted to jot you a short note to thank you for the help you are giving Krishna.

At my end, all is fine.  I am still keeping a close watch on the goings on in India.  A matter of habit, I guess after some 5 years!

Wishing you and the family the very best.  

Regards,
Sandeep.
