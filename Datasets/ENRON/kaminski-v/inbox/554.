Dear Shirley,

I have emailed and voice mailed Vince about confirming his scheduled 
11/15-11/16 campus visit to Baylor University, but I haven't heard back 
from him yet.  I have him scheduled to present to students on 11/15 from 
11-2, and on 11/16 to present a seminar to the finance faculty.  I also 
have a room reserved for him at the Judge Baylor house in Waco for the 
evening of 11/15.  My colleagues and I plan to take him out to dinner on 
the evening of 11/15.

Anyway, can you confirm these plans for me?

Thanks,

Jim Garven
