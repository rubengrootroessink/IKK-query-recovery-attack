Vince,

I was wondering if you completed the review of the article by Grimwood and
Hodges entitled "Let's Swing Again (Pricing Non-storable Commodities)".
Please let me know.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Paolo Cadoni

Paolo,

I should finish the review in a day or two.
We were quite busy here in Enron for the last few days.

Vince
