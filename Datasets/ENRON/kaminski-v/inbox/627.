Vince,


Two recruiting seminars this week for the Finance Department that may be of
interest to you.

(1)Thursday, November 29:  Evgenia Portniaguina (University of Utah). She is
completing here Ph.D., and is one of their strongest students ever. She is
originally from Russia with a BS in Exploration Geophysics (4.0 GPA), Oil &
Gas Academy, Russia.  She will now speak on a Finanicial Market
MicroStructure topic, but she could be of great interest from the Energy
Institute point of view.  Her seminar is in Room 256, Melcher Hall,
10:30 -12 noon.

(2) Friday, November 30:  Peter Carr, Adjunct Professor at Courant
Institute, NYU...His specialization is in derivatives (although he will talk
on "Hedging with Incomplete Markets"). His talk is also in Room 256, 1:30-3
p.m.


Best,

Praveen
