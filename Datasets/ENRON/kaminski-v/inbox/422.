Title: Viewing Environmental Strategy Issues in a New Light

***********************************************************************

STRATEGIC CHALLENGES GROW IN ENVIRONMENTAL ARENA

The issues that are most prominent in the environmental arena are notable for
their relatively long time horizons. Thus, although the uncertainty created by
recent events might cause adjustments in environmental strategies it is less
likely to result in fundamental shifts in direction. In the immediate future,
however, the challenge will be in responding to a shifting landscape while
maintaining long-term objectives.

* Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are forging ahead with final negotiations,
while the US focus is on when a domestic climate change policy might appear.

* The European Union is moving toward development of a unified greenhouse gas
emissions trading scheme, while individual European nations are developing or
implementing their own (potentially incompatible) systems.

* Continued technology maturation combined with heightened energy security
concerns is solidifying the foundation of the renewable energy niche, bringing
increased focus on remaining technical and political hurdles.
