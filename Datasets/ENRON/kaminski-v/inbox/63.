Dear Vince,

I was wondering whether in addition to your talk on market and credit risk
at EPRM you would be interested in participating in the panel debate at the
beginning of day two? The panel will be a senior-level debate on the future
of the US power markets and I thought this might be something you would be
interested in speaking on.

I have reattached an up-to-date version of the agenda. Please let me know
what you think.

Best wishes,

Victoria

P.S. The other people invited so far to take part in the panel are Eddie
Meche, Reliant and Bill Schivley, Select Energy.
