Maureen,

Andre is going to look over the list of curves needed for the global assets (August Board meeting) one more time before I forward it to you.  He will make sure that we do not request FX and inflation (CPI,PPI, etc.) curves when only one of the curves will actually be used in the valuation process and to determine which inflation index is needed.  Typically, we receive both FX and inflation from you, but both curves may not always be used.  I hope that we can give you some time savings by eliminating any nonessential requests.

For now, this is the list of countries for which  we will  probably need the FX and/or inflation curves.  I will send the specifics per Andre later today.

India 
Philippines
Bolivia
Jamaica
Guatemala
Venezuela
Columbia
Puerto Rico	CPI only (I need historical inflation data, as well)
Panama
Brazil		we have current data already
China		we have current data already
Euro		inflation only

I am not certain about the needs for the London Underwriting/IV group but will request the information from them if you have not done so already.

Thanks!

Cindy
