Greetings from EDGAR Online!

How's your Free Trial of EDGAR Online going? Or did forget you registered,
since you were just interested in getting at that one filing you needed a few days ago?

Did you know you could be receiving an email alert as soon as that company files
again? It's not just 10-Ks and Quarterly Reports. Every company has to file with the
SEC all the time, not just once a year. You may have already missed their latest
announcement.

Plus, you can get real-time email alerts on new filings by not just company name or
ticker symbol; My EDGAR Online allows you to track by industry, region, or specific
filing type, including unscheduled material events and shareholder announcements.

Stop searching and let My EDGAR Online look for new filings FOR you. Go to http://www.edgar-online.com/watchlist.asp/ and set up your portfolio now.

TAKE EDGAR ONLINE TO THE BEACH
Why not? As a subscriber, you can download and print any document to take with you anywhere: the train, the couch, even the sand. Why stare at a screen in the office when
you can review filings at your convenience? And don't print the entire document -
select just the pages or sections you need.

FREE ANNUAL REPORTS, TOO
You can get hard copy Annual Reports from over 3,000 participating company delivered
to your home or office, FREE. Go to http://edgar-online.ar.wilink.com/cgi-bin/start.pl
or click on the Annual Reports link in the More info box after any search by Company
or ticker symbol.

For the next two weeks, you have FREE access to all of the business and financial data
available on over 15,000 U.S. public companies. Subscribe now! Go to http://www.edgar-online.com/trial_upgrade.asp for more information. (BROKERS: EDGAR Online offers a
