Dear Colleague:

    I would like to call your attention to three fine Penn students on
the job market this year, Sean Campbell, Clara Vega, and Canlin Li.
Their interests and skills span time series econometrics, financial
economics and macroeconomics.  I have attached my letters of
recommendation, which provide much more detail.

    I hope that you will seriously consider interviewing them if their
skill match your needs; please simply contact them directly if you want
to do so and/or if you would like more materials from them (their
contact information follows at the end of this email).  In addition,
please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance in
any way.

    Finally, I hope that you will excuse the intrusion caused by this
communication, but email is the least intrusive and most efficient way
that I know to get the message out.

                                                            With best
regards,

                                                             Frank
