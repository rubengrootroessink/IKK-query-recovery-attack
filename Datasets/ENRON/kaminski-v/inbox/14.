Vince,

As mentioned in my voicemail, please find attached a speaker details form
which I need you to fill in. I have also reattached the draft programme. At
the end of the main conference agenda is an outline of the three seminars. I
am having great difficulty locating relevant people to speak on the
operational risk seminar, and was wondering if you had any ideas.

I hope things are well with you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best wishes,

Victoria
