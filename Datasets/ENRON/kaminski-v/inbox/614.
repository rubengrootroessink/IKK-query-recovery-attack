Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download

By Christopher Cormier

Welcome to this edition of Whitepaper Downloads.  Today we have
two new whitepapers for you to browse through. Starting off we
have a whitepaper from F-5 Networks.  In this whitepaper F-5
illustrates the features of their Internet Control Architecture
system. F5 outlines the challenges of maintaining a content
management system, including distribution, delivery and control
of content and applications.  Secondly we have a whitepaper from
Cisco which deals with using Intrusion Detecting Systems (IDS)
solutions.  As always we have indexed all the current whitpapers
on Network World Fusion at the end of this newsletter.


F-5 Networks
An Advanced Internet Control Architecture For Creating
Application Aware Networks

Many system administrators have struggled with the need to
integrate content delivery solutions and custom applications to
all points of their networks, while still managing costs.  This
F5 Networks whitepaper offers the company's solutions to these
problems.  The complexity of content management has stretched
the limits of many networks and has often resulted in loses,
temporary solutions and high costs.  With their content
management system F5 says it is able to avoid many of these
problems and allow centralized management of all points on a
network.  Click the link below to read more about F5's Internet
Control Architecture.

Host-Based Solution

This paper examines the combination of the existing NIDS and
the new NIDS components in the Cisco IDS solution by exploring
relevant security issues. It continues with an analysis of the
extent of coverage provided by the combined solution and

other.

Winternals Software
Enterprise Defragmenters For Windows NT/2000: Cost and Benefits
Compared

In this whitepaper Winternals Software explains the impact of
defrag software.  Disk defragmentation is an area many
companies are exploring in an effort to cut costs.  According
to Winternals Software many defrag companies claim the use of
defrag software may have a cost savings of nearly $350 annually
per user.  Supported by figures and charts, Winternals Software
demonstrates how ambitious this number appears to be.  In
addition to the cost savings analysis, Winternals unveils other
possible hurdles involved with defrag software.  To provide you
with an alternative, Winternals Software introduces Defrag
Commander. In this article the functionality, effectiveness and
potential cost savings of Winternals' Defrag Commander is
explained.  Click the link below to see how Defrag Commander
may be a benefit your company and your budget.

Cisco
SAFE: A Security Blueprint for Enterprise Networks

Cisco, using design guideline sections and configuration
snapshots, has developed a blueprint for designing and
implementing a secure network.  In this whitepaper you can read
about the numerous potential holes typically exploited by
hackers.  Cisco describes various types of attacks, where they
originate, and suggestions on how to combat each type.  Cisco
also explains how hackers use all areas of the network for
their attacks, from routers to applications to hosts.  Along
with all the other features of this whitepaper, in Appendix B

Reliability

According to Keynote Systems 29% of connection errors are
related to DNS.  Also Keynote systems observes, DNS-related
errors are the second most frequent reason for failed Internet
connections.  Despite the percentage of DSN-related errors and
research supporting significantly improved customer satisfaction
by raising DNS' profile, typically management of DNS is limited.
