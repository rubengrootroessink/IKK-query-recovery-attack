The Research Group is conducting an access audit for its directory and subfolders.  I would appreciate receiving a list of access groups and their members for the O:\Research directory and subfolders.  If there were a way to list what kind of access each group has for each folder (or at least which groups have Modify access), it would be great.  I have already spoken with Sandra Hart who has begun the process.

Thank you for your assistance in our effort to maintain the integrity and security of our data.
