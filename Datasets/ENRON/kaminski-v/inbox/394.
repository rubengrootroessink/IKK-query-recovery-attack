Congratulations..... we can now go ahead with JCC (a small deal which we will give indicative pricing by the end of this week)
I will give you a call tonight - I want to reach a conclusion on the FX issue so that we can move forward
 
Thanks
Rousseau

We have gotten the go ahead to start to offer JCC.  I need for you to prioritize your potential leads so we can first go with those that are most interested.  I'd like to get some prices out by the end of the week.
 
Rousseau:  speak with Slovenski and tell him that I spoke with Nowlan and we will be starting out with some smaller deals in order to test research's analysis.  I will speak with Bill White later this week.
