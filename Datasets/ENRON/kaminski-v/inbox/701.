        Jayendran,

        Thank you for your note, and for your interest in Enron's Associate /

        Analyst Program.  I've copied Traci Warner who leads Recruiting for

our

        Program.  Traci, or someone from her team will follow up with you.

        I've also noted your unique mix of weather / climate training and

        experience, combined with your financial analysis and risk management

        background.  We will highlight this experience with a couple of

specific

        groups.

        Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

        Best regards,

        Billy Lemmons

        Vice President, Associate / Analyst Program
