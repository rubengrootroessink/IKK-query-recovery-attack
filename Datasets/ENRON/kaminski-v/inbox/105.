     The Bachelier Finance Society was founded in 1996 by a group of
  researchers in Mathematical Finance to serve as a platform where
  academics and practitioners can meet and exchange ideas spanning across
  Mathematics, Finance, Economics, Econometrics and Insurance. To achieve
  this goal, the BFS organizes every two years an International Congress.
     The scientific program of the 2002 BFS Congress consists of plenary
  talks and contributed papers. The invited plenary talks will give an
  overview of the latest important developments in the field. They will
  also present new ideas, directions and methodologies from Finance,
  Economics, Econometrics and Mathematics and, discuss pressing problems
  in the Finance and Insurance industries. The contributed papers will
  complement the plenary talks with recent results and advances.
      The overall scope is to create a unique interdisciplinary forum for
  discussion of new concepts, incite stronger interaction across the
  fields, and, at the same time, define new directions for the future
  development of Mathematical Finance.
