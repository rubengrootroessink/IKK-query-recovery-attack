Vince-

Are you going over to the new building right away?

The reason I ask is on the trading floor the workspaces are very small,
and there is no room whatsoever for books (eg, econometrics texts).

I think this revives the issue of a library. We used to have a wonderful
one, then it went away.

I was wondering if you could keep a thought in the back of your mind in
terms of a place where people could go to find and read good textbooks.

Thank you,

Clayton
