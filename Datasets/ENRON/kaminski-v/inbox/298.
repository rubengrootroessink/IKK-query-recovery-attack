Jag,

well done!

please, could you schedule a couple of seminars for our people to help them to become acustomed to the Live Link. 
Please, could we ensure that by the beginning of June everybody is using Live Link easily.

many thanks,
Slava

Hi

There is now a London Research Group area on live-link which contains the Project Library and other documentation.

The following (very long!) URL will place you at the top of the live-link tree from which the Research Area is clearly visible. 

http://livelinkeu.corp.enron.com/LiveLink/LiveLink.exe?func=ll&objtype=141&objaction=browse

Alternatively one can access livelink from a link on the bottom left-hand corner of the Enron Europe Intra-net homepage.

Regards
Jag
