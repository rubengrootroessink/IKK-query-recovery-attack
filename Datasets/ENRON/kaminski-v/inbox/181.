Dear Vince
 
I am delighted to inform you that the  garp2001online Convention is now online. The response  that I have received thus far has been very positive. Please feel free to visit  the site at www.garp.com/2001online 
 
Can I also suggest that you go to the  Debate Forum and maybe post some comments, address some  questions, maybe even post questions yourself. The web site is http://www.garp.com/2001online/discussionforum.asp 
 
I trust that you find the Virtual event as exciting  and innovative as GARP would like it to be, especially given that this is a new  avenue for GARP.
 
I look forward to your contribution.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
