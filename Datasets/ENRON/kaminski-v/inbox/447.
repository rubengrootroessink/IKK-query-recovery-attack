Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.


Vince

This is the latest version of your Raptor valuation memo that we have.  Is
there a more recent version with the changes we discussed (i.e. UBS shares
are not in a forward contract, 4 year restriction, etc.)?
