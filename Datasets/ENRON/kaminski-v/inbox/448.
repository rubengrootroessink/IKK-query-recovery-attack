We want to personally thank you for agreeing to join the Energy Committee of
the C.T. Bauer College of Business Dean's Advisory Board (Current Committee
Members Attached).  The Committee is a terrific group of people with a
diverse background that will represent exceedingly well the needs of the
Houston energy community.  As a member of the Energy Committee, you also
become a member of the Dean's Advisory Board, which is having its next
meeting on January 17, 2002.  This Dean's Advisory Board Meeting will
include the grand opening ceremonies for the new AIM Center for Investment
Management in the Bauer College.  Please mark your calendar for January 17,
2002 for this important event.

We are delighted and excited about the Energy Market Center of Excellence
and look forward to your leadership in guiding and shaping its rapid
evolution (Draft Business Plan attached).  Our first meeting of the Energy
Committee on November 14, 2001 will be held at the Bauer College of
Business - Melcher Hall in the AIM Center Board Room, which is on the first
floor as you enter the building, from 5:00 PM to 7:00PM (Agenda Attached).
The parking gate will be open for your convenience. We believe the role you
will be playing (Energy Committee Charter attached) in integrating the
Energy business community with the University of Houston and Bauer College
could well be the model for the next generation metropolitan research
university.  We look forward to seeing you on November 14th and thanks again
for your commitment of time and support.

Sincerely Yours,

Dean Arthur Warga
Chairman of Energy Committee Lane Sloan
Chairman of Finance Department Praveen Kumar
