Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Hi Lance,

	he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.

Vasant,

Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern.

Hi!
   Thank you very much for your help.
Here is my resume.
Please let me know what should I do next as soon as possible.
Becasue I have several interview plans with other companies.
But I would like to work at Enron most.
So if I can get the job at Enron, I don't want to
hang around others.

Thank you again.
