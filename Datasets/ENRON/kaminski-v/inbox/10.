Dear V

The events of September 11 will have long-term effects on the insurance industry.

The insurance industry is at a turning point - capacity shrank, rates rocketed, and losses mounted. Some cover is still hard to come by. Yet a dramatic resurgence is under way as new capital floods in
and as insurers adopt alternative risk transfer, dubbed insurance-based investment banking.
How will it affect the banking industry and capital markets?
