Please check with at home or on his mobile as I won't be

Hope to see you soon!

Shirley

Thanks for the notice, Shirley.

I already posted your resume at Reliant Resources, but Reliant Energy I
couldn't find secretary position. It's excellent if Vince can help. I
hope you can work here at the same building.

Next week any time is fine with me. But don't make it hard. If it's not
convenient for him, it's OK. I can see him sometime around. If
available, what about Tuesday 11:30? (feb. 5th.) I just want to talk
with him before he leaves downtown.

Good luck for the job search!

Jaesoo

Jaesoo:

Vince wants to know if he can postpone the lunch one more
time until sometime next week.  He is going to meet with
the HR person at Reliant tomorrow for lunch and give her
my resume, Anita's and Therese's.

Let us know what day next week will work.

Cheers!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

I found that I have an already set up appointment on Tuesday(29th of
Jan). Would you move the appointment with Vince on Wed., Thu. or Friday?

In the process of referring you a senior secretary position in here, it
required your cover letter and resume. But without them, it processed.
(I briefly mentioned your job at Enron and left your email company
address.)
If you don't receive any contact from here, please let me know. Also I
saw 2 other postings of executive secretary position.   

See you tomorrow.

Jaesoo
