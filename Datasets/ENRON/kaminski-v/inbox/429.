Greg,

Condolences for the turbulent times Enron is going through.

We remain excited and optimistic about the possibilities of a joint project.
We realize that you and Vince may have limited bandwidth in the immediate
future, but when you have time we hope you will consider the draft proposal
we sent Vince.  We are still fully behind it.

Yours truly,
    Norman
