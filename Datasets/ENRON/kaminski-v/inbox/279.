Thank you for your participation in the above referenced visit to Enron.  Attached is a final agenda with attendees.  There are approximately 10 guests from Norsk Hydro.  Due to the size of the group, all meetings will be held in 50M.  I will have an LCD projector in the room if you wish to use a slide presentation.  

Enron Norway would like this visit to be an opportunity to create a favorable climate for increasing business with Norsk Hydro as deregulation in Europe takes off.

To reiterate, this is a study team that is part of Hydro Energy Management Group, a division of Norsk Hydro in the oil and energy sector.  This visit is part of a one week trip to Houston with visits to at least four or five companies.    They are here to exchange ideas in a free informal give and take discussion about:
Operation in deregulated markets
E-Commerce
Risk Management
Tolling Agreements/Gas for Power
Trading

My role is to act as facilitator and agenda timekeeper.  Please let me know if there is additional information you require.

 

Thank you.
