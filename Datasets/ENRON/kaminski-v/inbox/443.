MEXICO'S NATURAL GAS PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY: LOWER THAN EXPECTED?

A series of important developments in Mexico's gas market is reducing the
potential for long-term domestic natural gas productive capacity.

*  Low natural gas exploration and production investment. Investment in natural
gas exploration does not appear to be enough to significantly increase
productive capacity in the future.

*  Low expectations of the new Pemex multiservice contracts. Though Pemex has
announced a new model for service contracts and expects to have a bid round by
mid-2002, CERA does not expect an enthusiastic response from the private sector.

*  New liquefied natural gas (LNG) import projects reduce the pressure for
increasing domestic capacity. The strong interest in developing LNG import
terminals and recent LNG regulatory progress are reducing political pressure to
increase domestic capacity.
