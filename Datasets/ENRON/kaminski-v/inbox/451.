 The newly redesigned site offers:

7	Software Downloads - Visitors can now download software directly from the
Support section of our website.

7	Enhanced Navigation - New search function, site map, and additional
navigation menus.

7	Expanded Content - Our Browse by Industry section explains how companies
use FEA software across industry sectors.


2. ******FEA IS MOVING****** : The demands of continued growth have prompted
FEA to move into a new headquarters building in Berkeley, California. As of
November 9, 2001, our new address will be:.

2201 Dwight Way
Berkeley, CA 94704-2114


FEA phone and fax numbers will NOT change. However, the weekend we move
(November 8 thru November 11) it may be intermittently difficult to reach us
by phone and possibly email. Be sure to use email during this time. And if
you're planning a visit, be sure to verify our physical location first!


Telephone and fax numbers:
T. +1 510-548-6200
F. +1 510-548-0332

Please Note: The move will take place on November 9, 2001. FEA will be open
for business during the move. However, please expect slower response times
to your emails and voice messages that day.

Best Regards,

Financial Engineering Associates, Inc.
