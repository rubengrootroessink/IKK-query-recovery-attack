Hi Vince,

I saw that you will be featured on the finance panel for the leadership
conference at Sloan.  I plan on attending, and will enjoy seeing you
again.  I don't know if your schedule is too full but it would be great to
catch up if you have any time.

The first semester here in school roars on.  We had our first midterm today
(accounting).  For me, it feels like school will be over very quickly.  Not
surprisingly for Charlotte and the boys, it probably can't be over soon
enough.

I hope things are well with you and everyone else in Research.  Give my
regards to everyone.
