Vince,

I talked to Chris last week during a recruiting event that Analyst and Associate pool hosted at Rice.
He was very interested in the kinds of projects that our group is working on.  Also, he has had an 
extensive experience in the Energy industry.
I am attaching his resume.  He has one more year left in school, but If you are interested, I could 
invite him over to talk to our group members, and get a better feel for the Enron Research environment.

Jason

Jason,

I enjoyed our discussions last Thursday....much more interesting that the usual partio-MBA schmooze stuff.  I would very much like to talk to your Director about opportunities at Enron.  To be honest, I am approaching Enron from several different points in order to pinpoint the area that best suits my abilities and sense of direction (kind of mirroring the internal process that you would use to move between groups within Enron).  As Enron is the only large corporation that I am seriously considering, talks with people such as yourself are invaluable in helping me find areas of commonality between the company's and my own goals.  Makes for a realistic set of expectations on both sides.

My resume is attached in Word format, but sending emails from home via the Rice server sometimes buggers the attachments.  If you can't open the document, let me know and I will send another copy both from my Roadrunner address as well as directly from school.

Thanks for the help.
