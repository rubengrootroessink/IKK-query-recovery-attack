On behalf of Enron and the Research Group, Vince purchased a table at the subject event.
There are 8 places at the table and he would like to invite you and your wife to attend.  

The attendees from the Research Group will be:
Vasant Shanbhogue and his wife (Vasant's wife is actually working on the event, so her place will not be counted in with our group.).
Krishna Krishnarao and his wife 
Sandeep Kohli and his wife
Maureen Raymond

Please let me know if you are available on the 16th.
