RiskNews Update - week ending 8/6/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
============================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 8/6/2001

Morgan Stanley swept the board at RiskNews' sister publication Credit magazine's second annual European analysts' survey this week, claiming 12 first place awards out of 17 categories for credit research excellence. The firm improved on its performance last year, when it was in the top five in eight of 14 categories. Morgan Stanley credit strategist Neil McLeish typified his firm's performance having risen from fourth place last year to claim the top spot in the strategy sector this time around. Merrill Lynch also performed well, with 13 mentions as a top-five firm in the 17 categories, including first places for high-yield telecoms & media, high-yield industrials, and index provider categories. Another outright winner was Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, which topped the high-grade consumer products sector. A full version of the Credit magazine awards is available at www.creditmag.com.

More responses to the proposed Basel capital Accords - Basel II - emerged this week. The Institute of International Finance, the US-based association whose membership includes Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and UBS, said it was concerned that the proposals may result in an excessively conservative and costly capital framework that overestimates the amount of risk on banks' balance sheets. Separately, investment managers said Basel's move to cover operational risk is flawed.

In Asia, meanwhile, Credit Lyonnais issued what it claims are the first call warrants on a basket of Chinese 'B shares', following the decision by China's securities regulator to allow local Chinese to buy these shares, which previously were only available to international investors.

Finally, RiskNews will report extensive coverage of events at Risk magazine's Risk 2001 USA conference in Boston next week. Look for top stories in the conference update box on www.riksnews.net
