Vince,
    IT had informed me that you were interested in our liquidity margin model over the weekend.  Here attached is a brief synopsis of the workings of the model, including methodology, a validation example, and web-page front ends.  It has been in use daily for the past month and a half, after going through a prototyping and implementational phase.
  Please let me know if you have any questions,

Naveen
