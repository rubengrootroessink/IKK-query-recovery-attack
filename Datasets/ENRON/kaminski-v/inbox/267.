I have placed a preliminary program for the June 21-22 conference on retail
participation in competitive power markets under the June 21-22 listing at:

http://www.stanford.edu/group/EMF/meetings

Speakers come from companies, government and university and research
organizations.

You will also find hotel and registration information there as well.  There
is no cost for the conference but we appreciate your registration for our
planning.

I look forward to an interesting session on approaches to managing
electricity loads that will help policymakers and steer future research.

Regards,
Hill
