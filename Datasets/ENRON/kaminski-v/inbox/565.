Attached you will find the cash data that I have been using to derive my graphs.

In terms of the method I used to derive the average of $10 million/day, I used the net cash inflows for September and the net cash outflows for October and calculated an average based upon 41 business days.  The average came out to be $6.22 million/day and I then grossed it up a bit to be $10 million even.

Thanks,
Rob
