Thank you Vince.

I have sent you one more version this morning. I hope you have that.

We are not a newspaper so it is not necessary for us to bother your press
spokesman.

I would be happy to keep in touch with you if you would find that useful. In
any event, I will treat this email exchange as a private matter between old
(in more ways than one!) friends.

Ed

Ed,

Thanks. I have forwarded your message to Mark Palmer, our
press spokesman. He has a full plate, as you might expect,
but I strongly suggested  that he should get in touch with you.

Vince
