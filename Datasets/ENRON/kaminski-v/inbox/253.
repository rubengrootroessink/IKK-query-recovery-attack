Hey, Vince:

How are you? I just want to thank your for all your
efforts during my application to Enron last year. Even
if it did not work out in the end, but I still
appreciate all your help.

I just started my new job at "Allegheny Energy Global
Markets" in New York city, the company is the trading
arm of Allegheny Energy, and used to be Merrill
Lynch's Energy Trading Group. I will be responsible
for structuring.

Again, thanks for the help, I look forward to talking
to you in those conferences in the future.

Sincerely,
Charles Shen
