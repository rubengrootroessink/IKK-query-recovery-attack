ERISK ESSENTIALS --
What's New at ERisk.com, 08 June 2001

WEEKLY REVIEW
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0ImL0Av
In this week&#8217;s economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: corporate profits take their worst hit for a decade; tobacco firms face new legal risks; investment banks feel the effects of the deal drought; the SEC comes under fire; and catastrophe risk for insurers may be falling.

ANALYSIS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4V0A2
Why insurers are making slow progress towards e-commerce.
Complaints amid the compliments: banks, associations and regulators respond
to Basle II.

VIEWPOINT
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0B4X0A4
As chief risk officer, Walter Smiechewicz was charged with developing an
enterprise risk management framework at Old Kent, a relatively unusual
undertaking for such a small firm. The bank&#8217;s recent merger with fellow
regional Fifth Third put an end to the programme, but as Smiechewicz tells
ERisk's Duncan Wood in our latest Q&A, it learnt a lot of valuable lessons
along the way.

JOB LISTINGS
http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=eIfr0BHCKe0CjE0Bie0AB
Among the opportunities posted in our Job Listings section this month: positions in corporate treasury, investment risk management and bank credit risk management.

ANNOUNCEMENTS
Later this month ERisk will begin running announcements of key personnel
changes, new product launches and other important company and industry news.
If you have an announcement you&#8217;d like to see featured on the world&#8217;s
premier risk management portal, please email the editorial team at
