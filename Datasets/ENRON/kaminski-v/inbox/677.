Dear Vince,
I hope everyone is well among your family and friends;as a US citizen
and as a European citizen,I am devastated by the New York (in fact,world)
events.
I am in touch with Sandeep for the software;moreover,a good student from
the Finance Mastere programme at ESSEC wishes to join Enron,anywhere..
Should I forward you his vita?
See you in November
Kind regards
Helyette
