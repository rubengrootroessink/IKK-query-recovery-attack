Attached are the registration form and  agenda for Friday's February 1 industry meeting in New  York City. This meeting is a  continuation of Monday's Jan   28 industry collaborative at DOE to develop a "single" consensus standards  setting organization by March 15, as directed by FERC. Provided below is the  matrix developed by industry at Monday's meeting identifying  the areas of similarities and differences between the various models and  proposals. We look for you to review the matrix internally and be prepared to  advance the discussion and start making the hard decisions in New  York.
 
We strongly encourage all companies to participate in New York  and the subsequent industry meetings. FERC staff will present  in the morning and industry will begin discussions and negotiations thereafter.  FERC is holding its Northeast Energy Infrastructure Adequacy Conference on  Thursday, January 31 at the same Helmsley Park Lane Hotel.  It was a  concerted decision to hold this meeting in New York City to allow for  companies to maximize their trip North and participate in both meetings, if  desired. Please fax or e-mail the registration forms to jmastin @eei.org  or the fax number provided on the registration form. We have registered  close to 75 persons for this meeting and need an approximate count of attendees  to ensure adequate meeting space for all participants. If you do not forward the  form by COB Thursday, please contact us by phone and bring a completed  registration form to the meeting. 
 
Also, for those companies that can not attend in person, we  have established a conference call dial-in. 
 
The number is 800-860-2442. 
Call Name: Wholesale Standards Call  
Date/Time: Friday,  February1 from 8 AM-4PM
 
Thank You,
