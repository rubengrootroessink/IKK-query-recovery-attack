It's Day 5 of your FREE 2 week trial of EDGAR Online. This is just a reminder
that you could be tracking any number of companies, industries, regions, and filing
types using My EDGAR Online, your personal portfolio that alerts you immediately
about new filings.

FILING ALERTS
As a trial user, you can set up My EDGAR Online now at http://www.edgar-online.com/watchlist.asp now. Or whenever you search EDGAR Online, just select
the Add to My EDGAR Online button to save that search. Instead of you doing the
work, EDGAR Online sends you an email whenever a new filing matches your criteria.

IPO ALERTING
You should already have received your Daily Report from IPO Express summarizing
the day's IPO-related activities, including filings, pricings, withdrawals, and other headlines. And every Sunday IPO Express sends you a Weekly Summary of the week's events, and what to expect in the week ahead, including Lockup and Quiet Period Expirations, and the companies expected to start trading.

WORD DOWNLOADING
Once you click on any filing, you can download and save that document immediately
in Word or any other word processing program. Print it out and take it with you to
read at your convenience.
