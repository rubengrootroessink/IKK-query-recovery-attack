Module 5 - Spring 2002 Faculty,

I am contacting you today to remind you book orders for your Module 5
course needs to be placed through the Campus Book Store.

Below is the web address you will need to access in order to place your
book order for your course.

http://www.dacnet.rice.edu/~rcstore/bookzone/login/

If you have any questions regarding enrollment numbers (for book orders)
for your course please contact Pam Castro at castro@rice.edu or call her at
6223 and she will be glad to assist you.  Faculty please order for the
TOTAL number of students in your course (example: MGMT 501 - 001 = 58
students, MGMT 501 - 002 = 59 students, MGMT 501 - 003 = 58 students - the
TOTAL NUMBER OF BOOKS YOU WILL ORDER for MGMT 501 will be 175).

All book orders need to be placed ASAP (NOTE: once orders have been placed
it can take 2 to 4 weeks before they come in).  I will be contacting you on
Monday, February 4, 2002 to make sure all book orders have been
placed.  Please let me know if you do not plan to order books for your
course so I will not contact you with reminders.  Thanks in advance for
your help in this matter.

Kathy
