Dear Speaker,

Gas & PoweRisk, Sofitel Hotel, Paris From 6th -9th November 2001


I am delighted that you will be joining us to speak at the Gas& PoweRisk
2001 conference. Please note that 5 copies of the printed brochure will be
sent in the post for you and your colleagues plus you can also view the
brochure via our website - www.icbi-uk.com/powerisk. I would be grateful if
you could just take a moment to look through the items we would like from
you prior to the conference to help ensure everything runs smoothly on the
day.

Your Administration/Preparation Details
20 weeks to go!

You will find attached the following forms:
? AV FORMS: please tick and fill in and fax back immediately
? HOTEL FORMS please tick and fill in and fax direct to the hotel
? MARKETING FORM: Information for our marketing department, please fill in
and send back as soon as possible

Friday 12th October 2001: A Hard Copy Of Your Documentation
3 weeks to go!

? We would like a hard black & white copy of  your presentation / bullet
points/copy of slides whichever is best for you, to insert into the delegate
documentation. We can receive this by post or email if the documents are not
too complex but we try not to insert fax copies as copy quality is poor.
(e-mail address - vthomas@iirltd.co.uk).

N.B. Even if you plan to speak off the cuff, we would urge that you submit
at least an outline of your speech to us for insertion into the delegate
pack by the above date. The most consistent complaint that we have from
delegates is that not all speakers offer hard copies of their presentation.

? If you are unable to make this deadline, please could you inform us as
soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements and avoid
printing delay.

Should you have any queries regarding your participation at the conference
please contact me as I will be looking after the 'domestic' side of the
event. You can me on (44) 207 915 5641 Thank you once again for joining us
and I look forward to seeing you in Paris.

With kind regards,
Victoria Thomas
