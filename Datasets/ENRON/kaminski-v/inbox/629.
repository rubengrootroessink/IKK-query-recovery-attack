Today's focus: IBM's latest Linux servers keep chugging

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise Linux users looking for the latest and fastest
server hardware might want to check out the new eServer xSeries
servers from IBM.

IBM's new servers will support Linux on up to 16 processors in
a 3U (three rack unit) sized box. The first versions of the
xSeries will include 32-bit Intel processors, with 64-bit chips
to come later.

An interesting feature that could be useful to server
administrators is the ability to partition processors on the
xSeries servers. With this, users could set up a Linux server
to do multiple tasks in a single box, such as assigning
different bunches of processors to handle Web, database, e-
mail, or file and print serving. Different Linux distributions
could be run on the partitioned processor groups, or even other
operating systems, such as Windows-based systems.

The new IBM servers support several hardware enhancements aimed
at making Linux systems more reliable. The xSeries will include
what IBM calls Active PCI-X, which allows a server technician
to replace PCI or PCI-X adapters or peripherals on the fly,
without having to power down the server. A "memory mirroring"
feature is also included, which can help avoid crashes due to
corrupted memory. Mirroring allows a server to detect when a
RAM module goes bad and replicate the system memory from hard
disk space, allowing for the bad RAM to be replaced without
shutting down the server.

Next issue, we'll look at how Dell is keeping pace with its own
Linux server offerings.
