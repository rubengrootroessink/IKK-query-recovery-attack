Vince, 
 
I would like to offer you to be the chairman for  the morning stream session "On-Line  Trading & Risk  Management" (8th November,  11.45-13.15), to introduce the speakers (Spyros Maragos, Per Hjorth and Les Clewlow)  and lead the discussion. Would you be interested in doing  that?
 
Kind Regards,
 
Angelika Staude
Director Gas & PoweRisk  2001
