2001 Industry Partner Workshop & Dinner - THURSDAY, NOVEMBER. 29, 2001
MANAGING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
IN A TOUGH ECONOMY:
DOING LESS WITH LESS AND GETTING MORE
When markets sag and earnings are squeezed, top management attention shifts from growth prospects to immediate productivity gains. Yet technologies keep progressing, disruptive innovations challenge incumbents and a robust development portfolio is needed to keep growing. How are leading firms managing the tension between the immediate pressure to conserve and the long-run need to innovate?
During this timely workshop, the partners in the ET program will learn from each other how to ratchet up their development productivity with innovative processes, organization designs and partnership arrangements. This is a networking event where partners are invited to share their experiences, insights and fresh management approaches to problems of mutual interest and concern. We will also share with you our vision for the future of the ET program and seek your guidance on our priorities and initiatives.

Wharton Impact Conference - FRIDAY., Nov. 30, 2001
MANAGING KNOWLEDGE ASSETS:
CHANGING RULES AND EMERGING STRATEGIES
A Wharton Impact Conference sponsored by the William and Phyllis Mack Center on Technological Innovation
Co-Chaired by Mark Myers and Sid Winter, The Wharton School.
Knowledge may be the most important source of competitive advantage for a firm, but capturing the potential gains is a continuing challenge. Firms are filing patent applications at an unprecedented rate, while struggling to keep up with accelerating development cycles and shrinking lead times. Emerging technologies, changing legal interpretations and growing administrative burdens on the patent system are creating a new and unfamiliar context for the management of intellectual property. In response, firms are rethinking their strategies for realizing the rewards from their innovation.
The Mack Center at the Wharton School has assembled thought leaders from leading companies, government and academia to address issues such as the following:
- What strategies are firms using to create, protect and use their knowledge assets?
- Do mechanisms such as secrecy, control of complementary assetsand lead time play an important role as a substitute or supplement for patent protection?
- How is the U.S. patent and trademark office responding to the remarkable growth in patenting? Should they be protecting not only inventions but also ways of distributing and selling them? How should they deal with applications for patents on sequences of the human genome?
- In a world where technology is developed and employed globally, what are the prospects for international harmonization of intellectual property laws and practice?
- Are the patent office and the courts up to the task of creating and effectively enforcing clear intellectual property rights for emerging technologies?
