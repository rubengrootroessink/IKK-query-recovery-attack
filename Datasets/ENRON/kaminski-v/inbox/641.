Good morning Andre':
 
Vince is on his way to California so he forwarded the message to me.
 
I will send the books to you today and Vince will call you when he
returns on Monday.

Hello, Vince
 
It was a great pleasure to meet you in London.  After our lunch I had interesting discussions with the research group and continental trading group.  How was the response on your lecture/speech?
 
You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.
 
You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.
 
Thanks and regards,
 
Andr? Damslora
