Sandeep,

I received a e-mail from Toshiba requesting a meeting to discuss collaboration between Enron.  Mr. Tatsumi states in the email that Vince told Toshiba that Enron would like to examine the Boltzmann model through the Tokyo office.  How would you like us to proceed with Toshiba?  We are happy to meet with them, however I would like to have a clear definition of the objectives from our perspective.

Regards,
Mark
