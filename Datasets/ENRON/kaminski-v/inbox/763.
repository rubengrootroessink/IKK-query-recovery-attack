Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 26/10/2001

JP Morgan Chase was in the news this week. First, its US credit derivatives group said it was considering partnerships with affiliated companies and data vendors to redistribute its data and create an industry pricing benchmark. Second, it and Deutsche Bank separately signed deals with US technology solutions provider Longitude to speed the introduction of broader index trading based on economic data.

The idea to create credit derivatives indexes is not new to the bank. Its European operation has already set up a credit default swap data service - albeit that it has received a somewhat underwhelming response from clients, bankers said. But global credit derivatives head Andy Brindle said the US approach would be different to Europe, although he declined to provide more specific details due to the early state of negotiations.

Wider-than-market indexes are also a relatively uncharted territory, but the use of Longitude's Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA) technology, could be the first step towards banks reducing market risk. PDCA products should
be self-clearing and self-hedging, and priced according to customer particpation. They are therefore not dependent on supply and demand constraints. JP Morgan Chase plans to use the technology to create products based on economic statistics published by the US government and US
government agencies. Deutsche plans to use Longitude to create derivatives based on economic statistics published by European and Japanese governments.

Meanwhile, Moody's Risk Management Services has formed a strategic working group - the RiskCalc Sponsor Group - with nine major banks, to develop European credit risk benchmarks, using its RiskCalc software. The RiskCalc
backers are Barclays, Lloyds TSB, and Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK; Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Santander Central Hispano (formerly BSCH) in Spain; HypoVereinsbank in Germany; Banco Espirito Santo in
Portugal; Fortis Bank in Belgium; and Bank Austria.

On the people front, Barclays Capital, the investment banking division of the UK's Barclays Bank, has named former Chase Securities executive Eileen Murphy as the global head of its new collateralised debt obligation group.
Barclays plans to launch a new CDO based on leverage buy-outs by the end of the year.

Finally, on 5-9 November in New York and on 26-30 November in London, Risk magazine will be holding it's 3rd annual Maths Week conference. This five-day event will cover the latest research in quantitative finance and risk management, with presentations by leading industry practitioners and academics.
