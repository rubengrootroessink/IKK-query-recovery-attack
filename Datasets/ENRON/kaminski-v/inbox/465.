More efficient and quantitative than an MBA specialization in Finance, and more advanced than any available executive education course, the Financial Investment Technology (F.I.T.) program offers attendees an extraordinary opportunity to learn and apply the latest advances in financial theory and practice. The course will be held at the Haas School of Business on the U.C. Berkeley campus from January 7th to February 1st, 2002.
  To view a quick presentation about the upcoming F.I.T. program click on the URL below, or paste this URL into your browser's address bar:http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/finance/FIT/presentation 
All thirteen members of the world-renowned finance faculty of the Haas School of Business teach the F.I.T. program. Most professors will teach their particular specialty and several, where relevant, their current research. In years past, the original research presented is now summarized in current textbooks. With these professors, you will spend quality, live-in learning time mastering the techniques of modern quantitative finance.
The program is presented in two sequential, two-week terms entitled "Derivatives Modeling and Implementation" and "Dynamic Asset Management and Trading Strategies". These two segments make for an integrated package, but you can choose either one separately. 
 The F.I.T. program is intended for senior implementers, line managers, and strategists in asset management, investment banking, trading, enterprise-wide risk management, and corporate strategic planning. 
 You can contact the program coordinator, Johanna Della Valle  (please put 'FIT' in the subject line) via email or phone (510) 642-0114.
We hope to see you in January.
John O'Brien and Mark Rubinstein 
F.I.T. Marketing and Executive Directors
