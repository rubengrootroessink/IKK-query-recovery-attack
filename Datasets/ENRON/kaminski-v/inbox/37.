Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 25/1/2002

The focus of investigations into the collapse of Enron turned to its derivatives trading business this week. Expert testimony in a US Senate hearing Thursday by Frank Partnoy, a professor in the University of San Diego School of Law, warned that profits the firm attributed to its derivatives operations may have been inflated due to systematic problems with the way Enron valued its positions and recorded them in its trading book. But Partnoy - who is currently researching a book about Enron's fall - failed to provide any hard evidence. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer refused to address the matter, stating Enron would not offer counterarguments to each testimony. To vote on whether derivatives played a key role in Enron's demise, visit http://www.risknews.net.

Meanwhile, Citibank and Soci?t? G?n?rale will sell warrants for the first time in the North American retail market on Monday, via the Bourse de Montr?al. The expansion is significant for the banks, both of which are market leaders in the warrants business, as it could open the way to selling the products to the US retail market. A tight US regulatory environment currently impedes the selling of warrants in the US.

Operational risk software and data vendors Raft International and OpVantage plan to integrate their respective op risk applications, Raft Radar and OpVar. US-based OpVantage was established in April last year when PricewaterhouseCoopers and NetRisk merged their op risk offerings. The firms believe the joint offering should allow users to manage their entire operational risk process from developing and collecting risk indicators through to calculating capital-at-risk.

On the people front, Lehman Brothers lured a 15-person equity barrier options team from rival CSFB. The move is the largest hiring spree in Lehman's two-year drive to boost its equity derivatives capability. The team will be led by Jerry Guthrie. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, hired Michel Iskander to head its OTC derivatives structuring business. Iskander, who has worked at JP Morgan since 1993, will manage a team of about 10 and report to Toshio Okumura.

This Appeal has been set up for the immediate families of, and any persons financially dependent on, those attending the Risk Waters financial technology conference on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, who lost their lives in the terrorist attack. Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals).
The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London).

As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.
