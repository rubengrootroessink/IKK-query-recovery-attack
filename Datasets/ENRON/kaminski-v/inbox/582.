Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I was referred to you by Dr. Shi-Jie Deng of the
Georgia Tech School of ISyE. He suggested I send my
resume to you because of my interest in the Energy
Industry.

I will be receiving my master's degree in Quantitative
and Computational Finance from Georgia Tech in
December 2001. My academic background also includes a
strong emphasis on research, Mathematics, and Physics.

Attached is my resume for your review. I would greatly
appreciate the opportunity to discuss my interest in a
position with Enron and will contact you within a
week. If you'd prefer to contact me, I can be reached
during the evening at (404) 451-6432, or by email.
Thank you in advance and I look forward to speaking
with you.

Sincerely,

Alexander Panoutsakos
327523 Georgia Tech Station
Atlanta, GA 30332
