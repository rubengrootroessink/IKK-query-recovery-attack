Vince,

The previous time I sent this it appeared not to be delivered by your
system.  I am resending.  I apologize if you get more than one of these
emails.
We are looking forward to you presenting at the conference.   In regards
to your topic for the conference, the theme of the 2001 Electric Market
Forecasting Conference market volatility and risks regional markets.
Several of the presenters will explore the underlying drivers in the
respective markets that will effect market price and value of positions.
Others will be exploring Electric and Gas Forward Markets and Gas and
Oil Hedging Strategies.

Please consider one of the following topics:
*	Western U.S. Markets:  Issues and Understanding Western Markets
*	Key Principles (and Strategies) for Managing Positions in
Volatile Energy Markets
The intent of the presentations is to get to the heart of emerging
electric market issues and increase awareness of the big issues and
principles that will give the attendees insights.  However, as Warren
indicated, please feel free to select your own topic related to the
conference theme.

Listed below are the topics by the other presenters.

Just let me know the topic you would like to address.  I am very willing
to discuss this with you over the phone if that would be helpful.
Regards,
Lee
