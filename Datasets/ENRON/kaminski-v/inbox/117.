Vince/Shirley:

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.
Paulo Issler
