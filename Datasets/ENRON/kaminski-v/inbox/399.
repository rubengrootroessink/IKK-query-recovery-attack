Vince,
 
All's okay with Jeff Shankman re. charging us for one of your managers.
 
Let's move forward on this as soon as possible--I have some momentum building and need to keep pushing our group ahead.
 
When you designate someone from your group for this role I would like to involve him in the hiring of their own support team.  We already have a lead on a good quant. analyst and would like the input of whomever you select for this new role.
 
Thank you very much for your help and support.
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
Per our conversation earlier this month I discussed with Vince Kaminski the possibility of getting a quant. guy on permanent loan to our group to help manage the more complex analyses I want our guys to be doing.
 
Vince is amenable to letting us have one of his managers.  However, because is group is stretched thin and he wants to keep his headcount flat, he would want to hire a replacement and charge the manager we get to us.
 
I would also want to hire an analyst to help this quant. guy with general research ideas and data gathering.
 
Is this acceptable to you?
 
Jeff
