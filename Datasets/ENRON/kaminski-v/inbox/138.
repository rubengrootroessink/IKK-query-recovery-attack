Vince, 
   As I mention Milan Kratka mentioned your name to me.  I am a financial recruiter with about 15 years of experience.My practice involves financial engineers up and down the senority ranks in many roles....derivative trading & research, Risk Mgt, statistical equity trading, convertible arb, commodity derivatives....etc.  
   Currently I am working with a specialty financial products company looking for a 2 to 5 year desk level quantitative analyst.  Probably a math or physics Phd....but one who can and has worked on day to day issues of a trading enviroment.  The products involved are weather and energy derivatives.  Position is in the New York Area. 
If anyone comes to mind a referral would be appreciated.  I am always open to talking to people whether they fit this particular role or others 
Happy Holidays...Best of luck 
Bob Long
