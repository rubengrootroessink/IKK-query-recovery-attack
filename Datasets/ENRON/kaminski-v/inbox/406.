Vince,

	As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have
established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class
recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy
industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as
possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up
an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable
resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global
Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth
(Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly
(Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on
the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired,
Shell Oil).

	Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a
leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the
industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would
be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to
organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it
may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
would agree to be on the Committee.

	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.

Best wishes,

Praveen
