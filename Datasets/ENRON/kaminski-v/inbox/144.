Dear Dr. Kaminski--
Chonawee Supatgiat has applied for a tenure-track faculty position in Decision
Sciences at the Fuqua School of Business, and he has listed you as a reference.
Do you have a letter of recommendation for him (ideally in electronic form)
and/or can you tell me anything about his research and teaching potential?
Thanks in advance for your help, and best wishes for the New Year.
                  Sincerely,
                                       --Bob
