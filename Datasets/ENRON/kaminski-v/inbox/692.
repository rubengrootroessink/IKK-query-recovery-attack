Dear prospect sponsors: In behalf of the Rice MBA students interested in th=
e Energy Industry I want to thank you for your interest in the Energy Club =
and present to you the club's program for the academic year 2001-2002.  We =
have a great number of opportunities and the attached program provides an o=
verview of the topics for the academic year 2001-2002.  I would like to tak=
e this opportunity to present to you how the club intends to involve and ed=
ucate the students' body on the Energy Industry, and I would also like to p=
resent the format we will use for this end. We have three levels that built=
 one upon the other.  The first level is a general understanding of the Ene=
rgy industry, (see Energy 101 event).  The second level it refers to the op=
portunities available for MBAs in the Energy industry, (see rest of the pro=
gram), and the third will focus on the opportunities/profiles in demand now=
, (no identified yet).   The format is a roundtable presentation in which r=
epresentatives from different companies bring they perspective and work exp=
erience, relative to the topic of the meeting.  Each roundtable has or will=
 have a leader and moderator; the leader is responsible for organizing the =
event and it is your reference.  Please contact the person associated to th=
e event if you are interested in participating in that specific roundtable.=
 If there is no name feel free to e-mail me.  The Energy club heavily depen=
ds on your participation and your support will definitely bring value to al=
l students in different ways.  You will also attract more talents, help stu=
dents to take a better-informed decision with regard to the professional fu=
ture, and establish a more intimate relationship, mutually beneficial for s=
tudents and companies. Next step.  This coming Friday we are hosting the En=
ergy 101 roundtable.  In this case the leader, Craig Parks, will have in th=
e panel students with relevant work experience in the Energy Industry.  Ple=
ase see the attached file if interested.  Next week I am going to submit th=
e Program to all first and second year students, I aspect to have the list =
of the moderators by the end of the next week.  I will promptly notify all =
of you. If you are not interested in receiving further information about th=
e Energy Club please e-mail me and I will withdraw your name from the list.=
  If you believe in this initiative an admiring comment is welcomed.  I wil=
l collect all your feedback and implement them if possible in this same aca=
demic year or leave them as guides for the next year. Thanks in advance for=
 your support, Sincerely,  Luigi CalabresePresidentRice University Energy C=
