Dear Mr. Kaminsky,

As a first year MBA student at Rice University I am searching for a summer
internship.  Peter Veruki informed me that you were impressed with the Rice
ALP students working at Enron and may have further opportunities available
for this summer.  Similar to the Enron ALP, I worked on an Action Learning
Project with Phillips Petroleum which involved a pension fund analysis along
with recommendations delivered to senior management.
Prior to beginning my studies at Rice,  I worked as a programmer with El
Paso Energy, working on a proprietary energy trading system
I would like to speak with you concerning opportunities at Enron for this
summer.  Please call me at your earliest convenience.  I can be reached at
home at (281) 480-4894.  I have attached my resume for your consideration.

Thank you,
Aijaz Syed
