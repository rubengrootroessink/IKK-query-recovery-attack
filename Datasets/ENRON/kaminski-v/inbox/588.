Vince, 
My name is Randy Katz.  We met earlier this fall when you spoke to Dr. Ron's Energy Finance class at the University of Texas-Austin.  I spent my summer working for Lloyd Will on the power floor, and recently accepted an offer to return to Enron full-time as an associate.
Obviously, I've watched the events of the last few weeks very carefully, and I am wondering if you can provide any perspective on what's happened.  In addition, though I know this will be difficult, I'd be interested to know your views on the future of the combined entity.
I respect your opinions, and look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Randy
