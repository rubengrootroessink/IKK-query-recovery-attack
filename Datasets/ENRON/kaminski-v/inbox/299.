Dear Speakers,
 
I understand how awfully busy you must all be at  this time, but I would appreciate a phone call or a quick email to confirm  that you ahve or have not, for that matter received the speaker packets I sent  to you May 2, 2001.  please advise as soon as possible, that way, if yo  have not, for whatever received them, I will know what steps to take from  there.
 
All the best.
 
Sincerely,
 
Joanna Vidal
