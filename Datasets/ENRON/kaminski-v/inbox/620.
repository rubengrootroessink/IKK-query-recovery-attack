Title: Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.

*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive
capacity.

*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.
