Hi,

I am looking for a quant position within finance.

I have 6 months job experience as a risk analyst at
Bear Stearns. I was responsible for the Tokyo equity
derivatives desk.

I have a PhD in theoretical Physics. My PhD/postdoc
research involved numerical methods for PDEs and
adaptation of Monte-Carlo Simulated Annealing to
various problems.

I include my CV. Please let me know if you are
interested!

Best wishes,
Tom Weidig
