GLOBAL ENERGY CONFERENCE CALL: THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 10:00am EST

We would like to announce a unique opportunity to participate in a CERA Global
Energy Conference Call with OPEC President Chakib Khelil on OPEC's current oil
market strategy. Mr. Khelil has offered to discuss OPEC's current position with
CERA clients, while major market decisions are being made.

* What is the impact of current OPEC decisions on world oil prices?
* Is OPEC's decision really conditional on non-OPEC participation? What level
of non-OPEC participation is deemed sufficient?
* Market share versus price defense strategy
* Supply and demand assessment for next year
* After September 11, is the 22/28 $ price band still relevant?

Our speakers will address these topics for 30 minutes.
