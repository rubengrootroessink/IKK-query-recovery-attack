Dear Director Vince Kaminsky,

I am Alex Yu, an MBA student at Rice University. Peter
Veruki, Executive Director of Career Planning and
Admissions, told me that he and Dean Gilbert Whitaker
had breakfast with you today, and that you might be
interested in hiring a summer intern or part-time
helper.

I have received a Ph.D. in Finance, MS in Accounting,
and MS and BS in Computer Science. In the course of my
studies, I have learned a great deal about finance,
mathematics, and computer software. I am very
interested in working in your program at Enron as a
summer intern or a part-time employee. My resume is
attached. Thank you for your consideration.

Best wishes,

Alex Guang Yu
