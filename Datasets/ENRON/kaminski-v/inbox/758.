To Whom It May Concern:

I am respectfully submitting my resume to you for your review with hopes of
seeking a position your company.

I have been in the deregulated Natural Gas Industry for over 15 years,
primarily as a marketer, Director of Marketing and Marketing Manager selling
natural gas supplies to Large and Medium Industrial as well as Large General
Service endusers.  My area of marketing expertise is to customers behind
Local Distribution Companies (LDC'S) served by Columbia Gas Transmission
Corporation and CNG Gas Transmission Corporation including Columbia Gas of
Ohio, Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Columbia Gas of
Maryland, Columbia Gas of Virginia, West Ohio Gas Company, East Ohio Gas
Company, Mountaineer Gas Company, Hope Gas Company, and Peoples Natural Gas
Company of Pittsburgh.  In addition, I have had experience marketing natural
gas supplies on a retail and wholesale bases to endusers on Texas Eastern Gas
Transmission Corporation from the Southwest and Appalachian basin, Tennessee
Gas Transmission Corporation, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, and the
LDC's, which they serve.

Over the years I have been responsible for adding over $ 9,000,000 per year
in gross sales of One- (1) or multiyear term enduser contracts with the
companies of which I have been employed or contracted with on an Independent
Marketer status.  I have also been responsible for negotiating and
renegotiating enduser contracts for another like term at an average margin
well above the then current market place.  I have also been responsible for
purchasing supplies for resale for the companies, which I have represented.

During my tenure as a Natural Gas Marketer I have amassed a database well in
excess of 20,000 qualified potential endusers, which contains all pertinent
data to be most effective in the marketing of Natural Gas and potentially
Retail Electricity.

Attached you will find a resume of myself outlining in more detail my
responsibilities for the companies which I have been employed by.

After you have had the opportunity to review my resume I would like the
opportunity to discuss, in person or by phone teleconference my potential
employment opportunities with your company.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Sincerely, Roger M. Gray
