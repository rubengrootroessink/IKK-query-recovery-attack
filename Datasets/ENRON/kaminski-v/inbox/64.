Dear Vince,

Just to remind you, I will be graduating this May with an MBA from Rice.  My
concentration is in finance, but I'm also an undergraduate engineer from
Cornell University and an IT specialist.

I need help not simply finding a job, but perhaps some suggestions on how I
can differentiate myself from my classmates in my job search.  I've been
somewhat frustrated trying to explain why I'm more effective than my peers.
Mike Roberts even said that I achieved more for the weather group in three
months over the Summer than any other MBA achieved in a year.  This was
probably due to my technical background and ability to put models into
program code quickly and reliably.

I know this is a tough economy, but I just want a chance to do good work and
show quick success.  What I can't say in my resume is that I'm the best in
my class at finance, statistics, and information technology.  However, this
combination is also my biggest crutch.  I'd like to engage all my skills,
but typically, interviewers are only looking for one.

Do you have any leads to big or small companies that might be interested in
my skill set?  I'm indifferent to moving anywhere in the U.S.

Vince, in any case, I appreciate your time and any suggestions you could
offer.  I had a wonderful time working for you, we really had a good team.
If you have any questions for me, please call or email me at any time.

Sincerely,
Chris Pernoud

P.S. If your son ever wants to startup a linux company, I'd be interested in
helping, he could email me at cgp1@cornell.edu.
