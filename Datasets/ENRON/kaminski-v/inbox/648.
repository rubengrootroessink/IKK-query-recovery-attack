Vince

I manage the conference programme for Enron Europe and I have been co-ordinating Peter Styles' participation at Gas and PoweRisk, 6-8 November 2001.

With this taking place in Paris, I wanted to offer you our help should you require any assistance with liaison with the conference organiser, presentation support or hotel logistics.

Best regards
Kate
