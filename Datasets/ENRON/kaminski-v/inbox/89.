Vince, 

Thanks for the email.  This new message from Britt Davis is in response to a recently-received subpoena, and is just a precaution until we can discuss what is required with Wilmer Cutler.  Even though emails would have been deleted from your system we have retained the backup tapes so we have a complete record.  Please let me know if there are some that you wish to retrieve.

Thanks and have a happy New Year.

Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince
