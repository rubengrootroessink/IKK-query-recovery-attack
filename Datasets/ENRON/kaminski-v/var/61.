Jin & Winston,
I will look at the results of 2 runs,
but I will not look at the code unless it is in our Version Control System 
SCCS.

Please, put all your version under this system, as we used to do, and as we
discussed with you.

Thank you,

Tanya

Subject: The newvatrfacs program and testing data

Hi, Tanya:
 Two versions of the newvatrfacs program: with (V2) and without (V1) weight 
are listed in the location:

 /rms/prod/bin/tmp/V1 and /rms/prod/bin/tmp/V2 along with testing result for 
the effdate = '20-OCT-2000'.

 The testing results of the factors for a given NG-cluster (a constant list: 
clust.dat) are listed in
/rms/prod/bin/tmp.  (The files with name like s* are the results of a test 
run without "weight", while the files with name like t* are the results of a 
test run with "weight").

 All source codes are listed there, including the makefile and the 
excuteables.  Should you find any problem with the program, please let me 
know.

Jin
