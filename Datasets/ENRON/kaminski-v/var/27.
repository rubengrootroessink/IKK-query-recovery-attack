Tanya,

As we discussed in the last meeting, to simulate secondary power curve we 
need correlated jump sizes. This is totally different from the current 
secondary price curve simulation which assume the perfect correlation and 
also totally different from the secondary GAS basis curve simulation which is 
based on the hedging ratio.

There are two more issues on my side I need to resolve:
1. I want resolve the power basis curve issue.  Currently all power position 
on these basis curve are actually price positions.  We are hard coding this: 
if power basis we add basis to corresponding region curve.  I am trying to 
remove this hard coding by asking loading the price curve for all these basis 
locations.

2. Same is true for all those Power F curves.  These curves looks similar to 
those basis curves.  Currently we just directly map these F curves to the 
corresponding region curves.  I would also prefer to load the price curves 
instead of the price differences.

From research, I need those jump size correlations.

Clearly, all these involve many new development, unless we want to use 
simpler way to simulate secondary power curves.

Regards,

Winston

Jaesoo,
as we discussed last week on Wednesday meeting can you, please,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region. This involves 
the following:

1. Deciding together with Risk Control how many geographical regions we want 
to use
and which Enron's curves belong to each region.
2. Deciding together with Risk Control how to choose core curves for each 
region. This decision can 
be maid based on the a) position size; b) statistical analysis. There might 
be other considerations.
3. Doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core 
curve.

Winston,
can is it possible to run VAR for the clustering results obtained by Jaesoo 
with clustering done by SAS?
Should we wait for the stage re-fresh and what is the status on this? 

Tanya.
