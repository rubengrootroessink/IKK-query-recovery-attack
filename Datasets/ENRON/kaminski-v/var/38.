Tanya,
          I have checked the factors for US Power and all except the 
following are acceptable:
R11, R1C, R1F, R1J, R1K, R1L, R1M, R1N, R1Z, R4A, R4B.
          For Global Liquids, the requisite curves have been submitted to the 
liquids team.  I will review their results and confirm.
Naveen

Naveen,
attached spreadsheet contains the factors for US power curves calculated
based on 9/28/00-11/28/00 data in stage with the latest version of vatrfacs.
By specifying integer number from 1 to 32 in cell J1 you can see the factors 
for different regions.
I suggest to consider the following sets of factors as acceptable:
R1A, R1E,R2,R2A,R2B,R3,R3A,R3B,R4,R4C,R5,R5A,R6,R7,R7A,R8,R9.

Please review and confirm.

Tanya.
