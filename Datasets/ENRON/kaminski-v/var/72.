 Paul Bristow gave me a call a few minutes ago, and is sending over some 
info.  I also received an email yesterday relating to operational risk.  
Evidently CIBC has purchased some software to help quantify there exposure.

> GREENWICH, CT. July 11, 2000 - NetRisk, Inc., the risk management software
> and advisory firm, today announced that both Canadian Imperial Bank of
> Commerce (CIBC) and Erste Bank have purchased licenses to its RiskOps(tm)
> software product for measuring and managing enterprise-wide operational
> risk. Operational risk includes the risk of direct and indirect loss from
> causes as diverse as rogue trading to technology failures to improper
> sales practices.
>
> Erste Bank, the second largest Austrian bank, and Canadian Imperial Bank
> of Commerce, the second largest Canadian bank, plan to use RiskOps(tm) on
> a continuing basis to help evaluate and quantify their firm-wide
> operational risk capital. The results will be integrated into their
> Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC) and consolidated enterprise
> (market, credit and operational) risk measures. These measures will help
> both banks to better allocate resources, evaluate individual business
> units on a risk-adjusted basis and improve strategic decision-making.

> "We are delighted to continue our working relationships with CIBC and
> Erste Bank by offering the RiskOps(tm) solution to complete their
> operational risk measurement and management processes," says Dan Mudge, a

> of the regulators' minds and both CIBC and Erste Bank are taking leading
> positions in the industry by quantifying Capital at Risk by business

> decision making."
>
> "The formal inclusion of operational risk into our overall risk management
> framework has required a significant commitment of Erste Bank.
> RiskOps(tm) will be used to estimate Capital at Risk for each business,
> thereby creating an incentive for stronger risk management within the
> Bank," says Franz Reif Head of Risk Management of Erste Bank.  "In
> addition, we plan to work with Swiss Re New Markets to evaluate our risk
> financing alternatives to ensure our capital is being used most
> efficiently."

> developing in conjunction with Multinational Operational Risk Exchange(tm)
> (MORE(tm)), which includes CIBC, will significantly benefit the industry's
> ability to exchange loss and risk data."
>
> RiskOps(tm) incorporates a database of published operational risk losses
> from the financial services industry, combined with web-based software to
> allow users to understand operational risk, analyze loss probabilities,
> scale these losses to their firm and determine operational risk profiles,
> including operational Capital-at-Risk. The product displays graphical
> analyses of the causes, effects, probabilities and severities of
> operational risk, specific descriptions of events and measures to help
