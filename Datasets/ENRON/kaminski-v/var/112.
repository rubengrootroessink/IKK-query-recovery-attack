Hi Richard,

Lloyd Fleming introduced me to the key personnel on the trading and risk side 
at MG today; I spent most of today discussing forward curves and option 
volatilities with Tim Jones, Russell Plackett and Jon Barrett.  I hope to be 
able to get historical data from David Thompson to facilitate forward curve 
analysis for our VaR models.  Also discussed valuation issues (e.g. option on 
calendar spread that they need a model for).  Also was able to get a good 
understanding of trading strategies and nuances of aluminum, copper and 
nickel markets.

Regards,

Anjam

Deal entry
The need for 3 data-entry clerks becomes clearer when we understand that 
between 200 and 2000 manual deal tickets are written each day which then have 
to be keyed in.

Romulus
The trading assets of Rudolf Wolff in London and New York were bought after 
close of play on Friday.
Included with the metals trading is a proprietary FX desk, and a softs desk, 
trading coffee, cocoa, and sugar.
The softs people are expected to arrive in Enron House at the end of July.

EOL
Two metals trades have been executed on EOL.
