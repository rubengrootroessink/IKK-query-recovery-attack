I know nothing about this.  Since neither Research nor EnergyDesk know about 
it, all we can do is collect their requirements and provide what they're 
looking for as a new project.  This will require Vince's input since we'll 
essentially be sending Research models to the outside world.

Subject: VAR model - some questions

Hi Sharad,

Could you please have a look at below VAR model - the dll file should have 
been provided by Research (if some time back...)

Can you provide any information re 

What and how it does it?

Underlying assumptions?

Shortfalls?

Many thanks for your help!

Cheers,
