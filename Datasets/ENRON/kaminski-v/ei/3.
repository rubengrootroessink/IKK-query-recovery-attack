State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz=20


THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday Apr 27 2001
DPC board empowers MD to cancel MSEB contract

THE ENRON power project crisis on Thursday deepened with the board of Dabho=
l Power Company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to=
 the Maharashtra State Electricity Board even while international lenders t=
o the project asked Enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed wi=
th the MSEB.
The decision to authorise managing director Neil McGregor to issue "notice =
of termination on the contract to sell 740 MW of power" was taken after the=
 board prevented MSEB from voting on the ground that it was an interested p=
arty. The decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposi=
tion vote was cast by IDBI, sources said.=20

According to reports, financial institutions such as ANZ Investment Bank, C=
redit Suisse First Boston, Citibank, ABN-Amro and the State Bank of India h=
ave on Wednesday advised Enron against terminating its PPA with MSEB. MSEB =
chairman Vinay Bansal, who with two other directors attended the meeting on=
 Wednesday representing Maharashtra's 15 per cent stake in the near $3-bill=
ion project, said: "The Indian side told them that it would be unfortunate =
if Enron broke the contract." While Bansal declined comment on the board de=
cision, the sources said the Indian side had expressed its interest to hold=
s talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were pos=
sibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the =
state. (PTI)


THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Friday Apr 27 2001
MSEB pays Rs 134cr under 'protest' to DPC

 DESPITE the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head, M=
aharashtra State Electricity Board on Thursday made a "protest payment" of =
Rs 134 crore disputed amount, towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to Dabh=
ol. "We were ready with the payment on Wednesday itself, but DPC officials =
could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh", a senior MSEB off=
icial said. "We have disputed payment of Rs 12.64 crore and it would be now=
 taken up at the disputes resolution forum, of which Enron India managing d=
irector K Wade Cline and Krishna Rao are members", MSEB sources said.=20

Last week, DPC had dashed off a communication to the government and MSEB th=
at it would not accept "protest payments" anymore. Cline had said the energ=
y major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums, which MSE=
B in fact owed DPC in full and that the company would also not recognise th=
e "purported protest or reservation". MSEB had paid a Rs 113.5 crore Februa=
ry bill in protest last month. On April 23 last, both domestic and internat=
ional lenders of DPC had met in London and held exhaustive discussions the =
multinational's move to issue a termination notice to MSEB and state govern=
ment. (PTI)=20

BUSINESS STANDARD, Friday, April 27, 001
Enron India MD authorised to terminate PPA

The board of the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), at its meeting =
in London on Wednesday, authorised the managing director of Enron India to =
issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the Maharash=
tra State Electricity Board and the state government. "The board has author=
ised Wade Cline to serve the termination notice. However, this does not mea=
n that the termination notice will be served immediately. It is only an ena=
bling provision and will be used only if the situation arises," a state gov=
ernment source told Business Standard from London. He said DPC was under pr=
essure from its lenders.=20
The DPC spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue. The hardening of=
 the board's stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of DPC's lenders, who=
 had warned Enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notic=
e. The lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need =
not be served at this stage. Serving of the notice requires a nod from the =
lenders, who have an exposure of about $2 billion in the project. Sources s=
aid given the lenders' strong opposition to termination of the contract, th=
e Enron board's "enabling resolution" did not have much significance beyond=
 conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio. T=
he Maharashtra Chief Minister had warned Enron not to scuttle the process o=
f crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice. The state government i=
s to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the Dabhol contra=
ct.=20
Enron holds 65 per cent in DPC, while US-based GE and Bechtel hold 10 per c=
ent each. The balance 15 per cent is held by MSEB through a special purpose=
 vehicle, Maharashtra Power Development Corporation. The MSEB representativ=
es were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested pa=
rty. The IDBI representative protested against the board's decision. The me=
eting was attended by state energy secretary VM Lal. The meeting was held a=
gainst the backdrop of a dispute between MSEB and DPC over payment of bills=
.=20
After MSEB failed to pay Rs 102 crore towards the December 2000 bill, DPC i=
nvoked the state government's guarantee and then the Union government's cou=
nter guarantee. When payment of the Rs 127-crore January bill became overdu=
e, DPC again invoked the state government's guarantee. MSEB retaliated on J=
anuary 28, 2001 by slapping a Rs 401-crore penalty for non-supply of electr=
icity at adequate levels. It demanded that DPC adjust the bills against thi=
s penalty. "This stand of MSEB was explained to DPC at the board meeting", =
a state government official said. The Centre also supported MSEB's stand an=
d refused to honour the counter guarantee. The power company then invoked t=
he political force majeure clause. A process of conciliation and arbitratio=
n between the Centre and DPC is currently on.=20
THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, April 27, 2001
Foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to DPC , Sanjay Jog & Raghu Mo=
han
Global banks comfortable with Enron pull-out
Lenders to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are a sharply divided lot. Intern=
ational lenders, in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by=
 the the Industrial Develoment Bank of India (IDBI), are categorical that a=
dditional assistance to DPC's phase-II will be held in abeyance despite the=
 completion of 92 per cent of the project work.The stage is also set for a =
preliminary termination notice to be served by DPC to the Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board (MSEB) within the next four weeks.This follows the autho=
risation given to Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline and DPC pres=
ident & CEO Neil McGregor to serve the termination notice, and transfer not=
ices to MSEB, following Wednesday's DPC board meeting in London.
The essence of the message from the international lenders following the Lon=
don meeting with DPC board is: Emotions do not work. Contractual obligation=
s and payments have to be met. We are convinced that the MSEB has failed to=
 meet its obligations. There is no point in Enron continuing with the proje=
ct and the company should get out of it.The structuring of DPC's debt has c=
reated two classes of lenders. In phase-I, international lenders are covere=
d by a sovereign guarantee while in phase-II, no lender is. However, all le=
nders have a parri passu charge, making attachment of assets a messy affair=
.
Sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t=
o phase-II of the project are worried that an awry DPC project will affect =
their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets -=
 like a sovereign cover. "It was this desperation that made local lenders l=
ike IDBI slash the interest rates a few months back to 16.5 per cent from 2=
1.5 per cent," a leading foreign banker pointed out.Three points that were =
made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were=
: a) there are contractual obligations b) MSEB was not punctual in its paym=
ents to DPC and c) MSEB adopted a confrontational position by slapping a Rs=
 401 crore rebate charge on DPC for misdeclaration and default on the avail=
ability of power.
While local lenders led by IDBI - with MSEB parroting the same - were of th=
e view that the current situation is a temporary one, international lenders=
 were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out. This i=
s despite the stance taken by IDBI and MSEB that authorisation for terminat=
ion given to Mr Cline and Mr McGregor was not called for. International ban=
kers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges an=
d protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapp=
ed in its present form.The points of contention are: a) that phase-I of DPC=
 is backed by a sovereign guarantee b) phase-II is not and c) to the extent=
 that phase-II is covered by assets, cancellation of phase-II may see all a=
ssets - even those under phase-I - getting attached. Therefore, an examinat=
ion on the segregation of assets under phase-I and phase-II is now warrante=
d.
PTI adds: In a significant move, DPC board has empowered its management to =
sever power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could inflict a financi=
al liability of about Rs 2840 crore on the Centre. A decision to authorise =
DPC president Neil McGregor to issue a termination notice to MSEB for sale =
of power was taken by the board at its meeting on Wednesday.=20
THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Friday, April 27, 2001
Enron: Dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the MSEB

THE BOARD of Dabhol Power Company, a subsidiary of Houston-based Enron Corp=
, has decided to warn the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) that i=
t intends to pull the plug on its Guhagar-based project.In a board meeting =
held in London on Wednesday, the board decided to authorise DPC President a=
nd CEO Neil McGregor and Enron India's managing director K Wade Cline to se=
rve a ''preliminary'' termination notice for sale of power to the MSEB with=
in the next four weeks.The Dabhol project has been mired in disputes since =
MSEB began missing payments last year. MSEB owes Dabhol Power $48 million f=
or power delivered in December and January. The payment ran into a dispute =
after MSEB slapped penalty notices of Rs 401 crore on DPC for its failure t=
o supply power within three hours of the demand being placed.But MSEB has p=
aid $24 million for February. And a payment of $31 million was made for Mar=
ch on Thursday.
The $3 billion Dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in Ind=
ia to date. Issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable Dabhol =
to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes.While a preliminary=
 termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead=
 to the abandonment of the project by Enron, analysts have described the de=
cision as a ''procedural'' move consistent with DPC's negotiating strategy =
to recover overdue payments from the MSEB.
After the company issues the preliminary termination notice, step two would=
 be an official termination notice, and step three would be a notice that t=
he company is surrendering control of the project. If the project is termin=
ated, the government of India will have to take a hit of $300 million besid=
es paying bills of Rs 1,500 crore for the next one year to Enron as penalty=
. ''Our (Centre's) liability, if Dabhol power project is terminated, would =
be one year's electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million,'' Pow=
er Secretary A K Basu said.''Contractually, the Centre will have to pay one=
 year's electricity bill, totalling at present prices about Rs 1,400-1,500 =
crore, and take over DPC's debt, which stands at around $300 million, if th=
e project was terminated,'' Basu said in Delhi. Dabhol Power is in the proc=
ess of completing the second phase of the 2,184-megawatt power-plant projec=
t, which is 95 per cent through.
While the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company=
 to get out of the project, Indian lenders, led by IDBI, are asking the com=
pany to reconsider its decision on its termination notice. During the meeti=
ng in London, MSEB which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project, had stro=
ngly opposed DPC's move to authorise Cline and McGregor to issue notices fo=
r termination.
MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal and technical director Prem Paunikar - both dire=
ctors on the DPC board - and the state principal secretary (energy) VM Lal,=
 an invitee to the board, raised the issue at the board meeting in London. =
MSEB claimed that DPC was needlessly ''threatening'' to issue various arbit=
ration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of PPA in isolation.In =
recent weeks, Dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the MSEB, deliv=
ering a notice of political force majeure to Maharashtra - a step typically=
 invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war, coup, o=
r a similar radical political event. In this case, DPC's move was viewed as=
 a threat to stop providing electricity.DPC has come under fire because of =
the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to the company chargi=
ng Rs 7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with around Rs 1.5 a kilo=
watt-hour charged by other suppliers.
THE HINDU, Friday, April 27, 2001
Offer of renegotiation 'too late': Enron, By Mahesh Vijapurkar=20
MUMBAI, APRIL 26. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, which last nigh=
t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its P=
ower Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,=
 has decided to keep a stiff upper lip. This, in turn, has stoked speculati=
on that the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent, whi=
le in reality, a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within =
the PPA.=20
As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden deat=
h of the project'' and in all probability, the DPC, vexed with the developm=
ents, including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole Committee, ha=
s chosen to only arm itself with a serious option. ``This would only eventu=
ally come into effect. It is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal =
work is involved''. Apparently, the DPC intends to do some arm-twisting.=20
At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initiall=
y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contenti=
ons on the project, the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board th=
at the offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late''. It also said it=
 did not see any room for optimism about the outcome. It did not, however, =
rule out the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the de=
cision to authorise termination was a new weapon.=20
The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC w=
ould not take any ``harsh step'' which would cause lot of damage to the int=
erests of both the independent power producer and the Government and today =
he expressed his dismay. In fact, the mandate of the team that went, on the=
 strength of its stake in the DPC, was to put across the idea that negotiat=
ion was the requirement and not confrontation.=20
Echo in LS=20
The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister=
, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Ce=
ntre Rs. 2,840 crores, whose liability in the project agreement was limited=
. The Centre's liability in case of termination is one year's electricity b=
ill and a termination fee of $300 million.=20
Blow to FIs=20
The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial In=
stitutions (FIs) which, under the leadership of the IDBI, were trying to co=
nvince the other lenders of the project against the notice. The exposure of=
 Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee=
 either of the Centre or the State.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday ,27 April 2001
Enron ready to pull out, but lenders say wait=20

The Dabhol Power Company board, which met on Wednesday in London, authorise=
d the company management to issue a termination notice to the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board. The company, however, may not pull out of the proje=
ct yet, considering its lenders, who met on Monday, opposed such a move and=
 favoured renegotiations. Sources present during both the meetings said tha=
t though foreign lenders supported Enron on the termination issue, domestic=
 financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, p=
revailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move. Enron need=
s the lenders' consent to file a pre-termination notice for pulling out fro=
m the project. The decision to empower DPC chief Wade Cline to issue a term=
ination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single IDBI vot=
e against such a move.=20
Another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the =
financial institutions made it clear that further funding of Phase II of th=
e project will depend on the Government of India assuring payment mechanism=
s. Institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned pac=
kage, which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project. ``The=
 board has given powers to Wade Cline to issue a pre-termination notice. Bu=
t the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to termina=
te the project but to initiate serious re-negotiation proceedings,'' said M=
SEB Chairman Vinay Bansal, who attended the board meeting. ``MSEB presented=
 their views to the board members and it was understood by Enron which also=
 included the Rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration p=
roceedings. ``We have also made it clear that the tariff structure of Enron=
 is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable," Bansal a=
dded.=20
``They cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our expo=
sure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans=
 in that direction,'' said a top banker who was present during the lenders'=
 meet. ``There is a general consensus that the project must be completed an=
d the proposal to terminate the PPA should be kept in abeyance,'' he added.=
 The global arrangers for the DPC include ANZ Investment Bank, Credit Suiss=
e First Boston, ABN-AMRO, Citibank and the State Bank of India, where all t=
hese parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials. Howeve=
r, some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one =
lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proce=
edings.=20
Meanwhile, in a clear reversal of roles, Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasra=
o Deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the P=
PA. ``We will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since th=
at would be bad news for all of us, including DPC,'' Deshmukh said. Deshmuk=
h was echoing Union Power Minister Suresh Prabhu's sentiments, who said tha=
t the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row. He, howe=
ver, added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investmen=
ts, and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $2.9 billion pro=
ject would be a blow to India's efforts to woo foreign investors.=20
The DPC has already slapped one conciliation notice on the Centre and three=
 arbitration notices on the state government over non-payment of dues amoun=
ting to Rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for December 2000 a=
nd January 2001. Meanwhile, MSEB officials said in Mumbai that the March bi=
lls amounting to Rs 134 crore was paid on Thursday as protest payment, desp=
ite the dispute over the amount.=20
When asked on the future course of action, Bansal said it was up to the DPC=
.

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, April 27, 2001
DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice=20
THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has authorised the Man=
aging Director, Mr Neil McGregor, to issue the notice of intent to terminat=
e its power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity=
 Board (MSEB) ``at an appropriate time''. The decision was taken at a board=
 meeting held in London yesterday. ``While MSEB, which is an `interested pa=
rty', was not allowed to vote, it made a presentation clarifying its stand =
on the matter,'' a senior State Government official said.=20
The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice =
was carried by six votes to one. IDBI voted against the decision, the offic=
ial said. The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a =
six-month ``suspension period''. According to clause 17.8 of the Terminatio=
n Procedure, of the PPA: ``Following the giving of a preliminary terminatio=
n notice, the parties shall consult for a period of six months (or such lon=
ger period as they may agree) as to what step shall be taken with a view to=
 mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the=
 circumstances...''=20
IDBI and State Bank of India, the principal Indian lenders, had earlier per=
suaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice=
 for some more time. At least one lender has to consent for the company to =
serve termination notice. It is understood that overseas lenders are in fav=
our of termination of the project and are prepared to consent. However, dom=
estic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PPA i=
s abandoned mid-way.=20
According to institutional sources, Indian lenders are trying to get all th=
e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues. The Maharashtra and C=
entral Governments too are in favour of a conciliation. Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk=
h, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, yesterday went on record that the State d=
id not want the project terminated. Mr Yashwant Sinha, Union Finance Minist=
er, is also understood to be of the same opinion. ``The DPC will now have t=
o decide what is the `appropriate time' to serve the notice,'' the official=
 said. MSEB pays Rs 134 crore: Meanwhile, MSEB has paid DPC Rs 134 crore to=
wards its March 2001 bill. MSEB officials confirmed that the bill was paid =
`in protest'' today morning. ``They (DPC) had billed us for an amount of Rs=
 146 crore. We do not agree with some of the items included,'' a senior MSE=
B official said.=20
THE PIONEER, Friday, April 27, 2001
Enron testing Maharashtra's nerves, T N Raghunatha
Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has begun to put fresh pressure on the Maharasht=
ra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Maharashtra State Government and the=
 Centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them, if t=
he DPC Board of Directors' decision to authorise its managing director to s=
erve a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication.
The DPC Board, in its meeting in London on Wednesday, empowered the company=
 management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that coul=
d inflict a financial liability of Rs 2,840 crore on the Centre. The decisi=
on to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB wa=
s taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government representa=
tives were prevented from voting on the ground of "interested party".
When contacted, the company's Mumbai-based spokesperson, Mr Jimmy Mogal, de=
clined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the DPC Board.=
 "We have nothing to say on the reports emanating from London. We will expr=
ess our views after a few days," he said. However, Maharashtra Chief Minist=
er Vilasrao Deshmukh on Thursday termed the DPC board's decision as "unfort=
unate". "We have already requested the company not to take any harsh decisi=
on", Mr Deshmukh said in Mumbai.=20
Official sources in the State Energy Ministry interpreted the DPC Board's d=
ecision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the =
MSEB to clear the pending power bills without any further delay. Through it=
s tough posture, the DPC wants to make its position stronger before it can =
formally agree for re-negotiations with the MSEB, the Centre and the State =
Government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the State elect=
ricity board. The sources said that the DPC's reported decision to authoris=
e its managing director to stop electricity supply to the MSEB did not mean=
 that the Enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of th=
e power contract with the MSEB.
"If anything, the DPC's reported decision is to mount additional pressure o=
n the MSEB for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronge=
r position in settling its dispute with the MSEB. As part of its plan to ar=
m itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its =
control, the DPC had recently served a political force majeure to the MSEB,=
 the Centre and the State Government," the sources said.Not surprisingly, t=
he DPC's London decision comes on the heels of the Maharashtra Government's=
 decision to set up a high-level committee, comprising representatives of t=
he MSEB, the Centre and the State Government to re-negotiate with the Enron=
's subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the State =
electricity board.Meanwhile, amidst the threat of a possible termination no=
tice hanging on its head, the MSEB on Thursday made a "protest payment" of =
the Rs 134 crore disputed amount towards March bill of Rs 146.64 crore to D=
PC.

Enron threatens to pull out
=20
 The Enron crisis deepened with the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power =
Company deciding to authorise the managing director, Mr K Wade Cline, to se=
rve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $2.9=
 billion power project.The decision, which could lead to the cessation of D=
abhol's power supply to the state, was taken at the meeting held yesterday =
in London according to reports quoting the chairman of the Maharashtra Stat=
e Electricity Board, Mr Vinay Bansal.=20
While DPC officials refuse to comment on anything, it is learnt that MSEB w=
as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days bef=
ore the meeting.MSEB was said to have been dissuaded by the Nationalist Con=
gress Party president, Mr Sharad Pawar, and union power minister Mr Suresh =
Prabhu, who had talks in New Delhi with the Maharashtra chief minister, Mr =
Vilasrao Deshmukh, and an MSEB delegation last Monday.
The state government has been served two arbitration notices while the Cent=
re is ready to go for conciliation with the DPC for failing to honour its c=
ounter-guarantee.Further, the DPC has already slapped a notice of political=
 force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event=
 of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step.The union power minist=
er, Mr Suresh Prabhu, contended in Delhi that since DPC contributed only 0.=
7 per cent of the total energy output of the country, its termination would=
 not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation.=20
However, if terminations proceedings go through, Enron Corp, a 65 per cent =
share-holder in the Dabhol Power Company, would stand to net a hefty amount=
 in damages. The union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termi=
nation of the DPC would cost the Centre Rs 1,800 crore, which is the total =
of one years' electricity bill and a termination fee of $300 million. Accor=
ding to an energy analyst, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, the total liability would not=
 cross Rs 350 crore. However Mr Prabhu said in the Lok Sabha today that the=
 that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Centre Rs 2,840 crore.It is=
 learnt that on 20 April, Mr Deshmukh had given the go-ahead to the MSEB to=
 prepare a legal notice to be issued to Enron during the meeting of the DPC=
's Board of Directors on Wednesday. At the meeting, the energy minister, Pa=
damsinh Patil, energy secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal and MSEB chairman Mr Vi=
nay Bansal, were also present.The notice was prepared over the past weekend=
 and taken by the delegation when they called on Mr Prabhu on 24 April. How=
ever, the politicians convinced them that Enron would not get tough, given =
its huge stake in the project, and that such a notice would not be necessar=
y. The meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff=
, with Enron's consent.
Among those present at the London meeting were Mr Lal, Mr Bansal and MSEB t=
echnical director, Mr P Paunikar, in their capacity as directors. However, =
they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party. The =
only vote to go against the decision was that of the IDBI which is also rep=
resented on the board, it is learnt.The chief minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmuk=
h, said the state was not in favour of terminating the project. This could =
mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm-twist the Indian authorities could ac=
hieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past=
 three months cleared.The MSEB owes Enron Rs 146.64 crore for March 2001 an=
d Rs 229 crore for December 2000 and January 2001.The Centre today put up a=
 brave face on Enron's decision saying there would not be any adverse effec=
t on foreign investment in power sector in the country, PTI reported from N=
ew Delhi.
"There will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic =
or foreign company. As far as we are concerned there will be no adverse imp=
act on FDI in power sector," Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters wh=
en asked about DPC's decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio=
n notice to MSEB.Emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decisio=
n, Prabhu said after the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affai=
rs "we are expecting cooperation from many Scandinavian countries as well a=
s European nations in the power sector."In fact not only the Power Minister=
 but also the Prime Minister of Norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on =
power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector."

'DPC may not wind up'
Maharashtra Chief Secretary V Ranganathan has said that though Neil McGrego=
r, managing director of the Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC), has been given =
complete powers with regard to DPC's operations in the state, including the=
 authority to wind up operations, it does not necessarily mean that McGrego=
r will issue such a termination notice. McGregor was given the powers at a =
meeting of the DPC board in London on Wednesday. Ranganathan said that stat=
e officials, including Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman =
Vinay Bansal and Power Secretary V M Lal, have reported back to him about t=
he meeting in London.
With regard to the state's failure to pay Enron, Ranganathan said, " Bills =
are prepared as per the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and DPC owes some mo=
ney to us. Our people informed Enron officials about this.. In fact, there =
was no reason to give powers to the MD to slap a termination notice."In the=
 London meeting, MSEB and Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) repre=
sentatives insisted that the DPC must pay Rs 411 crore since it could not s=
upply power whenever needed.=20
Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the deci=
sion of the board of the Enron-promoted DPC to give McGregor powers to wind=
 up operations. Deshmukh added, " We have already requested Enron not to ta=
ke any harsh decision."Deshmukh had earlier said, " We have directed state =
Government officials attending the DPC board meeting to desist the energy c=
ompany from winding up operations in the state, as it would be harmful to b=
oth of us."
Enron officials are keeping mum on the issue. McGregor said, " I am not goi=
ng to give any comment."

Enron offers 'no comment' on renegotiation, H S Rao
A crucial meeting of the Board of Directors of the Dabhol Power Company (DP=
C), promoted by the US energy major Enron, was held here yesterday apparent=
ly to discuss fate of its $900-million power project in Maharashtra, but th=
ere was no official word on the Indian and state Governments' decision to r=
enegotiate the contract.=20
An Enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting, sayi=
ng the issues discussed at the meeting were 'confidential' . " We have not =
received any direct communication. Unless we get it and evaluate the detail=
s, we have no comments to make," the spokesman said when asked about the pr=
oposed decision on re-negotiation of the project in which the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) has 15 per cent stake.
Asked whether the Board had taken a decision on empowering DPC Managing Dir=
ector Neil McGregor to wind up its operations in India, the spokesman said =
he had nothing to say on them. Enron has reportedly authorised Mcgregor to =
look at various options including selling the company's stake in DPC. Mahar=
ashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said in Mumbai that the state Gover=
nment would pay up the undisputed dues to the company. He said the Maharash=
tra government " is not in favour of terminating the 2184-MW project, but w=
anted an amicable solution to the imbroglio."

Committee to renegotiate Enron deal
A committee to renegotiate the Power Purchase Agreement with the Dabhol Pow=
er Company will be appointed by this evening, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshm=
ukh said today. Addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted s=
ocial reformer Anna Hazare at his official residence Varsha, Deshmukh said =
the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow, at the most.H=
e termed as unfortunate the Enron board decision empowering DPC chief Neil =
McGregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the Maharashtra State=
 Electricity Board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wi=
th power company.
" Renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the Godbole co=
mmittee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotia=
ting committee. We don't want to take any hasty decision," Deshmukh saidHe =
pointed that the only bone of contention with the DPC had been its expensiv=
e tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably.When pointed t=
hat the Enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state=
=19 s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee, Chief Minister said=
 it was unfortunate.
Earlier, in his meeting with Hazare, Deshmukh promised to make necessary am=
endments to the Right to Information law recently passed by the state so th=
at the information was easily accessed by the common people. He also gave a=
 patient hearing to Hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state=
 departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry wi=

 'ENRON'S ON!'=20
State govt. to renegotiate Dabhol Power Project , By Hubert Vaz=20
The US power giant, Enron Power Corporation's willingness to wrap up the Da=
bhol Power Project and leave the shores may not actually materialise, thoug=
h the Dabhol Power Company chief, Mr. Wade Cline, has been authorised to do=
 so, since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the mat=
ter.=20
Disclosing this, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed this morning th=
at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the p=
ower project at Dabhol could be continued, and at the same time Enron did n=
ot feel slighted. "Enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision. We=
 are waiting for their letter," he said. When asked what sort of compromise=
 the state government plans to forge, Mr. Deshmukh said, "Let our officers =
come back. After that we will decide a future course of action. But we are =
definitely going in for renegotiation of the project. It is very difficult =
to predict the outcome of Enron's decision but as of now the project is sti=
ll on." When asked whether the project could be moved to another state, if =
wound up from Maharashtra, Mr. Deshmukh said, that was not possible as per =
the terms of the agreement between the US company and the state government.=
 However, it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself,=
 he indicated. He also confirmed that both parties would face considerable =
losses if the project was terminated.=20
The board of directors of the Dabhol Power Company, which met in London on =
Wednesday, decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje=
ct once and for all by empowering the DPC chief to terminate the project, i=
f he deemed it fit. However, this decision, as of now, does not necessarily=
 indicate the death knell for the project. The Enron project, which had bee=
n riddled with controversies right from its inception, had been a pretext f=
or the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from ti=
me to time. The previous Sena-BJP government, which had been out to termina=
te the project, however, chose to continue with it following renegotiations=
 with Enron's top visiting officials like Ms. Rebecca Mark. And, the Democr=
atic Front government inherited the controversial project when the governme=
nts changed hands a year and a half ago.=20
Meanwhile, State Energy Minister Dr. Padamsinh Patil, when contacted at the=
 Osmanabad Circuit House, said the state government and the central governm=
ent have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project wi=
th Enron. "It is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like tha=
t. They will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for b=
oth sides," he said. In case the project is terminated, the government can =
still manage the power needs of the state, though it would be a bit tough j=
ob, he added.=20
