THE HINDU, Friday, April 27, 2001
Offer of renegotiation 'too late': Enron, By Mahesh Vijapurkar=20
MUMBAI, APRIL 26. The Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company, which last nigh=
t=20
authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its Pow=
er=20
Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, has=
=20
decided to keep a stiff upper lip. This, in turn, has stoked speculation th=
at=20
the switching off of power from its Phase I plant was imminent, while in=20
reality, a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the PP=
A.=20
As one source familiar with the PPA told The Hindu, ``it is not sudden deat=
h=20
of the project'' and in all probability, the DPC, vexed with the=20
developments, including sharp and pointed observations by the Godbole=20
Committee, has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option. ``This woul=
d=20
only eventually come into effect. It is not an overnight operation and a lo=
t=20
of legal work is involved''. Apparently, the DPC intends to do some=20
arm-twisting.=20
At the board of directors meeting in London, which Maharashtra was initiall=
y=20
disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention=
s=20
on the project, the DPC squarely told the MSEB nominees on the board that t=
he=20
offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late''. It also said it did no=
t=20
see any room for optimism about the outcome. It did not, however, rule out=
=20
the option of talks, thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to=
=20
authorise termination was a new weapon.=20
The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, had hoped that DPC=
=20
would not take any ``harsh step'' which would cause lot of damage to the=20
interests of both the independent power producer and the Government and tod=
ay=20
he expressed his dismay. In fact, the mandate of the team that went, on the=
=20
strength of its stake in the DPC, was to put across the idea that negotiati=
on=20
was the requirement and not confrontation.=20
Echo in LS=20
The Enron issue also echoed in the Lok Sabha today where the Power Minister=
,=20
Mr. Suresh Prabhu, said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the Cent=
re=20
Rs. 2,840 crores, whose liability in the project agreement was limited. The=
=20
Centre's liability in case of termination is one year's electricity bill an=
d=20
a termination fee of $300 million.=20
Blow to FIs=20
The termination could prove to be a serious blow to the Indian Financial=20
Institutions (FIs) which, under the leadership of the IDBI, were trying to=
=20
convince the other lenders of the project against the notice. The exposure =
of=20
Indian FIs in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee=

either of the Centre or the State.=20

which is crucial for completing the Phase II expansion project. ``The board=

THE HINDU BUSINESSLINE, Friday, April 27, 2001
DPC board authorises MD to issue PPA termination notice=20
THE board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has authorised the=20
Managing Director, Mr Neil McGregor, to issue the notice of intent to=20
terminate its power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Maharashtra State=20
Electricity Board (MSEB) ``at an appropriate time''. The decision was taken=
=20
at a board meeting held in London yesterday. ``While MSEB, which is an=20
`interested party', was not allowed to vote, it made a presentation=20
clarifying its stand on the matter,'' a senior State Government official=20
said.=20
The resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice=
=20
was carried by six votes to one. IDBI voted against the decision, the=20
official said. The serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead =
to=20
a six-month ``suspension period''. According to clause 17.8 of the=20
Termination Procedure, of the PPA: ``Following the giving of a preliminary=
=20
termination notice, the parties shall consult for a period of six months (o=
r=20
such longer period as they may agree) as to what step shall be taken with a=
=20
view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to=
=20
all the circumstances...''=20
IDBI and State Bank of India, the principal Indian lenders, had earlier=20
persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination=20
notice for some more time. At least one lender has to consent for the compa=
ny=20
to serve termination notice. It is understood that overseas lenders are in=
=20
favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent. However,=
=20
domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the PP=
A=20
is abandoned mid-way.=20
According to institutional sources, Indian lenders are trying to get all th=
e=20
parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues. The Maharashtra and=20
Central Governments too are in favour of a conciliation. Mr Vilasrao=20
Deshmukh, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, yesterday went on record that the=

a contract termination notice to the MSEB is any indication.
The DPC Board, in its meeting in London on Wednesday, empowered the company=

management to sever its power supply agreement with MSEB, a move that could=

inflict a financial liability of Rs 2,840 crore on the Centre. The decision=

to authorise the DPC management to issue a termination notice to MSEB was=

taken by a vote of six to one after the Maharasthra Government=20

decision as a pressure tactic employed by the Enron subsidiary to force the=
