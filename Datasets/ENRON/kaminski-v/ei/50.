Dear Mr. Fujita:

I will be glad to make the dinner arrangements.  I will make reservations at
the "LaTour D'Argent" Restaurant located at 2011 Ella Blvd at T. C. Jester.
for 6:30 PM on the 17th.  They do require a coat.

I believe most of the cabs will know where it is - but just in case:

"Take I-45 North to 610 East, go to the Ella Blvd exit and turn left (back
under the freeway) on Ella Blvd.  Go to 2011 Ella Blvd. (on the right)."

Look forward to having you at Enron.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw

Dear Ms. Crenshaw:

   We are very glad to see Professor Kaminski has taken our proposal to have 
a dinner on
17th. I would like to take your very kind offer to arrange the place to have 
dinner. We
are now arranging to stay Four Seasons Hotel. It is just a second time to 
visit Houston
and we will not have a car, but may use a taxi between hotel and restaurant. 
Please give
us a recommendations. I wonder if Four Seasons have a good one.

Best regards,
