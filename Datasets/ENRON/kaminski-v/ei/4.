Vince,

From the sound of the articles, it appears ENE is ready to exit India, or a=
lternately to get into an arbitration battle.

I have scheduled some time with you at 10.30 to discuss.

Regards,
Sandeep.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS,April 23, 2001=20
Godbole's report unearths absurd calculations , Maharashtra could use this =
to wriggle out of the Dabhol project , Sucheta Dalal

It is finally Quit India time for Enron. Though the controversial multinati=
onal has denied plans to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), info=
rmed sources say that it has sent feelers to China Light & Power and others=
 to offload its majority holding.Getting out of India may be the best cours=
e for Enron. Though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force m=
ajeure, the Energy Review Committee headed by Madhav Godbole will certainly=
 weaken its case. The committee points out that the many "infirmities" in t=
he DPC approval process brings into question the "propriety of the decision=
s".

 It is clear that the $20m that Enron spent on educating India's policy-mak=
ers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of techno-economic a=
ppraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts. The=
 committee says it is "troubled with the failure of governance that seems t=
o have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on ma=
tters relating to DPC. The failure of governance has been broad, across dif=
ferent governments at different points of time, at both the state and the c=
entral level, and across different agencies associated with examining the p=
roject and at both the administrative and political levels. It strains beli=
ef to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigne=
d responsibilities is purely co-incidental".

Though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate=
 these infirmities, its two key members, Mr Godbole, and former secretary i=
n the Ministry of Finance, EAS Sarma, have asked for a judicial inquiry int=
o the process of clearing the DPC project. Other members felt a judicial in=
quiry would delay the negotiation process and "not serve any purpose". Ther=
e may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating=
 tariffs or facilitating Enron's exit, but the report certainly provides th=
e Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) with all the grounds that it needs to =
start an investigation.

CVC N Vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the d=
eal, especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign. Though the pol=
itical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry, the CVC=
 can establish whether there are lapses on the part of "government function=
aries including political executives" and ensure "appropriate action" again=
st them. If it is indeed able to establish "undue influence" in signing the=
 contract, then Maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently again=
st the public interest without any monetary liability.

The Godbole committee has vindicated the stand of anti-Enron activists who =
have been opposed it since negotiations began in 1994. It establishes that =
Enron power is expensive per se, and the project needs to be re-negotiated,=
 regardless of the causes for the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MS=
EB) financial distress. Also that DPC's extortionate tariffs are not merely=
 because of the steep rise in petro-product prices and rupee depreciation, =
but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government. Enr=
on's contract is clearly one-sided; it deliberately uses expensive raw mate=
rial (ignoring World Bank warnings), has worked on fanciful demand-supply e=
stimates and several legal requirements and permissions.

In fact, the committee has found that the MSEB has been paying Enron Rs 930=
 crore more than it should every year. This comprises overcharging of Rs 25=
3 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per =
cent of the capacity is used for DPC. There's also a Rs 100 crore extra bil=
ling to the MSEB for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thes=
e facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge. By charging =
more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the governm=
ent of India, Enron collects approximately Rs 246 crore extra every year. I=
t has also been collecting Rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel co=
nsumption claims. Enron has been charging at 1878 kcal/kwh under the power =
purchase agreement (PPA) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed=
 it a much lower consumption rate. This gives it a fat fuel arbitrage oppor=
tunity at the cost of the people of Maharashtra.=20

The committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four differ=
ent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation: a rate=
 of Rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan=
s, Rs 34.5 per dollar as reference rate for Phase-I, Rs 39.35 per dollar as=
 reference rate for Phase-II and a curious Rs 42 per dollar for calculating=
 Government of India tariff. Forcing a reduction of these excessive charges=
 has nothing to do with contract cancellation. All it needs is tough negoti=
ation and public pressure on the political establishment.=20

The Godbole committee has established that DPC's tariffs can easily be halv=
ed if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the doll=
arisation of payments, the take-or-pay clause and escrow facility (which is=
 in fact hampering MSEB's reform particularly in power distribution) are sc=
rapped.The security of future payments to DPC under the restructured tariff=
 would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system=
. The committee also gives Enron a difficult escape route. It says that if =
the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous, it sh=
ould free MSEB from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside Mah=
arashtra. The committee has tried to establish another precedent on all pro=
jects negotiated by government: "The public has a right to know what is bei=
ng contracted on their behalf" and has recommended that all documents, incl=
uding contracts related to all Independent Power Projects (IPPs), particula=
rly DPC, should be published by the Maharashtra government within two month=
s.

Also, having established that demand-supply estimates by the state governme=
nt were fanciful, the committee has asked MSEB to defer all negotiations wi=
th power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption =
of power generation from such IPPs. It recommends that such negotiations sh=
ould be in accordance with the least-cost plan spelt out by the report. Thi=
s should also end the hectic lobbying by Reliance (Patalganga), Mittals (Bh=
adravati), the BSES (Saphale) and others to set up IPPs in Maharashtra.

DPC board set to authorise president, Enron MD to issue notice of terminati=

Scrapping of Power Purchase Agreement

The board of directors of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which has already tak=
en an aggressive posture, has proposed to authorise the Enron India managin=
g director K Wade Cline and DPC president and chief executive officer Neil =
McGregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement (=
PPA) and transfer of Dabhol project in view of continuing default by the st=
ate and Central governments and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).

The board of directors, which would meet on April 25 in London, also plans =
to appoint Mr Cline as its "true and lawful Attorney-in-fact" and authorise=
 him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts a=
nd financing agreements and their amendments and modifications.Top sources =
told The Financial Express that DPC would authorise Mr Cline and/or Mr McGr=
egor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to t=
he state and Central governments and MSEB under clause 17 and schedule 11 o=
f the PPA.

"In response to the continuing default by the MSEB of its payment obligatio=
ns under the PPA, the failure of the Government of Maharashtra to honour ob=
ligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of th=
e Government of India to honour obligations under its counter guarantee, th=
e company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conci=
liation and arbitration proceedings," the company resolution said. "Consist=
ent with this recourse to contractual remedies, the company now seeks the a=
uthority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices purs=
uant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the PPA from time to time and at any t=
ime upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such =
notices as determined by the company," the resolution added.

According to the resolution, the directors, the company secretary and offic=
ers of the company and each of them acting individually, are authorised and=
 empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take s=
uch other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution,=
 in the name and for and on behalf of the company. Against this backdrop, t=
he state government and MSEB have been exploring the possibilities of issui=
ng termination notice to the DPC for its failure to meet the contractual ob=
ligations under the PPA. The state government and MSEB sources said that su=
ch a notice could be served by the MSEB as DPC has not paid the rebate (pen=
alty) of Rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of=
 power on January 28 and February 13.

The state government and MSEB, which reviewed its position on Saturday at a=
 meeting convened by the Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, are of the view =
that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio=
n notice to the DPC. The DPC's move to appoint Mr K Wade Cline as its "true=
 and lawful Attorney-in-fact" deserves importance especially when the state=
 government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit =
cost and gauge the possibility of sale of Dabhol power to the power deficit=
 states.

Mr Cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out =
or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the=
 ordinary course in amounts exceeding Rs 64 crore or the equivalent in fore=
ign currency in any financial year. Furthermore, Mr Cline would be in a pos=
ition to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relati=
ng to the day-to-day operation of the company's business or exercise its ri=
ghts and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the fina=
ncing agreements

DPC seeks OK to exit power project , Tamal Bandyopadhyay & S Ravindran=20

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is seeking the approval of it=

a tomorrow (April 23).The meeting has been convened in London at the initia=
tive of the company. The meeting is crucial as the DPC board is meeting on =
April 25 in London to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to =
the Maharshtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).
=20
DPC cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders.=
 While bankers said the lenders' meeting is about the second phase of the p=
roject, which is still under construction, state government officials clari=
fied that since there is only one PPA covering both phases of the project, =
the lenders' decision will be applicable to the existing Phase I also. The =
second phase of the project involves 1,444 MW generation capacity, whereas =
Phase I of 740 MW is already operational."According to the loan agreement, =
even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract t=
hen DPC can do so," highly placed sources in the lenders' consortium said f=
rom London.=20

This in effect means that only one lender has to agree for DPC to serve a p=

Enron winding up operations in India?=20

Marred by controversies since inception, the US-based energy major Enron-pr=
omoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) board will meet this Wednesday, April 25,=
 in London to decide the fate of its 2,184 MW project in Dabhol, including =
winding up of its operations. "The top most item on the agenda is to empowe=
r DPC Managing Director Neil McGregor to wind up operations in the country,=
" state government sources told PTI on Saturday. When contacted, DPC spokes=
person declined to comment on the agenda of the London meeting and added, "=
I will not like to comment on speculations."=20

Sources said a team comprising three top officials of Maharashtra State Ele=
ctricity Board (MSEB) including chairman Vinay Bansal would attend the high=
-profile board meet. Bansal told PTI that MSEB has decided to give a "fitti=
ng reply" and present its case concerning the Rs. 401 crore penalty that th=
e loss-making board slapped on DPC on February 28, for not generating requi=
red power within the stipulated time as per the Power Purchase Agreement (P=
PA).=20

This London meet comes two days after the international and domestic financ=
ial institutions sit together (April 23) to discuss DPC's future course of =
action in the wake of non-payment of dues to the tune of Rs. 223 crore by M=
SEB and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty.Over the payment of=
 dues of December 2000 and January of Rs. 102 crore and Rs. 111 crore respe=
ctively, sources said, both the state government and MSEB had offered to ma=
ke a "protest" payment as per the PPA, but DPC, India's first fasttrack pow=
er project, refused to accept on that condition.=20

Currently, Enron India holds 65 per cent in the US $900 million DPC project=
, which includes MSEB's 15 per cent while General Electric and Bechtel hold=
 10 per cent each. The controversial "now on now off" project began in 1992=
 but ran into rough weather after the Shiv Sena-BJP came to power and was s=
crapped only to be revived after renegotiating the PPA. Fresh trouble arose=
 in October last when MSEB began defaulting over the "enormous" billing fol=
lowing which DPC invoked the state and centre's counter guarantee and also =
recently sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the polit=
ical "forced majeure" implying inability to conform towards any financial c=
ommitment.

DPC had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50 =
per cent but according to Enron Corp's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skillin=

The Real Story Of Dabhol If a judicial probe, suggested by the committee, i=

IT BHUSHAN

"The Committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken=
 in respect of the Enron project at different points of time by successive =
governments and agencies in the Centre and state."
--Energy Review Committee headed by former home secretary Madhav Godbole

This could well be the real Enron story
A five-member high-powered committee headed by Madhav Godbole-and including=
 former Union economic affairs secretary E.A.S. Sarma, hdfc chairman Deepak=
 Parekh, teri chairman RajendraPachauri and Maharashtra government official=
 Vinay Mohan Lal-has recommended a judicial probe into the entire Enron pow=
er project deal saying it signified "the utter failure of governance that s=
eems to have characterised almost every step of the decision-making process=
 relating to the Dabhol project". The report, which was submitted to the Ma=
harashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by Outlook, is se=
verely critical of former chief minister Sharad Pawar (with the Congress th=
en), the 13-day bjp-led Union government which reworked the deal in 1996, S=
hiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and his government in Maharashtra head=
ed by Manohar Joshi

"The utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every s=
tep of decision-making relating to the Dabhol project." Madhav Godbole Comm=
ittee Report

An investigation, if ordered, could embarrass at least these three governme=
nts The report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by Enron=
 to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal. According to the co=
mmittee, the deal reveals failure of governance, both at the Centre and sta=
te, and across different agencies. "It strains belief to accept that such w=
idespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coin=
cidental," the report said, proposing a set of measures to be implemented i=
f something of the project was to be retrieved. Godbole and Sarma also felt=
 that the panel should categorically recommend the government of India to o=
rder a judicial inquiry. This was finally adopted by it. Says a Congress le=
ader: "Enron could well become the biggest political issue in Maharashtra a=
nd put to question liberalisation, particularly in the power sector."

The proposal has already struck panic. Says ncp's Praful Patel: "If the Enr=
on decision has at all been detrimental, it is because of the haste with wh=
ich phase 2 was cleared by the Shiv Sena-bjp government. Now with the state=
 having already entered into an agreement with Enron, the important thing i=
s to resolve it amicably. A judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it'=
s not an issue of corruption but that of perception."=20

Pro-market Congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the=
 Centre and the state which invited Enron, even though the second phase was=
 cleared by the bjp-Shiv Sena combine. Says Congress spokesperson Jaipal Re=
ddy: "Right now we're too involved with the Parliament deadlock  over Tehel=
ka." Pro-liberalisation Congress MPs also fear that such witch-hunting coul=
d send wrong signals to foreign investors. Non-Congress MPs from Maharashtr=
a, meanwhile, claim that the Godbole Committee was instituted with the expr=
ess purpose of politicising the Enron issue. "I think I know Vilasrao Deshm=
ukh's gameplan," says an MP from the state. But some MPs like Congress' Pri=
thviraj Chavan question the cloak of secrecy that's surrounded the deal: "I=
've maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examin=
e this".

The committee report also says that had the Enron project been subjected to=
 a techno-economic appraisal, as envisaged under provisions of the Electric=
ity supply Act of 1948 and related legislations, the infirmities could have=
 been avoided.Since this wasn't done, questions about a concerted effort to=
wards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to=
 arise, the exhaustive 93-page report points out.

"I'd highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government cleared =
the project minutes before it quit," says Congress MP Prithviraj Chavan.=20


The Enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberal=
isation in the early '90s and, despite several controversies, is now an est=
ablished power project at Dabhol, 150 km south of Mumbai. In July 1992, Enr=
on signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (mseb) to set=
 up a 2,550 MW station as part of the government's 'fast track' projects.

Subsequently, when the Shiv-Sena-bjp came to power in Maharashtra it filed =
a writ against the project. This curiously led to renegotiations with Enron=
. The committee has quoted a Bombay High Court order on the renegotiated de=
al.  "Once it (GoM) decided to revive the project, it acted in the very sam=
e manner its predecessors in office had done. It forgot all about competiti=
ve bidding and transparency. The speed with which the negotiating group stu=
died the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons, which was accepte=
d by Dabhol, is unprecedented." Says Chavan: "I would particularly like to =
highlight the speed with which the 13-day Vajpayee government at Centre end=
orsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned."


Since the commissioning of the plant in May 1999, the mseb has paid Rs 1,60=
7 crore for the power it has bought from Dabhol. If the same watttage of po=
wer had been bought from Indian-built power plants fired by indigenous coal=
, the payment would have been approximately Rs 736 crore. In the first year=
-and-a-half of its operation itself, the dpc had drained the Maharashtra ex=
chequer of nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

The Central Electricity Authority (cea), in fact, pointed out that the Dabh=
ol plant was not the least costly option. The mseb had other inexpensive al=
ternatives like the four units of Kaparkheda, but they were in a preliminar=
y stage. The report notes: "...if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pu=
rsue these projects, they might not have remained in their preliminary stag=
es". It adds that the members were of the opinion that "the mseb and the Ma=
harashtra government erred seriously, based on information available at tha=
t time, in proceeding with the dpc as a base-load factor even when its capa=
city was reduced." The failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity =
of the Union power ministry, finance ministry and the cea. It quotes the ce=
a as saying that since the Union finance ministry found the tariff reasonab=
le, no further examination was required

Strangely, Bal Thackeray's Shiv Sena, when it came to power together with t=
he BJP in Maharashtra, filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the =
deal.=20

After the new Shiv Sena-bjp government took over, its CM, Manohar Joshi, ap=
pointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises, actu=
ally managing to reduce the tariff. But certain things remained inexplicabl=
e. No fresh clearances were required from the cea, which also said that "si=
nce no cost increase was involved...fresh formal clearance wasn't necessary=
." Says the committee: "This only adds strength to the suspicion that the c=
ea didn't consider the economic aspects of the project at all. Indeed, give=
n the non-availability of any official record of the meeting on June 24, 19=
94, with the Committee and the nature of this letter dated December 23, 199=
4, the Committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discu=
ssed at all.''

The credibility of the Shiv Sena-bjp government has been seriously question=
ed. "The Committee finds it unexplicable (sic) why there was no mention of =
any reduction in capital cost of the project from $2,828 million to $2,501 =
million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committ=
ee," the panel observes.Says lawyer Prashant Bhushan: "It is strange that t=
he Shiv Sena-bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly=
 renegotiated the deal." The committee further spells out the losses incurr=
ed through the deal. "Subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc, the finan=
cial deterioration of mseb has been rapid. While the mseb was in profit in =
1998-99, it plunged into huge losses of Rs 1681 crore in 1999-2000."=20

Significantly, the World Bank in 1993 had predicted the system's inherent w=
eaknesses. In a letter written to the then power secretary, R. Vasudevan, a=
 top bank official had said that "after a detailed review of the analytical=
 framework and costing assumptions, we reconfirm our earlier conclusion tha=
t the Dabhol project, as presently formulated, is not economically justifie=
d" and that in "our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb s=
ystem in 1998. The proposed base-load operation could result in uneconomic =
plant dispatch, as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be=
 replaced by the higher cost lng power."

Enron's persistence and the 'gullibility' of the Indian side can be gauged =
from high-ranking Enron official Joe Sutton's letter to a key Indian offici=
al, Ajit Nimbalkar: "I recently met with the World Bank and have been follo=
wing the articles in the India papers. I feel that the World Bank opinion c=
an be changed. We'll engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the media from h=
ere on. The project has solid support from all other agencies in Washington=
."

The key question in the Enron deal is whether a developed state like Mahara=
shtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all? For the first =
time the Godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of suc=
h a project. According to the report, the mseb has been one of the better p=
erforming boards in the country and has, despite a faulty transmission and =
distribution (T and D) system, managed to consistently earn net revenue sur=
pluses on an accrual basis.

Maharashtra accounts for nearly one-fourth of the gross value of India's in=
dustrial sector. It's one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electri=
fication. Since '95, the mseb has been adding to its generation. "This impr=
ovement, which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation underta=
ken by the mseb, exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was b=
eing considered," the report points out. Following a policy of cross-subsid=
y, roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised.

But the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn=
't been much. In fact, the subsidy claim decreased from Rs 630 crore in 199=
5-96 to Rs 355 crore in 1998-99, until in 1999-2000 it increased nearly fiv=
e-fold to Rs 2,084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise =
per unit-from 15 to 41 paise-an increase of 173 per cent. "The increase in =
the subsidy claim by Rs 1,729 crore is due to the increase in the gap princ=
ipally because of the increase in power purchase costs," says the committee=
, adding: "Without the dpc and without problems of T and D loss, the mseb c=
ould be financially healthy."

But can that happen now since Enron is here to stay? The committee has come=
 up with some far-reaching recommendations: make public all Dabhol-related =
documents and agreements, restructure the Dabhol project itself to bring do=
wn the cost of power, restructure dpc financially, allow sale of dpc power =
outside Maharashtra, re-examine ppas in accordance with least-cost plans, a=
nd thoroughly reform the mseb.The committee know this can become reality on=
ly with political consensus and through forming of public opinion. The ques=
tion is, can that be achieved in an unstable political environment?

MSEB revenue collections up at Rs 968 crore in March , Renni Abraham=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) revenue collections in Mar=
ch 2001 stood at a record Rs 968 crore. This was largely due to the disconn=
ection drive on defaulter connections -- pegged at nearly 20,000 disconnect=
ions a month -- which resulted in compliance by consumers. With the Dabhol =
Power Company (DPC) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussio=
n among arbitrators on the negotiating table, the MSEB has turned to puttin=
g its house in order.=20

As if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed=
 as the facilitator to the entire DPC tariff crisis, the state electricity =
board has put matters relating to its performance on record. For instance, =
MSEB has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended March 31, =
2001, at 45930 units, compared with the previous year's 45582 units, making=
 it the top SEB of the country in this respect. Similarly its power station=
s recorded the highest availability percentage at 86.1 up from 84.6 per cen=
t last fiscal. Plant load factor is up to 72.78 per cent, compared with 71.=
7 per cent in 2000.=20

The Parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten=
 years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units, which made it eligib=
le for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines =
issued by the Government of India carrying a cash award of Rs 12.5 lakh. Al=
l other power stations in the state, without exception, also fulfill the el=
igibility criteria for the cash award, a senior MSEB official said. Similar=
ly, the Chandrapur power station became the first power station of any stat=
e electricity board to get the ISO 9002 certification.=20

A senior MSEB official said: "Earlier MSEB was suffering from too much inte=
rference in its day to day functioning. The agriculturists were touted as t=
he major reason for its deteriorating accruals, while theft of electricity =
during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged=
 under this head. In the recent past, the government has authorised MSEB to=
 take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials, many of whom=
, including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions
