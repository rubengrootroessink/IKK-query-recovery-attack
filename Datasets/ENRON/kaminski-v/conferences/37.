Dear Energy Participant:

Don't miss your chance to register for the Henwood Power Market Symposium at 
the DISCOUNTED PRICE of $875.  After April 1st the registration fee increases 
to $975.*  Register now because
space is limited!

This annual three-day event will take place from April 29 to May 1, 2001 in 
Atlanta, GA at the beautiful Evergreen Mountain Resort.  This year's 
Symposium features leaders from FERC, Electric
Power Research Institute, Standard & Poor's, ISO New England, Conoco, Entergy 
Nuclear, and more.  Discussion topics will include "Rating Implications of 
the California Market Failure",
"Upcoming Changes to Wholesale Electric Markets in New England", "Impacts of 
High Gas Costs to the Nation's Supply Portfolio", and many others. As always, 
participants will also have the
opportunity to gain access to Henwood's Software Products, Consulting 
Services, and Online Databases, as a means to develop competitive strategies 
and unequalled value in restructured
markets.

Your registration fee is inclusive of the following:

- Complete hotel accommodations at the Stone Mountain Resort for Sunday April 
29th and Monday April 30th, 2001
- All meals and refreshments for April 29th through May 1st. A welcome 
reception is planned for Sunday, April 29th.  This reception is an excellent 
opportunity to network with market participants
and decision-makers of the electric power industry.
- A river boat dinner cruise on Monday, April 30th on board the Henry W. 
Grady Paddlewheel Riverboat.
