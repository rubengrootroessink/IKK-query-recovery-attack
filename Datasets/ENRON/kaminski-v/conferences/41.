Paul, 

Thank you  for the invitation to speak at the Eastern Conferences on 
Regulation and  Competition on May the 25th. I shall be glad to attend and 
make an after  dinner presentation. I hope to be able to attend the entire 
conference.  

Sorry for a delay in responding to your message. I have been traveling  
extensively in the last few weeks. 

Vince
