Please find attached a revised announcement and call for papers for the 5th
ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REAL OPTIONS: THEORY MEETS PRACTICE. The
conference is co-organized by the Real Options Group and the Andersen
School, at UCLA, Los Angeles on July 11-14, 2001. The submission deadline
is MARCH 2 (and registration is by April 20). Travel allowances are
provided for all academic presenters (and fees are waived for all
presenters).  We are proud that Eduardo Schwartz will be our keynote speaker.

We hope that you will be able to participate and would appreciate it if you
could also post the announcement or circulate it among other interested
colleagues.

Best wishes
