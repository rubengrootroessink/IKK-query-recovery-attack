That should be fine, as long as you keep to a general overview and 
dissertation work.  You can talk about different modeling approaches in the 
industry, and indicate, if asked, that Enron looks at all approaches but not 
be specific about which particular one we believe in.  

Can you give me more details on the meeting?  I may like to attend as well.

Thanks,
Vasant

Vince and Vasant,

I was asked by one of my advisors to be on a panel for the summer Power 
Engineering Society.  I stated that I couldn't divulge any information on 
modeling efforts at Enron but could give a general overview and cover my 
dissertation work.  He stated that he understood and other companies had 
expressed similar concerns.

I guess that I need your OK to attend this presentation and present.

Thanks,
Lance
