Dear Vince,

I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding Grant Masson.  You informed me
that he is no longer an Enron employee.  I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.

I am inquiring because Infocast would like to have an Enron representative
speak at an upcoming conference entitled "Power Crisis in the West: Status &
Outlook for Wholesale and Retail Markets".  Is there someone else at Enron
whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?

I have attached the program agenda for your review.  Knowing a bit about
Grant's expertise, I specifically wanted him to participate on the panel
"How Will Power Prices Play Out in 2001-2005?".  Please let me know if there
is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or
others that may be of interest to Enron.

I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly
going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy surrounding
the situation in San Diego.

Kind Regards,
Nia Mansell
