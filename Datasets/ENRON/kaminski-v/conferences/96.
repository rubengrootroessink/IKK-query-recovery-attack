Vince,

Thanks for your prompt response.  I just sent out the abstracts to the
organizers.  Please be aware that today is the deadline for early
registration ($55 more if you register after today).  The link for
registration can be found at http://www.informs.org/Conf/SanAntonio2000/

I'll let you know the exact date of presentation later (most likely being
11/4 or 11/5).

Best,

Shijie
