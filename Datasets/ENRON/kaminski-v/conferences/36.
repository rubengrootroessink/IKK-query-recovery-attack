Vince and Vasant,

I was asked by one of my advisors to be on a panel for the summer Power 
Engineering Society.  I stated that I couldn't divulge any information on 
modeling efforts at Enron but could give a general overview and cover my 
dissertation work.  He stated that he understood and other companies had 
expressed similar concerns.

I guess that I need your OK to attend this presentation and present.

Thanks,
Lance
