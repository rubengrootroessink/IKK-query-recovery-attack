Please find attached the programs for the two back-two-back conferences on 
real options at UCLA (you may also download them from www.realoptions.org and 
www.rogroup.com ). The two conferences are separate but complementary events. 
The first conference, co-sponsored with Accenture and Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, on July 11-12, is a professional conference on Real Options Valuation 
in the Connected Economy: High Tech, Pharma, Energy, Corporate Valuation & 
Strategic/Portfolio Management. For information and online registration see 
www.rogroup.com.

The second is the 5th Annual International Conference on Real Options: Theory 
Meets Practice (the annual industry event where academics and practitioners 
get together to share the latest developments on theory and applications), 
co-organized with The Anderson School at UCLA on July 13-14. For information 
and online registration see www.realoptions.org

Between the two complementary events, we are pleased to present an extensive 
array of practitioner and cutting-edge academic presentations, sharing of 
experiences by corporate executives, and panel discussions by experts from 
leading organizations and universities. Our keynote speaker this year will be 
Eduardo S. Schwartz of UCLA. 

Interested participants must register for the conference online 
www.realoptions.org) and indicate hotel preferences by May 31 or ASAP.

We look forward to seeing you at this exciting event, and would appreciate if 
you share this with interested colleagues.
