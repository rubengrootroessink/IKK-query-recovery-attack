Dear Lucie,

When I agreed to speak at the above conference, it was agreed that Enron 
could bring another staff member to attend gratis. However, I noticed that 
Enron is actually providing two speakers - Dr Vince Kamainski and myself. It 
would be appreciated if we could instead of sending two staff members to the 
same seminar that Enron sends one staff member to the Aust Energy seminar and 
one staff member to the RISK 2000 - Sydney seminar in August 22-23. The 
length & pricing are similar for both the seminars.

Upon your reply, i will supply the names of the staff members, there is 
strong internal competition to go.

Thank you, Raymond
