Hi Vince,
?
I'm sorry you weren't around in Sydney this week.  You missed a very good 
book launch party that John Martin organised here for us.  Paul made a short 
speech in which he relayed some great comments which he said  came from?you - 
thanks very much!
?
Please find attached the next EPRM article. Its not  really tided up fully 
from our end yet, but I wanted to send it off before the  weekend in case you 
got chance to look at it. Because of the Easter break Robin  is after it by 
Thursday of next week.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
