Mike,

Here are the particulars of the trial run of our service, including the
times for the telephone contact from WSI. Remember this will be a bilateral,
not a conference, call.

On the ESAI side, while I will be out of town, Peter Ingraham (781 245 2036)
is available to answer questions or take suggestions. We look forward to
working with you next week.

Ed

Ed,

   We are set with a evaluation of the service covering the period from
Monday to Thursday July 31 to Aug 3.  We will activate the web access on
Friday afternoon and initiate calls Monday morning.  The call schedule is:

short range: 8:40 east coast time
mid range:   9:20 east coast time

if there is a conflict with these times, please notify me.  We will need a
number to call into, typically we call directly onto the trading floor.  The
username and password are the same as the initial viewing:

username:  enron
password:  stros00 (zero zero)

It is important to make the point this is for evaluation purposes since we
are not under a contract with liability issues addressed.

I am sure Enron will love it like the rest of our clients!!

Jeff
