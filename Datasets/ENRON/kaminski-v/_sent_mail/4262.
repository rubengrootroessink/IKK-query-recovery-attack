 Dear Energy in Europe Congress Delegate

ENERGY IN EUROPE CONGRESS 2000
19th June * 22th June 2000 * Kempinski Hotel , Berlin

I am delighted that you will be joining us to speak at our Energy in 
Europe2000 conference (formally known as Electricity in Europe Congress) and 
enclose copies of the printed brochure for you and your colleagues. I hope 
that you will agree that the programme looks excellent and the response so 
far indicates that the event will be extremely well attended.

I would be grateful if you could just take a moment to look through the items 
we would like from you prior to the conference to help ensure everything runs 
smoothly on the day.

Your Administration/Preparation Details
12 weeks to go!

You will find attached:
  ? PINK FORM : please tick and fill in and fax back immediately
? HOTEL FORM: please tick and fill in and fax direct to the hotel
? MARKETING.DOC: Information for out marketing department, please fill in and 
send back as soon as possible

Friday 26th May 2000 : A Hard Copy Of Your Documentation
3 weeks to go!

  ? We would like a hard black & white copy of  your presentation / bullet 
points/copy of slides whichever is best for you, to insert into the delegate 
documentation. We can receive this by post or email if the documents are not 
too complex but we try not to insert fax copies as copy quality is poor. 
(e-mail address - ttulsi@icbi.co.uk).

N.B. Even if you plan to speak off the cuff, we would urge that you submit at 
least an outline of your speech to us for insertion into the delegate pack by 
the above date. The most consistent complaint that we have from delegates is 
that not all speakers offer hard copies of their presentation.

  ? If you are unable to make this deadline, please could you inform us as 
soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements and avoid 
printing delay.

Under separate cover we have arranged for five brochures to be sent to you 
outlining the full programme.  These should arrive very shortly.

Should you have any queries regarding your participation at the conference 
please contact Tanuja Tulsiani, our Logistics  Manager who will be looking 
after the 'domestic' side of the event. You can call her direct on (44) 171 
915 5173 or do contact myself. Thank you once again for joining us and I look 
forward to seeing you in the Berlin.

With kind regards,


Alexandra Howells
Director
Energy in Europe Congress 2000
