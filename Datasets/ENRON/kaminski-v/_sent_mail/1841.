Attention:   FT.com Users -
FT.COM SITE NOW DELIVERS THE INFORMATION YOU NEED - FASTER

FT.com has updated key pages that our users visit most frequently
* News and analyses
* Markets information
* Industry news

The site retains most of its look and feel but should download onto your
desktop more quickly.  Four prominent buttons at the top of every page provide
immediate access to index pages for news, markets, industries and companies. 
We
bring you hour by hour update on global story headlines -  political and
economic, with business highlights, key market developments as well as the
latest corporate news. New index pages link directly from the home page - you
can find your way to individual companies or groupings by region from the head
of every page.

So if you haven't visited the site for some time we urge you to revisit us
today and judge these improvements for yourself. And if you rely on this site
as your primary business information source every day, we hope you will agree
that the enhancements make keeping on top of global trends easier - and more
efficient.  If you have the time, please send us your comments: e-mail
editor.ftcom@ft.com.

PS:  The Financial Times newspaper has a sharper look too this week, with new
features for UK and around the world; as well as more coverage of European and
global business.  Additions include a weekly review of business law and a pick
of the weekend's big sporting events.  Plus every Tuesday, a new supplement,
Creative Business, offers stylish, hard-edged news and views on media, design
and communications.
