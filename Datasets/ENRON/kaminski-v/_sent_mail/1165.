Dave,

I am sending you my accomplishments for the last year.
I am including also one document (just browse through it quickly)
to give you a flavor of some projects I have been working on.

I shall send you shortly an additional document I would like you to browse 
through
(the list of projects my group works on in a typical week) to give you more 
information
about the scope and depth of what we do. It's an internal document and I want 
to clean 
it up

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to  you and  your family.


Vince
