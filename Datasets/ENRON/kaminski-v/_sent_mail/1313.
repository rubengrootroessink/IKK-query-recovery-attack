Subject: Chris Hall's resume

Vince,


this pertains to Chris Hall, about whom Joe H left you a message earlier.

I would not mind talking to you about him and vouching for his 
qualifications.  The guy is excellent.  He worked for me  (I was the hiring 
manager) until I left IT a few weeks ago.
Please give me a call if you would like some input.  His resume follows...



Yannis
