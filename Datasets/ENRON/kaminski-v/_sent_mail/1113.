Stinson,

Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model.
It seems that our work will make an impact on EOL trading, that is very
exciting.

Could you e-mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with
the changes you have made ?   

I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes
book, I finished the entire book.  The queueing theory is very fascinating,
 and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project.

I will take my family out to see the Nature Bridge Caverns near San Antonio
tomorrow.

See you on Tuesday. 

Happy New Year !

Zimin

Greg,

Here are results corrected for spread profit per round-trip transaction.   
Prior results incorrectly counted a spread profit per trade.
