Hi Vince,

I had intended to call as soon as I set up another meeting in Houston but
that had to be put off due to scheduling problems and a heavier than usual
workload here.

I would like to get together sometime after the first of the year to discuss
some research initiatives.  I may also be interested in the position at
Enron that you mentioned the last time we spoke.  I am currently considering
a few new positions and would like to expand my search.  If you have an
interest in discussing the position then just let me know.  I'll be leaving
town on Wednesday, December 22, and returning December 29 but I am always
virtually here at any of my addresses, e.g., mailto:macminn@cheerful.com
<mailto:macminn@cheerful.com> .

Merry Christmas,
Richard
