John,

Very interesting, I would make a point that the generation demand
is highly volatile  and driven to a large extent by weather. Also,
the changes in the structure of gas demand
require development of different types of storage (more peaking storage).

See my storage story that begins on 1. Plus you might find the issue to be
of interest. I will be doing little occasionally fee pieces for the
Transportation &
Storage Report and will be having lunch with them tomorrow so any thoughts
you have on my piece or the report would be appreciated.



Best regards,


JHHerbert
