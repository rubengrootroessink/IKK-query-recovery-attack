Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince
