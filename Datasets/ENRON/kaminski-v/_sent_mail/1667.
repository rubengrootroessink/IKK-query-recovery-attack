Subject: Power 2000/EPRM 2001





As a speaker at EPRM's highly successful Power 2000 event in  Houston, I am 
writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce  myself. I 
will be responsible for the production of all North American EPRM  events 
having moved from our banking conference and training course division in  
July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is  
developing our technology events for Waters conferences and Joel Hanley will 
be  starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.

EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th  of May and I am 
keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend  to call 
each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like 
to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some  
issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference  
seminars at EPRM 2001?

What research are you or your company involved in that would justify  
inclusion in EPRM 2001?

Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of 
energy risk management?

Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (Regulatory bodies,  
academics, practitioners)

Any assistance at this initial stage of research is  appreciated. You can 
email me or call on +44 20 7484 9883. I look forward to  working with you on 
this event.

Paul Bristow

Senior Conference Producer, EPRM  Conferences
