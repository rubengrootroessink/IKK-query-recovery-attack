Hello everyone:

I need your help!  I had a request for an article that was in the February 
2000 
issue of the "Journal of Finance", which the Research Group subscribes to.   
However, when I went to look for that particular issue, I only found two 
issues 
(April and August) for the year 2000.

Please check your desk or home and see if maybe you checked some of 
the missing issues out and let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley
