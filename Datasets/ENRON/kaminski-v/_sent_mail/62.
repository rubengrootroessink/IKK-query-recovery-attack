I gave you local admin rights on your laptop yesterday. What you have to do 
is to log into the laptop using the local
Machine account. The id and the password is the same as your Corp login now. 
The password on the local account will 
Never change. If you have a minute today I will show you how. Let me know a 
time.

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Vince
