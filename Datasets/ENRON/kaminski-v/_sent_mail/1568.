Today's bug patches and security alerts:


Microsoft releases patch for "Indexing Services Cross Site
Scripting" vulnerability

We reported this vulnerability in the last edition of the
newsletter - it was another Georgi Guninski find. Microsoft
Internet Information Server contains a security hole that could
allow a malicious user to inject code into a Web page that can
be used to access a remote computer. A similar problem was
discovered a few months ago in a previous version of the
software. For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-084.asp


Patch available for "Netmon Protocol Parsing" vulnerability

The Network Monitoring tool that ships with Windows NT, 2000
and Microsoft System Management Server contains a flaw that
could allow a malicious user to gain access to the affected
system. The problem resides in Netmon's parsers, which have
several unchecked buffers that can be exploited by sending a
malformed frame to the server. For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-083.asp


Patch available for "Malformed MIME Header" vulnerability

By passing specially formed MIME headers to Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5, an external user can crash the server. The system
will need to be rebooted before it will work again. For more
information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-082.asp
**********


Red Hat releases patch for kpackage

The kpackage module that comes with Red Hat Linux 7.0 crashes
when files are installed or uninstalled. Patches can be
downloaded from:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/7.0/i386/kpackage-1.3.10-7j1.i386.rpm


Updated svgalib package available

The svgalib that ships with Red Hat Linux Powertools contains a
bug that causes it to crash when the library is compiled into
other applications. Updates can be downloaded from:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm
ftp://updates.redhat.com/powertools/7.0/i386/svgalib-devel-1.4.1-12.i386.rpm

HP reports vulnerability in dtterm

Hewlett-Packard has released a patch for the dtterm module
after it was discovered the module could be exploited to gain
root access. The alert does not mention how this could be
accomplished. Patches and workarounds can be found at the HP IT
Resource page:
http://itrc.hp.com
**********


Allaire issues patch for JRun DoS vulnerability

After a slew of patches last week for JRun, Allaire has
returned again this week with another patch. This one protects
against possible denial-of-service attacks. By sending
malformed URLs, the Java servlet handler leaks memory and could
consume all system resources. For more information and a patch:
http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=18085&Method=Full
**********


FreeBSD reports DoS vulnerability in getnameinfo() function

FreeBSD has issued a patch for the KAME project that fixes a
problem in the getnameinfo() function, a protocol-independent
name resolver library. By sending a malformed request to the
function, it is possible under certain circumstances to crash
the affected server. Patches can be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:63/getnameinfo.patch.asc


Top allows reading of kernel memory

The top module, which displays system resource usage, contains
a format string vulnerability that could allow unprivileged
users to execute arbitrary code on the affected FreeBSD
machine. For patches:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-00:62/top.patch.asc

USSR reports flaw in Ultraseek search engine

USSR Labs is reporting a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
Ultraseek search engine. By sending malformed URLs to port 8765
(Ultraseek's default port) it is possible to crash the search
engine. For more information and links to patches:
http://www.ussrback.com/labs56.html

AOL 6.0 wreaks havoc with some PCs

AOL 5.0 was an unmitigated disaster for the online giant. Soon
after its release, users began complaining about network
settings getting blown away, key Windows files being rewritten,
and in some cases, PCs becoming utterly inoperable. Some of the
exact same problems are beginning to crop up with AOL 6.0,
launched last week. Network World, 10/31/00.
