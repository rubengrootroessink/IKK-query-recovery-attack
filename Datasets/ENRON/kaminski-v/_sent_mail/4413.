Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I enjoyed our discussion this morning. It sounds like there is a great deal
of overlap between Enron business units and my interests. I am very much
looking forward to meeting you and your colleagues. Thank-you for the
invitation to interview with your group.

Sincerely,
Rodney Greene
