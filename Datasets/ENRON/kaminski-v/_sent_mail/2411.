Vince:

Our PR staff has put together a great design for the Finance Seminar
mugs.  We need to get a clean copy of the Enron logo, if possible.  The
design is in Adobe Pagemaker if your people can find a logo that can be
pulled into that format.  They can send it directly to me and I will make
sure it gets to the right place.

Thanks so much.
