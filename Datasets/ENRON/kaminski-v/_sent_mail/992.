Vince, pursuant to your discussion with Joe, I am enclosing my resume for 
your information.  I would appreciate the chance to discuss rotation 
opportunities within Enron, particularly how a research position would relate 
to future commercial opportunities.      

For your information, I am meeting with Maureen Raymond tomorrow.  I will 
call your assistant afterwards to set up a meeting.   

Thank you.

Seth
