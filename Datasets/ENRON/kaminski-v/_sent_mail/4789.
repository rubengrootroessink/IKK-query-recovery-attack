Subject: A paper of mine



Vince,

I have written a paper, which supposedly is going to be published in the
February 2000 issue of EPRM, probably after some editorial cuts (at least
this is what I am being told by them).  I would appreciate your thoughts if
you would have time to read it.

Regards,
Martin
