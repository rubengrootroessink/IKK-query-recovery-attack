Good morning, Vince.

We deposited the check and made the 7 purchases today.  The one Ginnie Mae
did have enough but the minimum purchase amount was $25m.  I purchased it,
you wanted 20m and you still has plenty in money market to cover it.

The CMA Tax exempt money market has a 7 day yield of 3.71%.  We can change
your money market to that if you would like.

We signed you up for ML on.  The web address is www.newmlol.ml.com.  The Log
on ID is 0400432840.  The pass word is the one you gave me last night.  Take
a look at it and tell me what you think.

It was nice visiting with you last night.  Next time, we will have a drink!

Call me if you have any questions.  I will call you on Monday.
