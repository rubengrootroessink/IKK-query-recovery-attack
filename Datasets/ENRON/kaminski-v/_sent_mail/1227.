David,

A follow-up on my voice-mail message regarding
Grant.

Dave Delainey is on board regarding Grant.
We can bring him back at the same level and comp,
assuming that resignation was handled
in a professional manner.

DD asked me to work out the details with you. Can we meet to talk
about it on Monday?


Vince
