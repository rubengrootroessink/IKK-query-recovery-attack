Mark,

Thanks for the message. As a matter of fact I would like to discuss the 
allocations with you.
Is Friday morning OK with you? I  need 2 more days to finish my homework.

Vince

Vince as a follow-up to our meeting on January 24th regarding allocations of 
Research cost to ENA, were you able to give any more thought to how I should 
allocate the cost to the ENA commercial teams?  I have a meeting with Weather 
coming up and one of the questions they have deals with your group.  

I know you are extremely busy and if I can be of any help please let me know. 


Thanks
