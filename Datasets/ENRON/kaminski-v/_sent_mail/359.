Karen,

Yes, but I think it's confidential. Please, contact
David Port about the release possibility.

Vince,

Can you tell me whether Enron has a formal written Risk Management Policy?

Thanks,

Karen Marshall

Hello,

I am enrolled in a Maritime Management Masters program at Maine
Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine and am currently studying "Global
Risk Management and Insurance" as one of my courses. As part of
my research for a term paper I am investigating organizations
in the oil business to see whether or not they have formalized a {Risk
Management Policy Statement}. Does Enron have such a policy
statement and if so would I be able to acquire and incorporate
it into my research paper. If available, I would appreciate some info
on how Enron is involved in Risk Management.

Brgds,
Jim Parsons, MM., BMS.
