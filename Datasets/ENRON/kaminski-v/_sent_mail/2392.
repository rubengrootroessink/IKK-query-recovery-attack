Vince:  I am in receipt of your package.  Thank you. I would like to
keep this information but think it should be rebundled and forwarded on
the Tim Luehrman.  However, if you could send a duplicate of what you
sent me to Tim Luehrman at PricewaterhouseCooper LLP; One Post Office
Square, Boston, MA 02109 via U.S. Mail, that would be great!  Let me
know if that is possible to do prior to your leaving for Australia.
Otherwise, I will send this one to him.  Have a good trip down under.
