Subject: Visit by Jerry Sellers of Orillion

Gentlemen:

I have spoken with Jerry Sellers of Orillion and he is proposing a visit by 
Orillion with EBS on Monday, April 25, 2000 for about half a day.  It can be 
from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon or 1:00 - 4:00.  They are flexible with the 
times.  

The following individuals will participate on behalf of Orillion.  They are 
as follows:

     Jerry Sellers, Chairman
     Terry Lindsey, President
     Professor Ken Dick, Technical Advisory Board at University of Nebraska


Orillion would like to propose the following agenda:  

     1.  Introduce Orillion to EBS
     2.  Engage in Technical Discussions
     3.  Discussions on how Orillion can help EBS


Please let me know if your schedules will best accommodate a morning session 
or an afternoon session.  Many thanks for your prompt assistance.
