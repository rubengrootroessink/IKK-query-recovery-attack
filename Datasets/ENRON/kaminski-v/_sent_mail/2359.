Eric, 

I have the presentation  on my laptop  and I
shall send you the presentation in a few days when
I get my back to my office in Houston.

I am currently using the system as a guest in our Sydney office.

The  person I mentioned is Anthony Dayao.

Vince Kaminski

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

My name is Eric Takigawa of Algorithmics Japan, and I spoke with you on the
last day of the seminar.

I would be pleased to receive a copy of your presentation with the promise
of non-circulating the material.

I have been in communication with Mr. Jonath Whitehead and will be meeting
Mr. Joe Hirl in early August.  You mentioned another individual at Enron
Japan - Antonio Dai(?) but couldn't recall the proper spelling of his name
and would like the opportunity to meet with him.

There is a tremendous opportunity for Enron in Japan and the conditions are
just right.

Kind regards,

Eric
