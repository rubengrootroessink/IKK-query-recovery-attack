Dear Mr Kaminski,

Firstly, I wanted to tell you how privileged I feel to be considered for
some of the opportunities within your prestigious firm.
I am strongly interested in what Enron Global Markets has to offer in its
research side.  Your Training Program is widely recognized within the
financial industry as being one of the best, and I would be more than
honored to be part of it.  I believe that as member of Enron I can learn a
lot more quantitative ways of trading energy products, and I can also learn
how to get a feel for the Energy markets from some of the best people in th=
e
business.
Thus, I would sincerely appreciate to be considered as a potential member o=
f
your rotational program.  Indeed, I believe that my employment experiences
have provided me with valuable skills that will be very useful in your
Group.  These skills include the ability to synthesize quantitative
information quickly and accurately, the facility to deal with sophisticated
financial products, and more importantly the ability to work as part of a
team by fulfilling responsibilities diligently and sometimes prior to
deadlines.  I genuinely hope to contribute to Enron=01,s success by bringin=
g
these skills, along with my strong mathematical background and knowledge of
the Energy Industry.
Finally, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism, and
the clarity with which you exposed the opportunities available within Enron=
.
You surely are a genuine proof that your Group is committed to working with
people who exhibit a superior level of professional capabilities.

Sincerely Yours,

David A. Michalon
