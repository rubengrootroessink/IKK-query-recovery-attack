Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

To solve complex problems, aerospace professionals worldwide use
MATLAB, Simulink, and other powerful tools from The MathWorks, for
engineering analysis, modeling, simulation, control design, and DSP
design.  Find out how you and your colleagues can apply these tools
to your own systems design problems by attending the free
Aerospace/Defense Spectrum of Solutions seminar in Dallas, TX on
February 8th or Houston, TX on Februar 10th.

This seminar will highlight the latest release of MATLAB, Simulink,
and The MathWorks rapid prototyping tools.  Many new MathWorks
products will be demonstrated including the MATLAB Data Acquisition
Toolbox and xPC Target.

Continental breakfast and registration begin at 8:00 am and the
presentation will begin at 8:30 am. The seminar will last
approximately three hours.

To register for this seminar or request more information, either
visit our Web site at www.mathworks.com/texas or call our
registration line at 978-694-6104.

If any of your colleagues might be interested in attending,  please
pass this information on to them!  If you register three colleagues,
you will be entered into a drawing to win a MATLAB shirt.

We look forward to seeing you in February!

Sincerely,
John D. Binder
Manager, Aerospace/Defense Industry Marketing
