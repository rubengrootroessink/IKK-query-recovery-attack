Vince,

Please forward the recommendations to the following address:

2569 Windbreak Dr.
Alexandria, VA 22306

Don't forget to label each envelope, e.g. "Columbia", etc., and to sign
each envelope over the adhesive seal. I must receive the package 
before the new year in order to meet the submission deadline. 

Thank you for your time, and happy holidays.

-Hector
