[Vince,]
Jeff,

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip) [OK- I will let London know 
this].
I think the organization is very interested in him [Thank you for your 
help...I always consider working for you, primarily- not just Enron as a 
company...my goal is to make you happy and do what you want; My mission was 
to get Howard to you, I understand he will go in front of the directors in 
London- what can I do to help you interview him? I understand that ?Melanie? 
is doing this...and the Manager of Risk at RW is directing Howard. Do you 
want me to set Howard up with you after the second round in Enron London?]

I don't know what "illicts your attention" means [Sorry, mistype in the 
car...was traveling to the snow with my girlfriend on a "mini-vacation" today 
(I neglect her and took off to make her happy)...I constantly think of my 
work (never peace of mind) and because I remain loyal to you...I recieved 
this email information on Howard today(form Enron London) and felt it was 
important enough for you to be aware of (the 2nd interview) and make sure you 
were happy regardless of where I'm going or what I'm doing (you said last 
time you were going to interview this guy by video conference and Rachel said 
she was going to set it up with you)- I didn't know, otherwise. If I don't 
know something then I can't report to you accurate information therefore, I 
forward everything to you- so, it is transparent or maybe you knew something 
different or something I overlooked. I usually send everything and anything 
related to this guy (Howard) because I know you liked him and I can't afford 
any mi!
stakes- sorry to be a pest. Anything you want me to do please tell me- I'll 
do it. Thanks, Vince. Jeff]

Vince
