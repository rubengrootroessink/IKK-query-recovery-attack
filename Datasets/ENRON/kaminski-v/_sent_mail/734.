Subject: Java class

Shirley,

One other possibility for the class.   If we can find/borrow enough lap tops 
for everyone to use, we can just get any conference room and use laptops to 
take the class.     Many members of the group already have one (me,  Martin, 
Tom Halliburton).    Can we find 10 more?
