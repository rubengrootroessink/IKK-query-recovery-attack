This is to remind all of you of the dinner plan (with
family) at my house on Saturday Dec 2nd.  We will
expect you at about 6:00 pm.

Address:  3410 S. Briarpark Ln, Sugar Land

Directions (from downtown) :

Take 59 South all the way past Sam Houston Beltway 8,
and past Highway 6.  Take the next exit --- First
Colony Blvd/Sweetwater Blvd.  Take a left at the
traffic light onto Sweetwater Blvd (over the highway).
 Go straight on Sweetwater Blvd past a few traffic
lights and a few stop signs.  After passing a golf
course on the right, you will get a subdivision
"Crescents on the Green" on the right, and a
subdivision "BriarWood" on the left.  Take a Left into
the Briarwood subdivision and an immediate right onto
