Konstantin,

No problem, as long as the MBA program agrees to it.
I need an E-mail from them.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski

 I am a post-doc in theoretical chemistry at Rice. Currently I am
exploring risk management as an alternative career path. I hope you do not
mind if I attend your course "Energy Derivatives" at Jones School of MGMT
at Rice. I've already taken "Futures and options-I", "Corporate finance",
and I am currently taking "Futures and options-II".

 Thanks.

 Sincerely,
 Konstantin Kudin
