Subject: Your speaking engagement at Baylor on evening of February 23


Dear Vince,

I am following up concerning your upcoming speaking engagement at Baylor on
evening of February 23.  Of course, I'll plan to see you during the
afternoon at John Martin's "new economy" conference.  That evening, you
will be the dinner speaker for the official chartering ceremony of the
Gamma Iota Sigma Risk Management and Insurance fraternity.  We are hoping
for a really good turnout that evening, and expect guests not only from
around Texas but also possibly other parts of the country.  I am not sure
what your travel plans are, but I did take the liberty of setting up a
guaranteed reservation for you at the Marriott Courtyard (Confirmation
#84857419).  Let me know if you don't need the reservation, but otherwise
it will be available to you.

I also am interested in finding out whether I might be able to attract you
to campus on another occasion to speak to my corporate risk management
classes.  Perhaps we can discuss this possibility when we see each other
about three weeks from now.

Sincerely, with best regards,

Jim Garven
