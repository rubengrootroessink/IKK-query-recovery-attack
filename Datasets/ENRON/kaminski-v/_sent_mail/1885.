Taiichi:

Here is the cover letter and report
that I sent to Vince Kaminsky on June 26.
As Zimin was the source of the
model and code, I think Vince
may not mind if you forward
it directly to Zimin.
Please wait 24 hours before
doing so in order to give
Vince a chance to countermand that.

Thanks!

Darrell

Vince:


I attach a report, prepared under my direction
by my research assistant, Dr. Taiichi Hoshino,
now employed with Goldman Sachs, on the Enron storage
valuation model that you asked me to review.

This report contains some details that
you didn't ask for, but that your research staff
might appreciate.

The model and software are appropriate to
the task they are designed for, in my opinion, based
on the code and the documentation that
you sent. Some suggestions for
potential improvement are noted
in the attached report, but these
are either minor or not critical
to the current business objectives of the model,
in my view.

If this email is not sufficient, or you
would prefer a hard-copy opinion letter,
please let me know.


Meanwhile, I hope life at Enron is
as exciting as usual!

Sincere regards,


Darrell

PS I will bill you separately for my time (1.5 hours)
and the time of Dr. Hoshino.
