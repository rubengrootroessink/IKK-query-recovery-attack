If either of you have a soft copy of the paper we would appreciate it.  We 
will
do the work but will definately give credit where it is due and also where it
has the most impact (from you guys).

thanks

Subject:  Credit Trading White Paper

Dear Vasant,

I am currently working with Bryan Seyfried and the Credit Markets/Trading 
group
in London, and am in the process of designing and building a website as an
information portal.

I am in possession of a paper that you co-authored entitled "Actively Managing
Credit Risk", which was published in Risk Publications.

Bryan has asked Bijoya (who is interning here during her X-mas holiday from 
the
LSE) to update this paper and generate a new White Paper about the current 
state
of the credit market and the developments we are pursuing and creating. This
will be used on our website and be published later in time.

Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya 
to
draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give a
better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in
London again next week.

I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the 
next
few weeks.

Please contact me at any time!

Regards from London

Katja
