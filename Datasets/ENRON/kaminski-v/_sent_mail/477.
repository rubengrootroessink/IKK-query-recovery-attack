Vince:

I hope you received the Winter issue of the JACF. Your article was great. 
Many of the issues and themes raised in that piece can be expanded upon. The 
same holds for the Round Table discussion which included Gene Humphrey. 
Finally. I would love to get your assessment of the real option article I 
wrote with Gordon Sick.

Best Regards,



John L. McCormack
