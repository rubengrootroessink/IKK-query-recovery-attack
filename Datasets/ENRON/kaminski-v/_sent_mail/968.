Christie:

As our Tiger Team prepares to head out to Houston, we wanted to give you
an idea of some people we hope to meet with on Friday. Ideally, we would
like to start out the day with a quick meeting with Vince Kaminski so
that we can clarify his goals for our project. Here is the list of
additional energy contacts we would like to meet, along with a few
specific questions and/or subject areas:

* EnronOnline Representative: We would like to know the history of
EnronOnline, where it is headed, what new industries are being targeted
and what criteria is used in identifying a target industry. We also
would like to talk about the overall vision of EnronOnline.
* Wholesale Energy Representative: What percentage of Enron's
wholesale energy trading is done online? What are existing platforms,
online or other, and has Enron's business shifted from one platform to
another over the past two years? The past year? What new electronic
platforms are emerging? Mobile platforms? What percentage of energy does
the average Enron customer buy through Enron?
* Energy Marketing Representative: How does Enron market itself,
online and across other platforms? What are competitors, such as ICE,
doing? What percentage of energy does the average Enron customer buy
through Enron?
* Energy Trader:  We are interested in seeing a demonstration of
EnronOnline and/or other electronic systems that traders regularly use
(initiate, process and complete trade). We need a trader's perspective
as to his or her's perceived advantages/disadvantages of Enron's
electronic trading platforms and systems over competitors. Does the
trader have any insights on applications of mobile or other emerging
technologies?
* Energy Information Technology Representative: What are all the
electronic platforms being used by Enron? What platforms are being
developed? How does Enron technology stack up to the competition? What
innovations, if any, have Enron competitors developed that may be worth
integrating?

We also have some business development and strategic questions, but we
are not sure who would best answer them. Specifically,  we would like to
know more about how Enron manages its energy relationships and handles
contracting with suppliers and wholesale energy buyers?

Please feel free to re-arrange these questions so that they fit the
appropriate people. If possible, we would greatly appreciate it if we
could have a list of whom we will be meeting with, as well as additional
contacts whom we can reach once we return to Philadelphia.

Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to seeing you Thursday
(and dining at Churrasco's).

Regards,


Enron Tiger Team #1
