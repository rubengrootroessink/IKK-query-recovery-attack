Dear Vince:

        I am in some preliminary dialogues with some faculty in the math
department about the possibility of establishing a special program perhaps at
master's level on financial engineering.  The attach pdf file is my own
sketch about the program. Since you have extensive knowledge about these
things, can you give me some comments.
