Stinson and Alex,

Curt Randall wants to visit us at our lunch meeting next Friday (Nov. 3).   
He is going to
do a presentation to demo the software from his company SciFinance. 

His visit is subject to change, that is why I want to wait till next week to 
make the announcement.

I appreciate that Stinson agrees to give a talk in the brown bag options 
seminar.  We could move Stinson's talk
to Thursday group meeting if Stinson OK it. Or we can reschedule Stinson's 
talk to the following Friday.   

Let me know your thoughts.

Zimin

You are welcome.

Shall we say 11:30 to allow some time for getting organized?

I usually use an old fashioned overhead transparency projector if you've
got one.  If they've all been replaced by digital projectors, I can
bring one.

I'll be in touch early that week, to get directions for parking etc.

rgds,
Curt
