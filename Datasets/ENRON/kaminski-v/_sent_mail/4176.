NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Instant messaging
04/13/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Instant messaging
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

While NetWare has had instant messaging capabilities built in for more
than 10 years, it has never gotten much beyond the basic product first
introduced with NetWare 2.

The product allows a limited message (less than 250 characters) to be
sent from one logged-in user to another on the network, or to a group
of users.

Now, Novell has joined forces with AOL to produce InstantMe - an
instant messaging client for enterprises based on AOL's phenomenally
successful AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) client.

InstantMe uses the Novell Directory Services eDirectory to store
contact information accessed from anywhere on the 'Net with Novell's
DigitalMe identity services platform. With roaming capabilities and
real-time access to contact information, DigitalMe lets users respond
quickly, no matter where they are or what station they're working from.

InstantMe lets users communicate in real-time conversations with
partners, suppliers and clients. It also lets users have conversations
with any other AIM user worldwide (provided both users are logged in to
the service). It also will, I'm sure, lead to more involved discussions
of where to do lunch, rehashes of Sunday's football game and other
so-called "water cooler" chatting, all from the privacy of the user's
desktop. That may or may not be a problem - you will want to formulate
some usage rules before implementing the technology.

Novell plans to release a secure version of InstantMe in the next few
months, which will integrate encryption and digital certificates in a
move to increase trust between two or more parties and ensure integrity
and confidentiality of messages exchanged over the Internet.

Instant messaging should provide a much-needed medium for quick,
perishable communications, such as those requesting time-sensitive
coordination or short-fuse decisions. It's best used where e-mail
would be considered too slow to get the needed response. Generally,
you'd use instant messaging in a situation where today you would use
the telephone. Instant messaging can be even faster than using the
phone when you consider time spent on hold or navigating through
receptionists and secretaries, and it's cheaper than a long-distance
call. Those are competitive advantages, and you should examine this new
technology thoroughly before deciding if it is, or isn't, for you.

InstantMe is a free download that supports Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows NT and Windows 2000.
