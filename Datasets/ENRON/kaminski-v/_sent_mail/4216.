Hi Amy:

That is fine, Vince was going to come on the 28th anyway, but he will probably
need to come earlier - please let me know what time you have scheduled
the dinner so I can make his airline reservations.  

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

I just realized that I goofed on the dinner - it will be held on Sunday,
May 28th instead of the 29th.  Sorry about that!

I hope your day is going well so far.

Amy
