Just a last reminder that you haven't renewed your 2001 NESA/HEA dues.  We
are in the process of preparing to publish our annual directory and are
hopeful that you will take a moment to renew your dues so that you are
included.  If you have misplaced your form, please visit our website at
www.nesanet.org and click on WHAT IS NESA, or call the office at
713/856-6525 and we can update your records over the phone with a credit
card.  Dues are only $75 and you don't want to be left out!

Let us hear from you, or if you wish to be deleted, just respond to this
message.  Thanks for your consideration and we hope you'll renew your dues!
