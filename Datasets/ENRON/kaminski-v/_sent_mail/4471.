Ravi,

Our compensation for summer interns is very generous. It's more than what an 
engineering student expects.

Vince

P.S.  Any progress on the resumes in electronic form? I want to send a 
package to Charlene today.

Vince

Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.
