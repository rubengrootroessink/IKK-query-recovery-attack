RiskNews Update - week ending 02/02/2001
http://www.RiskNews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

The Fed's second 50 basis point cut in interest rates in a month to stave
off a recession in the US - a move widely discounted in the marketplace -
was the subject of many headlines this week. While the cut is the largest
since the 1982 recession, and has raised eyebrows regarding the true state
of the US economy, there was also plenty of other important news.

ABN Amro unveiled plans to boost its risk management and derivatives
business by purchasing a large slice of ING Barings' North American
investment banking operations for $275 million. Competition in the US and
elsewhere will be fierce, however, with leading player Salomon Smith
Barney creating a new global interest rate and derivatives products group,
following an overhaul of its fixed-income and derivatives businesses.
There appears to be no long-term role for Citibank's Fred Chapey in the
new division. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's decision to axe about 2,600 staff
following a restructuring of its operations into two business groups, will
have a negligible impact on its derivatives business (see Headlines).

London-based broker Tullett & Tokyo Liberty was back in the news again for
alleged racial discrimination. Laurent Weinberger, a broker on the new
issues desk until last May, initiated a racial discrimination and unfair
dismissal case against his former employer this week. Previously the firm
had a run-in with client Citibank, when a Tullett employee allegedly made
racist comments to a Citi official (see People).
