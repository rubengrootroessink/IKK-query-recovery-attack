Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

Top news this week included early findings by credit ratings agency
Standard & Poor=01,s that internationally active banks may find it is cheap=
er
to use the standardised risk management approach to capital management
rather than the internal ratings based (IRB) system. Early findings that
IRB, as laid out in the Basel Committee's new capital Accord proposals,
may cost banks more in terms of capital appears contrary to the =01+spirit=
=01,
of the de facto international banking regulator=01,s proposals. Next week,
RiskNews will print exclusive coverage of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association=01,s (Isda=01,s) response to Basel as part of our
extensive coverage of Isda=01,s 16th Annual General Meeting in Washington.

With consolidation seeming imminent for the plethora of electronic trading
platform providers, electronic derivatives trading platform Blackbird=01,s
chief executive Andy Baxter admitted having difficulties encouraging
dealers to move away from phone broking. In a separate development, JP
Morgan Chase selected multi-bank FX trading portal Atriax as its
electronic portal =01) a move seen by industry observers as a blow to rival
portal FXall, which was strongly backed by the pre-merger JP Morgan.

Meanwhile, Citigroup=01,s top FX salesman Martin Dyer pans to take =01+time=
-out=01,
from his post after 20 years, clearing the way for Lars Olesen to be
appointed global FX sales manager of Citibank Foreign Exchange in London.
