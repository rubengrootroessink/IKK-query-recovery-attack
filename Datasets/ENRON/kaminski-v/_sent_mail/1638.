Vince
Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone 
number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals. 
Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but 
he was in classes all morning and got the message in the  afternoon. I really 
appreciate your going out of your?way to help. Perhaps  there will be another 
opportunity.?
Shmuel?
