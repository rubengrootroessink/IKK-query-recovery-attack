Vince/Stinson,

Please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation, as 
well as the revised statement that can be made to press.

The numbers are not small, but really do not reflect the true magnitude of 
the genset issue.  They do not take into account the capital costs of the 
gensets, and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating 
in homes, and commercial establishments.

Hope ths helps.

Regards,
Sandeep.
