Hi all,
Martin has kindly arranged the following presentation for us.  Come and enjoy 
it. 

Zimin, Alex

Giuseppe Paleologo of Stanford and Enron Research Summer Intern fame will 
present a talk on 
  IP Pricing 
at 1pm in EB 46C2, Friday, March 9.

Below is a description of the topic.

Because of the bursty and intermittent nature of IP traffic, 
"oversubscription" is possible.  
In telephone or cell phone networks, selling more lines than the physical 
capacity is 
commonplace.  When too many users access the lines at 5pm, busy signals 
result.  With service level agreements that call for damages to be paid when 
capacity is unavailable, simple busy signals will not do.  An approach to 
this 
issue and thoughts on the trade off between oversubscription and liquidated 
damages will be the focus of this interesting talk.
