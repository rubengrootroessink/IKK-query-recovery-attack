FYI. Indian papers and politicians are complaining about the high prices for 
power that the state govt. in Maharastra is paying to Enron. The reason: 
Naphtha prices more than doubled in 1999 and the fuel cost is a pass through 
(I can't believe they let it floating!). They requested our help in pricing 
caps on naphtha.

Hi guys!
 I calculated the premiums for monthly caps for different cap (strike) levels 
using the 1999 prices as forward prices. The scenarios I included are:
1. At-the-money (ATM) caps: cap level = forward price (FP)
2. Out-of-the-money (OTM) caps: cap level = (1+x) * FP where x = 5%, 10%, 15% 
& 20%
3. Constant cap level across months: $168 (average of FPs), $200, and $250.

Brief results: Historical naptha volatility is 34% over last 2-years (which 
is higher than over the 10-year period - see the volatility chart). Premiums 
expressed as percent of the average naptha price for 2000:
 
             ATM =  10.4%
            ATM*=  13% (Assumiung FP = $224/MT)
    5%  OTM = 8.4%
   10% OTM = 6.8%
   15% OTM = 5.5%
   20% OTM =   4.4%
   $168 Cap  = 15%
   $200 Cap  = 9%
   $225 Cap  = 6%.

 If you are looking to protect from any price move up from the current level, 
you will be looking at 10-15% range. Please keep in mind these are only 
indicative, since we are just guessing the forward prices. Given such drastic 
changes in prices during the last year, we really need to get an indication 
of the forward prices. I made some inquiries here and found the name of the 
person trading naptha. It is John L Chismar in Singapore ( 
Ph.011-65-838-9016; email: jchisma@ect.enron.com). Please contact him today 
and try to get an indication of the forward prices and volatilities for 2000. 

 It would be much easier if we can install our Exotic Options Library in your 
office. We need to place it in a common drive that all of you can access. If 
any of the common drives you use is G, J, M, O, or P, I can send you the 
files to be installed. If your common drive has another initial, we need to 
do some programming here before sending to you. 

 Call me to discuss/clarify further. You can call me at home if necessary 
(home ph. 281-240-5705; I am awake till 11PM usually). 
best wishes,
Krishna.

Hi Mr.Krishnarao,

Was really nice talking to you! As per out telecon please find attached an 
excel sheet with the monthly FOB Naphtha prices from 1987-99. I am trying to 
get the forward prices for naphtha sent to you as well.

Appreciate the help from you!!

Thank & Best Regards,

Anshuman
