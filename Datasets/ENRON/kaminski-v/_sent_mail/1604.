Subject: Ethylene deal valuation



Dear All,

I would like to get together to review the Ethylene deal valuation. The desk 
is
about to submit the bid on Nov. 10.  Due to the size of this deal, we need to 
be as accurate as possible. 

I propose 1:30pm on Monday at one of our conference room.
If you have time conflict please let me know.

Zimin
