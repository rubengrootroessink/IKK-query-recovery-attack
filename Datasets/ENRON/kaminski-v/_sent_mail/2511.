Subject: Sabbatical



Dr. Kaminski:
?
I had intended to contact you regarding a position at Enron  this summer, but 
the department really needed me to teach a section of  undergraduate 
corporate finance this summer.? If all goes well,  and?there is a place for 
me at Enron, I would be able to start after the  summer session ends in 
late?July.? 
?
I?discussed the possibility of a sabbatical at Enron with  Drs. Tom Arnold 
and Alex Butler, both of whom send their regards, and they both  felt the 
experience would be invaluable given my research and career  objectives.? Dr. 
Arnold and I agreed that a sabbatical of 1-2 years would  be optimal.? I feel 
that it would be difficult to get a good idea of where  the company is 
headed, and to show how I can be a valuable team member in  helping it get 
there?in much less than a year.? He was afraid that the  university would 
begin to grumble if I was gone for much more than 2  years.? Any suggestions?
?
Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing  from you.
