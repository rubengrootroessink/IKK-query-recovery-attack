Dear Vince,

How did your meeting with the traders go yesterday?  If you heard any
feedback about our research from them, please let me know whom I may contact
to save you from forwarding our reports around every day.  I look forward to
your reply.

As usual, attached are today's issues of our daily morning faxes:
1. Financial Markets Today - FX majors and key bond markets' analyses.
2. Fixed Income Today - US treasuries, agencies, and corporates' analyses.

I look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Vadim Pokhlebkin
