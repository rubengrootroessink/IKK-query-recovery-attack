Hi Jana,

I shall be in NYC May the17th through 19th (flying back on Friday).
There are several good movies I would like to see.

Vince,
It was nice to see you and hear you speak the other day.  I am sorry we
didn't get to  visit more.  You are a "popular" guy!

How does Saturday, May 20, 2000 look for dinner and a movie with us?

Let me know.

Jana
