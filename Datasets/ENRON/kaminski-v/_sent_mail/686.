Molly:  I am meeting with Anshuman at 2:30 today and he will give me his 
documents.

However, I still need everything from you, as listed in my emails of January 
22 and February 13.  Please let me have this information asap so that I can 
send the package to our attorneys for processing.

Thanks
Margaret

I definitely think you should continue to "prod" Anshuman for his documents, 
and I will follow up with Sandeep for the job description.  

Thanks again for your help,
Molly

Molly:  Sorry, but I don't have any job description templates as the job 
description always comes from the HR recruiter/representative.

Do you want me to go ahead and send another email to Anshuman to get his 
documents so that I can proceed with the visa application?  
To date, I have not heard anything from him.

Please advise
Thanks
Margaret

I spoke today to Sandeep Kohli about Anshuman's job description, and he said 
that he would be happy to start on it right away (finally!).  Anyway, he then 
asked if we had any job description templates for visa applications, and I 
told him that I would check with you to see.   Can you help him with anything?

Molly
