Vince --

Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San 
Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market 
discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows 
the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.

Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their 
B-school in the evenings.

Thanks.

Jim Steffes

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor
Dept. of Industrial Engineering
and Operations Research
4117 Etcheverry Hall
University of California
Berkeley, CA 94720-1777
