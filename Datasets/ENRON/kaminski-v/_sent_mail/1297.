Winston, 
I am sending you the documentation on the new methodology for creating ffvols
from implied vols. This methodology requires some minimization procedure
to fit the given vol curve with a smoothing function. I am sending you the
code I wrote that performs minimization with simulated annealing method from 
Numerical Recipes.

We might need to discuss some details. Please, let me know if you have 
questions.

Tanya.
