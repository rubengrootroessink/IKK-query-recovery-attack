I need your help...  I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget 
and I am showing a significant increase from last year.  Did we have an 
increase in headcount?  I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used 
the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year 
(see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the 
following tabs:

 Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001
 Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA
 2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
 Research  2001 budget

The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in 
your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will 
bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to 
ENA and the increase in plan?  I am open all week except for Wednesday 
between 10 and 11.  Thank you.
