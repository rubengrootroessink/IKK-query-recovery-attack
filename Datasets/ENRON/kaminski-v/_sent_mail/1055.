Pearce, 

I shall be in my office, receiving many calls during the course.
Some of the calls may be confidential. This makes it a bit 
difficult.

Subject: PJM Training

Vince,

I was interested in signing up for the 2/27 PJM training, but found out the 
class was full.  After calling PJM, they told me that you were the only other 
person at Enron signed up for the course.  I was just curious, if I could sit 
with you and do the training at the same time since it is done over the 
computer.

If this is a problem, I understand.  Just thought I would ask.

Thanks,
