Thank you very much for your detailed answer to my question on e-Speak.  I 
find this area of study fascinating and would very much like to learn more.  
It's interesting that you mentioned the Amram/Kulatilaka book because I'm 
reading it right now!  I've talked with my director, Terry Galassini about 
the possibility of taking your classes this fall and it looks good so far.  
And I'd like to take you up on your offer of a set of binders on real options 
and energy industry applications. 
FYI, I'm a senior engineer in a facility planning group up here in Omaha 
although I obtained an MBA from the University of Houston a few years back.   
The concepts of risk/reward and all of the financial tools available to hedge 
risk in financial markets have always tantalized me in their possible 
parallels in the gas industry.   My recent personal discovery of this area of 
real option valuation has further piqued my interest.  

If you could, please add my name as a possible attendee to your fall 
presentations.  Thanks again for your e-Speak dialogue.
