Vince:

Here is the formatted shell for Basket Options.  You already have "Binary 
Options" and you can see the color scheme from that presentation.
Let me know if you need anything else.  Also, you can email me the 
presentation if it needs additionaI "dressing up" and you do not have the 
time to do it.  I need the finished presentations to send to the Copy Center 
by Thursday, October 19, 2000.  Thanks.  Anita
