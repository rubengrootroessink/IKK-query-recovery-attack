Dear Vince Kaminski:
   I enjoyed talking with the Enron representatives at Rice University
last week and was recommended to contact you regarding my strong interest
in pursuing a career with Enron Corporation.
   I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at Rice University and have the
highest current GPA in the Ph.D. program. I am also gaining knowledge in
Derivatives Pricing, Risk Management and Hedging at Rice University Jones
School of Management. I am very interested in an internship and/or
permanent position with your company beginning in the summer of 2001.
Enclosed please find a copy of my resume.  I've attached a second copy to
download, if necessary.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Tatiana Marinenko
