Dear Vince,

Thanks for writing back.?? I am glad to hear that Shane Green is working 
there and doing so well.? Please give him my regards.? 

Let's plan on having you speak for our Gamma Iota Sigma dinner on the evening 
of 2/23.? It is my understanding that you are going to be in town anyway for 
John Martin's "new economy" seminar.? Will you be needing a hotel 
accommodation for that evening?? If so, please let me know and I will have my 
secretary arrange accommodations for you.

Concerning class presentations, I am curious when whether we can try to 
arrange a date.? I am teaching two undergraduate sections of a business risk 
management course from 11-12:20 and 12:30-1:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays this 
spring.?? I also am teaching a graduate version of the same course from 
3:30-4:50 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but when you come I will probably have 
you speak to the undergraduate classes and have my graduate students attend 
either of those sessions.? The spring semester starts January 9 and ends May 
1, and the following dates are already taken for other speakers, exams, or 
spring break: 

Thursday, February 15 - Midterm exam 1
Tuesday, March 6 and Thursday, March 8 - no class (spring break)
Thursday, March 15 - presentation on risk adjusted discount rate 
methodologies by Dr. Richard Derrig, Automobile Insurers Bureau of 
Massachusetts
Tuesday, April 3 - Midterm exam 2

Please let me know at your earliest convenience when you would like to 
schedule a presentation.? Considering the fact that the presentation would be 
scheduled for around the middle of the day, it would probably be technically 
possible for you to make your visit into a day trip (back and forth from 
Houston) in case if you are pressed for time.? Continental flies here from 
Houston, but unfortunately the morning flight doesn't come in until 10:45 
a.m., which would be too late for a presentation to the 11 a.m. class.

Thanks again,

Jim

Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling
extensively
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student,
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance
& Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you
as our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate  and
graduate students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have
in mind is a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring
to my LSU classes.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to
seeing you once again.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
