Jana,

Friday, July 28th works for us. We can work out details
closer to the 28th.  If you take  Hardy Toll Road, you will need about 40-45 
minutes
to get to the Woodlands on Friday after 6:00 p.m. I shall send you detailed 
directions
later.

Look forward to seeing you again.

Vince

Vince,
Sorry it has taken me awhile to get back to you.  We were trying to sort out
our plans.

How does Friday, July 28 look?  Does it take about an  hour to get up there?

thanks

Jana
