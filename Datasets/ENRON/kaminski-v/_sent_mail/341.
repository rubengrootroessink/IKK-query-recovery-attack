Vince:

Molly called me today and Bhala wants us to get him an apartment for the
summer.  Will this be charged to our cost center or does he pay the rent
on this?

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Shirley

Stinson:   Just a friendly reminder about the job description for Bhala.  He 
called us today, and is becoming somewhat apprehensive about time.   He said 
that you need only provide 3-4 lines of a job description, and that it's not 
necessary to go into any real depth.   Bhala also wanted to confirm a start 
date of 5/28/01 so that he can give notice at his apartment.

Thanks,

Molly
