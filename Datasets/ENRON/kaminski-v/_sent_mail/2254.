Subject: EES Europe - Risk Management

Vince

Tried to find time to catch you when I was in the States during the week 
beginning 10Th July.
Best I managed was to say Hi on the bus one morning.

I wanted to tell you that I taking over responsibility for setting-up EES 
Europe's Risk Management activity and would like to talk to your guy's about 
ways in which they can help me. I know that you are providing a service to 
retail in US. 

Maybe we can talk, or one of your team give me a call.

I am out later today for the rest of the week but will be back in the office 
from Monday.
