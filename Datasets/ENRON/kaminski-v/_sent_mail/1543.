Thank YOU!  I appreciate your gentle arm-twisting at the meeting.  I've 
already talked with Sharad, and he has agreed to do a bio piece for Monday.  
Kate and that other new person ( whose name escapes me) will give us another 
three weeks.  Was it Alex who possibly had a Technical Corner article, or was 
that Sharad, too?

Sam

Good Morning, Vince!

After going over our department list, I believe that, with the exception of a 
part-timer or two, we have covered everybody in the newsletter.  If we have 
recently hired someone who might not be on the list, would you please let me 
know?  Also, if you have a good article from someone that we can use for a 
Technical Corner, we will need that, too.  I'm going to put out a general 
call for TC material today.  Hopefully, we will get several things we can use 
for the coming weeks.

Sam
