John,

What about Thursday, 10:30 a.m.? I have just come back from Europe
last night and I am trying to organize my schedule for the next few days.

My phone number is 713 853 3848.


Vince

Vince,

Can I call you Tuesday morning about our writing project?  I have to be in
Austin for a dental appointment on Monday at noon and that will probably
wipe out the day.  Give me a time and number where I can reach you.

John
