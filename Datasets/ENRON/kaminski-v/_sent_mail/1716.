Andrzej,

I shall be in the Bay area again  for Thanksgiving. I came to SF for one
day to
do recruiting at Berkeley. I hope you will feel better soon.

Wicku,
I hoped to hear from you. Please, let me know whether your plans have
changed, and if so, when you are coming to Palo Alto.

I spent theer weeks in Europe in September (had dinner with Leszek and
Ewa),
and went to Sydney as a guest of NBC. Upon return I caught a flu, and
travelled heavily congested to New York, which led to some ear
problems.Consequently I intend to stay put for several weeks, and will have
to reschedule my trip to Houston for Dec. or January. Hope to see you here
before then.
Best to all three of you.
Andrzej

Andrzej,

Thanks. Please, send me the information about the dates
when you plan to visit Houston. Also, the information about
your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
about the other members of your team) would be useful.

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Wicek
