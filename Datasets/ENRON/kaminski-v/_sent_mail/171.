Subject: Asset Swap and LIBOR Model Docs

The LIBOR and asset swap models are now live on the traders' desktops, so in 
order to aid your understanding and validation of them, here are the 
technical documents:

 << File: LiveLIBOR.pdf >>  << File: AssetSwap.pdf >> 

Please read, and report back with any questions, criticisms or ideas. 
Feedback is the only way we'll ever progress forward......

thanks

Ben
