Just a friendly reminder that tomorrow, Tuesday, August 15, is the day of the 
Economic Espionage Act presentation.  As you may recall, on August 1, I sent 
you an invitation to this presentation.   Our guest speaker is Mr. Dan Waltz 
from the law firm of Patton Boggs LLP.   In 1996, Congress passed the EEA.   
This Act helps shape how corporate American collects, uses and protects 
valued information.  Mr. Waltz will include in his presentation some 
hypothetical corporate case studies.   I believe this presentation will be 
most informative, and I hope that you will be able to attend.

The presentation is scheduled to begin at 1:30 and will be held in the 50th 
Floor Board Room.  If you have not yet confirmed your attendance to this 
presentation, please call my assistant, Sharon Purswell at 5-7212.   We hope 
to see you there!

Scott
