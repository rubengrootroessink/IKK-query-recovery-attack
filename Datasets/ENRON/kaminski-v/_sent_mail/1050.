Dear IAFE Member:

I would like to take this opportunity to wish you a Happy New Year.

2001 marks the 10 Anniversary of the IAFE and we will be celebrating with
a Winter Gala at The Yale Club Ballroom on February 8th.  The Black Tie
event will begin with cocktails at 6:00 and a sit down dinner at 7:30.
There will be
dancing and festivities including war stories by IAFE Senior Fellows, a
Silent Auction,
and a Financial Engineering Retrospective, to name a few.

A special award will be presented to Myron Scholes for his work on the
Black-Scholes Model.  For more information and to register for the
event please go to <http://www.iafe.org/whatsnew/gala2001.htm>.

We are pleased to report that we had a very exciting and productive
year with dozens of activities around the world. As we enter our 10th
year of operations, the IAFE has additional membership options available
to you. Please take a moment to renew your membership, if you have not
done so:  <https://www.iafe.org/about/register.ihtml>.  Based on member
requests, a Premium Membership is now being offered that includes the
Annual Conference at a 30% discount, the Financial Engineer of the Year
dinner, plus a subscription to the Journal of Derivatives (JOD). The Full
membership remains as in previous years. The new Regular
membership includes all Full membership benefits except JOD. Membership is
based on the calendar year January 1 - December 31, 2001.

Our website was recently updated, when you get a moment, please visit our
web site.  Make sure to check the calendar for upcoming events regularly
since we add to it frequently.  <
