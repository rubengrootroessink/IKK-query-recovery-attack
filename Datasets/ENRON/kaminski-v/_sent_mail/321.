Krishna,

Here is my working paper on the issue. We actually applied the alternative 
method
(put value) to the calculation of premium for managing the "liquidation 
value" curves.

I am working with the desk to get a list of all the projects we have with 
information about 
the technology class, region, volume etc. Shortly we will be able to apply 
these methodologies
and test them.

Osman
