Mike,

This one is very good. I am afraid we shall
have a few employees left after this test.

Subject: The QUIZ


The following short quiz consists of 4 questions and tells whether you are
qualified to be a "professional". Scroll down for each answer. The questions
are not that difficult.

1.  How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?



















The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close
the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an
overly complicated way.

2.  How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?


















Wrong answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the
refrigerator.

The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe,
put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to
think through the repercussions of your actions.

3.  The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals
attend except one. Which animal does not attend?


















The correct answer is: The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator.
This tests your memory. Okay, even if you did not answer the first three
questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your abilities.

4.  There is a river you must cross, but it is inhabited by crocodiles. How
do you manage it?



















The correct answer is: You swim across.  All the Crocodiles are attending
the Animal Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.
According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the professionals
they tested got all 4 questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several
correct answers. Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the
theory that most professionals have the brains of a four year old.
