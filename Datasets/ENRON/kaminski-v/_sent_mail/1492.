Subject: FYI: FERC Staff Report on Investigation of Bulk Power Markets


Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at 
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

The FERC staff recently released a report discussing markets in each of the
regions titled "Investigation of Bulk Power Markets". The report is not a FERC
Order.

The Northeast region is discussed in a section of 100 pages in length. PJM is
discussed in detail beginning on page 1-59. There are some minor inaccuracies 
in
the report with respect to PJM, such as the 1999 Peak Load.

The report is a good first step in understanding the complex markets in the
Northeast and their relationships among each other. The report also contains
recommendations and options for resolution of issues.

The complete report can be found at www.ferc.fed.us/news1/staffreports.htm
