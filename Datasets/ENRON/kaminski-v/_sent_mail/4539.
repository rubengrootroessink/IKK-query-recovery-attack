RE: Special Workshop Invitation: "Energy and E-Business: The New Quiet
Revolution" - Monday, February 7, 2000

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I am pleased to invite you as our guest to attend a special private CERA
workshop on "Energy and E-Business: The New Quiet Revolution," to be held
next Monday, February 7th from 9:00-11:00AM at the Westin Galleria Hotel in
Houston Texas, in conjunction with CERAWEEK 2000.  This event will be an
interactive forum to stimulate new thinking and an integrative framework for
how e-business will transform the energy industry - and the resulting
strategic and operational challenges.

The morning will include brief presentations by CERA experts focused on
e-business developments in various energy segments - retail, upstream, and
power - followed by discussion among participants on the implications and
lessons.

This event inaugurates CERA's "E-Squared" Energy and E-Business Retainer
Advisory Service - a new program offering continuous analysis and insight on
how e-business is changing energy industry strategy and structure - and how
companies can take advantage of the internet opportunity.  At the conclusion
of the session we will present our plans and research agenda for your
consideration and discussion.  We value your contribution to shaping this
new CERA offering.

To view the agenda for this session, and to obtain an enrollment form,
please go to  http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=524&c=2804

Participation is limited to CERAWEEK participants and invited guests.  To

FAX to (617) 497-0423 or email register@cera.com.  Alternatively, you may

follows.

Sincerely,

James Rosenfield
Executive Vice President
