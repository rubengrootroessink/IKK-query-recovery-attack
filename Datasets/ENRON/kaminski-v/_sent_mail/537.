Vince and Stinson,

I worked with IT guy, now the new version @energy 2.0 is working.   
You should see  an icon in start/programs/infobase/fea 2.0.
Launch that icon, fea will be loaded to your Excel.

Under FEA menu bar you can choose the Excel templates. 
We have license for the following products:
1)@Global. 1-4
2)@energy / Swing
3)SPAV

I also found the e-docementation attached below. Enjoy.


Zimin
