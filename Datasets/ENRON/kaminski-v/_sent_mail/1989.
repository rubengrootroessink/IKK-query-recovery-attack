Jim,

In response to the 3 questions below:

Who prepares Enron's country curves? - The Foreign Exchange and Country Risk 
group within Enron North America's Research Group is responsible for 
producing the forecasts of inflation and foreign exchange.

What is the criteria in determining the curves? Please explain. - The FX and 
Country Risk team analyses a host of data and information to forecast foreign 
exchange curves and predict inflation.   Primarily, we depend on the work of 
the Institute of International Finance (IIF), we also talk with their staff 
Senior Ph.D. Economists.  We review the current macroeconomic policy mix 
including monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies and their 
sustainability.   We also analyze the balance of payments to make sure their 
are no pressures on the current account, capital account  or foreign exchange 
reserves.   In addition, we look at economic output in light of all the above 
mentioned factors and incorporate our global outlook of global growth and 
international commodity prices.  Then we determine our expectations for 
changes to these conditions based on many domestic and international 
factors.  We also evaluate the progress of  IMF program and the countries 
ability and willingness to meet the IMF criteria, and whether or not they are 
in compliance with the Fund.    In addition, we analyze the political 
risk/stability of the country, timing of elections and or major 
constitutional or policy changes which would have a major impact on the 
economy.  We also perform a ratio analysis of a country's ability to repay 
its debt in the context of debt-to-GDP ratios, debt service, import coverage, 
FDI-to-current account, etc.   We analyze the stability of the country's 
banking system, level non-performing loans-to-total, bankruptcy laws, and 
progress on restructuring bad debts.   All these factors influence the 
outlook on local price changes and movement of the exchange rate.

How often do the curves get updated? - Curves are updated upon request from 
the Enron business units or RAC.  The business units need to have the curves 
updated before Risk Assessment and Control evaluates the projects.
