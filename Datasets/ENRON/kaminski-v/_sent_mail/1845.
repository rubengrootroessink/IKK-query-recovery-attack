Mike,

Using NASA satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a Houston 
Data Center to consolidate and centrally process 3D seismic data surveys for 
oil and gas extraction, exploration and development could save the petroleum 
industry more than $300 million dollars annually through reduced operational 
expenses.  Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the 
finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon 
$15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in 
revenue.  By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using 
this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the 
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.  By 
holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a 
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team 
is quantifying the valuation of this information)

Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data 
transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, 
calculated using $22/barrel oil.

Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a 
presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron 
potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October).
