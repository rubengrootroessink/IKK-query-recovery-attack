Lenos

I'd like to give a talk entitled "Diagrammatic Representation of Real Optio=
ns=20
in Enron", in which I will give a brief run-down of a diagrammatic techniqu=
e=20
I have developed for representing real option deals.  My notation allows=20
originators, managers and quants to communicate unambiguously, while still=
=20
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality.  I have defin=
ed=20
a "diagrammatic grammar" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal=20
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram.

I propose to introduce the symbols and grammar, then go on to present some=
=20
suitable examples of diagrams.  If appropriate I'll talk about the links wi=
th=20
dynamic programming.  (I will need some guidance as to how much technical=
=20
detail I can go into based on the audience.)

All the best,
Steve
