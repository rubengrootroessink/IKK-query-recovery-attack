Black and Blue: The California Electricity Restructuring Saga
George Gross
Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
University of Illinois at Urbana =01) Champaign


Abstract

California led the nation in the electricity restructuring arena. Starting
with the various and numerous forums of all the stakeholders at the
California Public Utility Commission, a wide =01) sweeping regulatory refor=
m
act giving customer choice to everyone was enacted in 1996. The
implementation of the restructuring began in 1998. Since May 2000, the
prices in the wholesale California electricity markets have stayed at
extremely high levels. Since the restructuring has frozen the prices at the
retail level, the market developments have put the two largest California
utilities on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, the state has suffered
major impacts due to the shortage of electricity in the past 9 months. Ther=
e
are key developments at both the state and federal levels impacting the
California situation. This presentation will review the major reasons for
this =01&dismal and
dangerous situation=018 in California. The focus will be on the market
developments and their interaction with the regulatory initiatives. The
experience to date will be assessed in terms of key issues in market
redesign and supply availability. The importance of the California
developments to the restructuring across the nation will be discussed.

George Gross is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and
Professor, Institute of Government and Public Affairs, at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research and teaching activities are in
the areas of power system analysis, economics and operations, utility
