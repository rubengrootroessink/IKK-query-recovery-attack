Larry,

Please, take a look at this candidate. I don't
think his profile matches my requirements, but he looks quite
interesting.

Vince

Dear Vince:

In following up on my voicemail message today, I attach my resume below for
your review and consideration.

It's ironic that you called while I was putting the message together.  I
will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience.

Best regards,

Paul
