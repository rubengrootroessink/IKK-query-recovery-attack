Subject: Monday's Newsletter

Hello Vince!

I'm working with Michael Sergeev to produce this next issue of the 
newsletter.  Do you have a suggestion for the Kaminski Column on Page One?  
If so, please tell me what you'd like to use and I'll get it ready either 
today or Monday morning.

At some point, when you have a couple of minutes, we should sit down and talk 
about your philosophy regarding the newsletter and what you would like to see 
in the future.  I'd like to get a little creative with it once I know your 
thoughts on this.

Best Regards,


Sam


p.s. - Note that I am "William Smith" in the Lotus Notes system.  There is 
also a "Will Smith" that works in IT.  We forward each other's mail all the 
time! :-)
