Dear Sheridan,=20

Thank you for taking time to speak with Brad Nebergall, Vince Kaminski and=
=20
myself regarding distance learning for the University of Texas Energy and=
=20
Finance program.  We enjoyed speaking with you regarding your plans for=20
taking the classroom to the web and feel that there are numerous=20
opportunities for Enron and UT to work together on this venture.=20

As you requested, I am sending you additional information on the services=
=20
that can be provided by Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  EBS offers two=20
distinct product offerings that could be provided to UT students. =20

1) EBS offers our customers a full spectrum of bandwidth services.  This=20
includes dark fiber, OCX-lambdas, DS3 and above circuits, and bandwidth=20
management solutions.  Our focus is to help the enterprise customer add val=
ue=20
and flexibility to their bandwidth service needs with features such as=20
bandwidth "on demand".  EBS owns over 18,000 miles of fiber optic cable tha=
t=20
provides EBS with an extensive network in the USA and Canada. =20

2) Enron offers a full turn-key streaming media service called e PowerTM =
=20
MediaCast.  This service can involve the entire management of the entire=20
process from filming through encoding, hosting and streaming or to supply t=
he=20
specific services that a client could need.   Each client  would access the=
ir=20
client's media through an URL embedded on the appropriate client=20
website(s).   The content can streamed live or stored to be played=20
on-demand.  EBS can deliver the streams at bit rates from 20kbps to 1Mbps o=
r=20
higher.  There are no additional resources (hardware, software or human)=20
required by a client to use our product. =20

Our current customers has found the superior quality of e PowerTM =20
MediaCast.has improved their ability to deliver a clear corporate philosoph=
y=20
and increase their customer retention.  The e PowerTM  MediaCast Network ha=
s=20
a distributed server architecture supported by a private global fiber and=
=20
satellite network (a pure Internet Protocol strategy) with embedded softwar=
e=20
intelligence that sets it apart from other network providers. The EBS e pow=
er=20
TM private network has dedicated servers in over 200 cities in the USA and=
=20
Canada. After the service is initiated, each client  can  access to reporti=
ng=20
of the viewership statistics for your content on the EBS Intranet Site=20
(www.epoweronline.com) that is updated on a daily basis.  Each client is=20
provided with a User ID and Password.  EBS guarantees their customers a=20
superior quality of service level.      =20

Our customers have found three major benefits.  First, Enron stores our=20
clients' content on our servers which reduces the strain on clients' centra=
l=20
servers and Website.  Second, Enron constantly monitors its clients' sites=
=20
and updates its servers regularly to keep the data fresh.  Finally, Enron=
=20
sharply cuts the time it takes a viewer to receive our clients' content by=
=20
delivering the media across Enron's private network and with the use of=20
software (bandwidth operating system) that decides within milliseconds whic=
h=20
Enron server can deliver the fastest.   To do that Enron servers, which=20
deliver our customer=01,s content, are located in over 200 cities in the US=
 and=20
Canada.  This places your content close to the end user (typically, "one-ho=
p"=20
away), and allows up to 500,000 simultaneous viewers at any time.  This=20
enables high quality, rich media to be streamed without delay and congestio=
n=20
to an end user's desktop.  In fact, Enron recently announced plans to insta=
ll=20
18,000 of our media servers (Compaq and Sun) into our global Data Centers=
=20
over a three year time period to extend our service domestically and=20
internationally.

We offer two internet sites to browse that demonstrates the true TV-like=20
experience of the e PowerTM  MediaCastexperience. =20

 1) http://www.enron.net/mediacast
 =20
 a) User name and login ID are both  -  epower4.=20

 2) http://www.enron.net/finance/srv_demo/enron/ms1250.html

 a) Once you are at this page called Today's Feature - click on the ACME TV=
=20
and chose one of the channels
 b) Chose the speed of your video player (either REAL or WindowsMedia Playe=
r)
 c) Hit the play arrow button on the "Screen" that pops


Finally, I estimate the cost per student to stream the course would be=20
approximately $75.00.  Please remember this price is for the streaming only=
,=20
and is priced on a per MB delivered basis.  In addition, there will be a fl=
at=20
monthly charge to administer the program.  Production and encoding can be=
=20
provided at an additional cost.    Therefore, if the stream rates in my=20
assumptions listed below change, our pricing will change slightly.  As you=
=20
will see the cost for the streaming would be a minimal and would not prohib=
it=20
the students from taking the course on-line.  I apologize that we do not ha=
ve=20
any example distance learning clips that we are able to share with you at=
=20
this time.  However, I would be happy to demonstrate our capabilities to yo=
u=20
on your desktop, if you are interested.=20

I look forward to discussing with you in greater detail how either of these=
=20
services could be used to expand the reach of the University and its course=
=20
offerings.    I will contact your office at the beginning of next week to=
=20
continue this discussion.  If you would like to contact me prior to next=20
week, please do not hesitate to call me at 713 853-3242.   =20
