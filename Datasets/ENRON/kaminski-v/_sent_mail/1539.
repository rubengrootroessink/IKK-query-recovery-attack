Subject: Christmas List

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks
                                                          Kevin Moore
