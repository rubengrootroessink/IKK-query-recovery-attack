Vince and Mike,

Do you think our International Economic Review (see attached) that we sent to 
the traders today would make a good addition to the technical corner for next 
week?  We intend to publish this Economic Review and Central Bank Monitor 
article weekly.

Thanks for your feedback.

Gwyn Koepke for
Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
