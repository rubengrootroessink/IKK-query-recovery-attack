Vince -

I work in the Caribbean Structuring Group and previously worked at Entergy 
Power Marketing on the Structuring desk with Gary Zhu.  I am attaching the 
resume of a friend from Entergy who holds a PhD in Operations Research.  He 
is considering a move from Entergy and from speaking with Li Xiao I thought 
that your group might be a good fit for him.  Please call with any questions 
(x 67446).
