Mike,

Bad news.

It may be necessary to go to Sydney.

Vince--

Although I'd love to go to Sydney (2 or 3 days business and add on my 240 
remaing hours of vacation to travel the Outback),

It would probably make more sense for Christian to come here so both myself 
and Joe can work together with him (as well as Jose, Dave & Todd as needs be)

Either way, I agree with you that we need to exploit what he's got to the max.
