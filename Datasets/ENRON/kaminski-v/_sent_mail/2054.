Today's Focus: The rumor mill
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

There have been a lot of rumors and speculation recently about
the future of Novell. Some have the company being acquired -
by, among others, IBM, Lucent, Cisco, Sun and AT&T - while
others see the company selling off its best technologies
(eDirectory and file caching) to separate companies.

Neither of these will happen in the near future, the next six
to 12 months. The company is making money, although not a lot
of money, and it does have a significant amount of cash on hand
with little or no outstanding debt. But because the stock price
is currently so low ($9 to $10 per share over the past few
months), sale of the company wouldn't bring in enough to
satisfy the stockholders. And any company offering what Novell
stockholders want would be in trouble with its own
stockholders.

Selling off technologies makes even less sense, since it would
leave Novell with more cash (which it doesn=01,t need) and fewer
products to sell.

Instead, watch as new marketing and sales programs are launched
in the fall. These will either boost sales back to 1999 levels
or precipitate a wholesale turnover of top management, leading
to more rumors of a sellout. And those rumors might be true.
