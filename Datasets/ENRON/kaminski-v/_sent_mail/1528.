Subject: Rice University ALP program -- December 1st deadline


On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your
project. We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance.

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far,
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase
the diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give
our students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the
Jones School ALP program.

Carrie Miller                                           Pam
