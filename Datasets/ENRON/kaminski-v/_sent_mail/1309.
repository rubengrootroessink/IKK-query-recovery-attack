Andrea,

It's fine with me. Few points:

1. As a courtesy to Maureen Raymond, please, discuss the timing with her.

2. Yana is not a member of the Analyst/Associate pool. THIS IS NOT A ROTATION.
     She was hired directly and   this means that we transfer her
     permanently to your unit.


Vince

I spoke to Yana today and understand that you are supportive of Yana rotating 
through our group, EIM Fundamental Analysis.  We are very pleased that Yana 
will be joining us.  Her skill set will be particularly helpful as we build 
the steel business.

I was hoping that Yana could begin working with us mid December.   Does a 
start date in EIM of Dec. 18 work for you?  Please let me know.

Once again, thank you for your support.

Andrea
