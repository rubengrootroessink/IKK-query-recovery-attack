Hi Zimin!

Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps. 
The structure of this particular swap is:  

semi/semi Act/365F
>
> YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2
> p = payment month
>
The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will 
notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as 
opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).

Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by 
swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.



Looking forward to your comments.

Best regards,

Martina
