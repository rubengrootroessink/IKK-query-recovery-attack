Dear Mike

I would like to apply for the above position as advertised in "EARTHWORKS" and
enclose my full CV (In Word 97/00 format) in support.

I am currently a research Fellow with UCL conducting research, and building
forecasting models for the statistical prediction of North Atlantic Sea 
Surface
Temperatures and other climatic parameters at long leads (1-12 months ahead of
forecast period).

I have recently applied this model to the North Sea in order to aid long-lead
forecasts of Fish Stocks (see SAP-symposium, 4-6 December, Bergen, Norway), 
and
have recently been applying similar models to the North Atlantic Oscillation, 
an
atmospheric phenomena which is strongly correlated with winter climate over
UK/Norway and NW Europe, particularly temperatures, rainfall and windspeeds 
(see
enclosed poster which was presented recently at an international conference on
the NAO in Vigo, Spain)

As you will see from my CV, I have 2+ years experience consulting in several
areas of geoscience to the oil, gas and minerals industries and have good
programming skills, both on Unix machines and on PCs.

I am particularly keen to apply my skills in the commercial sector and 
initiate
a permanent career path.

I look forward to the opportunity of hopefully discussing my skills further 
with
you in the near future.

Yours sincerely

Tony Hamilton
