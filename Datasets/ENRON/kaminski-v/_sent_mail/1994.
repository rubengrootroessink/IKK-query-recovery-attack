Vince,

Here is a copy of the article I received from Maureen/Gwyn a couple of weeks 
ago.  When you get back from your  vacation, would you please let me know if 
it is usable?

Thank You!

Sam

Sam,

Attached is a tech corner article on the british pound sterling for the next 
issue of the weekly newsletter.  I will be out of the office on Friday Sept 
1st.  If you have any questions or issues to address with the article, please 
refer to Maureen Raymond Castaneda or Yana Kristal in my absense.  Thanks.

Gwyn
