Dear Mr.Kaminski,

I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other
departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
this mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thank you
