Folks:
We interviewed three candidates. One of the three (Tony Hamilton)  seems to 
be a very good fit within the Enron culture and values.
Recommended Next Steps
Vince, Mike and Jeff interview Tony via video conference or avistar

Tony Hamilton Key Strengths
Quick thinker
Good teams skills
Driven - will be able to get the project off the ground quickly
Has a commercial attitude
Sees "the big picture"

Tony Hamilton is available for follow up interviews the first week of January.
Thanks
Jen
