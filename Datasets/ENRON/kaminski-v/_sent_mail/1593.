Subject: Hello Vince


Vince,

A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime
the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for
our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you
can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime
in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and
I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How
about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the
same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then
together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on
Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do
the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made
some real progress.

Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in
the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our
discussions next Monday and Tuesday.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our
paper.

Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the
reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow.

Take care.

John

p.s. Take a look at my web site for a review of the spring "new economy and
business education conference".  By the by, I need a short bio-sketch on
you for the site and for my introduction to the faculty and the class.
