David,

I expect I shall be able to move a very significant amount of  dollars
into my ML account soon.

I hope you will treat me well.

Hello, Vince.

The bonds have been doing great.  We need to start looking at getting some
equity exposure for this account.  When can we get together to discuss some
equity portfolios?

Do you have some more money to deposit?
