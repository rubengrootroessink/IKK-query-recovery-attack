Today's Focus: Adobe Acrobat PDF vulnerability
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jason Meserve


Problem with Adobe Acrobat PDF format

Panda Software reported last week that Adobe has issued a patch for
its Acrobat software that is used to read PDF document files. Used to
transmit high-quality reproductions of documents across the Internet,
the format was thought to be secure. But with all things Internet,
there must be a hole. It turns out code can be embedded in a PDF file,
which could be used to deliver a virus, Trojan or other nasty tidbit.
Adobe recommends users install the following patch for protection:
ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/acrobat/win/4.x/ac405up2.exe
**********


Microsoft releases patch for "Malformed IPX Ping Packet" vulnerability

This patch for Windows 95, 98 and 98 Second Edition, fixes a problem
that could allow an external user to flood a machine using the IPX Ping
command. If a network has a number of machines affected with the
problem, the exploit could be used to flood the network with excess
data packets. For more information and patches:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-054.asp

Debian fixes mailman problem

Debian announced that it has fixed a problem in the mailman Version 2.0
application. The flaw could be used by a local user to gain group
mailman permissions. For source downloads:
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody/main/source/mail/mailman_2.0beta5-1.di
ff.gz
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody/main/source/mail/mailman_2.0beta5-1.ds
c
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody/main/source/mail/mailman_2.0beta5.orig
.tar.gz

Red Hat fixes mailman problem

Like Debian and others, Red Hat has fixed its version of the mailman
list server software for Linux. For source downloads:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/secureweb/3.2/SRPMS/mailman-2.0beta5-1.src.rpm
**********


SuSE in process of fixing multiple vulnerabilities

SuSE put out a general alert saying it is working on fixes for a number
of problems in its Linux implementation and third-party applications.
The problems being fixed deal with Netscape, knfsd, system user account
nobody, pam, gpm, openldap, mailman, cvsweb.cgi and knon2. Look for
more here when the actual patches become available. For more on SuSE:

Today's virus alerts:

Kak.Worm.B -- Kak.B is a direct descendant of the original Kak virus,
the only difference being the name of the Trojan file that infects the
computer. This virus exploits a hole in Microsoft Outlook. (Panda
Software)

Backdoor/Doly.17 -- This Trojan installs a "server" on the target
machine, while the perpatrator used a client to execute damaging
attacks on the infected computer. (Panda Software)

Beah -- A boot-sector virus that disables virus detection of most
system BIOS by making changes to the CMOS. (Panda Software)
