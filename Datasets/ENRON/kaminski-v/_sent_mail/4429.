Ynot Get Char-azy?

So the day of love has passed and some of us are reveling in the piles of 
Valentine's cards we have received. Of course, all of mine are e-cards so I 
can only frolic near my computer not among the masses of paper greetings that 
shamelessly fall short of the sentiment our greeting cards convey (and no! I 
didn't HAVE to say that...)

International Women's Month is being celebrated this March. Make sure you 
send a card to the women who have inspired you. Remind them that their 
presence in your life has made an impact! Celebrate their existence!

Spring is on its way, which means, the end of those winter blues. Hooray! I'm 
so glad to have the beautiful, blossoming flowers and the allergic reactions 
to look forward to. It's time to invest in those tissues! But in all 
seriousness, I love spring. It's a time to regenerate, to plant and plan for 
the summer days to come.

I can't forget St. Patrick's Day. I have far too many Irish friends (or 
friends who, in the very least, like to "act" Irish) to let that one slide on 
by without comment. I'm already worried about the level of "party" I have to 
achieve to prove my "spirit"! Remember to enjoy this holiday safely (if 
soberly won't apply). Happy St. Patrick's Day!
