Vince

We had such a nice time at dinner on Friday evening. Thank you, again. We
enjoyed meeting Ludmilla, and look forward to meeting your son.  I hope he is
feeling better.

I am forwarding you a newletter from Specs re their wine classes, etc.  I
thought you might enjoy seeing this.  Maybe we can all take one sometime.

Have a good week.

Jana

shrimp, pork, beef, even M&Ms.
