Hi Vince

RE: EUROPEAN ENERGY 2000, 3 & 4 APRIL 2000, AMSTERDAM

I hope all is well in sunny Houston. It is with great pleasure that I enclose 
details of our forthcoming annual European congress, European Energy 2000. I 
would very much like to invite you to become involved as a chairperson and 
speaker for the following topic 'Applying weather risk management 
methodologies to the European energy market', although I would of course be 
more than happy to discuss any of the other sections with you eg. 'Estimating 
volatility for efficient pricing, trading and risk management'.

I hope we can work together on this event and I look forward to hearing from 
you soon. As always, my deadline is quite tight so I would appreciate 
receiving a response from you at your earliest convenience.
Kind Regards
Angela Adedeji
