Mr. Kaminski;

 I am a Research Associate at Meridien Research
(www.meridien-research.com) in the greater Boston Area. We specialize in the
reporting and analysis of technology in the financial service industry.  I
work in the Risk and Trading Group.
 Currently I am working on a report on Energy Risk Applications.  I
introduced myself to Mr. Scott Neal who informed me that I should contact
you (see below). I would like to spend some time talking to you about
Enron's risk management for energy trading.  And if possible, I would like
to be able to include Enron in my report since they are the global leader in
Energy.
 If it is possible, I would like to talk this week.  My calendar is
pretty open so whenever you would like to talk.  I think the conversation
should take about 45 minutes to an hour.  If you would like a list of
questions, I would be more than happy to provide them.
 I can be reached at 617-796-2830 or dkovelsky@meridien-research.com.
 I look forward to talking to you,

Cheers,

Damon Kovelsky

I believe Vince Kaminski could possibly be of assistance in this matter.

Mr. Neal,

     I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you
about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy
risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I
would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of
questions,
I would be happy to provide them.
     This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't
want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy
risk applications are being used "on the ground".  I would like to be able
to write about Enron, but it is not required.
     I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
