Vince,
It was good seeing you again today.  I want to make sure the NFCF is on
your calendar for May 4-5.   You should be receiving some registration
materials shortly.

Please plan on coming if you can.
Also, please attend the dinner on Friday evening along with your wife if
possible.

Regards,
Dave
