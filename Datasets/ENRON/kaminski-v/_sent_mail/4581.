Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski
Vice President, Research
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

We want to make a special offer to you regarding the mid-project workshop
for CERA's new study "High Tension: The Future of Power Transmission in
North America".  This session will be held on Friday, February 11, 2000 from
8:30AM - 1:30PM in the Monarch Room at the Westin Galleria Hotel, in
Houston, Texas.

In consideration of your participation in CERAWEEK 2000, we invite you to
enroll in the workshop for a special, stand-alone fee of $5,000.
Participation in the workshop (normally available only to those enrolled in
the study) will provide you with the workshop briefing book, a recap of work
to date, a review of the initial scenarios and an interactive discussion on
sign posts, strategic implications and business segment analysis.

To view the online prospectus for the study, and to get the workshop
enrollment form, please go to:

This timely and important study analyzes the key issues and uncertainties
facing the electric transmission business, including industry structure,
strategy, policy and regulation, technology, market structure, reliability,
and operations.  The main project objective is to develop a scenario-based
framework for understanding the risks and business opportunities.

We hope you can join us for this timely event, and to take advantage of this
special offer.  To enroll in the workshop, please complete and return the
form found on the web page above.  For more information, please contact me

Sincerely,

Peter Augustini
Director, North American Energy
