FYI

http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/

My first impressions are that R/S can be quite powerful but is not as 
intuitive as it might be (e.g. it has taken me quite some time to understand 
how to manipulate and collate data sets.)
For this reason, I have ordered a "Basics of S" book from Amazon.  If it 
turns out to be useful, I will pass on the title to you.

Grant.
