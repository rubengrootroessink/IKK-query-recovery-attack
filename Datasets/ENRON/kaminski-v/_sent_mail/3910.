Dear Professor Kaminski,

    It was a great opportunity to meet with you and Mr. Masson. Enclosed are 
digital
pictures at LaTour D'Argent. Thanks again for your kind hospitality.

    We have translated almost a half of the book "Managing Energy Price 
Risk". We are now
finding a publisher of Japanese book and want to know the contact in Risk 
Publications. It
is very kind of you if you can let me know the successor of the editor of the 
book who may
still be anonymous and then a general contact who may assist us to find him 
or her.

    I hope we can host you soon in Tokyo.

Best regards,

                                            Masayuki Fujita
                                            Mitsubishi Research Institute, 
Inc.
