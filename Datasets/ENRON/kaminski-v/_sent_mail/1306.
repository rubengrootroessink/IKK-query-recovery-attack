Louise,

Thanks.

My understanding is that they offer it through video conferences.

Thanks  - we are going to set up interviews.  We are making progress on the 
Course (although they do not offer any online piece - is that your 
understanding?).

Subject: A resume

Louise,

I am sending you a resume I received today. She graduated from the same 
university
in Poland I attended (many moons earlier). She recently got an additional 
degree in e-commerce.
