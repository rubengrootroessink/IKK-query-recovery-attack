Hi Vince:
This Zeigham Khokher at the University of Texas at  Austin, Finance 
Department.
?
I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available 
here.? It is basically the historical prices  for price of oil, gas and gold 
futures contracts and options.
?
Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all.? Let me 
know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.? 
All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.
?
Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk  at UT this fall?and look 
forward to seeing you then.
?
Regards
Zeigham
