This is to let you know that I am leaving Risk Books today. I want to thank
you for being such a good friend to us - right the way back to MEPR1 - and
to give you my home email so that you have me on file should you want some
publishing input in the future.

shan@pmillie.freeserve.co.uk

Hoping all goes well with you.
