=09Syncrasy provides individual forecasts for over 1,600 weather stations i=

continental US. For any one of these stations, you can compare all 14 weath=
er=20
forecasts side-by-side either to gain statistical confidence in a particula=
r=20
outcome or to quantify the weather risk of a specific forecast.  If you rel=

=09Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most accurate =

when actual temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, or when temperatures=

using Difference Graphics, a user can view the difference in surface=20
temperature between "Weather Vendor A" and "Weather Vendor B" across the US=

=09ENHANCE YOUR WEATHER COMPARISONS TO INCLUDE TRAILING AVERAGES
=09
=09The meteorological community frequently relies on one dataset for compar=
ative=20
purposes: the "30 year average." This "30 year average," however, may not b=
e=20
an ideal comparison as it is defined as the 30 year average over the period=
=20
from 1961 to 1990. Syncrasy broadens the user's information by including=20
options allowing users to compare any weather forecast to the trailing 30,=
=20
15, 10, or 5 year averages. =20
