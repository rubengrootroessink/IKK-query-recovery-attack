WEEKLY REVIEW
http://www.erisk.com/news/weekly/news_weekly2001-05-04_01.asp
This week's economic, banking and P&C insurance news, from an enterprise risk 
management perspective. Featuring exclusive coverage of this week&#8217;s 
RIMS conference in Atlanta.

ANALYSIS
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_analyses.asp
? Who matters most - stakeholders or shareholders?
? Risk managers neglect overseas operations at their peril.
? Mobile banking is on the way - but will banks benefit from it?

BASLE RESOURCES
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp
Now you can find all ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive coverage of the Basle II 
proposals on bank capital adequacy in one place: 
www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp. You&#8217;ll find all our recent coverage, 
including features, event transcripts, news stories, interviews and analysis 
along with links to other resources, regulatory summaries and rating agency 
and industry association responses.

BASLE SPECIAL
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
Continuing our special coverage of the proposed new regulatory capital rules, 
we look at Basle&#8217;s approach to operational risk. Rob Jameson explores 
the proposals to set a regulatory capital charge for op risk, and canvasses 
industry opinion on how they might work in practice.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
In this special Q&A, Ashish Dev of KeyBank talks to ERisk about what his bank 
has discovered so far from its internal testing on the impact of the new 
Basle proposals. It&#8217;s too early to say for sure, but many banks may not 
find much reason to improve their risk management practices. You can find out 
Dev's perspective on the Basle proposal in our iConference archive.
