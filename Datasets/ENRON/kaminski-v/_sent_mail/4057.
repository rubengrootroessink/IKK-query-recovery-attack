Subject: Some municipal bonds for you to look at.....


I called out muni desk to have them take a look at the current munis avaiable 
that looked best at this time to invest $50,000 going out to 30 years for 
you.  The following is what they came up with....

Pecos Co TX Cert of Obl w/a Coupon 5.5% Matures in 02/01/11 callable at par 
on 02/01/07 offered at $101.964 - AAA rated

Brownsville Util Rev w/a coupon of 5.25% maturing in 09/01/15 callable at par 
on 09/01/05 offered at $97.425 - AAA rated

Alvin TX ISD PSF w/a coupon of 5.75% maturing in 08/15/22 callable at par on 
08/15/10 offered at par - AAA rated

Houston TX Air Revs w/a coupon of 5.00% maturing in 07/01/28 callable at par 
on 07/01/08 offered at 86.479 - AAA rated

Remember, these are subject to change, but if these interest you and they are 
not still available, I will see if there is something comparable.

Talk to you soon.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks, Julie
