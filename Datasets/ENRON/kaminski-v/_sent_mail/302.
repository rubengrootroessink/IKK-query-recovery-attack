Subject: Weather Derivates - Project report

As part of "Options and other derivates" class I am taking at UH, I had to 
submit a report on either "Weather Derivaties" or "Asian Options" as part of 
individual term project. I choose "Weather Derivatives" and for what it is 
worth, I am attaching a copy of that report for those individuals who are 
interested in "Weather Derivatives".  



Note that in the employee meeting, there was mention of using weather 
derivatives to manage our volumetric risk
