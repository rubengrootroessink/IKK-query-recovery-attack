Vince,

 I spoke with Susan Wood, who heads up our emissions marketing effort who 
says we don't really have any materials we send out. She did recommend the 
Emissions trading handbook which can be purchased for $50 from 
http://www.etei.org/handbook_changed.htm. 

 In general, the site http://www.etei.org/ is a great source of info, and the 
the parent site, http://www.emissions.org should be checked out as well. If 
you'd like me to purchase the handbook (it will take three weeks) let me know.

Joe

Szanowny Panie,

Chcielibysmy zaczac propagowac w Polsce idee handlu prawami do emisji 
zanieczyszczen. Dlatego tez prosilbym o przeslanie, najlepiej droga emailowa 
materialow dotyczacych tej koncepji - glownie chodzi mi o strone 
"merytoryczna".

Z powazaniem,

Adam Brulinski
