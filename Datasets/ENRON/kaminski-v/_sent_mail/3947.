Hi Shirley,

Thanks for your message.  It's not surprising that someone who is as busy
as Dr. Kaminski is running a bit behind.  I've organized a number of
conferences, and it always turns out that the best speaker is the last one
to get his presentation ready.  We are very lucky to have him speak at our
conference, and I am happy to help.

There will be an SVGA data projector with an LCD colour data projector and
screen available.

If he would like the conference participants to have copies of his material
during his presentation, perhaps he could take it to the hotel's 24-hour
business services area when he arrives (or when it's ready) and I will pick
up the copies before registration begins at 8:00.  If he doesn't mind me
waiting to distribute the copies on the first break, I can take care of the
copying once everyone is seated and his talk begins.

If he chooses to have the copies ready first thing in the morning, please
have him request 55 (three-hole punched) copies to be charged to the
University of Waterloo's function.  If it's all right to hand them out
later, he can bring me the diskette when he comes down to the Stuart
meeting room on the third floor.  I will be there for registration and
continental breakfast beginning at 8:00.

Please let me know which he prefers.

Thanks!

Amy
