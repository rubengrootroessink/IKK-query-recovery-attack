Subject: Research Group Denim Shirts

I am going to order denim shirts for the Research Group again.  If you do not 
have one or need a new one, please let me know by Friday, June 23, 2000.

FYI - new group members
The Research Group will provide you with a long sleeve denim shirt that says 
"Research Group" above the pocket.  The first shirt is free, any after that 
you will have to pay for (approximately $45.00).

Please furnish me with your shirt size:  Men Or Women - Small, Medium, Large, 
or Extra Large.

Thanks!
