Pierre-Philippe,

Thanks for your message. I shall be glad to make a presentation in early
November. I understand the presentation are on Fridays and November the 3rd
would be the best date for me.

If you prefer November the 10th, we have to wait a few more days with the
decision. We have a management conference every year in San Antonio and it
will be held either in the 2nd or the 3rd week of November. I shall know in a
few days. The same goes for November 9, assuming it was not a mistake (it's
Thursday).

I shall be free for dinner on the day of the conference. Thanks for the
invitation.

 Vince
