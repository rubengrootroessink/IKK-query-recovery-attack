Sam,

Good thinking. I shall also write an article over the weekend so we shall 
have one in reserve.

Good Morning, Vince!

As I will be on vacation (tomorrow until Monday the 27th), I'm enlisting 
Elena Chilkina's help in producing this Monday's (20 Nov.) newsletter.  
Here's how I hope it will work:  

I've asked Alex Huang to try to get his article to you by Friday for your 
review.
I'm attempting to get with Sharad today to get his photo and remind him about 
the bio piece for page one.  He should be the feature for Monday.
I will also schedule a person and an article (probably from Charlie Weldon) 
for the 27th.  If Alex's article is a two-parter, we'll just do part 2 that 
day instead.
For all submissions for this coming Monday's issue, I would ask that they be 
e-mailed to Elena Chilkina


If you notice something I may have missed,  would you please let me know?


Thank You!

Sam
