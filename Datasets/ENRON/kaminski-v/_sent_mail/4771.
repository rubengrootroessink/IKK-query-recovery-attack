El Paso Says Enron Successful Firm Capacity Bidder

    El Paso Natural Gas says that it contracted its remaining 1.2 Bcf per day
of firm interstate pipeline capacity to Enron North America for $38 million
plus upside potential for a one year term. Combined with the sale of 99.3
MMcf per day to Williams Energy Marketing and Trading, the total revenues
generated for the capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas system is $45.5 million
for the year 2000, an increase of 30% over the annual average revenues
generated from this capacity during the past two years. Following an offer
made by an undisclosed shipper, an open season was held to provide an
opportunity for other shippers to better the rates in the contract pursuant
to FERC regulations. The open season resulted in the contract with Enron
North America.


Kinder Morgan Buys Interest in Trailblazer

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has bought Columbia Energy Group's
one-third interest in Trailblazer Pipeline for $38 million. Trailblazer owns
a 436-mile, 492 MMcf per day natural gas pipeline from Rockport, Colorado, to
Beatrice, Nebraska. The purchase allows Kinder Morgan to take advantage of
increased natural gas exploration in the Rocky Mountains. Last week, it
agreed to acquire another third of Trailblazer as part of a $700 million
purchase of natural gas pipelines from its parent, Kinder Morgan Inc. Enron
owns the other third.
