Judy,

Sorry, I cannot help you on this one.

I already cover a number of campuses.

Subject: HARVARD Recruiting

We've had a last minute cancellation of one of our 2nd round interviewers at 
Harvard and wanted to know if you would be interested in interviewing.  Our 
offer/acceptance rate has been extremely dismal at Harvard and would like to 
get you involved for the summer internships.  We have a pre-interview 
reception on Friday, 3/2/01and Interviews on Saturday, 3/3/01.  1st rounds in 
the Morning and 2nd rounds in the PM.  If you are unable to participate, 
could you possibly recommend someone at a very senior level of management to 
substitute?  Thanks.
