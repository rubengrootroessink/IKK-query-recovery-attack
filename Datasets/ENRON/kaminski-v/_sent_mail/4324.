New England's Natural Gas Industry Reaches New Growth Levels
( March 23, 2000 )
(relayed by Bob Brooks, GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System)
PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 23 /PRNewswire/ -- The natural gas industry in New
England continues its fast rate of growth, in terms of new customers and
new supply capabilities, industry and government leaders learned today at
The New England Gas Association's annual Energy Conference held at The
Westin Hotel in Providence.
Alfred P. Degen, chairman of The New England Gas Association, and chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Valley Gas Company, based in
Cumberland, Rhode Island, said: "The interest in natural gas has never been
stronger in New England. We look forward to continued growth in the years
ahead, to bring reliable, efficient, and cost-effective natural gas to
homes and businesses throughout the region."
This growth in New England is reflected in such developments as:
* A 25% growth in the region's pipeline infrastructure over the last year:
-- two new pipelines from Canada - the Portland Natural Gas Transmission
System (PNGTS), and the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline from Nova
Scotia;
-- system expansions by the region's transmission and local distribution
companies;
* A new supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Caribbean:
-- the Cabot LNG Corporation's Atlantic LNG Project made first
deliveries to New England in May 1999;
-- LNG deliveries to New England in 1999 were more than double 1998
levels;
* There are more natural gas customers in New England than ever before:
-- NEGA reports that New England now has over 2.2 million natural gas
customers, from homeowners to small and large businesses;
-- The region's gas utilities reached a new record sendout of gas on
January 17, 2000, reaching 3.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a 13%
increase over the previous record.
"Over the past year," said Degen, "the New England natural gas industry
installed more new miles of pipelines than it has in decades. Whole areas
of New England are gaining access to gas for the first time, and the rest
of the region is receiving substantial new supplies as well."
The Conference was attended by more than 300 industry and government
officials. In his keynote address, Gary L. Neale, chairman, president and
CEO of NiSource, Inc., and chairman of the American Gas Association
(A.G.A.), reported on the national natural gas market projections found in
A.G.A.'s recent study, "Fueling the Future." Neale noted that increased
natural gas demand has multiple national benefits, including:
environmental, energy security, trade, and economic development.
NEGA, based in Needham, Massachusetts, was established in 1926. Its
membership includes all of New England's local natural gas utilities, the
interstate pipeline companies, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, and
over 280 associate member companies. The natural gas utilities serve over
2.2 million customers in 490 communities in New England.
