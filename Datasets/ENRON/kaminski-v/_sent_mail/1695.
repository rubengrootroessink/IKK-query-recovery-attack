Vince,
Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I 
am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus.  He should go through 
the on-campus screening process before attending a Super Saturday.  We are 
reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely 
to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.  
Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it 
is possible for him to interview when they go on campus.
Charlene

Kevin and Kristin,
Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate 
to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.  

Thanks

Charlene,

Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
Super Saturday? I really want
to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
efforts.

Vince
