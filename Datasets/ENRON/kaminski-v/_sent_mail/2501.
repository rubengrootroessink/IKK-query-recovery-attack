Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Keith Shaw

We=01,re back after a small hiatus, to bring you more white papers
courtesy of Network World. This week we=01,ve got a report on how to
prevent those nasty denial-of-service attacks,  a look at the SunTone
Certified Services for Service Providers program, and a Network World
white paper on network storage issues.

Arrowpoint Communications
Web Site Security and Denial of Service Protection

Preventing a denial-of-service (DOS) attack is critical for most Web
sites. These attacks are specifically designed to bring down a Web site
using methods that appear to be normal network traffic  until it is
too late. Web site administrators have used packet filtering in their
IP routers to provide basic access control, but often this slows router
performance to an unacceptable point and fails to eliminate many common
types of DOS attacks. Furthermore, traditional firewalls were designed
to prevent access to systems, a concept that is incompatible with
today=01,s Web.

With that in mind, Arrowpoint presents its case for Content Smart Web
Switches that provide comprehensive Web site and back-end system
security capabilities, as well as the right level of security, without
sacrificing scalability or performance. The paper looks at the switches
and how they can help prevent the DOS attacks.

Sun Microsystems
SunTone Certified Services for Service Providers

With the explosion of service providers offering Internet services, Sun
created the SunTone certification and logo program to recognize and
promote investments in process, methodology and infrastructure
elements that promote secure, reliable and predictable Internet
services.

This white paper explains the program, shows its objectives, highlights
the certification process and gives an example of a sample certified
architecture.

Network World white paper
Making the Storage Connection

The rising tide of data storage has hit a critical point. Learn more
about the latest network storage solutions by reading case studies of
companies that are tackling the issue. Included is a discussion of
whether to outsource your storage, and a glossary of storage networking
terms.

This white paper was produced by Network World in association with
3Ware, Computer Associates, Exabyte, Interphase, St. Bernard Software,
Storage Networks and W. Quinn.

Note: White paper is in PDF format, you=01,ll need Adobe Acrobat Reader to
