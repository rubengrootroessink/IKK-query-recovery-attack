Microsoft
The Business Value of Certified Applications

For a technology to have maximum value, it must deliver core benefits
to IT and to the organization. Simply put, these core benefits must
make life better and the job easier for IT while lowering the
technology's total cost of ownership (TCO) for the company.

The process of Windows 2000 Certification can help meet both of these
demands. This paper looks at the value and procedures involved of
Windows 2000 certification. It explains the process of certification
and also presents case studies of seven different companies who are
seeking or have received Windows 2000 certification.
