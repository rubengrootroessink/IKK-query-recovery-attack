Steve,

It's really Houston part of the group only.
We have to figure out how to close the gap caused by Grant's departure.

Thanks for the invite Shirley, but 9pm is pushing it a bit, especially on a 
Friday night!

Subject: Continuation of Project Meeting

Hello everyone:

Vince would like to continue his "project meeting" that was cut short this
morning.  The area to be discussed is the Researh reorganization.  We
would like to have schedule this meeting for this Friday, January 12th at
3:00 PM in EB19C2.

Please let me know if you have a problem with this.  Osman will be in
California, but he will join you via conference call.

Thanks!

Shirley

Osman:  The number for the conference room EB19C2 is:  713/853-6336.
