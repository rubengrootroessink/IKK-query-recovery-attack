Steve,

The schedule is fine with me. One consideration is that in 2 cases
it would require two, as opposed to one, round trips. Please, talk to  Dale 
about it and make sure that it is fine with Richard and the RAC  group (they 
will have to pay for it).

Richard has agreed to pay for Matt's visit, so here's the schedule so far:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
      (No crossover with Matt, ensures power cover in London office.)
Matt  A couple of weeks in August. (Preferably the hottest ones.)
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.

Vince, Dale

Here are our proposals for Houston visits from our group:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.
Matt  Not a permanent Research Group member.  I'm asking Richard's group to 
pay for his visit, probably in August.

Steve
