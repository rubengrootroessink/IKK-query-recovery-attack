Vince,

I have added a lot of material to "fill in the wholes" and would like your
reaction to the current draft.  I am still not very happy with the risk
management segment (primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge) so
please read it carefully and get me your comments.

I plan to let Don Chew (the editor) take a look at it to give us his
guidance toward a successful draft.

Hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year.

Your friend

john

p.s. I really enjoyed your papers.  those should definitely be part of a
class on risk management.
