A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.  NBC

Raymond Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc.,  a 
Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that  
combine advisory and systems development services to &corporations and  
financial institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to  credit and market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or  academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as  a variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure. The  presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity  risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk management.
