NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Filling in forms automatically
03/23/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Filling in forms=20
automatically
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

You've probably started switching to electronic documents (rather than
printed forms) for your users. Perhaps you've created an expense report
template in Excel that has the fields your accounting department is
interested in.

But if you want to really impress the users, how about templates which
automatically populate themselves with user data (names, departments,
etc.)? If you've got NetWare 4.x or 5.x and use Microsoft Office, you
can do that - quickly, easily and (best of all) for free.

Novell Directory Services-Enabled Office is a tool for automating the
task of filling in standard forms with user and departmental data from
your NDS directory. It=01,s based on ActiveX controls and uses Visual
Basic scripts to feed that data into your forms.

To use NDS-Enabled Office, you must create Microsoft Word or Excel
templates that contain Visual Basic script macros that call users=01, NDS
data, such as their names or departments. You can then send your
templates to any employee in the company, and when the employee opens
the template, the document will be filled in automatically with that
employee's NDS information.

The NDS-Enabled Office installation includes sample templates. One is a
Word fax template, and the other is an Excel expense report template.

It saves paper, saves employees' time and it=01,s free. What are you
waiting for?
