This is very interesting!

States won by Gore: 19  
States won by Bush: 29  

Counties won by Gore: 677  
Counties won by Bush: 2,434  

Pop. of counties won by Gore: 127 million  
Pop. of counties won by Bush: 143 million  

Sq miles of country won by Gore: 580,000  
Sq miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000  

Now Professor Joseph Olson of the Hamline University School of Law in St.  
Paul Minnesota has produced another interesting new statistic. ?Professor  
Olson looked up the crime statistics for all of these counties and came up  
with this:  

Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2  
Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1  

Now, what area of this country do you want electing the President of the  
United States, Gore's or Bush's
