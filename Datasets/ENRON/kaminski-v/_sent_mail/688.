John,

I think it's a good idea. Please, go ahead and call
him directly.

Vince,

What do you think about asking Andy Fastow to come to the Texas Finance
Festival this April as our luncheon speaker?  If you agree I'll go ahead
and call him.  If you have an opportunity to speak with him about the
conference that would be great.  The date is April 21st (that's a Saturday).

Hope you are enjoying NY.  Shirley tells me that you're running up your
frequent flyer miles again.

your friend,

john
