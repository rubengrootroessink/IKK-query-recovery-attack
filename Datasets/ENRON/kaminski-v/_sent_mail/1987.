Darren,

Glad to hear from you !   I heard that you moved to Japan, hope everything 
goes well for you.

The catastraphe option was listed in Chicago broad of trade, but the open 
interest was very small. 
Internally, Enron insurance group knows a few insurance companies offer such 
product. The contact
person is Jim Bouillion.

If you are interested to offer such bond/insurance in Japan,  we can look 
into the pricing and "hedging" (i.e. reinsurance)
issues.  I will discuss this with Vince, Stinson and Vasant. 

Best Regards,

Zimin

Hello Zimin. I hope all is well with you.

 As you may have heard,I moved to Enron Japan about 2 weeks ago in order to 
foster a financial trading presence here, with the intention of utlizing this 
location to better optimize the management of Gary's exisitng portoflios, as 
well as to identify and act on local trading or financial opportunities.

One peripheral, recurring idea has been for Enron to somehow establish a 
market in catastraphe bonds and/or insurance. Earthquakes are perhaps the 
greatest risk that the Japanese people fear according to various polls, a 
natural response to the significant number of earthquakes that occur in the 
area . Such a product  would have tremendous and widespread appeal and from a 
cursary review,  it does not appear that there is a developed,liquid market 
for such products.

I was wondering if you could talk to Vince briefly about his thoughts 
regarding the feasibility of such a product, in terms of hedging where a  
 natural offset is not found. Is this a product that research feels a hedge 
can be made against with a reasonable amount of statisitcal confidence? I 
realise this is vague and if you need any more information, please contact 
me.  


Sincerely,

Darren
