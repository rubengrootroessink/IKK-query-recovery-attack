John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince
