Molly,

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here. 

Vince

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,
Sandeep.
