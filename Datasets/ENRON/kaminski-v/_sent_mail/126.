==========On The McKinsey Quarterly Web site this month==========

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.

Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.

The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.
