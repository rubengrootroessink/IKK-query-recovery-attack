Executive Summary:

AB18X is the focal legislative point for the proposed bailout plan, but=20
contains several problems.
Per yesterday's morning report, the bill includes a plan in which the=20
utilities would issue stock warrants in exchange for financial assistance=
=20
from the state.
The bill will be subject to attacks from consumer groups, which will slow i=
ts=20
passage. Timing is crucial because of the February 7th deadline for the FER=
C=20
emergency order and the February 13th deadline for debt forbearance.
The bill also contains little detail about costs.  The cost of the bailout=
=20
cannot be determined until the final auction results are known and the=20
utilities reach a deal with Davis with respect to the share of outstanding=
=20
debt that must be paid by the parent companies of the utilities.
Sources report that Davis will insist  that at least 43 percent of the=20
outstanding PG&E/SoCal debt should be absorbed by the parent corporations.

1. AB18X- The "Bailout" Bill

There are a number of key problems with AB18X.=20

The bill is being presented by its drafters as a "work in progress." The=20
current bill is likely to be significantly different next week after consum=
er=20
groups blast it in committee hearings and in the press.  Also, the fiscal=
=20
effect of the bill is listed as "unknown", because the costs of the long-te=
rm=20
contracts being bid upon in the auction are not yet known.  Moreover, the=
=20
audit of the utilities and its recommendation for the share of utility debt=
=20
to be paid by the state versus the parent companies is not yet finalized (s=
ee=20
below).

The industrial users are unhappy with this bill because they will bear the=
=20
burden of the costs.  Approximately 35% of power customers in CA are=20
residential, and another approximately 10% are commercial or users with=20
emergency status; this means that half or more of all power customers in CA=
=20
will benefit from price controls on their power.  This, in turn, leaves the=
=20
large industrial customers footing the bill.  They are saying that this may=
=20
result in job losses and may even give them incentive to leave the state.

The State of California is talking about issuing revenue bonds to pay off t=
he=20
utilities=01, debt.  There is an important but subtle difference between th=
ese=20
and general obligation bonds, which draw from tax revenues and assets to pa=
y=20
debt.  Revenue bonds draw from the revenue gained from actually using=20
something.  For example, a stadium developer might issue revenue bonds to p=
ay=20
for a new stadium, then make revenue from the team that uses the stadium. =
=20
How will that work in the case of the utilities?  There is no guarantee tha=
t=20
there will be positive revenue to pay back the bonds.=20

California=01,s interruptible power contracts have a 100-hour/year limit.  =
Most=20
of those contracts are at or near that limit and will become firm power=20
contracts.  This removes another option for finding power.

2. The Audit:

Many of the details in AB18X are subject to the results of the audit and th=
e=20
power auction.  Governor Davis has commissioned a study which shows that 43=
=20
percent of the PG&E and SoCal Edison debt is owed to their parent companies=
. =20
He views this as the minimum acceptable percentage that the parent companie=
s=20
should contribute to a bailout.

The companies cannot simply eat the cost of their inter-company debt.  They=
=20
do not have the cash to do so.  The question becomes, if the subsidiaries=
=01,=20
bills are not paid, will they be forced to go into bankruptcy?

3. The Auction:

As told by us to some of you yesterday afternoon and as reported by the Wal=
l=20
Street Journal this morning, the low bids that have been announced from=20
Wednesday=01,s auction are based on off-peak power.  This is why they are s=
o=20
low.  It is estimated that if Davis were to include off-peak power, the bid=
s=20
would be closer to 9.5 cents per kilowatt hour. =20

Governor Davis is not disclosing the "true bid price" because to do so woul=
d=20
not be "in the public interest."  While they legally can keep the auction=
=20
terms secret, this makes an excellent bluff to try to get other power=20
providers to bid lower for peak power.

Since the real cost of power is higher than the auction price is making it=
=20
appear, this means that there may actually be little or no margin between=
=20
where the state buys power and where the utilities sell it.  No margin woul=
d=20
mean no funds to pay down utility debt.

4. The Rest of the West

The federal order for other states to supply CA with power requires Oregon=
=20
and Washington to draw down their own reservoirs.  The people of OR and WA=
=20
are understandably upset about this.  It is not clear how much longer this=
=20
can continue, as reservoir levels continue to drop.

The problem is the drought impacting the entire Northwest is not getting an=
y=20
better even as Washington and Oregon hydroelectric plants dump water throug=
h=20
their dams to keep the lights on this winter. Officials in these states are=
=20
now bracing for electricity surcharges that could hit 50% by mid-summer and=
=20
increase the casualties on the dot-com laden killing field.  Cities from=20
Seattle to Tacoma and beyond are already passing legislation that scales in=
=20
electricity surcharges that high and more. Seattle raised prices by 10% the=
=20
first of January, with a further, emergency 18% increase is set to pass the=
=20
city council on Monday. And city political officials warn that another 25%=
=20
increase would be in effect by mid-summer -- unless the federal government=
=20
agrees to plans by the western governors to request an emergency price cap=
=20
for the summer.

Although the Clinton administration and Bush administration steadfastly=20
refused to impose such a price cap when Governor Davis requested it many=20
times in the last month, western governors told our sources that they hope=
=20
the political and economic considerations will change by late spring.=20
"Although FERC head Hebert is a free-market freak," one government official=
=20
told our sources, "this is very different than the price cap request=20
California made. First, you could legitimately say California's problems st=
em=20
from their screwed up de-regulation plan. But the west's problems this summ=
er=20
stem from a drought, and that is significantly different. Second, the Bush=
=20
administration may want to punish Davis with thoughts of 2004 presidential=
=20
politics in their head, but that will not apply to all of us across the=20
Northwest and Southwest. We have a lot of Republicans on the hook here.=20
Third, even if you think damage to the US economy from California's trouble=
s=20
won't be that great, the damage of 50% energy surcharges rolling across the=
=20
entire western United States from Arizona to Washington has to get Bush's -=
-=20
or at least Cheney's -- attention."

There is almost no snowpack in most of the northwest, according to these=20
officials, so the usual rebuilding of water reserves necessary to generate=
=20
electricity will not occur. Add to that the fact Northwest dams are being r=
un=20
harder than usual to keep up with the maxed-out energy demands across the=
=20
west ,and you have the makings of a mid-summer economic disaster. "The=20
reservoir behind Grand Coulee dam (the country's largest) is dropping at a=
=20
foot a day since New Year's and there is no sign of that slowing," one=20
official told our sources.
