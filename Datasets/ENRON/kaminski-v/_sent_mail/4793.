If either of you have a soft copy of the paper we would appreciate it.  We 
will do the work but will definately give credit where it is due and also 
where it has the most impact (from you guys).

thanks

Subject: Credit Trading White Paper

Dear Vasant,

I am currently working with Bryan Seyfried and the Credit Markets/Trading 
group in London, and am in the process of designing and building a website as 
an information portal.

I am in possession of a paper that you co-authored entitled "Actively 
Managing Credit Risk", which was published in Risk Publications.

Bryan has asked Bijoya (who is interning here during her X-mas holiday from 
the LSE) to update this paper and generate a new White Paper about the 
current state of the credit market and the developments we are pursuing and 
creating. This will be used on our website and be published later in time. 

Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya 
to draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give 
a better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in 
London again next week. 

I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the 
next few weeks.

Please contact me at any time!

Regards from London

Katja
