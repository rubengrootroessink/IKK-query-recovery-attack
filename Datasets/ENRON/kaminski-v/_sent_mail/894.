Steve,

I was delayed on my wait out. I probably hit the stop at
6:15.

Let me buy you a coffee this afternoon. What about 2:00?

Vince,

I was at the bus-stop from 5:50 to 6:10 ish, assumed you had been delayed and 
jumped on the next Research Forest bus that came along.

I hope you didn't wait around for me?

regards

Steve

Steve,


Please, let  me know when you come back.

I have detected a tendency to implement different

approaches to valuation in the past.


To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal

rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques

which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the

originators to control the outcomes.


Vince

Vince,


I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.


I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK

traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while

here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.


We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation

piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA

portcalc.


I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"

syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that

without you guidance.


I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these

systems.
