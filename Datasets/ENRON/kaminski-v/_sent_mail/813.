Hi Jason,
Here's the file.

Hi Jason,
I've attached an excel file with both sets of prices.  However, the HA Zone 
Price data set appears to be incomplete.  I'm currently looking to complete 
this set and will get back to you shortly on it's progress.  If you prefer 
the data in a different format please let me know.
Thanks,
Maria V.H.

Maria,

Is it possible to get both sets of prices?
We will need to go back as far as we can.

Thanks.

Jason,

Are you looking for CalPX hour ahead UMCP or CalPX hour ahead zone prices?  
We have hour ahead zone price data from 10/1/98 - current and hour ahead UMCP 
from 11/6/2000 onward.

Maria,

I am looking for historical hourly real-time (spot) power prices for CalPX.
Can you help me to locate them?
