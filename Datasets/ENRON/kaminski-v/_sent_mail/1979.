Maureen,

We are currently in the RAC process for Dragon, and I understand RAC has 
requested updated curves.  We are currently using the following country 
curves you provided previously:

1)  Philippines:  90700

2)  Thailand:  51500

3)  Korea:  62300

4)  China:  50900

5)  Taiwan:  20800

6)  US:   81700

I agree in principal with the methodology and understand the approach, given 
the info you have.  However, you have just provided a new curve for Thailand, 
which, was just provided to us in May.  Given the methodolgy you explained 
earlier, I find it hard to believe we would see such a huge impact (35% 
decrease on a 25 year PV basis) on our COCO valuation (Thai project).  

It appears that this Thai curve is not using PPP, and I'm not saying your 
analysis has to be PPP, but most would expect that given the varying economic 
environments and market places we deal with, PPP is a widely accepted 
practice/method, as we cannot predict the future.  Please provide us a 
detailed reconcilation among the two curves and the Country rational in 
coming up with the revised curves from 4 months ago.

Please contact me if you have any questions at 011-852-2588-1234.

Regards,

Ramon
