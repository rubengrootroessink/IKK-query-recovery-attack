Vince,

I have penciled you in for Nov 13th for my class.  Does this work for you?
This is a Monday and I would suggest you come up Monday afternoon, you can
give a brief talk to our department late in the afternoon, and then you can
talk to my Ex MBAs at 6 p.m. for an hour or so.  I'll get you to the hotel
for the evening and we can work on the paper Tuesday morning.  I recommend
this Mon noon through Tue noon arrangement since I will be out of town the
weekend before the 13th.  If this needs reshuffling let me know.  We'll
make it work.

I look forward to talking with you later this week along with Mark Palmer.

John
