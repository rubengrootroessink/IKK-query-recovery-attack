Hi Vince and Ken!

Thanks for the opportunity to meet the Rice ALP students--Great group!!!

Regarding the meeting with Steve Kean,  this week looks tough, but I'm trying 
for a few minutes this afternoon to at least say "hello"--if it happens at 
all, it will be at 3:30 or 5p today.  I'll let you know Immediately when I 
can confirm.  Then, we can schedule something for next week when the students 
can have a more thorough discussion with Steve.

Thanks!!

--Christie.
