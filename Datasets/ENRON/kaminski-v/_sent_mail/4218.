Subject: Keane Proposal - Spiderman

Vince,
Good morning,

Have you had a chance to review Keane's proposal?
What are your thoughts?

I would very much like to speak with you for 5-10 minutes regarding moving 
forward on this project.
I have some ideas that I would like to bounce around with you.

Thank you,
John

PS I'm going to Boston this weekend for a search engine conference.
I will also be meeting with Northern Light in Cambridge.
