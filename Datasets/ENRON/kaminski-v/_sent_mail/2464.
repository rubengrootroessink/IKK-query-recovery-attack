See my storage story that begins on 1. Plus you might find the issue to be
of interest. I will be doing little occasionally fee pieces for the
Transportation &
Storage Report and will be having lunch with them tomorrow so any thoughts
you have on my piece or the report would be appreciated.



Best regards,


JHHerbert
