Rob,

Let me think about a good topic. You may also contact Steve Kean and ask the 
same
question.

Subject: Doctoral studies

Vince,
I'm Regional Mngr Gov't Affairs at NNG in Omaha and begin a doctoral studies 
program this fall at NU. I plan a research emphasis in regulatory politics , 
specific to energy and telecom market convergence and the public interest. 
I'd welcome any advice or suggestions you have regarding other potential 
area's of research, based on your professional experience in the industry.

I appreciate your assistance, I'm in the earliest stages of forming a 
supervisory committee and  curriculum of study.
