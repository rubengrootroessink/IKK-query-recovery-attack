Al, 

Thanks for  the messages. I have come back from Europe last night
and I am in process of going through my mail.

Friday this week would be a good day to meet. I am going back to
Europe on Sunday and shall be gone for a week.

Vince

Vince:  I hope all is well with you.  I look forward to chatting with
you soon.  Maybe we should have an early coffee meeting at the Hyatt
Regency when your schedule permits.  Al Arfsten
