Jason,

I have to break down the file since it exceeds the maximum file size for the
Rice Server.

I'll tell you how many parts you're supposed to receive in my last e-mail.

Thanks for coordinating for the class.

Have a nice day!

Tracy Pan

Tracy,
Break it down into 8000 files of 1 kB, and send each one in a separate
mail.

Just kidding!
Try to send the whole thing.
If one of the servers refuses to accept it, then break it down into several
pieces.
I know for sure that I can take files as large as 2MB.

Jason
