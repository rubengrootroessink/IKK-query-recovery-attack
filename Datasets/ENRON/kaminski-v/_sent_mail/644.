Molly,

Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman,
Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.

I talked to him in New York and he is considering
other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think John will like him more than Punit.



Thanks
