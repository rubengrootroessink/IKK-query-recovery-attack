Subject: Volatility Presentation/Discussion



Vince, it was an excellent presentation to get some discussion going among
the practitioners on how to map the volatility process.
I think we will never be able to build a single black box to value
volatility, otherwise markets will cease to exist and we in risk will be out
of business.
However, it will be possible to build a framework to structure volatility
modeling process. Like the general equilibrium modeling approach you
proposed.
Atleast we can agree on the key drivers of supply and demand and the
significant variables of a fundamental model.

I hope we get to have a continuing discussion on this topic.

I would also request if you could please send me a copy of you power point
presentation.

Thanks
