Dear Mr. Kaminski

I am emailing to introduce myself to you as the new producer for the PoweRisk 
conference. I am in the process of developing the draft programme for the 
2000 event, and this is the reason that I am contacting you.

Building on the success of last year's event, which attracted over 230 
delegates from across Europe and the US, PoweRisk 2000 will once again 
feature more than 50 leading power industry experts and academics world-wide. 
There will also be a comprehensive exhibition running alongside, cocktail 
parties,, champagne roundtables, in-depth workshops * and numerous other 
opportunities to catch up with your colleagues.

Throughout the course of my research, I have been speaking with many of the 
people who attended the workshop you led with Prof. Geman and Alexander 
Eydeland last year. The feedback has been extremely favourable and many 
expressed a wish to see you both participating in the main conference this 
year.

I appreciate that you have an incredibly busy schedule, and to this end, I 
wanted to contact you at this early stage with regard to the dates for this 
year's PoweRisk conference and to outline my list of queries to you, prior to 
calling your office tomorrow.  I would very much like to extend an invitation 
to you to deliver an address at this year's main conference. The conference 
will be taking place in Paris, on the 4th and 5th of October (with workshops 
taking place on the 6th)

The workshop topic last year dealt with the latest developments in risk 
management, pricing and trading of electricity derivatives. I would be most 
grateful if you could spare me some time tomorrow on the phone to discuss 
this area with me, and in particular the issues that you are finding most 
relevant to your work with Enron at present.

The need to build a programme which truly reflects the needs of the global 
power trading and risk management industry is clear in such a 
conference-saturated market. To achieve this we formed our Energy Derivatives 
Advisory Board last year for advice on all aspects of programme development 
and speaker acquisition. Chaired by Prof. Helyette Geman, the Board members 
currently include: Ehud. I. Ronn, Mark B. Garman, Dragana Pilipovic, Blake 
Johnson, Les Clewlow, Chris Strickland and Christian Vrolijk. This year we 
are expanding the scope of the Advisory Board and  inviting a number of new 
members*, including Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, Bruce Williamson of Duke 
Energy, Heinz Dieter Waffel of PreussenElektra, Harvey Padewer of Duke 
Energy, Alexander Eydeland of Southern Company Energy Marketing, John Shapiro 
of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Jeff Porter of Koch Industries

* (all confirmed and invited Board Members are past speakers at the ICBI 
PoweRisk event)

This year, I would also like to invite you to join our Energy Derivatives 
Advisory Board. In return for your evaluation of the draft programme and 
suggestions of possible improvements and potential speakers, you would be 
entitled to full branding as an Advisory Board member on the conference 
brochure and all conference documentation, first choice on speaking slots, a 
free pass if not speaking, and further discounted registration for clients or 
colleagues.

I will call your office tomorrow and would be very grateful if you could 
spare me a few moments to discuss the above proposals. I will also email this 
letter to you.

My contact details are as follows:
Tel: +44 171 915 5194
Fax: +44 171 915 5101
Email: rosef@icbi.co.uk

I look forward to speaking to you and very much hope that I will have the 
opportunity of working with you on this year's PoweRisk conference.

Yours sincerely

Rosemary Fitzgerald
Director, PoweRisk 2000
