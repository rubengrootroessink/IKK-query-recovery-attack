Vince:

As discussed , I am forwarding Ruwan's resume to you. Ruwan is very excited 
about meeting with you and elaborating on his qualifications. Please let me 
know a  convenient time for next Friday (4/28/00) when he could visit with 
you (or any other day next week at your convenience).  

I have briefly explained to him the nature of the job at Enron Research 
laying special stress on quantitative, programming and modelling experience. 
Ruwans seems very interested in that kind of work.




Sincerely,

Pushkar Shahi
