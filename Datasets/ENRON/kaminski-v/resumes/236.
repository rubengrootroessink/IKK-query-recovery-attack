Hi Vince.
Look at this guy (picture included).

He is "Lawrence", the guy I spoke to you about last week that you said you 
wanted to see.

He asked me if he can do a phone interview...I think Williams, Ford and 
SDCERA are soliciting him.
If I told him You and ENRON are interested- he would drop the others off the 
map for a chance to interview with you.

I like him too as he follows my instructions as is pleasant to work with 
(most are not).

Do you want to chat with him?

On your command,
Jeff Wesley


ALWAYS HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.
