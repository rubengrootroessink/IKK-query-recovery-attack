Dear Shirley,

Thanks for your letter and invitation. Next week we have a spring break at
UH, so I will be pretty flexible. Is next Tuesday fine? Almost any time. If
not, any other day next week will work for me. Starting March 19 I will
teach again, and it will be harder (but not impossible) to find a good time
for interview with Enron.

  Adam
