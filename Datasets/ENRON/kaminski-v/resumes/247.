Good morning Dmitri:

Your resume was forwarded to the Research Group with Enron by Pavel
Zadorozhny.  They would like to conduct a telephone interview with you
at your convenience sometime within the next two weeks.  It will be a
conference call and will include several of the Research group.

This will determine where you might fit for the summer program.

Please let me know some times that would be convenient for you and the
telephone number that you can be reached at.

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw
