Hi Stinson, I am Juan-Carlos Ferrer, also Ph.D. student working with Gabriel 
Bitran and going to Houston with Amit and Paulo on the 16th. Paulo told me 
that you are interested in some information of us before going to Houston.

Well, I am form Chile, married, and father of two girls (3 and 2). I 
graduated from the Engineering School at the Catholic University of Chile in 
1995 having followed the track in Computer Science during the last 3 years of 
school. Then, late in 1995, I was hired by the Industrial Engineering 
department as a full-time Assistant Professor of Management Science, where I 
was teaching and doing research until June 1997. In August 1997 I came to 
Boston to join the Operations Management group in the Sloan School of 
Management here at MIT. I already finished courses and qualifiers 
requirements of my program, so now I am trying to come up with an interesting 
research topic to develop my Ph.D. thesis.

I have been dealing with some interesting topics during the last months but 
since Enron appears as an opportunity to find a more challenging and 
appealing problem to me I decided to explore it. My intention in going to 
visit Enron is to have a better understanding of the bandwidth business in 
order to define a problem to work with. I would really like to do a thesis 
that involves Internet issues and yield management models, in the line of 
Amit's work.

Any other information or question you need, please feel free to contact me.

Looking forward to meeting you on the 16th.

Juan Carlos Ferrer
