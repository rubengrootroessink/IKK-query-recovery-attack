Darren, thank you for cordinating everything.  
I understand it takes time, this is
only the first week of the year in Japan, and I do not like to
push you much.  Normally, I have long meetings every Thursday.
For other dates, I make best effort to fit the schedule for
your convenience, including early morning or late evening. 
I am looking forward to seeing you sometime soon.

Sincerely,

Yumi Imokawa
