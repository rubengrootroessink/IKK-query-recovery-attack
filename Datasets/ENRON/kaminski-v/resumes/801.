I appreciate your recommendation of Van for a summer internship with Enron.  
I have communicated with Van and let her know that she will have a place on

Christy and Beth,

Van worked with us during the summer and over the winter break.
She did an outstanding job.

I would like to recommend her for another summer internship and
also keep her in mind for the future employment.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Please find attached a copy of my resume.  I have
talked with Christy Young and Beth Miertschin, the
college recruiters for the A&A Program regarding
my interest in an internship at Enron this
summer.  I understand that within the Analyst
Program, there are 4 rotational options; of those,
I would be most interested in one of the "Finance
rotations."  I would be happy to explore one of
the number of groups within this area.  (Please
let me know if this is sufficient or if you will
need me to give more specific indication of which
department I would like to be considered for an
internship.)

I greatly appreciate your consideration regarding
my job opportunities with Enron.  Please let me
know if there is anything else I can do to
facilitate this process.  I look forward to our
meeting again.

Sincerely,
Van Ngo

P.S. Shirley, I have mailed to you my parking
permit.  Please contact me if you had any problems
with it.
