Molly,

This is the list of people we can ask to interview Iris.
I would include one (or possibly more) people from  each group below,
depending on availability.


1. Debbie Brackett or Bill Bradford
2. Ted Murphy, Bjorn Hagelman or David Port
3. Mark Tawney  or Joe Hrgovcic
4. Greg Whalley or Louise Kitchen

I shall send a message to them explaining that we try to identify the best 
fit for a good
candidate.

Iris would like to come on Thursday, 12/28/2000, to visit with you and your 
group.  She will be in New Orleans, and will just fly in for the day.
