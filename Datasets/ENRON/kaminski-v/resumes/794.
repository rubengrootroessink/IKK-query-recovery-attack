Hi Dr. Gibner, I just called you but you were not there. As you might 
remember, I am working with Samer and you was the one who interviewed me for 
this position. Samer and I now keep our eyes open for the other job 
possibilities. I would like to know if there is a position available in Enron 
Research group that I might fit in ? My updated resume and transcript are 
attached in Hector's e-mail. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Stinson, 

Here's my friend's information. He is looking for other opportunities within 
Enron. I think he would be a good candidate for
the Research Group. His extension at Azurix is 6-9654.
