Hi Jeff,

 Re. Howard Haughton

 Further to your recent communications with Vince Kaminski with regards to
 the above candidate we would like to see him for an interview at our London
 offices. Could you please advise me of a convenient time for Howard or
 details on how to contact him to arrange this. He will be seeing four
 people for approximately 45 minutes each. We would like to do this
 preferably on Wednesday or Thursday of this week as some of Vince's team
 will be in London on those days.

 Please contact me if you have any queries on 0044 20 7783 5677 or via
 e-mail.

 Look forward to hearing from you

 With regards
 Rachel Quirke
 Human Resources
