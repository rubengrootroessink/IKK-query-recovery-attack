Darren,

Tanya and I had a telephone interview for Yumi.    I do not know what
kind of position you would offer her.

If you intended to let her do the work on quantitative modeling, her knowledge
in math seems very sallow.  She is working on a math degree on stochastic
process, but she can not explain what Ito' lemma is.  We also asked questions
about volatility of a basket, value at risk, etc. she did not have a clear 
answer.

If you intended to let her to be a junior trader, she might be ok. It seems 
she has
some experience of financial market, but I think you are much more qualified 
to
probe her than I do in this aspect.

Keep in touch,

Best Regards

Zimin

Darren, thank you for cordinating everything.  
I understand it takes time, this is
only the first week of the year in Japan, and I do not like to
push you much.  Normally, I have long meetings every Thursday.
For other dates, I make best effort to fit the schedule for
your convenience, including early morning or late evening. 
I am looking forward to seeing you sometime soon.

Sincerely,

Yumi Imokawa
