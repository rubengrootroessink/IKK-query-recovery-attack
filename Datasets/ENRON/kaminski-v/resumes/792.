Hi, Vince

I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to interview for a
position with your group.  I find the work described very interesting and
the work environment very appealing.

I think the retail area would be a good match with my skills and
interests, and I could make a contribution very quickly.  I believe that
the Power and Options Valuation areas would make a good fit as well, if
that matches your needs.

Thanks again,

Bob Lee
