Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  I seemed to have lost contact with you.  The last contact
was with a Ms. Graham - regarding my coming to Houston for an interview -
while I was still living in London.

     I am now back in the states - where I spent the last few months working
for a dot.com.  Although this internet opportunity was interesting, it was
not a viable one.  I guess part of the technology firm shake out.

     Therefore I am now interviewing again - with investment banks and
insurance companies.  Is Enron still interested in having me come down for
an interview?  If so, please let me know how to proceed.

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Iris Mack
