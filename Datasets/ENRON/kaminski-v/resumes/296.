Martin:

Lance will be out of town on the 6th of December and he suggested that
you interview Jingming (Marshall) in his place (it is a telephone=20
interview). =20

Can you do that?

Thanks!

Ms. Crenshaw,

 Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between
the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the
two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific
time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most
of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end,
please let me know.

 Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues.

Jingming
