??? Dear Vince:
?
??? I have put together a list of  finance working papers (some of which I 
brought to the interview last wednesday)  which I have written since 1995 
mostly in support of my work but also (at least  initially) as a learning 
tool. Several of them, however,?do contain  innovations.
??? 
??? I have asked Ms. De Claris to  forward a copy to you.
?
??? As I expressed to you earlier I  am particularly interested in Enron 
Credit Swaps trading platform and the  business opportunities that it will 
spawn.
?
??? I also think that there are  tremendous opportunities to be explored in 
the secondary mortgage maket in the  US. I do not know if Enron has 
considered or is active in this market. This  would be an area that I am also 
very interested and in which I think much better  can be done than most of 
the players in the street.
?
??? The question in my mind  (hopefully not prematurely)?is: If there is 
interest here would Enron  consider letting me put together this business?
?
??? I look forward to hearing from  you soon.
?
??? Best regards
?
??? Joao
