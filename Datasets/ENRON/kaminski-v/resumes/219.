Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I am very sorry to tell you that I have to cancel my interview with you
scheduled on Feb 9th. I had a job offer from Citadel Investment at Chicago
with a deadline on Feb 5th. I have been trying to get an extension for the
past week and unfortunately it failed today. With this very short time
frame, it is impossible for me and Enron's interviewing process to meet the
Feb 5th deadline. How unwillingly, I would not be able to visit Enron for
after taking Citadel's offer. I hope you will find another candidate from
our class. There are some people still available. I will be happy to help
you get in touch with those interested.

Please keep in touch and I wish you well in your business!

Frank Qian
