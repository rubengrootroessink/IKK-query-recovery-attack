Charlie Weldon is a candidate who was a summer associate last year.   I have 
made the one and only exception for him on the starting date.  He works with 
Mike Roberts and they had prearranged for him to work on a special project 
during hurricane season.  Unfortunately, the project can't be delayed due to 
the timing of hurricane season.  He will start in June to work on this 
project.  It is not a project that a summer associate could work on so it is 
not taking a job from one of them.

Mike totally understands the rationale for the starting date, etc. and has 
promised in blood that Charlie will start the orientation with his class and 
will not be pulled out to work on any projects during the 4 week 
orientation.  He is also someone that they would take into their group after 
orientation.  

Mike is drafting a letter that he will sign in blood indicating his promise 
re orientation.  Please keep an eye out for this individual when we send out 
the material regarding starting dates, etc.

We need to also make sure Charlie understands that he must attend the entire 
orientation.

Mike also promises to sing our praises about how great we are (smile-this is 
my addition Mike did not say that, but I am sure he will do it)

Thanks
