Dear Vince,

I am writing to bring to your attention a GSIA student, John Gordon, who is
currently being considered for Enron's Associates program.  My understanding
is that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as a
late addition to the program.

While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an ideal
candidate if you are willing to make an exception.  He is a terrific finance
student with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. Since
John has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additional
background reading about finance and energy.  John is personable and
outgoing.  Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would have
already cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues at
play here.

I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.  A copy of
his resume is attached to this email.

Best regards,
Duane
