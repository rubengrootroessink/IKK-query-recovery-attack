Dear Ms. Crenshaw:

I recently accepted a quant position with Texaco in Houston.  Lara Berry
from Enron contacted me just after that, and I told her of the situation.
I agreed to send her my resume (which I did) and keep in touch.

Enron is a fabulous corporation with exciting opportunities.  Mr. Kaminski
is very well known in the energy field, and I have read some of his
material.  I am extremely pleased that you all would be interested in me;
however, I have given my word to Texaco.

The Texaco position offers a lot of opportunity and risk.  This is the kind
of challenge for which I am looking.  If things do not work out, however, I
would definitely contact Enron again and cherish any opportunity for an
interview.

Thank you very much,

Cliff Parsons
