Title: Extending EU Gas Guidelines to Central and Eastern Europe
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2184


Overview: A comprehensive reform of gas legislation in Central and Eastern=
=20
Europe is bringing the region in line with the European Union=01,s Gas=20
Directive. This is true both for the countries expected to enter the Union =
by=20
2004=01)05=01*Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovenia--and f=
or=20
candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the=20
decade--Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. In CERA=01,s vi=
ew=20
current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for t=
he=20
internal gas market in Eastern and Central Europe look promising from an=20
investor=01,s point of view.

The candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the=20
implementation of the EU Gas Directive during a two-day workshop held by th=
e=20
European Commission and the World Bank in Paris in November.

Many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries=20
throughout the 1990s as part of their transition to a market economy. The=
=20
results have been mixed, particularly in the utility industries. The 1998 G=
as=20
Directive (adopted in August 2000) now offers a compelling incentive for EU=
=20
candidate countries to transform their gas industries, while providing a ro=
ad=20
map to guide them.

The critical points relevant to harmonization between the European Union an=
d=20
candidate countries include the following:

* Legal framework and regulation. The legal framework is the cornerstone of=
=20
enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in Europe. As a result, in a=
ll=20
candidate countries in 1999=01)2000 energy laws were either updated or newl=
y=20
established along the principles spelled out in the Gas Directive. Regulato=
ry=20
bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country, althoug=
h=20
issues of staffing, financial autonomy, and independence from political=20
influence are not uniformly resolved.

* Third-party access (TPA) and long-term take-or-pay contracts. All candida=
te=20
countries agree that TPA is a key to market competition. Therefore, all hav=
e=20
adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation. Although the=20
Commission favors regulated TPA, the specific approaches to TPA enforcement=
=20
in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases. In particular, the=
=20
implementation of TPA will have to address the issue of long-term take-or-p=
ay=20
contracts with Russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies=
=20
and somewhat preempt competition. Russian gas is for the most part sold to=
=20
single, traditional state-owned operators that dominate their internal=20
markets. A balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant=
=20
players and the competitive environment. This is made more complicated by=
=20
their ownership of large volumes of Russian gas supplied in kind in exchang=
e=20
for transit rights to West European customers. Article 25 of the directive=
=20
provides for !
a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take-or-p=
ay=20
obligations. This derogation would apply to the companies of candidate=20
countries with historical and commercial links with the Russian gas industr=
y.=20
Furthermore, article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only=
=20
one major gas supplier, to those with an =01+=01+emerging &#91;gas&#93; mar=
ket=20
status,=01,=01, or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of =
another=20
member state. Most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to=
=20
call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the=20
European Union.

* Price cross-subsidies. Residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a=
re=20
financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers. In=
=20
various countries, tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have=
=20
been scheduled, but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce.=
=20
This has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o=
f=20
imported gas to oil prices. All candidate countries have set legal framewor=
ks=20
that include the phasing out of cross-subsidies as part of sector reform, b=
ut=20
the actual implementation will remain politically difficult. As Table 1=20
indicates, price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte=
d=20
to enter the European Union by mid-decade, but the legal framework itself=
=20
cannot guarantee the pace of reform. The same goes for candidate countries=
=20
that have only recently introduced EU-complying energy laws and whose entry=
=20
to the European Union is likely to happen in a longer time frame.

* Unbundling. Most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission=
=20
companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of=20
liberalization. To date, unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is=
=20
all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie=
s.=20
In the future, the Commission is likely to press all EU countries for legal=
=20
separation (=01&structural unbundling=018) of the businesses, and candidate=
=20
countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly.

Table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries. As t=
he=20
table shows, the countries belonging to the second group have only very=20
recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the=20
Directive, whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries=20
scheduled for the first wave.
