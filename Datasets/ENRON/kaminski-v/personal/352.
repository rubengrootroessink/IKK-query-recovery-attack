Field 9 = I  have just sent you another message. I have inspected the bill
summary for the last and current months, and it seems that my payment plan
has been changed by you without my authorization. Last year I was on a flat
annual payment plan (about $220 per year), paid in one installment. I did not
agree to switch to any other plan, unless you asked me a question regarding
the billing in a vague or deceptive way. I hope that you will look into this
matter promptly and refund any excessive charges.
