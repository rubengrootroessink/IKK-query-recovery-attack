My article "The Gas-Fired Future: Boom or Bust?
Last year brought prices not seen for decades. So consumers will buy less
gas, just as before, and send forecasts out the window." was just published
in April 1, 2001 issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly.

If you would like to receive a reprint when I receive them send me your
address.


Best regards,


JHHerbert
