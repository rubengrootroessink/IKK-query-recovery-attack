Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

    I am very glad to see Professor Kaminski let me meet with him. I offer to
visit you around 3 p.m. on 17th Monday. I wonder if we can invite him for a
dinner that night because my colleague Mr. Yamada who also wishes to meet
with him will attend a Risk publication's seminar up to 5 p.m. on that day.
Please let Professor Kaminski  know we understand this offer may affect on
his private time and we do not insist on it. I am very much looking forward
to seeing him.


Best regards,
