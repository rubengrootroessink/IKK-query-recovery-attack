Vince, 

I have? left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. 
My brother? Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from 
consulting world to? working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I 
have heard of great deal? about the success of Enron on line business which 
fits well in the area of his? expertise. I am wondering if you know of some 
one in London who he can speak to? regarding career opportunities. 

Since? I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my 
manadate was? broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk 
management function? for both the domestic and international businesses for 
GMAC. Needless to say,? this is exciting albeit making the life a little 
more hectic than? usual. 

Talk? to you later. 

Anurag
