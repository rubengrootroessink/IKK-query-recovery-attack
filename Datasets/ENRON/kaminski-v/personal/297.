Dear Friends and Family,

On April 15 and 16 I will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on 
the MS 150 which is a two day bike tour from Houston to Austin covering 182 
miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.  
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable.  Symptoms may be 
mild such as numbness in the limbs, or severe paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the 
unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong  

My wife, Ilene was diagnosed with MS almost three years ago; at first I was 
at a loss of how I could support her.  That was until I heard of the MS 150, 
which is one of the greatest challenges of my life.  It is my choice to 
participate in the MS 150, Ilene does not have a choice, as she has to live 
with MS every day. 

This will be my third year riding in the MS 150 raising money for the 
National MS Society to fight multiple sclerosis. In 1998 my goal was simple. 
It was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own. I succeeded in my 
endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $6,000.  In 1999 
I raised my goal to $10,000 and finished the tour.  Not only did I meet my 
goal, but surpassed it by raising $15,000 to fight this devastating disease 
with the help of my friends and family.  This year my goal is even greater!  
My wife and I are once again asking for your help.  This year on the 2000 MS 
150 bike tour, my goal is to raise $20,000.

Enron is a big supporter of the MS 150.  For the past two years we were the 
largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally.  
Last year we raised $310,000 with 300 riders.  Enron will match dollar for 
dollar on all contributions donated in my name.  Using this secure, fast and 
easy web page you can make a tax-deductible donation (if clicking on the link

I appreciate your continued support of the MS Society and the Isuzu MS 150 
Bike Tour.  The funds raised on the Isuzu MS 150 Bike Tour provides 
equipment, financial assistance, self-help groups, counseling, information 
and resources, as well as education for people with MS and their families. 
Your support truly makes a difference in the lives of people with Multiple 
Sclerosis.
