George-

Here is one statistical method (linear regression), applied to Hosanna's fund 
giving. The method is deterministic, where contributions each Sunday are 
attempted to be explained by significant events on the church's and members' 
calendars, and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal 
one, where each Sunday's giving might be estimated to be the average giving 
of the same Sunday (e.g., each 2nd Sunday in January) in the past.

The following effects are estimated independently by the computer (they add 
and subtract with each other accordingly; some Sundays can have more than one 
effect "in play"):

1) most positive for giving: an additional +$8,802 for special pastoral 
appeals (3 of them in the past 3 years)

2) positive for giving: an additional +$2,551 Easter and nearest- Christmas 
"Sunday," an additional +$59 Thanksgiving Sunday, and a tiny additional +$1 
each week pure time trend.

3) negative for giving: -$304 for Sundays of Monday Federal Holiday weekends, 
and -$9 during the Summer (June 1-Aug 31)

4) "wave": there  is an $80 per week "wave"- giving $80 higher one week, $80 
lower the next, etc ...

The computer can explain roughly 60% of the absolute variation in giving the 
past 3 years using this approach. Keep in mind, much of the information, 
statistically, is captured in the pastoral appeals, Easter and Christmas 
Sundays, and Holiday weekends. The rest of the variation cannot be explained 
by this simple model (i.e., it looks like "noise").

Here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year. You can 
cut-and-paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet  you like. They may 
seem "boring" to you; please remember they are the deterministic components 
of a process that involves a lot of volatility, and your church's actual 
experience will predictably be volatile. These numbers are as-if the "means" 
of  experiences dependent on the "standard deviations."
