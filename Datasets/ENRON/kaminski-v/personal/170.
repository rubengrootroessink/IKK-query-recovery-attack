Hi,

Just like to say that it has been great meeting and working with you all.  I 
will be leaving Enron effective July 5th  to do investment banking in Hong 
Kong.   I will initially be based in New York and will be moving to Hong Kong 
after a few months.  Do contact me when you are in the vicinity.  I don't 
know my contact details yet and would let you know once I get it.   In the 
meantime, I will always be checking my e-mail at royibasco@yahoo.com.  Please 
let me know what your e-mail addresses are and keep in touch!

Best regards,

Roy
