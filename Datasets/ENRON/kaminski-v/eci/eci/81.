scott,
we are definitely going to do the network engineering / research
off-site in breckenridge the weekend of april 21-22-23 (fri, sat, sun).
there will be 25-30 people.  we will plan on meeting and lodging
facilities in town.  let us know if you want to arrange a social event
or activity at your place for the group.  my assistant, sheryl lara,
will be coordinating with you.  she will also be publishing agenda and
attendee invites as soon as we finalize these next week.
