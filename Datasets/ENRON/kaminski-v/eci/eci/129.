Sounds great.

There is another MIT student, Juan-Carlos, who I would like to have accompany 
Amit on the 16th.  I'll speak to him to clear the date.

All the best.

		 Subject: Amit's visit

Amit planning to spend the day of February 16th at Enron in order to give an 
update on his bandwidth pricing research.    We will also try to spend some 
time in more of a round-table discussion designed pick his brain on any other 
related issues on which he may be able to help us.   I am corresponding with 
Amit to set up a more detailed agenda.    Please let me know if there are 
conflicts which should lead us to choose a different date.

Regards,
--Stinson
