April 13, 14 is better for me as well. I'll toss these dates to John 
Griebling's people.

Ravi.

Ravi:

I previously told you that the weekend of March 31st would be allright for
this, however, I just found out that Krishna has planned a Research party
at his house (it is for all of Research on Saturday, April 1 and Vince told 
him it would be allright - it is his daughter's birthday).  It looks now like 
Vince
and his reports will be unable to do this until the weekend of the 13 and 
14th 
of April.

Please advise.

Shirley

Hi Shirley, please give me a few dates form end of march to first week in 
April to do an offsite for Vince's direct reports (including myself) and 
selected EBS research people. This includes, Vince direct report from our 
research group and the following people from EBS Research:

Ravi, Stinson, Samer, Chinowee.

The agenda will include: Research people giving several mini presentations on 
Trading, market development (history of Nat gas, Electricity, etc.), pricing, 
etc...

John's people will do similar mini presentations on Optical Network 
engineering, optical components, provisioning, telecom markets, pricing, 
etc.... 
If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational 
speech on the vision of EBS, etc..

It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to 
know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at 
the additions case-by-case.

John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please 
follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John 
has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with 
Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.

We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole 
weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel 
(family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we 
have a chance to talk to John & Scott.

I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.  

Thanks,

Ravi.
