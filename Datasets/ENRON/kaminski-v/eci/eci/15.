Paul,

Is there anything I can do to help get the $100K that Enron promised to Dr. 
Bambos?

Hi Stinson,

I am under pressure from the Department to wrap up Giuseppe's RAship,
and I am probing to see how things are going on this matter on your
side. I'm deep in the red in terms of the deadline - way beyond it!
Would it be possible to wrap this up this week?

Many Thanks,

Nick
