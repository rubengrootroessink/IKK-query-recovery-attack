Hello all:

Bad news!  Most of the really nice restaurants in Breckenridge close on the
22nd of April.  We may have to have all the dinners at the hotel.  Do you 
have 
any other suggestions?

I will check with Scott Yeager's wife again today to see if she perhaps knows 
of another good restaurant that may be open, but the owner of Pierre's told 
me most of them close and open again for the summer season in  May.

Thanks!

Shirley

Ravi:

Can you answer Shirley's question.  Are you planning to have the entire group 
go to dinner, or just senior management?  Please let us know your plan.

Sheryl

Sheryl:

I am going to call Pierre's Restaurant and make reservations for Thursday
night - will everyone on the list be attending or just part?

Thanks!
