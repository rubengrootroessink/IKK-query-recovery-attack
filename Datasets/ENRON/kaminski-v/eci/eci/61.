Thanks.  I will be flying back from Tokyo on that day, so unfortunately I'll 
miss Bambos.  If my schedule changes, I'll let you know.

All the best,

Tom

Vince,

How are you? Hope all is well.

Is there any chance we can schedule my visit to Enron on Friday, May 19,
or Friday, May 26?

By the end of April I was able to attract a top new student to work on the 
project.
The other one for the coming year will be Giuseppe. By spending the summer
at Enron, he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at Stanford to look at these problems.

I must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going.

Talk to you soon,

Nick
