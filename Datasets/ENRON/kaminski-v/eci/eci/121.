Ravi:

Samer and I met this morning with Sara Ledbetter.   She is starting the 
groundwork for setting up a storage book and a streaming book for tracking 
the e-powered products positions.    They are having a meeting on next 
Tuesday to discuss this.  Samer will attend.    This is a good opportunity to 
start compiling the data that we will need for some of John Grieblings 
questions.

p.s.   Sara also asked if we knew anyone who would be interested in managing 
the storage book.  Any suggestions?
