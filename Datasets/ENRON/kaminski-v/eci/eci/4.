Hi Stinson,

Giuseppe, Eric and I, arrive on Thusday night at 10pm. We'll try
to reserve rooms at the DoubleTree Hotel next to the Enron building.
Does Enron get special deals with this hotel? >>>GIUSEPPE, can you
please make the reservations?<<

1) SCHEDULE:

I leave on Friday at 5:25pm from the Houston/HOBBE(?) airport going to
Washington, DC. What time should I leave Enron?

Eric and Giuseppe leave later I think, around 8pm flying back to SFO.

2) MEETINGS

Giuseppe has prepared a 30-45min talk on IP pricing.

If possible, we would like to have a brainstorming session(s) with
your group  to discuss various technical issues, problem formulations
and research directions/results.

Other meetings with EBS and the trading group would be useful too.

 >>>GIUSEPPE, can you please call Stinson and see how we can optimize the
agenda and maximize the value of the visit. I am swamped today...<<<

I look forward to seeing you on Friday.

Talk to you soon!

Nick
