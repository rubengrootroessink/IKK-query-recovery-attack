Hello Mr. Kudin:

Vince Kaminski has asked me to schedule interviews for you with some 
of the Research Group.  However, Tuesday, the 8th is not a good day for 
everyone as we will need approximately 3 hours.

Could you do it Thursday afternoon May 10th?  We could start at 1:00 PM
and be through by 4:00 PM.

The interviewers would be:

Vince Kaminski  Managing Director
Stinson Gibner  Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao Vice President
Tanya Tamarchenko Director
Zimin Lu  Director
Alex Huang  Director

Please let me know if this will work for you.  If so, I will need you to 
forward
me a copy of your resume.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Research Group
