                     E*TRADE Bank licenses SunGard solution
   BancWare to provide interest rate risk management with advanced analytics

SunGard Trading and Risk Systems today announced that E*TRADE  Bank has 
licensed
the BancWare suite of advanced analytical modeling products to manage interest
rate risk on its balance sheet.

E*TRADE  Bank is a $9 billion Internet bank that more than doubled its assets 
in

the  past  year.  It will use the advanced Option Adjusted Value-at-Risk 
(OAV@R)

analytics  of  BancWare  Viewpoint,  a product that will determine interest 
rate

risk  and market value for the Bank?s investment portfolio as well as across 
its

balance sheet.


Dennis  Webb,  senior  vice  president  and  risk manager of E*TRADE Bank, 
said,

?BancWare  offers  the  most  complete  risk  management  solution,  with 
strong

analytics,  excellent  reporting,  and  dynamic interfaces to third-party 
vendor

solutions. We will use the information from BancWare to plan business 
strategies

as   we   manage   risk/return  tradeoffs  from  our  assets,  liabilities,  
and

derivatives.?


Mr.  Webb  added,  BancWare?s emphasis on quality control sets it apart from 
its

competitors.?


E*TRADE  Bank  will also install BancWare Convergence, an integrated 
forecasting

and  interest  rate  risk  management  system,  and  BancWare  Insight,  a  
data

collection,  transformation  and management system with a funds transfer 
pricing

option.


Terence  Faherty,  chief  operating officer of SunGard?s BancWare business 
unit,

said,   ?BancWare  has  long been recognized as a leading provider of 
integrated

risk  and  planning  solutions.  Our  asset/liability  management  and

planning   solution  is  used  by  more  than  200  banks  and  other
