Today's focus: The security double standard
---------------------------------------------
By Jeb Bolding

Security is a top concern for everyone in the application
service provider space. With so many options on the market, it
can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds
of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate
information.

Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives
customers the most comfort, is reasonably cost-effective, and
can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security.

The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to
a security double standard. These customers often expect better
security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they
provide for their local systems.

I find this ironic, considering most security infractions occur
from inside an organization, not outside. Conventional wisdom
places the percentage of breaches at 80% internal, and 20%
external (though I haven't independently verified these
statistics).

Based on that information, I would think customers considering
an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over
one another to locate their systems at an ASP, thus reducing
their exposure to system compromises.

Instead, prospective customers typically hit the ASP with
security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the
ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the
customers themselves. ASP business development staff have to
become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data
transfer and public-key infrastructure for authentication and
encryption, for example, just so they can get in the door with
a potential customer.

Unfortunately, comprehensive security procedures and
technologies are typically very expensive to implement and
require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot
hope to implement and maintain. And I'm not so sure these
technology answers are really solving the problem of security
for ASPs and their customers. Again, 80% of security breaches
come from the inside. In a lot of cases, that means that the
true threat is from people who are already inside the security
demilitarized zones. It seems to me that security technology is
really only part of the answer to the overall security
question.

In my opinion, ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond
the latest security technology and hire security experts from
the Department of Defense, NSA or the CIA who can help
implement security policies and procedures that will be
effective in eliminating the 80% internal breaches.

There are several documented systems, publicly available from
the government, that outline the policies and procedures
necessary to meet certain levels of security. For example,
there is a series of trusted systems books available from
INFOSEC, each named after a color: the Teal Book, the Orange
Book, and the Bright Blue Book, all of which are great
resources for a variety of security topics.

No doubt, there are some commercial enterprises that also
adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the
procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of
critical business information inside and outside corporate
networks. Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging
companies would make a lot of sense.

I don't mean to exclude technology solutions from this
discussion. I believe that there are significant strides being
made to make security technology more usable and affordable.
But I fear that ASPs are setting up service-level agreements
with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security
and intrusion detection, but are really only covering the most
visible problem.
