Hi Andy

I don't recall sending the above attachment.  If so, please pardon my
redundancy.

Attached is some registration details for the upcoming corporate finance
conference here at Rice.  When you get a moment, if you could have someone
on your staff return it that would be great.

Each topic is followed by "panel" discussion.  We have you slated to serve
on the panel dealing with"Equity Dilution from Option Compensation" and
will feature work by David Yermack from NYU.  Stu Gillan from TIAA/CREF
will be serving on the panel with you along with John Blahnik from Delphi
Automotive.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.
