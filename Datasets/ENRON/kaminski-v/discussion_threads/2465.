You are confirmed for the following course:

from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the Internet.

We encourage you to coordinate participation in this workshop with others at
your location by organizing a conference room with Internet and phone access.

No fee will be charged to PJM members; nonmembers will be invoiced $500.00 to

for each connection. Multiple participants may watch on a single connection.

In order to participate in the course, you will need a computer with Internet

International callers must pay for their own long distance charges.

Our course is being produced by Virtual-Workshops.com. A few days from now you
will receive registration confirmation from them. A few days prior to the
course, you will receive log-on and dial up instructions from them as well as
files of the slides which will be used so that you can print them out and take
notes if appropriate.
