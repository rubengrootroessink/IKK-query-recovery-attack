Guys

Please find attached my submission to the conference proceedings, at which I 
gave my recent real options talk.

The volume will be published by the American Institute of Physics in the new 
year, as part of the volume on complex and disordered systems.

(If you don't have a postscript reader I'll need to send you a paper copy.)

Steve
