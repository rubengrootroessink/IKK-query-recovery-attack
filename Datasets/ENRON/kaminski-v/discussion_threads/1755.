Hi Maureen,

Thanks very much for presenting yesterday. Your presentation created much 
interest and as always we look forward to your return to London office for 
another talk.  The viewing statistics on IPTV were excellent and are as 
follows:

Current: 85
Cumulative: 110

I have spoken to the audio visual team regarding the possibility of showing 
your presenting on IPTV in Houston. It will take a couple of days to encode 
the videotape, but as soon as this done, I will send a copy to you in 
Houston. They are also looking send the file to the relevant person in 
Houston so they can put in on IPTV. 

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to call me.

Kind regards and thanks again
