Christie,

I wanted to update you on my schedule for December as you are working to
arrange some time for Vince and I to visit with the Enron leadership group.
 We had talked about the first week in December and that is good for me
through Wednesday Dec 6th.  I will be at a conference at Harvard on the 7th
and 8th.  However, the next couple of weeks are also possibilities if we
can squeeze in some time.

Thanks

John
