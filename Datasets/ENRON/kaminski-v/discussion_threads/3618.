Kevin

My wife checked with our bank - it will take up to 10 days for the $2000 
check to clear.

I checked with Enterprise (the car hire people) last night and the total bill 
will be about $1251  - I don't have this much left on my credit card, help!

I am really sorry about the hassle this is causing you, but I need some way 
for Enron to pay directly for the car, that way I won't need the $2000 check.

Many thanks for your help


Tony
