Mike, 
Here is third version of the program. It gives better results than the 
previous versions you have. Sorry for the delay, these past 2 days I have 
been busy meeting with people on the new EBS project. I think the result 
looks reasonably good. You can try it. (To run, type cow filename.jpg m)

You can show it to the others by yourself or I can go with you. I will have 
to go to German Consulate tomorrow morning and will be in the office around 
10:30-11am.
