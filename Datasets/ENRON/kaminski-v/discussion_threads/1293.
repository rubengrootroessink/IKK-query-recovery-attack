Christie,

Thanks for helping out.  Attached is a one page "intro" to the project that
Vince and I are undertaking.  Please let me know how you would like it
"transformed" before passing it along to the leadership at Enron.

You have the basic story--Enron's leadership purposefully and very
successfully transformed the company.  We plan to document in broad strokes
the "plan" as it was set out, and trace its evolution through the history
of Enron's history.  The final result will be a 20-40 page paper written in
the style of a Harvard Business Review piece.

Please let me know what else you may need.  I'll put it together for you.

Thanks again,

John
