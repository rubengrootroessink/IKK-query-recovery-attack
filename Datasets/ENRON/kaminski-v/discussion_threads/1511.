Hello Kenneth:

Nice talking to you this morning!  Below is your interview schedule for
Monday, Oct. 30th and directions to the Enron Bldg..  Please let me know 
if you need any travel arrangements made.

Coming from the northwest part of Houston, your best bet would be to 
take I-45 into town.  There is quite a bit of construction downtown, so you 
will probably have to take the McKinney exit from I-45 (you will need to 
stay in the left lane as you approach town.  Exit McKinney to Smith Street, 
take a right on Smith Street go to Andrews Street, take a right on Andrews 
(the Enron bldg. is on the left), pass the Enron Bldg. cross "Ruthvan" (1st 
stop sign) and pull into the Allen Center Parking garage (Visitors area on 
your right).  Come to the security desk on the 1st floor of the Enron Bldg. 
and ask for me.  They will call me and I will meet you in the elevator lobby 
on the 19th floor. 

Monday, October 30th

9:00 AM  Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research
9:30 AM  Zimin Lu, Director
10:00 AM Vasant, Vice President
10:30 AM Krishna Krishnarao, Director
11:00 AM Paulo Issler, Manager
11:30 AM Stinson Gibner (He will take you to lunch)
1:00 PM  Molly McGee (HR Recruiter)

Have a safe trip.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
