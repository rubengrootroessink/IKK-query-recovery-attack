Dear All,
?
Would like to set a conference call to discuss  content for the panel 
discussion at Risk 2000 in Boston on 14 June. Perhaps I  can suggest 
wednesday 31 may at noon EST. I'm on London time and am quite  flexible if 
you would like to do earlier or indeed on another day.
?
The panellists are -
?
Vince Kaminski, Enron Corp
Richard Jefferis, Koch Energy Trading
Steven Bramlet, Aquila
?
The discussion topic is 'effectively applying  weather derivatives'
?
I think we need to establish a series of  questions around which to 
facilitate discussion. We currently don't have a  moderator and perhaps one 
of you could take this role on.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
Thanks, Oliver
