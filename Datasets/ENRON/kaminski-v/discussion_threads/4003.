Durasoft (the company that did the Java class) will be holding a course on 
COM object programming for Enron Networks.  COM allows for programs to be 
written such that they are available for execution to other programs on a 
language independent basis.  Several Research members are interested in this 
technology.

The class is $15,000 for 15 people and NetWorks has a few spaces that are 
unfilled.  We can send a few people, therefore, for about $1000 each.  The 
course is May 14-18 (which conflicts with the EPRM 2001 Conference), so they 
need a total soon.

Is this course something group members can sign up for?

Thanks,
Martin
