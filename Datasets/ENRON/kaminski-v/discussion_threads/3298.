Hi David,

  I understand that you were slightly upset over a comment Kevin Kindall made 
in one of his weekly reports.  The wording was unfortunate, but the intention 
was never to disparage anybody.  It is just that since Research gets data 
from a large number of sources, we feel obligated to the data donor to ask 
any requester for clarification of need.  I completely understand that RAC 
typically has access to much sensitive information and they have a right to 
know much information.  We just want to make sure there is open flow of 
information (it is in everybody's best interests and the company's best 
interests) and that everybody is aware of how data is flowing.  

Best wishes,
 Vasant
