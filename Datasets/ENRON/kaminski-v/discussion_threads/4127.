Christie,

Shirley reserved room 49C1 for Monday 4:00 p.m.  presentation.

Can you  issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner
details? I don't have all the details regarding the Enron Field
box and time. I am out most of the day on Wednesday but we can
discuss the details on Thursday. 

Hope to see you on Saturday at  the concert.


Vince
