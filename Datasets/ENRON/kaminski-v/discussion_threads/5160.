Absolutely - I can't find the previous email but it may have been lost during 
the few days they moved my email box from London to Houston - I know I had a 
lot of lost emails - do you have his phone number and email and we can sort 
out a password for a few days for him too.

Louise, 

Some time ago I sent you a message regarding Ed Krapels. He is writing a book 
on energy
commodity markets and would like to learn more about EOL. 

Can you give him a  call and chat with him for 10 minutes. He is a good 
friend of Enron and
it would be free ad for us.

Vince
