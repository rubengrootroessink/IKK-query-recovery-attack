Vince:

Here is Tanya's and my presentation.  It is a bit long and deliberately a bit 
bombastic. This is deliberate to hammer home the fact that my group provides 
power trading support for 5 continents as well as support for corporate level 
Risk Control.  If I have over done it, please let me know or else feel free 
to make modificaitons.


Grant.
