Subject: 7-1-00 to 7-15-00 Off Duty and Overtime Report

Attached is the off duty and overtime that was reported to me for the above 
pay period.  You are the only ones in our group that had these reported.

Please review and if there is an error, please let me know by next Monday
the 17th and I can correct it.  Otherwise, we cannot correct it until the 
next pay
period.

Thanks!

Shirley
