Molly,

Below are the resumes sent to us by Focus.   Vince suggested that we 
interview one person plus Sriram, who already lives in Houston.   Karim looks 
like the most qualified, but my fear is that we may not be able to afford 
him.   I am assuming that Vince will want to hire at most at the manager 
level.   Can you first check and see if Karim would consider coming at a 
manager level salary before we spend time talking with him.   If he is too 
senior, then we should talk to Samir, who looks like a more junior level 
person.

Thanks,

Stinson

Vince,
See below for my picks based on the resumes.   The others marked as "no" 
might be OK as well, but did not seem to have as much slant towards finance.
