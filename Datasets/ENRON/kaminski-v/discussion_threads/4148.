Dear Vince
?
Further to my telephone conversation earlier today,  I am writing concerning 
the GARP 2001 Virtual Convention. There  are a number of delegates that are 
keen to download your presentation but I have  put them off until now since I 
have been awaiting your 'extended presentation'.  As yet I have not received 
this and I was wondering if I could use your existing  presentation, at least 
until such time as you could send me the extended  one?
?
I have attached a copy of your extended  presentation and unless I hear from 
you by tomorrow I will make this available  to delegates.
?
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  continued interest in GARP 
and look forward to hearing form you in the near  future.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
