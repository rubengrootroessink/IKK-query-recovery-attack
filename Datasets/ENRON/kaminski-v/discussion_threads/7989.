Vince,
 I'm working for Chris Clark, and I was wondering if you can help me to get 
in touch with someone in the research group who had written some of our 
software.  Kevin Golden tells me that he thinks Jason Sokolov was the guy who 
had written an application for us to download emissions data from the EPA web 
site.  Could you confirm this?  If this is correct, is he still in your 
group?  Thanks a great deal.

Sincerely,
John Anderson
