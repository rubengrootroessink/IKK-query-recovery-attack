FYI

- Exotic Library :
 
Issue :  The London version is different from the Houston version.
  The problem is that some bugs in the London version were found.

Temporary solution: Bugs were immediately fixed at a local level.

Permanent Solution:  The London Exotic Version will be replaced by the 
Houston Exotic Version.
   The Houston Version is expected to be robust. 
   Sharad (London Research) is spending this coming week in Houston. 
   When Sharad is back to London, the Houston version will replace the London 
version.

Approach:  Steven Leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that 
will involve IT to fully test the similarity of the two versions.
  The procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement.
  Hopefully, no discrepancies will be found.
  In the adverse case it happens, it will be necessary to conduct an analysis 
to decide what is wrong.
  If necessary  further testing and development has to take place.
