Vince,

Rob and I would like to coordinate a meeting with one of your Research people 
to review the Spread Option calculation from the Exotica options library.  
We're pricing a spread option deal in NYC and have some questions related to 
the formula, greeks, etc.  Please let me know who might be available to sit 
with us for about 1/2 hour.  Thanks

- Jim
