Cindy,

Yes, it's just around the corner and we have our very best program ever.
Our web site is up at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

check it out.  Actually, I was waiting for the final version of the program
from Sheridan to post it before getting in touch with you this week.  We
are planning on a room capacity group of 45-50 folks and are finalizing the
plans for entertainment for Friday and Saturday night on the riverwalk.
Bill is handling the arrangements this year and I'll pass this message on
to him as well.

Do you think we could get an Enron speaker for Saturday's luncheon?  Last
year was fabulous and would be hard to top but we'd like to try.  San
Antonio should be a bit easier on the speaker too.  Let me know what your
thoughts are on everything including the speaker.

Bill and I are leaving town Wed afternoon to go to a Harvard conference so
maybe we could talk before then.

We're getting excited and want to get you guys involved for it is your
personal (and financial) support that makes the conference really work.

John
