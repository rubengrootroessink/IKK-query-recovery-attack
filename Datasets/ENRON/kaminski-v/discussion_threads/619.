Hello Vince :

I'm the Territory Manager for the MathWorks, we develop MATLAB technical
software. We've recently developed tools well suited for Energy Trading
Industry.

Enron has used our products in the past, but all of those end-users have
left Enron.

Risk Management and Research groups at Southern Energy, TXU, Dynegy, El
Paso Energy, Koch, Calpine, Reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways.

1. Create sophisticated option pricing models, risk analysis models, and
stress analysis models. Creating GUI front ends for the end-users.
2. Pull in Data from ODBC, Corba, and SAS databases to evaluate.
3. Visualize the results and quantify the solution.
4. Compile these models and distribute these applications to their
Traders, Analysists and Managers with no distribution costs.

Who should I contact at your company to discuss Enron's situation to see if
our can help Enron as it has with our other Energy customers?


Thank you for your time and help.
