Mr. Kaminski,

I have attached a resume below I thought you might find of interest, it is 
from a Business School acquaintance of mine, Denis Suvorov.  Denis is a 
highly intelligent Ph.D. candidate at my former school and is currently 
looking for opportunities within a research/modelling framework.  He has 
significant academic experience working on Asset pricing models and after 
speaking with Pavel Zadorozhny about his background and objectives, he 
recommended I forward a copy of his credentials to you.

I hope this is suitable and would be of interest to you.  

Thanks,
Matthew Frank
