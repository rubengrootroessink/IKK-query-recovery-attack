Vince and Grant,
?
Can you please send us your excel spreadsheets that were used for generated  
the graphs?? We will need to edit them so that they will look like the  
graphs in the rest of the book.
?
Vince, when you send us your half, will you please provide us with the  
references and footnotes?
?
Grant, thanks for your half.
?
Look forward to hearing from you soon,
Thanks,
Julie
