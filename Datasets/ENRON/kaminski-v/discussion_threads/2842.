 Hey Ding.  If you recall, we looked at Southern Cone during July, as this 
was the feedback that we got from our presentation in late May.  The Cuiaba 
gas and power volumes may be found in several different places since there is 
more than one model.  The models do not necessarily agree with each other.  I 
have attached a few models that should contain the necessary info.  I also 
have a summary sheet template that was to be attached in MAPS.  Enjoy.
