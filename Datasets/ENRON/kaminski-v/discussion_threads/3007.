Hi Kay,

I was referred to you by Julia for assistance.  Here in research, we are in 
the process of retaining Prof. Sheridan Titman of University of Texas at 
Austin to perform some consulting work.  In anticipation, we would like to 
have a non-disclosure agreement to protect the confidentiality of any 
information we might provide him.  Also, we would like have an agreement on 
how the intellctual property rights of any outcome of this effort will be 
shared.

Please let me know what information I can provide from this end to help you 
draft these documents.  My extension is 30936. Thanks.


Rakesh
