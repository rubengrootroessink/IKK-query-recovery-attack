Vince,

My apologies for writing to you after such a long gap. I wanted to thank you 
for the book you sent, as well as al the help that is been rendered by 
Krishna towards our efforts here

Our efforts here are becoming more intense and I will continue to need your 
group help as we proceed along the way.
Separately I have not yet forgotten about the training we had spoken about. 
However, give the intensity of our current effort we may need to hold on to 
that for some months. In the meantime we will continue to work together.

Once again I would like to thank you and Krishna for all your help and 
support.

Thanks and best regards
Sandeep
