Sandeep:  Vince has asked me to coordinate with Margaret Daffin in our 
international group to ensure that we acquire an L1 visa for Anshuman.  This 
visa has to be in place before he will be able to work in the United States 
in any capacity.   (Anshuman cannot work in the US on a B-1 visa--he can only 
come here for business meetings or training.)  There are still several items 
remaining to be completed for the L-1 process.  The first is a fairly 
detailed job description for Anshuman.   Secondly, we will need to know 
whether or not he will either be in a managerial position or whether he will 
be managing a project while he is here in Houston.  Vince thought that you 
would be best able to provide this information to us, and we would really 
appreciate anything you can do to help us expedite this process.   

If you have any questions, please give me a call at x34804.  Thank you for 
your help.
