Vince,

Thanks for the Tradespark article.  

I very much appreciate being able to participate in the Applied Learning 
projects.  It has been very stimulating for me.  I've really enjoyed all the 
projects I've worked on with the research group, and ever since my interview 
I have had plenty of second thoughts about going back to graduate school.  
I'm sure MIT will be a good and unique experience, but I wonder if it can 
help me find a job and a community I enjoy as much as I already have here.

If possible, I would like to talk with you and/or Stinson about the 
possibility of my staying on the research team, or coming back after the 
Fall.  

Thanks for your time.
