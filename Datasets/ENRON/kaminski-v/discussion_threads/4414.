Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex
