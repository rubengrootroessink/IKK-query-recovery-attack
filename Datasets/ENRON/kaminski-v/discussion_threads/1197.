Following our discussion please close down all intranet access to the London 
Research Group site.  Inaccuracies have been found in the content which may 
have implications for our trading operations.  Closing the site will force 
traders to contact our Group direct, ensuring only correct information is 
passed.

The site will be completely overhauled over the coming months, so I see 
little benefit in reinstating access to the site in the near future.

Many thanks,
Steve
