Julie:

Unfortunately, our reviewer has not come back to us with comments, so I am 
sending you the final version without the benefit of review.
The attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which I 
was responsible.  Vince will send you his half separately.  Putting them 
together should be a simple matter of cut and paste, assuming that Vince has 
not changed his equation, figure, or table numbering. 

 I presume Chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial 
reasons. There is one place where I would ask him for specific redaction:  
Table 3.6 "Model specifications" on page 14/15 has a column labeled "Equation 
Reference".  Some cells are blank because the equations specified have not 
been referenced previously in the parts I have written.  Nevertheless, the 
concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book, and it may be helpful 
for Chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table.  Alternatively, 
one could simply delete the column. 

If I can help in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.
