Jason,

Are you looking for CalPX hour ahead UMCP or CalPX hour ahead zone prices?  
We have hour ahead zone price data from 10/1/98 - current and hour ahead UMCP 
from 11/6/2000 onward.

Maria,

I am looking for historical hourly real-time (spot) power prices for CalPX.
Can you help me to locate them?
