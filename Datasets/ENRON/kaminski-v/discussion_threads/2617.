Hi Shirley &  Vince:

 Happy New Year! I am in our Bombay offices for a couple of days, so am able 
to contact you. For some reason, the modem dialup from my computer hasn't 
been working. Hope everything is going well in Houston. Anitha & I have  good 
news. We are having our second baby. It was confirmed after we came to India. 

Shirley, I have a favor to ask you on this matter. Can you make an 
appointment for Anitha with her doctor? The details are as follows:

Dr.  Dolar Patolia 
Tel:  713-756-5500
Name:  Anitha Kakani
Dates:  Jan 29th or 31st. 
Times:  In order of preferance, after 3PM, 12-3PM, 10AM-12Noon. 
Reason: Pregnant with due date of Aug 8th. Needs a full checkup.

Anitha is having severe nausea, so she is taking rest most of the time. 
Pallavi and I are enjoing our vacation thoroughly. 

Thanks and best wishes,
Krishna.
Ph. 011-91-40-7114833

PS: Please count Jan 16th & 17th as working days for me.
