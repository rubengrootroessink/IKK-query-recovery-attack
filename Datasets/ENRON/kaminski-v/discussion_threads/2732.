Vince and Christie:

Again, many thanks for inviting and hosting the Tiger Team for an on-site
visit.  It was a wonderful opportunity to meet and attend the very
informative briefings from the many senior level contacts you provided to
learn more about Enron overall. It was enlightening and exciting to learn so
much about Enron.  What a great company!  The trip got rave reviews from the
students.  You were delightful and most accommodating hosts.

As for the project, I am in the process of confirming dates and locations
for the weekly Thursday (4:00-6:00pm EST) videoconferences with Enron and
will copy you on the email to the students. I know they are anxious to begin
to narrow the scope as soon as possible so that can begin the research and
analysis of their particular projects.

Thank you for your time and support of the project.


Sincerely,
