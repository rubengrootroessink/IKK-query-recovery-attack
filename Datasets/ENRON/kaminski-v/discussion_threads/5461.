Steve

given the practitioner audience, I would prefer a less technical
presentation. Perhaps if you can talk about use of real options at Enron in
general, and then give some examples (graphically --no notation) of
diagrammatic representation might be good. Remember there are many talks
and the capacity of the audience to absorb notation, grammar, and technical
detail is limited.

How about a more generic title "Real Options at Enron?"

Please give me your title within Enron please
