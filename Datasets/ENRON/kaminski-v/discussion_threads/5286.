Find below resume and email from someone who has built an electric generation 
commitment optimization model and is job-hunting.

His skills look pretty good.
Should we bring him for an interview?

Dear Dr. Takriti,

My name is Jorge Valenzuela. We met last year in the workshop, "The new
generation of unit commitment models".  After your presentation, we had a
brief conversation.   I  defended my Ph.D. dissertation in Industrial
Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh last December. Currently, I am
teaching at the Business School of the University of Pittsburgh, but my
interest is to work for an electric power company such as Enron.

During the last three years, my work has revolved around modeling of
electric power systems. My Ph.D. dissertation deals with the scheduling of
generating units under the new operating environment. I have proposed a
formulation that includes the option of trading at market-clearing prices
with a power pool. I model the market-clearing price by a stochastic
process based on the stochastic processes of the generating unit
availabilities and the aggregate load. I use probabilistic dynamic
programming to obtain the schedule that maximizes the expected profit.

In my resume, herewith attached, I have listed some other work that I have
done in modeling electric power systems. I would like to add that I am a
very versatile person with strong background in Operations Research,
Statistics, and Information Technology.

Please call or e-mail me if you think that your company could make use of
a person as me.  Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

Best regards,

Jorge Valenzuela
