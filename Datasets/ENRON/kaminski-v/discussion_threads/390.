Vince,

F.Y.I.   I have not talked to John Martin about it yet.   I don't know if you 
have any interest.

My number is 254-710-4473 (office) and 254-757-0852 (home).  The editor of
the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance is doing a special issue on Energy
Finance for the Fall and I want to see if you and Vince would like to put
something together describing Enron's basic business model.  I would love
to join you if you would like and I can actually draft the paper with your
help.  I'll get in touch with you on Monday.  Have a great weekend.

John

p.s. Mitch Taylor was in class today and did his usual great job.  I sure
enjoy using Enron as my "premier company example".
