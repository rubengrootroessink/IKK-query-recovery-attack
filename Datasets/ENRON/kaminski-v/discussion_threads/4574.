Good afternoon!

Attached is the list of Associate Candidates to whom offers have been 
extended from Super Saturday IV.  Please feel encouraged to call or e-mail to 
congratulate them!

Let me know if you have any questions (ext. 3-6176).

Thank you for all your help!
Elizabeth Boudreaux

PS-  I have also included the "no offer" list, just FYI.
