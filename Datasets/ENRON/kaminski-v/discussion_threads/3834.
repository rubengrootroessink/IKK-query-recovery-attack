Mark,

First let me say thank you for your assistance in making it possible for 
meteorologists Tony Hamilton and Stephen Bennett to hit the groung running 
this week when they came over to London from Houston.  When we came into our 
offices in Houston Monday morning, Tony and Steve had already gathered and 
analyzed their data, prepared reports and were ready for the Avistar 
briefings! The cross-Atlantic communication and data-sharing and manipulation 
went seamlessly!  We have great expectations for continued synergy with this 
new set-up.

The Research Weather Group is excited about our expanded responsibilities in 
London. We are committed to maximizing the value added we can provide to the 
Weather Derivatives, Crude & Products, UK Trading, Continental Power, and 
Analytics efforts.  We are, however,  also extremely dependent on computers 
and communication, associated software and peripherals.  Plus the datastreams 
we access and the reports we generate are very time-critical in their value 
to traders.  We need a very stable environment, with reliable back-up and 
24-hour support to fulfill our commitments to providing the trading operation 
with timely, never-fail research and information flows.

So, thanks again, and  please do whatever you can to continue this high level 
of support by passing this letter of praise and thanks to your team, and show 
them our appreciation for your efforts.

Mike Roberts
