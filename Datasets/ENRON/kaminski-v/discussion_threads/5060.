Vince and Stinson,

It seems we made a good impression to Rodney.  Can we have him
working for our sub-group ?

Dear Dr. Lu:
Thank-you for meeting with me to discuss  opportunities in your derivative 
pricing group. I very much enjoyed talking with  you. The projects you are 
working on are quite interesting to me. It appears to  me the resources and 
culture at Enron are excellent for accomplishing quality  value-adding work. 
I would very much like to be a part of your group. Thank-you  once again for 
meeting with me. And it goes without saying - lunch was  great!
Sincerely,
Rodney Greene
