Elizabeth,

Can you please direct me to someone to assist us in making an offer to a 
young lady we just interviewed?  We would like to bring her in as a summer 
intern the same way that we brought in James Bradley Aimone.

She will be reporting to Stinson Gibner and I believe she is available right
away.

I am attaching her resume.

Thanks for your help.
