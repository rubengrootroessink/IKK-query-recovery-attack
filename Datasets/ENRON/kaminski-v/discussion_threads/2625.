Vince and Stinson,

I have to go back to China to attend my father's funeral on Saterday Jan. 20.
My father passed away last Sunday.   

My schedule is:

Leave Houston:  Jan 18 (Thursday)
Arrive Houston:   Jan 27 (Saterday)

I will take care of a few things before I go

1) Review for Paulo and Bob
2) Talk to Alex on the compound option on a power plant
3) Talk to Bob on volatility and correlation skews, to finish up this project 
for John Arnold
4) Telephone interview for Japan Office.



Zimin
