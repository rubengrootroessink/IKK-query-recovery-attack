Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the 
subject.  I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he 
completely agrees.  As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the 
product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor 
to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the 
product on our machines.   As for additional development we should get John 
Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John 
Bloomer's perspective.

Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo 
space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas, 
the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading 
will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc.  So the packet based stuff 
is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport: 
level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based 
requirements.  That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we 
will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for 
the products that he is developing.

That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise.

Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting 
Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work 
to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.  Martin will keep Samer 
and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.  Martin please start 
checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts. I will get 
you contact number for EBS and the vendor as soon as Jim provides them to 
me.  

Avici uses this product. Avici is a next generation router vendor that is 
selling Terabit routers. EBS is an investor in that company.

Ravi.

Attached is an overview of what OPNET Technologies ITDG and Modeler (V) 7.0 
offers out of the box.  As previously mentioned, we have purchased this S/W 
and are discussing potential co-development of module(s) currently not 
supported.  My belief is we can spin up a couple of your studs and develop 
our own stuff faster @ a fraction of the cost.   Avici, used OPNET to develop 
a circuit emulation model for their TSR and Cisco used OPNET for MPLS and DPT 
modeling.  These guys are willing brides at this point.  We just need to 
clearly identify their role in the network performance management and 
modeling space.  We will have to talk more in Denver. 

My flight arrives @ 10:00 ish and I am told that rental cars are scarce.

Jim
