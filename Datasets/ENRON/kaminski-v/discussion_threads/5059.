Dear Mr. Kaminski,

It was very nice to talk with you Saturday morning during the "voleyball
event".  Thanks a lot for offering your help in passing my resume to the
EnronOnline business people.  I am very excited about the possibility of
being part of the team involved with e-commerce at Enron.  Please find my
resume and cover letter attached.

Hope you have a good trip to California next week!

Thanks a lot

Carla Di Castro
(Paulo Issler's spouse)
