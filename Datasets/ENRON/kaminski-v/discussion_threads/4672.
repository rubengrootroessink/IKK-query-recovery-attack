On Monday 21st February a new analyst will be joining Enron Europe, and will 
have his first rotation in the London Research Group.

Matthew Williams has a PhD in high energy physics, having carried out his 
research at Imperial College London and CERN.  His academic experience 
includes extensive monte carlo simulation as part of his research on the 
phenomenology of supersymmetry theories.

Matthew will be working with me on issues arising from the optimisation and 
control of dynamic systems, which we expect to include power generation 
scheduling and gas flow.
