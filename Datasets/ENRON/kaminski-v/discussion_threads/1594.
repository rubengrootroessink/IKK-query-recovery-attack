Mr.  Kaminski,
?
Nick Perry and I  were recently discussing the conference in Paris, and we 
gathered that you had  some interest in exploring possible uses of our new 
WeatherDelta tool-kit.?  It is the only application that we know of, that 
can?model temperature,  loads, and power prices in several locations 
simultaneously: thus allowing the  user to measure the value an risk in a 
variety of financial instruments,  physical obligations and assets.? I have 
attached the product overview  sheet, and would be happy to discuss its 
capabilities with you at your  convenience.?? 
?
Nick and I send our  regards, 
?
