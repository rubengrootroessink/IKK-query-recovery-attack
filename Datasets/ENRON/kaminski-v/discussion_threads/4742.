Hi Vince, Scott Pleus (listed below in the director promotion section) is=
=20
bandwidth-trading backoffice person we=01,ve been working with.  I have kno=

Scott from EBS since he and I started around the same time. In fact, I was=

company's backoffice before that. =20

As for my specific situation, after our discussion yesterday, I understand=
=20
clearly what happened. It appears bad luck had a lot to do with it!!!

Thanks for looking into the promotion in the first place and I am certain=

Kind Regards,
