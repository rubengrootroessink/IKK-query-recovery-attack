Gentlepeople,

As the end of the year rapidly approaches, it seems timely to thank you for
your business this year.  Thank you for helping to make this the best year
ever for FEA!

And, wed also like to wish you Happy Holidays and a healthy and prosperous
New Year.

Earlier this year, FEA initiated =0F3Virtual Coffee Break=0F4, an emailed
newsletter for FEA Alliance Partners.  It has proven to be a popular and
useful media to share information.  This is our first effort at an emailed
newsletter to FEA clients, =0F3Afternoon Tea with Tracie).   We hope you wi=
ll
take a few minutes to skim it for pertinent information  and then move it t=
o
your FEA file folder for future reference.


***ANNOUNCING FEA PRODUCT UPDATES!***

FEA has been extraordinarily busy running extensive testing on new releases=
.
The following should be available to all clients, who are current on
maintenance, in just a couple weeks.  We will send an email notification of
the availability of the release, and CDs will be shipped.  If you prefer,
email support@fea.com to request download instructions.

@ENERGY. 2.0 will feature the release of the Forward Curve Builder and the
Swing (take or pay) Options valuation module. The Forward Curve Builder, as
its name suggests, calibrated the forward price curve for power
(electricity) and other commodity markets.  Some additional new features in
the 2.0 release include a Jump Diffusion Model for European-style options,
an option on a strip of options and an option on a strip of spread options.

VaRworks 4.0 includes sophisticated Stress Testing, support for individual
equities, and new easier to use templates.  Eagerly awaited by FEA clients,
the addition of Stress Testing capabilities has been a top priority for
FEA's engineering team.  Fund managers will be happy to hear that individua=
l
(sectorial) equities are now supported in VaRworks. 4.0.

If you do not own a license for @ENERGY or VaRworks, and want to evaluate
them, email sales@fea.com and request a 30 day demo.  Product demos are fre=
e
