In order to better understand the Research group, can I get a list of 
projects that your group works on during 2000?  Were these projects budgeted 
for separately in 2000?  If the answer is yes, can we do a comparison 
analysis on these projects (actual vs plan)?  Based on the 2001 plan, I do 
not think we budgeted by project, but I have to ask...  If you have any 
questions, please call me at 5-7094.  Thanx.
