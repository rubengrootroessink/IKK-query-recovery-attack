Molly,

I would like to invite this student for an interview,
sometimes in late December when things slow down.

Interviews with all my direct reports and George Hopley.

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Hi,
I am a Ph.D student at IEOR department at U.C.Berkeley.
Thanks for your presentation today.
It gave me knowledge and interest in electricity markets,
and your company.
As you mentioned in the presentation,
I send a resume to give me opportunity to learn more
about your company.
I hope I can join the super saturday event.

Jinbaek
