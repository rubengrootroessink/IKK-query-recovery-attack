Dear Mr. Braun:

As I mentioned, I have recently been reassigned here at Enron.  Although I am 
still in the Enron Transportation Services group, I am no longer the most 
appropriate contact for consideration of the Altos gas model.  I would 
suggest you contact Kim Watson at 713-853-3098 or of course, Vince Kaminski, 
who will remain very much a part of the decision process.  

Regards,

John Goodpasture
