Dear Mr. Palmer:

 Thank you for your interest in the Research group at Enron. We recieved your 
resume and discussed your qualifications within the research group. 
Unfortunately, there is not a good match between our job requirements and 
your skills. 

 Once again, thank you for your interest in our company and best wishes for 
your future.

Regards,
P. V. Krishnarao.
