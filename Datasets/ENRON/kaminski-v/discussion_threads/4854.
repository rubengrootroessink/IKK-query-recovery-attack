Dear Colleagues:

We are writing to remind you of an opportunity for in-depth education on
electric power restructuring in Texas through a training workshop offered
by the University of Houston.

With the passage of Senate Bill 7, Texas is moving forward with electric
power restructuring.  What will the new marketplace look like?  How will it
function?  How will existing business opportunities be affected, and what
new ones are likely to emerge?  Join us for a comprehensive two-day
training workshop March 1-2, 2000 that addresses these issues and
accommodates both new and experienced professionals.  Hosted by the Energy
Institute at the University of Houston's College of Business
Administration, the training workshop features an introductory day that
will refresh participants on the basics of the electric power market and
key aspects of the restructuring process in Texas and the U.S.  The second
day targets advanced issues in the emerging marketplace and case studies
for practicioners.  The training workshop will be held at the Center for
Executive Development at the UH-CBA.  Instructors are Ms. Dottie Anderson
and Mr. Jim Stanton, each with extensive experience in the power industry
and ERCOT implementation, and Dr. Michelle Michot Foss, director of the
Energy Institute (see biographies, following workshop details).  To
register, return the form below with your information.  Payment, or an
indication of payment, must be received by Monday, February 28.  For more
information, contact energyinstitute@uh.edu or telephone 713-743-4634.
This workshop is appropriate for new and/or advanced professionals in
operations, trading, marketing, planning, public and regulatory affairs and
in related fields such as law and accounting.

*Changing Electricity Providers: Town Hall Issues
Bringing together the elements of regulatory activity, market power and
restructuring to the retail level, this exercise allows the participants to
make active decisions as our experimental "town" weighs the option of
separating from its traditional electricity provider and treading the
waters of competition. Our group will assume roles centered around
"regulators," "power marketers," the present "investor owned utility" and
the "town" itself. A town meeting will be convened in which each entity is
allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal
decision-makers that theirs is the best option. Embedded in the exercise is
the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules
leading up to this participatory segment. Frequent references to the basic
materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the
process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will
implement.
*Congestion Management
Congestion management is one of the most critical components of ERCOT
implementation.  A number of approaches exist for pricing electricity
during periods of high demand.  Each methodology bears important
consequences for both providors and customers.  Workshop participants will
participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment
with different methods of managing congestion.
