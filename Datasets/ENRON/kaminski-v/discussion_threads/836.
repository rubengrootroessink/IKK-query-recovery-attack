Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson abo=
ut=20
who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.

Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The "Details of Jan and July.xls"=
=20
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday=
=20
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply cur=
ve=20
becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability=
=20
commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the=20
aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.

The workbook "Supply Curve.xls" has the simplistic, average supply curve I=
=20
mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question=
=20
you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.

The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:

Tao Guo, PhD, Senior "Algorithmist"  (916-569-0985) =02=05 the one I was th=
inking=20
of
Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985)
Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) =02=05 more a t=
rainer,=20
but sharp
Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 =02=05 ver=
y=20
resourceful
Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) =02=05 best for questions ab=
out=20
EMSS per se

all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com

Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP=20
(916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer=20
satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.

Regards,
Michael

Michael,

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I=
=20
am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and=20
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppar=
d=20
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and=
=20
consequently the person to contact in case of problems.

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provi=
de=20
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the=20
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack=
=20
and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort ea=
ch=20
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge thoug=
h,=20
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea=20
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations=
=20
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station=
=20
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:

For each hour, for each generating station:

"marginal cost" [o/MWh] =3D (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh=
] -=20
VOM_cost [o/MWh]

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a=20
marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above=20
calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea=
=20
Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and=
=20
TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which=
=20
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this cas=
e=20
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling=20
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

Regards

Karolina=20
