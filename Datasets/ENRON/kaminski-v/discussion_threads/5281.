PJM Two-Settlement & Market-based Regulation Market Trials
PJM will be conducting Two-Settlement and Regulation market trials in
preparation for the implementation of its Two-Settlement and Regulation 
Markets
on June 1, 2000. The Market Trials are designed to provide PJM Market
Participants the opportunity to submit generation offers, regulation offers,
demand bids (fixed and price-sensitive), increment offers, and decrement bids
using PJM eMKT. PJM will clear the markets and provide the ability for PJM
Market Participants to view two-settlement and regulation market results using
PJM eMKT.
PJM will conduct three sets of market trials. The first and second trials will
be conducted on April 19 and on April 27. The final market trials will be
conducted on business days between May 15 and May 24, 2000.
All PJM Market Participants are eligible to participate in the market trials 
for
two-settlement and regulation and must register in advance.
