Vince,
This morning I got a call from Richard Bryant, director of computational 
finance
program at Carnegie Mellon University (the program Kevin and I went through).
He's interested in getting Enron involved with their program designing and
(more critically I guess) campus recruiting effort. I gave him your phone 
number
and email. You can expect to hear something from him soon. 

Best,
Alex
