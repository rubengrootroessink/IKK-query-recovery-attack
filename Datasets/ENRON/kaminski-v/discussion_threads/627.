Vince: forwarding this to you as an FYI - do you suppose you should sit in 
since you've already met Victor? Just a thought ...

I am in the process of setting up a conference call with my contact here as 
well as Victor Burke.  Prelimainary indications are they have not finalized 
their objectives yet but I will discuss that further with them.  I would 
still strongly suggest rescheduling until everyone can attend and we can 
fully discuss our involvement.

I have discussed with AA and they are following up.  If I am the agenda, I 
would cancel the meeting and when I hear from AA, I will e mail everyone.  I 
would suggest we not hold a meeting until Kean, Buy , Koenig and I can all 
come so that we can truly move forward (or decide not to).  Let me know what 
you decide.  Thanks.  Rick
