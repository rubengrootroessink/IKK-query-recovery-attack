I enjoyed meeting you both yesterday to discuss my sincere interest in the 
research group.

Since many of the rotations for analysts are pre-determined, I think it is 
best for me to wait until my candidacy
for the analyst program is finalized.

Thank you for your interest in my skill-set. I am enrolled in the CFA 
program, have completed numerous futures/options
courses in undergraduate school, and am confident that my profile will be 
well-received after completing your in-house
project which will be utilized to test certain skills.

I'll talk to you soon after my discussions with the analyst program.

Regards,
David
