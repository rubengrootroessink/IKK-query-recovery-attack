Vera:

In studying the below information, if I am understanding it correctly, only 
$199.7 was to be reversed back to the Research Group and it should 
have occurred in July.  Do you not notice this entry either?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Per mail dated June 15 from Kim Watson,  there was supposed to have occurred 
a true-up of $274.7 in July for the fist six months of 2000.  Reviewing July 
actuals,  I was not able to locate this entry.  Would you pls let me know 
whether this entry was made,  if not,  when do you intend to process it .  
thanks.
