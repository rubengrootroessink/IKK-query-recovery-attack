Dear Vince
?
I am delighted to inform you that the  garp2001online Convention is now 
online. The response  that I have received thus far has been very positive. 
Please feel free to visit  the site at www.garp.com/2001online
?
Can I also suggest that you go to the  Debate Forum and maybe post some 
comments, address some  questions, maybe even post questions yourself. The 
web site is http://www.garp.com/2001online/discussionforum.asp
?
I trust that you find the Virtual event as exciting  and innovative as GARP 
would like it to be, especially given that this is a new  avenue for GARP.
?
I look forward to your contribution.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas
