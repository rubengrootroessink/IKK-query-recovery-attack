Vince,

My name is Shelly Jones, I am the analyst recruiting manager for the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  Christy Young passed on information from the 
University of Houston AIESEC program.  Due to the restructuring of the 
Associate/Analyst Program and the new policies regarding the interview 
process, compensation, offers, etc., we will not be participating in the 
AIESEC Program this year.  Due to your past interest in the program, I have 
forwarded the literature on to you, via inter-office mail, for your 
consideration. 

Please contact me if you have any questions. 

Thank you for your time.
Shelly Jones
