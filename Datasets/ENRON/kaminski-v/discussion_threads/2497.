Bonnie,

Thanks for getting back to me on Friday.

Enron will be contracting with Henwood for Henwood to provide an analysis of 
the Indian power system.   However, Enron will be providing a significant 
part of the input data used for the study including our views on the Indian 
market in the future and also very detailed information about our Dabhol 
plant.   We want to be sure that the information provided by us to Henwood 
remains confidential.  We also want to be sure that Henwood considers as 
confidential the results of this study provided by Henwood to Enron.

The Enron and related entities providing information are likely to include 

Dabhol Power Corp.
Enron India
also possibly Enron North America


The primary Henwood contact for the project is Robert Schenck in Australia at

Henwood Energy Services, Inc.
26 Greenhill Road
Wayville, SA 5034
Australia

The Henwood corporate office is in Sacramento:
