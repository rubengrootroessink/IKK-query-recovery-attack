Stinson,

Great! I'm looking forward to a very productive collaboration.
I'll immediately start doing Giuseppe's papers, for him to work
on the Enron/Stanford program.

Many Thanks to you and Vince, and I hope to see you soon at Stanford
or Enron. If I remember correctly, Vince is visiting Stanford in
October.

Best Regards,

Nick
