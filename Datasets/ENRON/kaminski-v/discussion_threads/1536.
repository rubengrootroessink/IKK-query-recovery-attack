Hi Maureen,

It was good to meet you last week and hear your presentation on the metals - 
full of advice on what to think about and all the various things that affect 
the market place.  I am only sorry I had to dash off to the airport - good 
job I left when I did though as check-in took ages!

Anyway, please could you send me through a copy of that presentation either 
on email or if it is located on the network somewhere then I could access it 
over the intranet?  I will be joining the LME conference tomorrow so am 
currently trying to do a bit of reading in preparation.

Thanks very much in advance & look forward to seeing the presentation over 
here in London.

Kind Regards
Alison
