Vince:

I'm looking forward to getting your outline on the economic paradigm. I hope 
that, among all the paper I've bombarded you with over the last few weeks, I 
have included a reprint of a FAll 1998 JACF article entitled "How to use EVA 
in the oil and gas industry." If this is not among the things I have left you 
with, I'd be happy to send you a copy.

The discussion of hydrocarbon reserve values is very much along the lines we 
have been discussing.

Best Regards,
