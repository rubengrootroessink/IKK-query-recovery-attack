Vasant,

So Sorry for the name mix up...it is YOU , not "Vance", another guy on my PR  
team, who is to be included in this...so sorry..I'd just gotten off the phone 
with "Vance" before I wrote this.   I'm writing this from 
"vacation-day-at-my-house"..which I can tell, the "vacation" part,  I should 
start taking literally!

Happy Holidays!

--Christie.

Hello everyone!

Regarding the Tiger team Research Project Houston Trip, these are the Rsvp's 
I've received:

Jaideep Singh
Dennis Feerick
Kim Whitsel "AND TEAM 1"
Ram Vittal
Heather Thorne 
Pat Henahan
Vincent Chen
Jack Rejtman
Deepa Mallik
Josh Leventhal
Edson Otani
Omar Bassal
Stephen Lessar
Clayton DeDiocinto.

Note: Heather and  Jack have requested to stay in Houston until Sunday 
(expenses other than air fare, beyonfd Friday at Enron will be individually 
borne).

Donna,

Would you please review this list, add the individual names of "team # 1), 
add any additional faculty, T.A.'s etc, that will be attending, and returnm 
this list to me and my assistant, "Melinda McCarty" who will begin the 
arrangements.  Also, if others would prefer Sunday returns to Phily, on the 
same terms offered Heather  and Jack, please so indicate NO LATER THAN 
Tuesday, Dec. 20.  Please inform Donna, who will then prepare and forward to 
me and my assistant  Melinda(e-mail address above) one complete, confirmed 
list of attendees.  The plan will be to leave Phily on Thurs afternoon, 
arrive late aft Thursday, Dinner at Churrasco's  South America Restaurant 
Thursday evening with me, Vince, Vance, Jeff Shankman, and possibly a few 
others from Enron.

Hotel Thursday evening and ground transportation through return to airport 
will be arranged by Enron.

Friday will be reserved for an Enron tour, and individual meetings the teams 
would like to set up with members from variuous business units 

Return will be scheduled for early Fri evening, except for those electing to 
stay through Sunday.  Again, except for return to airport and airfare, 
expenses beyond Friday afternoon will be borne by each respective student 
(though we encourage you to stay and look around this great city of Houston!).

Thanks Donna, for your immediate assistance with this--Vinve, Vance, Jeff and 
I are excited about the trip!!

Regards!

--Christie.
