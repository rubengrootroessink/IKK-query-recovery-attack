Shirley and I have scheduled the Skunkworks' meetings with Scott Tholan 
beginning Wednesday, July 5 from 2:00 to 3:30.  This meeting will take place 
every other Wednesday (same time and place) for the next few months.  These 
meetings will be held in EB1938.  Please mark your calendar, and if you have 
any serious conflicts, please let either Shirley or me know.

Thanks,
Sharon
