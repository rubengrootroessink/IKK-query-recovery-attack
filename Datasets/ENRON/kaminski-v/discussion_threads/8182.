Vince:

There is another person at Azurix looking for  a possible Enron position.   
He has an OR background and has good programming skill.   One possible 
weakness may be communication skills  (I interviewed him for Azurix way back 
when.)    I would like him to come over and talk to Zimin and myself again to 
evaluate him for a possible spot supporting ENA since we seem to be unable to 
attract anyone in the outside market right now, and we are rapidly getting 
more back-logged with requests.    I do not know what his compensation is, 
but I can check with him.

Hi Dr. Gibner, I just called you but you were not there. As you might 
remember, I am working with Samer and you was the one who interviewed me for 
this position. Samer and I now keep our eyes open for the other job 
possibilities. I would like to know if there is a position available in Enron 
Research group that I might fit in ? My updated resume and transcript are 
attached in Hector's e-mail. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Stinson, 

Here's my friend's information. He is looking for other opportunities within 
Enron. I think he would be a good candidate for
the Research Group. His extension at Azurix is 6-9654.
