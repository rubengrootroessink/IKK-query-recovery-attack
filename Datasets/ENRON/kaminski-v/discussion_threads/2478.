Vince,

I would like to meet with you or someone in your group to discuss some of the 
investment ideas and structures we are exploring.  How is your group 
structured these days?  Who would be best for me to meet?  Might you be 
available for lunch next week?  I will have my assistant contact you.

Thank,

Kevin Garland
