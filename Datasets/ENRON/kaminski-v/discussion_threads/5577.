Dear Vincent,

Hope all is well across the Atlantic. You may have seen this already but
thought I would pass it on just in case. Also Socgen just pulled off a
weather deal for a Japanease company looking to protect against wind damage
on their flower crop.

Weather is definatly picking up on this side too with more interest every
day.

Hope all is well,


Damian Goodburn
