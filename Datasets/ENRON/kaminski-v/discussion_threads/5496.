Shirley:
Could you please organize interviews for Mr. Ball with the usual Research 
suspects, including Alex Huang and Tanya Tamerchenko?
Mr. Ball's phone numbers are on his enclosed resume. Thanks.

Grant.
=======================================
Vince:
I talked to this guy briefly.  I think he is desparate to get out of Unocal 
before they downsize him out of a job.
He has a decent resume and the attached comment from Don Winslow is 
interesting.

Grant.

=======================================
Grant - here's the resume of the guy that called.  Sorry for the delay.  Here 
are Don Winslow's comments:

"Greg was my predecessor in the risk mgt dept at Unocal. He reminds me
somewhat of Remi's cousin-mild mannered, Physics Phd.  He is brilliant and
expresses himself well.  I think he might fit in Vince's group better than
in your group.  He has not had much exposure to commercial transactions. He
was in Bill Bradford's MBA class.  He graduated #1."
