Vince - appreciate you taking the time to dicuss some of our ongoing 
quantitative challenges.  Just wanted to confirm with you the next steps we 
agreed to:

research to develop a working prototype of a private firm model by Aug. 2001
this effort will include evaluating existing private firm models
houston research to allocate a full time resource, who is willing to spend a 
significant amount of time in London (at least initially) to kick off the 
effort

Please let me know if I have missed something.

thanks 

bryan
