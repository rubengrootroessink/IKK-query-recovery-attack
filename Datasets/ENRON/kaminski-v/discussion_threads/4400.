Hi Vince,
` this person was recommended by Prof. MacMinn, and he is interested.  
He seems to have the quantitative and insurance background.  I am going to 
call him again.  
Would you like to talk with him on the phone?

Vasant

Vasant,

I enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning.  From our conversation,
it sounds like Enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance.  In my mind, there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward.  As well, I see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved.  Frankly, I find that quite exciting.  I
left academics largely because I wanted to move into a more "front line"
career. While I've enjoyed my work here at the NAIC, it is still not where I
ultimately see myself.  I gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization.  If I am interpreting you correctly,
you are concerned about hands on technical work.  I enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths I bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story.

I look forward to talking to you next week.  I just found out that our
office building will be closed Monday, so I will not be in until Tuesday
a.m.
