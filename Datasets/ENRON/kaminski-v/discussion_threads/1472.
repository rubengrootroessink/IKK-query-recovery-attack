Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
I wonder if you could point me to some information
resource on Enron's bandwidth market.

I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
architecture which is the latest proposal made by
IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
I would very much like to get in touch with people
in Enron working on the similar topics.

Thank you very much.
