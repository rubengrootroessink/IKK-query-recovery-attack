Hi Guys,

I thought I would quickly update you on a few meetings we've had with the ag 
folks here over the past 2 days.  They are extremely interested in weather 
support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date.  A 
summary:

1) They are interested in Cocoa, Coffee and Sugar.  Specifically:
 Brazil:  Londrina, Bauru, Lavras   (All WMOs available in Accuweather)
 Vietnam:  Kentum, Dalat (No data immediately evident)
 Ivory Coast:  Man, Gagnoa (WMOs in Accuwx)
 Indonesia:  Sumatra-Kotubumi, Sulawesi-Dolo (No data immediately evident)

2) They are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature, 
precipitation or wind.  They are also interested in any trend information we 
can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could 
have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on 
ENSO and its impacts on these areas.

3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product 
related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)

4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have 
some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.

Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to 
see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We 
should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of 
international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.  
The problems here would be the models' problems handling tropical weather 
along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.

Let's talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together.

Steve
