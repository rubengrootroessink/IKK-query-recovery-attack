Vince,

FYI.

Prof. Gabriel Bitran of the M.I.T. management science department is planning 
to visit EBS on Wednesday, Aug. 9, to discuss research topics which might be 
of interest to EBS.   (This is Amit Dhadwal's advisor.)   He still has 25K of 
funding to use for research, but we are having a hard time coming up with a 
mutually suitable topic.   I have asked Samer to work with him in trying to 
come up with a research subject.
