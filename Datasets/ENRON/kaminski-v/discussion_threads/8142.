Today's focus: Red Hat boosts support for Web server users
---------------------------------------------
By Phil Hochmuth

Red Hat last week unveiled service and support offerings for
Apache Web server and the Stronghold Secure Web Server, Red
Hat's own Web server product based on Apache.

The new support service provides 24-7 support for problems with
running Apache Web server or Stronghold Secure Web Server on
Red Hat Linux servers. Enterprise-level service contracts have
a guaranteed 1-hour response time for incidents that can be
handled either over the phone or online. The service covers
problems involving Red Hat Web server setup, configuration and
troubleshooting.

Apache Web server is one of the most commonly used Web server
platforms, with more than half of the world's public Web
servers being run on the software, according to Netcraft.
Apache Web server ships standard with all Red Hat Linux
distributions.

Red Hat added the Stronghold Web product to its menu when it
acquired C2Net Software in August. C2Net developed the
Stronghold software as a highly secure Web server product based
on the Apache Web server. The Web server software supports 128-
bit encryption, as well as Secure Sockets Layer for securing
Web connections, digital certificates for user authentication,
and hardware encryption acceleration.

Basic Apache and Stronghold support can be purchased on an
annual contract basis for $695 per year, per server. Per-
incident support is also available. A five-pack of calls costs
$995 and a 15-pack goes for $2,495. Enterprise support, which
includes round-the-clock support with guaranteed response
times, comes in silver, gold and platinum levels, which cost
$25,000, $60,000 and $75,000 per year, respectively.
