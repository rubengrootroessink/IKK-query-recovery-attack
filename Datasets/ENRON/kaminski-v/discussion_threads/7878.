Dear Jeff and Vince,

Raffi Amit would like to invite you to attend the Tuesday, December 5th 
portion of the Wharton Forum meeting.  These Forum sessions are ordinarily 
only open to WeBI Partners and Members of the Forum on E-Business but 
exceptions are occasionally made for invited guests.

You can view a copy of the agenda for our upcoming meeting on the Forum 
website http://ecom.wharton.upenn.edu/agenda/12_00agen.html.  Please also let 
me know if you would be interested in joining our dinner with Jeremy Rifkin 
as our keynote speaker.

I hope you will be able to join us for an engaging day.

Robin
