Dear Mr. Kaminski, 

We will be glad to have you with us this Saturday for the Mock Sales Day.

This event is part of our recruitment process. So far this semester the 
recruitment has been very successful - we have 16 new members, compared to 10 
experienced ones. 

The next goal is to keep these people interested in what we do and build the 
AIESEEC spirit in them. I hope that this saturday will greatly contribute to 
that. 

Here is the schedule so far:
 
9:00 - 10:00 Breakfast
10:00 - 12:00 Sales Training Session
12:00 - 1:00 Lunch break (Board of Advisors and Alumni coming)
1:00 - 3:30 Practice Sales Calls

Some details:

I don't have the training program finalized yet, but I'm  sure it will be 
good. I have a teacher from UH Program for Excellence in Selling and the  
local committee president, Tim, organizing it. It should be interactive and 
motivating :).  If you are interested you are more than welcome to come in 
the morning and have fun with us. 

I'm inviting the Board of Advisors members and some alumni to join us at 
noon. Lunch will be provided. Our members are cooking! And it is a very 
international crowd! So far we have German meatballs, some Venesuelan soup 
(don't remember the name, but it's supposed to be very good and a lot of it), 
Spanish tortilla de patata and other international dishes. 

The part when you would help is the practise sales calls. This is a way to 
provide experience to our new members, we are inviting our board of advisors, 
alumni and everyone who is interested in AIESEC to play as company 
representatives. I will give you case scenarios, everyone will have an office 
and the new members will have to "sell" AIESEC to you. One of the goals of 
the organization is to create as many exchange opportunities as possible, so 
the new members will try to get you to sign a contract for taking an 
international intern into your imaginary company. 

I hope you find it interesting :). 

Directions to UH, College of Business:

take I-45 South, exit Spur 5, at the street light at the end of the freeway 
take a right, at Calhoun street light take a right again, the College of 
Business will be on your left hand side. Park in the parking lot in front 
(you don't need a permit on the weekends).

Please, let me know if you are coming and what time and I will make sure 
someone will meet you at the entrance of the building. 


Thank you for your time,
Biliana
