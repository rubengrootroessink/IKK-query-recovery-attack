To Margaret and Beth,

In order to ensure a comprehensive speech to Goveror Johanns, I am in the 
process of compiling some preliminary research on the Impacts of Energy 
Prices on Agri-business in Nebraska.  Before I can make a decision of whether 
I can accept this offer to speak, I would like to finish this preliminary 
study.  

I need to know the deadline of your request.  Can you give me a better 
understanding as to the duration of the speech and the type of forum in which 
I will be speaking?  Should I expect a Q&A after the speech?  Who will be in 
the audience?  What companies and CEO's will be attending the meeting?    Who 
will be speaking on energy derivatives?  Please let me know when you need my 
decision.  

Regards,

Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
