Hi Vince!

I got those notes. They should indeed
be useful. The one from Deutsche Bank
is especially helpful!

I am suppose to know this stuff, as I teach it!

Sorry about the delayed billing.
I have had trouble getting a bill
from my excellent asistant, Taichi Hoshino,
who has returned to Goldman Tokyo,
and has not been able to get anything else
done lately. I will try to get something out soon!

We had several energy people,
from several companies, at our credit risk
exec ed course last month. Seems that
credit risk and  power risk go
together these days!

Warm regards, Darrell
