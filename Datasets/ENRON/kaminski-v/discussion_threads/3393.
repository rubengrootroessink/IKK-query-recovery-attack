Hi David,

I would like to check with you just to be on the safe side.  I left our last 
meeting with the impression that only Naveen and I would be working together 
on the Raptors.  However, I heard from Naveen earlier today and he wanted to 
include Thomas (Mark, I presume) in the meeting as well.  I would like to 
ensure if that is indeed your intention.  Please advise.  Thanks.

Rakesh
