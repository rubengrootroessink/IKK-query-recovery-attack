LOUIS  RUKEYSER: Good evening. I'm Louis Rukeyser. This is Wall Street Week.  
Welcome back. 

Well, folks,  now you know why they call it black tie. 

Much of the  world of investors regards 2000 as a year of mourning -- for 
profits past, for  bubbles burst, for bulls de-horned and for certainties 
crumbled.

And let's face  it: It wasn't always fun. 

As Winston  Churchill put it, "I'm always ready to learn, although I do not 
always like to  be taught." 

Virtually  nobody except the non-stop pessimists -- who are still stone 
losers over the  past decade -- foresaw the viciousness of this year's 
declines -- although the  year was contradictory, even there.

For example, is  this a bear market? 

Well, yes and  no.

Even from their  highest heights in early 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average and the  S&P 500 have declined far less than the twenty percent that 
traditionally  has defined a bear market.

But for the  formerly high-flying technology stocks personified by the 
Nasdaq, this has not  only been a bear -- but the growly of all time.

Nasdaq, which  never does things moderately, fell nearly 40 percent this year 
-- and is off  more than 51 percent from its March 10th high. 

That makes this  not only the worst year ever for the 29-year-old Nasdaq, but 
the biggest  decline for any of the three major indexes since the S&P 500 
lost 47  percent in 1931, during the Great Depression. 

So devastating  was this latest, and most severe, tech wreck that any attempt 
to put it in  perspective -- by pointing out, say, that Nasdaq has been the 
bullish  phenomenon of the past decade -- and that it gained more than 85 
percent in  1999 alone -- is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history 
to today's  bleeding tech investors.

Are they right?  Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically 
promising up-trend, or is  it truly the end of a booming era? 

Were the  downward catalysts of 2000 -- a fierce Federal Reserve, a steeply 
weakening  economy and a nation driven to embarrassing self-doubt by the 
Election That  Would Not Die -- passing phenomena or auguries of enduring 
change?

We'll try to  get you some meaningful answers tonight -- in the company of 
four  sharp-shooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our 
viewers  significant money in 2000 while the markets -- and most of their 
competitors  -- faltered. 

We'll review  what really did happen in 2000 -- to the economy and to 
investors -- and we'll  see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in 
the year ahead -- in  which, not to put too fine a point on it, Wall Street 
owes us all a lot!  

But, first,  let's see how the best-performing got better -- and the 
worst-hit got  hysterical -- in a characteristically mixed ending to a 
thoroughly mixed-up  year.

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average ended on a stronger note, despite a 
final-day sell-off,  gaining more than 150 points to close the year at 
10,787.99 -- making this the  Dow's first losing year since 1990.

Most indexes  followed the Dow's upward lead -- with the conspicuous 
exception of, you  guessed it, Nasdaq, which ended the year at less than half 
its March  peak.

But the elves,  filled with the holiday spirit -- or something -- continue to 
insist that  better times lie ahead both for the Dow -- where our haloes go, 
as usual, to  those who voted neutral three months ago, since when the Dow is 
up by just a  bit more than one percent -- and for Nasdaq, which we now 
insist they also  predict -- to see if that can improve their worst overall 
yearly record since  they were created.

There were  minimal changes in the bond and oil markets, and the dollar had a 
mixed week  -- as the long-suffering euro continued its recent rebound.

And if your  investments this year are giving you palpitations, try munching 
some of those  holiday sweets you've been trying to put out of your mind. 

A new report in  the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that 
chocolate may  protect against heart disease.

The theory is  that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent build-up of 
blood  platelets.

Brian Rogers,  what's it going to take to build up investor psychology in 
Wall  Street?

ROGERS:  Well, Lou, I think what we've seen is a very natural transition this 
year away  from some of the higher-flying sectors of 1999. And I think 
investors as we  enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression, 
what the Fed does  with rates, and I think an awful lot will be determined, 
at least in the first  part of the year, on what happens to mutual fund cash 
flows. 

RUKEYSER:  When will we know that? A week or two from now, or will it take 
longer?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll see a lot of indications in January. I think the Fed 
will meet  several weeks into the new year. I think we'll see trends in 
mutual fund cash  flow data evident by the end of January. And then we also 
have the January  effect I suppose we can look forward to, to see how the 
first month of the  year shakes out.

RUKEYSER: So basically, if things don't look a heck of a lot  better by 
mid-January, that's going to be a bad sign.

ROGERS:  You can take the rest of the year off at that point. 

RUKEYSER: Thanks for your encouragement. Barbara Marcin, what do  you think? 
What's it going to take to pep up the investors? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of 
profit and  growth priced into the market here. And I really think that what 
happened this  year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really 
led the market  down. It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks 
which boomed so  much last year. And last year you could have a reasonable 
return which would  look very mediocre if you weren't invested in those 
stocks, and this year if  you have a reasonable return, it looks very good, 
because the telecom and  technology stocks declined so much. So I think it's 
really just been a matter  of resetting expectations, and I think we can 
still have a good market here  with a broad number of stocks attractively 
priced.

RUKEYSER: So it was a good thing that those jazzed-up fly boys  came down to 
earth, huh? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market 
certainly,  yes.

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, Brian mentioned the Fed. How important is  the Fed in 
all this?

HOLLAND:  Well, I think the Fed made a big mistake. I mean they raised 
interest rates,  you know, 6 times in 15 months. You know, basically the 
economy, inflation was  not an issue at the time that they were raising it. 
And now of course they  took money out of the system because they put a lot 
in at the end of '99 for  Y2K issues, and now they've taken it out. So really 
I think they've dropped  the ball here, and I think that they're going to 
have to cut rates here over  the next month or so. 

RUKEYSER:  How much impact will that have? Wall Street expects them to do 
that  doesn't it? 

HOLLAND:  Well, I think it does, Wall Street expects that. But I think, 
again, to  see it is to believe it, and I think to the extent that Greenspan 
has sort of  been a follower, he has not been a leader. So I suspect that any 
positive  action here will be received relatively positively.

RUKEYSER: You mean the markets have led him. 

HOLLAND:  That's exactly right. 

RUKEYSER: And they're now leading him to a rate cut. 

HOLLAND:  Exactly. 

RUKEYSER: I  see. Well, I hope Mr. Greenspan understands that. Beth Dater, 
what do you  think?

DATER:  Well, that's an interesting point, because I think typically the 
stock market  is driven by the economy. What's sort of interesting about the 
last  year-and-a-half is that to some extent the economy has been driven by 
the  stock market and the wealth effect. And so I think what's going to be 
really  important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can 
adjust to  a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more 
like eight  percent than 25 or 30 or high double-digit gains. 

RUKEYSER: The consumer didn't seem to be too sanguine this  Christmas. 

DATER:  No, the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here. 
And I think  the question will be, back to Brian's point, what will happen 
when the  consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual 
fund  business. It's something to watch very closely I think.

RUKEYSER: There was a fall off in the rate of net input into  mutual funds 
last month, which is not surprising. What do you think? Why  should people 
turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds  now?

DATER:  Well, I think there's, I think that consumers also have to adjust to 
the  fact that, you know, the same 25 stocks aren't going to carry 
everything, that  there are areas of diversification, such as fixed income 
and value and other  styles of investing, where one can still receive good 
returns over time.  

RUKEYSER: All right. Now, before we look ahead with our winners  of the year, 
let's review where we've been in a year most investors would love  to forget. 

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average was the year's first victim, falling nearly 
2,000 points  after peaking in mid-January at a record 11,723 -- but then 
gained most of it  back, ending with a loss of just over six percent.

The S&P 500  peaked later -- in March -- but recovered less, losing a bit 
more than ten  percent for the year.

But the true  carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq, which was butchered by 
more than 39  percent.

In contrast,  both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes 
-- which track  all the common stocks traded there -- eked out small gains 
for the year --  while the small-stock Russell 2000 was down by just 4.2 
percent.

Even a bad year  for stocks and a hint of inflation couldn't revive the 
fortunes of the  investment world's longest sufferers -- the gold bugs -- 
whose favorite metal  continued to tarnish. And silver did even worse.

The strong man  of the year was the U.S. dollar, which easily outperformed 
all other major  currencies, with a particularly dazzling gain of 12 percent 
against the  yen.

Meanwhile, the  U.S. economy continued -- as it has now for nearly ten years 
-- what has  become a record expansion -- but new doubts about its durability 
arose as  growth slowed in the third quarter to just 2.2 percent and the 
fourth quarter  seemed even weaker.

There was a  slight whiff of inflation midway through the year, helped along 
by a stunning  rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by 
Fed officials, who  last year took the Y2K threat too seriously. By November, 
there was some  relief -- consumer prices for the past 12 months had 
increased 3.4 percent,  ahead of the pace a year ago, but off the summer 
highs.

Continuing to  defy old-fashioned economic textbooks, unemployment remained 
low, even as  inflation blipped -- and the economy chugged forward. U.S. 
unemployment  reached a three-decade low at 3.9 percent, and as of the last 
monthly report,  in November, was still holding at just four percent.

Even the  ever-edgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation -- and with 
the  prospect of a softer economy, the ghouls rejoiced. The yield on the 
30-year  Treasury bond was driven down to 5.46 percent -- more than a full 
point lower  than where it was a year ago.

But short-term  rates -- which are more-easily controlled by the Federal 
Reserve -- climbed  nearly as much as long rates fell. The average yield on 
taxable money-market  funds is now up to six percent.

The year's big  international economic story was oil. From below $11.00 a 
barrel just two  years ago, oil climbed over $37.00 this past September 
before retreating to  today's $26.80 -- a little more than a dollar higher 
than a year  ago.

For the fourth  year in a row, the U.S. trade deficit is setting a record in 
2000 -- and next  April will mark a full quarter-century since the U.S. last 
saw even a monthly  trade surplus.

And where do we  go from here? The Conference Board's index of so-called 
leading economic  indicators has been anemic throughout 2000 with outright 
negative readings in  four of the past five months.

Brian Rogers,  which of these numbers, if any, is the one to watch in the 
2001  markets?

ROGERS:  Lou, I think the most important thing will be what happens to 
corporate  earnings in the first half. Things have been sluggish in the 
second half of  this year, and I think as we enter the new year corporate 
profitability will  be the most important thing affecting how investors view 
markets. 

RUKEYSER: And what's your guess on how that will turn out?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll have a decent profit year, but when I say decent, Lou, 
my best  guess is in the five to seven percent range, and not much more than 
that, from  a corporate profitability standpoint. 

RUKEYSER: Do you think the markets are expecting that?  

ROGERS:  I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that, which 
makes me  think we might continue to have some, again some choppiness in the 
first part  of 2001. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, what are you going to keep your eye on? 

MARCIN:  I'm going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels. You 
know, we  had three forces which slowed the economy this year: the Federal 
Reserve  raising interest rates, high oil and gas prices, and really a sharp 
drop off  in consumer confidence as the stock market fell, and that slowed 
spending a  lot. And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers 
really  stopped spending, that could spiral a little bit more into companies  
incorporating that and having layoffs, and really then we could get a  
recession. So that's what I'm keeping my eye on.

RUKEYSER: Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this  whole 
expansion. 

MARCIN:  Yes.

RUKEYSER:  There are some signs they're flagging a little, but you want to 
see how  much. 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER: What's your guess? 

MARCIN:  I think that, right now I'm not predicting a recession, so I'm not 
predicting  that they're going to flag that much more. We just had, this week 
the third  straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence. And I think 
that perhaps,  come the new year, we can regain it, but that is what I'm 
concerned about.  

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, how about you? 

HOLLAND:  I agree with Barbara. I think the consumer sentiment has 
deteriorated, and I  think that there's probably a greater than 50-50 chance 
that we're probably  going to have a recession. It's sort of the old notion 
of the Federal Reserve  pushing on the string in order to get the economy 
going by reducing rates or  injecting money into the system. And I'm not so 
sure that the system will  swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling 
into recession.

RUKEYSER: So you think the Fed has waited far too long.  

HOLLAND:  I think so. 

RUKEYSER:  Do you think there's a chance that they'll cut more than a quarter 
percent  next month? 

HOLLAND:  I think it's possible that they could have an interim meeting to 
cut, and I  think it's very possible they could cut a half a point. 

RUKEYSER:  Beth, can you cheer me up any more? 

DATER:  Well, I think it gets down to interest rates, because I think that is 
what  will ultimately influence the consumer confidence. I'm a little bit 
concerned  about the dollar in here. I mean I think that we have had a huge 
amount of  foreign investment also into our capital markets here, and if the 
dollar were  to weaken substantially, that might be at risk, and we might see 
some  repatriation of some of those foreign investments. 

RUKEYSER: All right. Now comes the moment of truth when we turn  the 
spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago.

In what has  been for decades the toughest competition in investing -- the 
lists cannot be  changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months -- 
it was a tough year  even for our certified geniuses -- though the average of 
all our panelists  continued to beat the performance of the S&P 500, let 
alone the sagging  Nasdaq. 

You can check  all their records on our web site. It will be up after 
midnight tonight. As  you'll see, the five who actually defied the odds, and 
made you money in 2000,  included the four stalwarts here tonight.

Brian Rogers,  to show what a weird year it was, you were the second-closest 
of all our  panelists, behind Marty Zweig, in predicting the Dow's 2000 high 
and close --  though even you were too optimistic by nearly 800 and 1,000 
points,  respectively. That was good this year.

But in the  far-more-important, actual money-making part of the competition, 
you excelled  -- with a portfolio of specific recommendations that, according 
to  calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets, was up a 
whopping  42.5 percent, aided by three timely short sales and a near-double 
in Bergen  Brunswig. Congratulations!

ROGERS:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, with both you and Brian here, it's clearly the 
value  players' night out. While your prediction that the Dow would get above 
14,000  turned out to be ridiculously high, you came within 11 points -- 11 
points --  of nailing the precise Dow low of 9796.03. And better still, your 
portfolio is  up more than 40 percent in this generally-grim year -- thanks 
to the best  single pick of any panelist, Everest Reinsurance Holdings -- 
which rewarded  you with a 222-percent gain. So thanks, Barbara, for bringing 
us so much  value! 

MARCIN:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Lou Holland, welcome back to your fourth year-end appearance, the 
most of  any panelist here tonight, and you earned it. While your high, low 
and close  were way off the mark -- a familiar song this year -- your 
portfolio was up  more than 28 percent, powered by the more-than-doubling of 
Washington Mutual.  Way to go, Lou. 

HOLLAND:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER: Beth Dater, this is your third year-end program. And  your cautious 
approach to investing in 2000 -- including putting 20 percent of  the 
portfolio in three-year Treasury notes -- paid off with an average gain of  
more than 7.5 percent. In 2000, that looked awful good. So congratulations,  
Beth.

DATER:  Thank you, Lou. 

RUKEYSER:  But enough with the compliments -- however well-earned in a year 
like this  past one. There's a new, and we hope different, year ahead -- and 
what have  you done for us lately? For starters, in our annual triumph of 
hope over  experience, let's hear from each of you the true inside word on 
the highest  close, the lowest close, and the final close for both the Dow 
Jones Industrial  Average and Nasdaq in 2001. And this time, gang, let's all 
get it exactly  right. 

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,500, a low of 10,000, and a 
close of  11,900. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 3,000, a low of 2,000, and a 
close of  2,250. 

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  For the Dow, I have a high of 13,000, a low of 10,500, and a close 
of 12,000.  And for Nasdaq, a high of 3,200, a low of 2,500, and a close of  
3,000.

RUKEYSER: Lou? 

HOLLAND:  For the Dow, I have a high of 12,936, a low of 10,100, and a close 
of  12,504. For the Nasdaq, I have a high of 3,090, a low of 2,101, and a 
close of  2,842.

RUKEYSER: Beth?

DATER:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,175, a low of 9,781, and a 
close of  11,740. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 2,834, a low of 2,404, and a 
close of  2,734. 

RUKEYSER:  Okay. Well, one thing is for sure -- and this is my only 
personal,  unqualified guarantee of the night: At least some of them will be  
wrong.

But, if you'd  like to see the full predictions, with specific stock 
selections, from all 22  of our panelists, all those lists will be included 
in tonight's transcript --  which you can get for $7.50 by writing to 
Year-End Transcripts, Wall $treet  Week With Louis Rukeyser, Owings Mills, 
Maryland 21117 -- or, you can order  on-line, for $10.00, by visiting our web 
site at: pbs.org.

And now, let's  see what these fabulous four think are the very best buys for 
2001.

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, Aon Corp, Cypress Semiconductor, Disney, Exodus Communications, 
Fortune  Brands, Hasbro, Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Fund, Motorola, 
Octel, Ryder  (System), Sprint (FON Group), and Unisource Energy.

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  I'm keeping the two from this year's list that did not perform, and 
that's  Cendant and Mattel, and I'm adding Compaq, WorldCom, Lucent, Loral 
(Space  & Communications), AT&T Wireless, and Motorola. 

RUKEYSER: A little tech in there, hmm? 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER:  Tech's going to have a little comeback you think? 

MARCIN:  That's right. Tech and telecom maybe.

RUKEYSER: Some of those bleeding people will be very happy to  hear that from 
a cautious person like yourself. Lou? 

HOLLAND:  Okay, I have Carnival Corp., CEC Entertainment, Ceridian Corp., 
Clorox  Company, Chase Manhattan Bank, Cognos Inc., Intel -- one of your 
favorites,  Louis -- Home Depot, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, and WorldCom. 

RUKEYSER: My favorites are the ones that go up. The ones I hate  are the ones 
that go down. You know what Will Rogers said, there's nothing  hard about the 
stock market. You buy a stock, and when it goes up, you sell  it. If they 
don't go up, you don't buy. Beth Dater, your list? 

DATER:  Lou, 25% weighting in 3-year U.S. Treasury notes. The balance equally 
weighted  in Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, Cisco Systems, Intel, MedImmune, 
Mellon Bank,  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Royal Dutch Petroleum, 
Schlumberger, Wal-Mart, and  Westwood One.

RUKEYSER:  Hearing as much financial services as I do, is that an interest 
rate  forecast as well?

DATER:  It's an interest rate forecast, and also it's a call on valuations, 
which I  think are still very interesting in that area. 

RUKEYSER: How about some of those fallen giants that you've  picked? That 
suggests to me that you don't think it's the end of the world.  

DATER: I  do not think it's the end of the world. And I do think it's a time 
of some  uncertainty and it's a time to think of preservation of capital 
first and  foremost, and therefore, I'm going with some household names at 
this point.  

RUKEYSER: Especially some that have been knocked so far down  that... 

DATER:  Exactly. The valuations are coming into reasonable levels.

RUKEYSER: Brian Rogers, let's hear from you on interest rates.  What do you 
think? 

ROGERS:  Lou, I think we'll see a normalization of the yield curve this year, 
so I  think we'll see short rates fall. The Fed will cut rates probably a 
couple of  times. And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in 
calendar  year 2000. I think that game is probably mostly over would be my 
best guess.  

RUKEYSER:  And short-term rates you don't think are going to fall that much?  

ROGERS:  No, I think short-term rates will fall causing the yield curve to  
look...

RUKEYSER:  But how much do you think they'll fall? 

ROGERS:  I think they'll fall at least 50 or 75 basis points this year. 

RUKEYSER: Okay. If we can get that over the next two weeks, that  might help 
some of your inflows into your mutual funds.

ROGERS:  Well, we'll be happy then. 

RUKEYSER:  Thank you all very much. There we do have to stop. I hope you'll 
join me  next week twice -- first, for our regular program when my guest will 
be the  incomparable Abby Joseph Cohen -- and then for a very special, 
hour-long  "Louis Rukeyser's 2001 Money Guide" -- when my guests will include 
four  world-class industrial titans -- true shapers of our future in the year 
-- and  the century -- ahead.

Meanwhile, this  has been "Wall Street Week." I'm Louis Rukeyser, wishing you 
a happy -- and  infinitely more prosperous -- New Year.
