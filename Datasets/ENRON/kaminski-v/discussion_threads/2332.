The Gas and Power Trading organizations have had a tremendous year.  
Sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization 
that significantly contributed to that success.  I believe the Weather Group 
comprised of Mike Robert's, Jose Marquez, Stephen Bennett and Dave Ryan from 
Power are one of those groups.  These individuals have done a tremendous job 
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take.  The 
greatest achievement has been the November and December winter forecast.  
They held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were 
moderating.  On a score card with all other services they definitely deserve 
an "A+".  When you are down on the 32nd floor it would be nice if you would 
stop and congratulate them on a tremendous job and their contribution to our 
success.

 Thanks,  Jim Schwieger
