Hello everyone:

Vince Kaminski would be available for a conference call on Wednesday,
May 31 at 10:00 or 11:00 AM EST.  The rest of the day is rather full.

Please let me know if either time is convenient for you.  If not, maybe we
could do it on June 1 - he is free most of the day with the exception of
12:30 - 2:00 EST.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks!
