Hi guys!

As most of you know by now today is my last day at Enron North America. It 
has been really great few months and Maureen has most graciously put up with 
my school and exam schedule. As today is also my graduation from the 
University of Houston, I don't have any formal reasons to remain in Houston 
and will be heading to the misty Albion to work for Enron Europe as soon as 
my work permit for the UK is ready. The latter is still a mystery but is 
anticipated some time in early February. Right now I am planning to come back 
to Houston middle of January to wait for the work permit and sell my car, 
some furniture, etc. (stay tuned for great deals :-) So, I will be back to 
see you guys. If you miss me too much try to find consolation in Miss Yana 
Kristal, a U of H student of Slavic origin, who will be taking over my 
responsibilities starting early January. I know I will miss you and am 
planning to sneak in the video conferencing room during the Thursday 
meetings. I know it won't be the same, but it's better than nothing. Or you 
can start planning that trip to London...

Below are the numbers where if you can't reach me there will be information 
where I might be.

Phone numbers:
Houston: 713-213-7733 - cell & voicemail
Sofia: (011) +359 2 74 73 06 - home (+8 hours from Houston)

E-mail: marty@myself.com

Travel schedule:
Leave Houston and go to Sofia December 21;
Come back to Houston January 15 (depending on how the work permit is coming ).

Have very, very Happy Holidays and a great Millenium!

Martina
