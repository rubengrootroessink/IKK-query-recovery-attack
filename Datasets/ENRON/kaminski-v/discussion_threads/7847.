Dear Mr Kaminiski

I am a Graduate Student majoring in Industrial Engr and Operations
Research at the University of California Berkeley. When you came for a
seminar talk in our department, I spoke to you regarding my interest in
working with your group as a Summer Intern followed by a full time
position. I am sending you my resume with this mail.

I have several accomplishments in my academic life, that includes 3
publications and some awards and I am receiving Full Scholarship from the
University for my Graduate Studies. It would be really nice of you if you
can give me a candid appraisal of my chances with the present background
that I have in the fields of Supply Chain Mgmt. Logostics Optimization
Decision Support Systems.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and working with your group in
Enron.

Thanking You
Yours Sincerely
Srijay
