Fiona,

To answer your questions:

1. We approved Chapter 3 for publication.

2. My current affiliation is Enron N.A. Grant left the company but my advice
it to leave his bio as is (it reflects his employment  status when he was
working on the chapter).
I don't think we should update the bio and advertise his new employer.

3. Ad material is fine.
