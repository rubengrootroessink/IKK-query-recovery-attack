Dear Vince,

Would you mind emailing to me a short biography/vita sometime when you get
a chance?  Also, if you have a paper to circulate or any PowerPoint slides
that you'll want to use either in your presentations to my students
Thursday afternoon, 2/3, or to the faculty seminar on Friday morning, 2/4,
please email these to me.  This would be greatly appreciated.

My colleagues and I are looking forward to your visit on Feb. 3-4 to LSU.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
