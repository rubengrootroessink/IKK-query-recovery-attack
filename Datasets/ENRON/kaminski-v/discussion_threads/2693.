Congratulations! Your company project was selected by the students for the 
2001 Action Learning Project program at Rice University. The Company Day was 
a huge success last week, and we appreciate all your time and effort. On 
Monday, January 22, we will send you a list of your team members via email 
with a hard copy to follow. Student team members will be in touch soon so 
that you can plan your first meeting. 

Thanks for your continued support and interest in the Jones School.
