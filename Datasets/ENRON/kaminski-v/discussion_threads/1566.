Thanks - based on a "speed read" it would appear that SRM sits neatly in the 
volumetric part of your framework. Regarding systems I am keen to preserve 
the work Kevin has already done and I suspect we can eventually use the 
visualization tools in the RisktRAC front end to display the results should 
we require.

To be honest, I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a 
framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the "angry 
lone voice" in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art 
of risk management generally travel in a similar direction !

I shall make sure our efforts remain in congruence.
