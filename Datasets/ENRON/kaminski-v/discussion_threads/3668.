Vince,

Attached is a description of the deal involving Jedi Shares.  The structure 
is a two-year forward followed by another two years of restriction.  The 
pricing is consistent with our previous approach.  I have given a copy to 
Stinson as well.  As Ryan would like a reply in the AM hours, I would like to 
let him know by 11 AM.  Please take a look and let me know what your thoughts 
are, time permitting.  Otherwise, I shall check with Stinson and proceed.  
Thanks.

Rakesh

Rakesh,

Can you please take a look at this write up that I put together last night.  
I would like to get your comments this morning if possible.  I am trying to 
see if we can use this as a discussion tool with some investment banks to get 
their comments as to the reasonableness of the restriction calculated.

Also, thanks for your assistance with Andersen yesterday.  They should be 
directing all of their questions/comments to me so I can intermediate with 
you and the rest of the research group.  Please let me know if they start 
calling you with questions or want to set up any meetings. 

Regards,

Ryan
