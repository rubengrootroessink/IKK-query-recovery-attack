Vince:

I am not sure I know what Becky is talking about.  Can you let me know
where you want the 1.2% allocation to go?

Thanks!

Research is currently billing and are going to bill CALME region in 2001, 
will you check with Vince and see where I should move the 1.2% allocating to 
them this year as well as next year?  If you have any questions, call me.  
Thanx.

We will not send out the invoices to other BUs until further notice, because 
the support departments were told to decrease their budgets.  Also, for those 
who are going to bill EI, we need to go back to the support department and 
ask for a new allocation.  

 Enron Global Assets: made up of the commercial groups of India, South 
America, Central America and Asia 
 EGM:  LNG, Middle East and Puerto Rico support and commercial teams joined 
EGM
 EES:  Asset Operations group went to EES
 Corp:  all back office support groups (Accounting, Tax and Finance) 

Effective October of this year, the above split was done.  Don't forget to 
ask for new allocation percentage from your support group(s) for CALME 
region.  If you have any questions, call me.
