Hi Anne!

Thank you for your reply.  Enron is delighted to be a part of the Wharton 
Business Plan Competition!

First, our assistant in the University Affairs Group, Melinda McCarty, will 
provide you with our logo.

Enron would definitely like to be Judge in Phase III and Participate in the 
Venture Fair, including the display table.

As to the mentoring and University community program, let;s discuss that 
further so I can better judge our way forward.

After I've had the chance to discuss all of this with our entire University 
Affairs and Wharton team here at Enron, you and I can get together to plan a 
more difinitive participatory strategy for Enron.  I will call you next week.

Again, we at Enron are very enthusiastic about participation with Wharton in 
this mutually interesting endeavor.!

Best regards!

--Christie.

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,


Anne Stamer
