Congratulations!!!

You have been nominated to join the Cal Berkeley Campus Team.  Beginning this 
Fall, Enron will head to the University of California at Berkeley for the 
first time!   In addition to traditional Analyst recruiting focusing on 
Finance, Economics, and Business majors, the Analyst program will add a new 
addition to it's rotational program - The Global Technology Track.   The 
Global Technology Track will provide a pipeline for MIS, Computer Science and 
Engineering majors to join Enron and rotate within Enron Net Works and EBS 
technology functions.  Therefore, we would like to create a recruiting team 
that represents all aspects of Enron including both IT and Business "swat 
teams" to help attack campus during career fairs, presentations, dinners, and 
other events searching for the ideal candidate.  

In the next week you will receive an invitation to the Cal Berkeley Planning 
Session and Kickoff.  At that time we will review strategies, profiles, and 
events to ensure that Enron is able to attract the top candidates!  Please 
make every effort to attend.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 3-3589.

Thanks,

Ashley Baxter
Global Technology Track
Recruiter
