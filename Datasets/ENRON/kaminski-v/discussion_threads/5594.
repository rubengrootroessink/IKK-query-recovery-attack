Vince -
I couldn't have been more pleased than when I saw your name on the Managing 
Director promotion list last January - who says nice guys finish last!  

I've had the announcement in my "to do" folder all this time, waiting for me 
to catch up enough to send you this message, but I guess you're no stranger 
to that scenario....

Nothing stochastic about it, you're simply the best!

Betty  :)
