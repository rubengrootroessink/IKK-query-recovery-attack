Vince,


these are the contacts from UH.  
I would recommend that for a first contact the following people be involved:
Larry Pinsky (PhysicsChair)
Joe McCauley (professor)
George Reiter (professor)
Their coordinates and some schedules are below.    If Larry is out of town, 
prof. Gunaratne would be a good alternative.

Please let me know how I can help further.

Yannis
