Vince,

Two things.  Do you have any comments on the interview document?  Second, I
want to submit a proposal to the European Financial Management Association
meetings for next May based on our paper.  The meeting is in May and is
held in Paris.  Hope you can come (assuming the program committee likes our
proposal--I won the best paper award at last year's meeting so maybe we can
do it again).

Looking forward to hearing form you so I can get Bob's response to the
questions.

John
