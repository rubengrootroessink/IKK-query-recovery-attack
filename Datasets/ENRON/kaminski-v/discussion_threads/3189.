Vince,
Steve Leppard informed my today that he will be moving to Enron Metals.  I 
think that leaves a leadership hole in Research here.  When that happens in a 
place like this, resources get diverted to the squeakiest wheel.  Do you have 
any advice?  I am concerned that London continues to lag behind in the 
implementation and analysis of VaR - most commodities are on spreadsheets and 
there is not a lot of attention on calibration, analyzing output, refining, 
improving etc..
pls advise
ted
