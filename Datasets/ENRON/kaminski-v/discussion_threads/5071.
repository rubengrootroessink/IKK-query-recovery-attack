		 Subject: Stewart Seeligson joins EBS


We are pleased to announce that Stewart Seeligson has joined EBS relocating 
after more than 4 years from Enron Europe in London.  Stewart started with 
Enron nearly six years ago as an associate in ECT in Houston.  In Europe, 
Stewart was successful in playing a key role in Sutton Bridge, originating a 
number of highly structured transactions including the Eastern deals and more 
recently co-led Enron's commercial activities in Spain especially the 
development of a 1200 MW CCGT which is expected to begin construction later 
this year.

Stewart will assist in developing, managing and leading several of our more 
complicated mission critical commercial transactions.  In particular, Stewart 
will focus on those transactions which require multiple functions across EBS, 
a role Stewart excelled in at Enron Europe.  Stewart will report directly to 
Ken Rice as a Vice President, but will work directly with each of the 
commercial business unit leaders on a project specific basis.

Please welcome Stewart to the EBS team.
