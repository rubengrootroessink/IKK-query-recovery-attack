Dear all,

Following up with Vince's meeting on full requirement, we might just start 
with the existing Psim model.
The attached spreadsheet  is still running !

You need to create a directory H:\projects\pwrsim before your run the model.  
If you want to re-run the model,
you need to close the report because re-run causes the program re-write the 
report.

Let us first review what is already there in the PSIM model, if we can live 
with the simplistic dispatch
logic in PSIM, the PSIM is the deliverable product for the full requirement 
deal. 

Alex agrees to write an agenda for this project before the Friday meeting.

Zimin
