Dear Vince,

I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
=01&Finance Festival.=018  We
have more common interests than I realized at first, as I am interested
not only in weather
derivatives, but also in the financial econometrics of risk management,
broadly defined.  And
moreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic

trading and brokerage
issues.  A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the
range of my interests; see
http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.

The upshot:  It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
extensive conversation.  I
would be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your
operations, and to tell you more
about mine.  Please do let me know if you are interested.

Best regards,

Frank Diebold
