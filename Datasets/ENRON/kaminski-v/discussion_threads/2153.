Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? Please see attached the documents regarding one Total 
Return Swap deal in Europe, just for reference.

Li, attached are some summaries prepared by the EGF team on all the Riverside 
(TPL) financing transactions.  The only ones still outstanding are Riverside 
3 (refinanced in Riverside 6 and 8) and Riverside 5 (refinanced in Riverside 
9).  Riverside 4, which was refinanced in Riverside 7 and 10 is now 
collapsed, as EEL has loaned money to EEP6 to repay its third-party debt.  
Concurrent with that transaction, the Enron guarantee went away.  The only 
one of these deals with a total return swap is Riverside 5.  The others 
include only an Enron guarantee of the SPE's debt.

This is very summarized, but gives a pretty good synopsis of the deal facts.  
Hector Godoy, in Risk Management should be able to get you copies of the 
financial models used for each entity in these deals.
