Vince,

Thanks for the title and outline of your seminar.  I understand that
you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will
pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of
the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll
have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will
take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.

I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal
meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present
to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We
are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar
will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program
director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I
arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm
to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.

I look forward to your visit.

Shijie
