Dear all,

We have developed analytical soulutions for weather-triggered commodity options.
We have also programmed those formulas into user-friendly Excel functions.

The original request came from the weather derivatives structuring desk, but the
model can be used in other situations --- generically it is a double trigger option deal.

See the documentation for more details.
