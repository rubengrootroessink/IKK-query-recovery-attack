Hi, Vince,

I hope you are doing well.
The UBS Energy business will definitely miss you and
your weather group! I have to say everyone is quite
concerned how will we be getting the weather forecast
:).

As for me, I have accepted the UBS offer and will be
back in the Gas Fundamentals group for now.

This is my personal e-mail address, I hope we can stay
in touch,

Best regards,
Biliana Pehlivanova
