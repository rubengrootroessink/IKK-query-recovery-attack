What happened to the bull market?
By the time NASDAQ had maxed out in the recent bull market, many financial
commentators were claiming that something structural had changed in the
economy: new economics and the increasing value of intangible assets and
brands, among other things, were supposed to have replaced more
traditional factors in determining stock market valuations. Nice in
theory, perhaps, but wrong in practice. McKinsey analysis shows that the
traditional triumvirate of earnings growth, inflation, and interest rates
continues to drive stock prices.

Broadband media: Look before you leap
How long will it be before broadband for consumers revolutionizes
television and video entertainment? After all, some 40 million households
in the United States will gain access to broadband during the next three
to five years. But broadcasters and other programmers would do well to
temper their enthusiasm, at least for now: the time isn't right to invest
heavily in broadband programming.

Brains abroad
Where does global talent go when opportunities aren't sufficiently
plentiful at home? To the United States, of course. In the 1990s alone,
some 650,000 people from emerging markets migrated there on
professional-employment visas. This talent drain could have lasting
economic repercussions for the developing world, depriving it not only of
the skills of these workers but also of their beneficial effects on the
productivity of others.

Better UK productivity: An inside job
There is little debate that Britain's manufacturing sector is in decline
but less consensus about the reasons for it. A recent McKinsey study makes
clear that the problem isn't the quality of the country's workforce:
foreign-owned companies in Britain, drawing from the same pool of
frontline labor as their British-owned competitors, are achieving much
higher levels of productivity. The fault instead lies with British
manufacturing companies that have failed to adopt practices proved
elsewhere.
