Vince --

These are the Research employees I still have as outstanding in the system.  Are these all correct?

Rakesh Bharati		Chuanli Deng
Shane Green		Paulo Issler
Martin Lin		Praveen Mellacheruvu
Kevin Moore		Leann Walton
Sevil Yaman		Roman Zadorozhny 

This is the information they need to access the system or if they are too busy, they can call or e-mail with their pledge amount and I will handle it for them.  They will then receive a confirmatory e-mail, so they can check it for accuracy.

Click on https://hrglobal.enron.com to make a contribution or learn more about this year's campaign. You will need your GIS ID (which is your "9" number, not your "P" number) and password.  If you have never accessed the HR global system, then your password is your birthdate (format: YYYYMMDD).

If you are not sure what your ID and password are, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"  If you have questions regarding access, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.

Thanks.

Eric
