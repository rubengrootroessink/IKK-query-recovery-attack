Vince,

On Thursday at 3:00, Scott Sawyer of U of H is coming to talk to Marty Chrishman and myself about ESL (English as a second language) training for different groups.  If you would like to attend, please just let me know.

Additionally, we are offering PRC training for managers so that they can give reviews more effectively.  I know that your group could also benefit from this, and am just wondering what day and time is more convenient for your team.

Thanks,
Anne
