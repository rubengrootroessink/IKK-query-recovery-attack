>Dear McAfee.com Dispatch Subscriber:
>
>The incidence of the following 2 MEDIUM-RISK viruses has
>been rising over the last several days. McAfee.com recommends
>that you scan your system to check for infection.
>
>1. W32/Badtrans@MM is a mass-mailing worm that spreads via
>the email program MS Outlook. This worm creates an Outlook
>object that sends an infected document as a reply to all
>unread email messages. If the attachment is opened, the worm
>displays a message box:
>
>Title: Install error
>
>Message: File data corrupt: probably due to a bad data
>transmission or bad disk access.
>
>Once running, the Trojan attempts to mail the victim's IP
>Address to the author. When this information is obtained,
>the author can connect to the infected system via the Internet
>and steal personal information such as usernames, and passwords.
>In addition, the Trojan is capable of capturing other vital
>information such as credit card and bank account numbers.

>2. W32/Matcher@MM is a mass-mailing worm that spreads via MS
>Outlook.
>
>Once running, the program attempts to email itself to everyone
>in the Outlook Address book repeatedly, until the worm is
>removed from the system. The email message appears as follows:
>
>Subject: Matcher
>
>Body: Want to find your love mates!!! Try this its cool...
>Looks and Attitude Maching to opposite sex.
