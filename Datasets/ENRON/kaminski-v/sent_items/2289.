Vincent,

sorry for the inconvenient. I have just sent you the paper by fax. I would
appreciate if can let me know if the transmission is ok.

However, it is quite strange what happened to this file. I have opened it
this morning with acrobat reader and it had a pdf extension. I use Acrobat
quite often and sometimes I have problems with particular characters, but
such a thing never happened to me before...

Thank you again for your time and co-operation.

Best regards,

Paolo

Paolo,

I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that
I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension
.pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters.
Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.


My fax number is 713 646  2503.

Vince
