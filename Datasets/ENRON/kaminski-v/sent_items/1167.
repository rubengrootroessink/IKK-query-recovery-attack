Vince,

I am very pleased that you will be able to join our Advisory Board and I
look forward to introducing you to those of our Steering Committee you do
not already know as well as the other Advisory Board members at our next
meeting on December 12, 2001 in New York.

I would like to send you a more formal letter of acknowledgment and
appreciation but I realize I have only your e-mail address.   Could you
kindly send me your full name, address and telephone number?  I would also
appreciate your forwarding me a short bio.

Thanks again for your willingness to be a part of our Advisory Board.

Rick
