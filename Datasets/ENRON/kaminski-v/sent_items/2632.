Bill,

Thanks for selecting me as a panel participant.
Unfortunately, I have to decline: I am planning extended 
vacation following Thanksgiving.

I hope your company is doing fine.

Vince

Subject:	can you participant in a panel discussion Nov 28-30?

Would you be interested in participating in a panel discussion at @Market
Expo 2001 in Chicago Nov 28-30?  I would like to propose a discussion
similar to the following:

Proposed panel discussion -
Electronic commerce is quickly expanding the capabilities that enable the
exchange of structured derivative contracts.  Derivative contracts,
including swaps and options, embody substantial financial risks related to
both underlying market prices and creditworthiness of participants.  The
technology needed for these new derivative marketplaces includes
multi-parametric exchange functionality, rapid response to changing
preferences for exotic contract structures, and control over the exposure of
financial risk to traders.  These developments promise to bring electronic
commerce into the OTC marketplace.  This panel brings together leaders from
the field of financial risk management to discuss these emerging
capabilities.
