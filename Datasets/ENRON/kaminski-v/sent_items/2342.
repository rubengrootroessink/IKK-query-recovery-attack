John,

Would you like me to use the slides you attached
or expand/replace them with some additional material.

Vince,

I am attaching some powerpoint slides that I have prepared for the EMBAs in
Dallas.  I wanted to share them in the event that you might find them
useful (don't feel the need to use them however as they are self-contained
notes that the students can use independently of your comments).

John McCormack and I will await your arrival at the Cooper Center tomorrow
night before going to dinner.  Shirley sent me your schedule which
indicates your arrival at Love Field at 6:20.  I suspect that you can be at
the Cooper Center by 7:30 so if you will give me a call when you arrive we
can gather together for dinner.

Thanks again for taking the time out of your very busy schedule to help out
in my class.

your friend,

John

p.s. I hope your cross country trip went well.
