I just wanted to forward this information onto you for staffing purposes.  Kyriakos is a summer intern candidate of mine from Carnegie Mellon and expressed interest in working with Vince this summer.  After Kyriakos spoke with Kevin and Vince, Vince agreed to take him into his division for the summer.  If you need any additional information please let me know.

Kristin

Dear Kevin,

Following my interviews at GSIA on February 15/16, I will join Enron as a
summer associate this May. I would be very excited to join the Research
Team, if possible.

Thank you in advance,

Kyriakos Frantzeskakis
