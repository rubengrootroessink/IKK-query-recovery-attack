Vince,

I'm sorry for taking so long in responding.  Thank you for allowing us to access Sandeep.  We may have a need for his time and if so we will try to give you as much notice as we can.  Thanks for the offer, it is appreciated.

Regards
Rebecca

A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.

He is working currently in my group. He is available on a very short notice to help you with
any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding
our DPC strategy. In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support 
of other members of my group with skills in different areas.
