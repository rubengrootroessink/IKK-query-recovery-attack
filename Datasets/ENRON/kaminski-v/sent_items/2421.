We're ready to go.   I have set up the reception from 5:00 - 6:00  September 10th. It will be held at the Hall of Honors (in the CBA) and the Energy Finance Group will also be invited.  After the reception, I think it would be wisest to have Billy and Vince join the corporate presentation, which is scheduled from 6:00 - 9:00pm.  The summer interns receiving full-time offers will be invited to attend.  That way, they can share their summer experiences with the audience.
 
I think Professor Ronn's itinerary is great!
 
Please let me know if you have any additions or corrections to the plan.
 
Thanks!
 
lexi

Professor Ronn, Billy and Lexi:

September 10th works great for Vince.  He suggests the following if it works for your schedules:

1.  Lunch on the 10th with Professor Ronn and colleagues (to be coordinated by Professor Ronn)
2.  Vince's presentation to MBA students:  2:00 - 5:00 PM
3.  Associate/Analyst Reception:  5:00 - 7:00 (?) (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
4.  Dinner with the Associate Analyst group:   7:30 PM or whenever the reception is over. (to be coordinated by the Associate/Analyst Program)
 
Please let me know if this is workable with everyone or if you have other suggestions.
 
Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Shirley:

>Hope all is well with you and you are surviving the "hot" summer.
Greetings.  Not to worry:  I like heat and thaw out in the '90's.

>I am forwarding a message from Lexi Elliott with our Associate/Analyst

>with their calendar.  Is this feasible from your stand point?
Sep. 10th is indeed feasible.

I scheduled the invitation dates of 9/24 - 10/17 to give me time to make
progress in my class presentations so that students would have more of a
background in listening to Vince's presentation.  If select the 9/10 date,
I would ask Vince to take into account in the level of his presentation
that by that date the students will only have had 6 hrs. of the Foundations
of Energy Finance class (classes begin 8/29 and Labor Day intervenes).  On
the plus side, the students do come in with three finance courses (core
course, investments, advanced corporate) as prerequisites to my class.

In sum, I appreciate the importance of recruiting and can accommodate
Vince's presentation Sep. 10th.  Please advise if Vince would like the 2
1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or the 75-min. subset
thereof.

>Perhaps we could arrange lunch or dinner the day of the presentation
>for yourself and our 5 summer associate interns.  That way, we are
>making the most of your time in Austin.
I had planned on hosting Vince for lunch with my faculty colleagues.  If
his presence is called for at a lunch scheduled by your Associate/Analyst
Program, we will plan his schedule around that.  By this e-mail I also
inquire of Lexi whether Enron intends to host a reception at the 5 p.m. end
of the class:  If so, she should contact Energy Finance Center Assist.
Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (or 512-232-7386) to
coordinate matters.

Sincerely,
Ehud Ronn
