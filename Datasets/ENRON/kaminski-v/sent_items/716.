Vince,

In the morning we were talking about the El Paso candidate who thinks he is above something and is not
willing to take certain project or responsibility.   In real life, we also occasionally have similar stiuation. (an
example is attached).

I would like to have your guidance when such a situation occurs.  

Zimin

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

Subject:	Asian Option for Pavel

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,
