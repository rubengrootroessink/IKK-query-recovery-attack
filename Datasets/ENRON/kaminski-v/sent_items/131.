Today's focus: Wireless LAN security, Part 2

By Neal Weinberg

In our review of wireless LAN security solutions, we tested
3Com's Access Point 6000, Avaya's Access Server 1, Cisco's
Aironet 350 access point and Access Control Server, and
Colubris' CN1000. Last time, we looked at the Cisco and
Colubris products. This time, we check out 3Com's and Avaya's
wares.

3Com's Access Point 6000 is a well-designed product. It
features a two-position wireless access point with a flip
antenna as well as a retractable X-Jack antenna on its wireless
network interface card (NIC). The X-Jack lets you store the
antenna in the NIC when not in use, keeping it in your laptop
during transportation.

3Com's Dynamic Security Link technology is similar to Cisco's
Lightweight Extensive Authentication Protocol (LEAP). One
benefit of Dynamic Security Link is that it increases the
number of simultaneous users from 65 to 255.

Furthermore, you don't have to manually enter the 128-bit keys.
The software automatically generates new keys and distributes
them to the client each session. This is great for encryption,
but you still need to provide for authentication.

It took only 60 seconds to set up the access point, but
implementing the full range of security took a while longer.
3Com's browser-based Configuration Management System was
excellent, and the HTML-based documentation was complete and
well organized. In all, 3Com's product had some neat
technology.

Avaya's wireless NIC looked familiar and that's because it was.
It seems that both Colubris and Avaya use NICs from Orinoco.
But Avaya's solution goes far beyond just the NIC.

Avaya's Access Server 1 is a slick tool for managing corporate-
level wireless security. It includes Remote Authentication Dial
In User Server software that runs on any workstation plugged
into the hard-wired LAN. And it employs automatic key
generation and distribution.

Avaya's documentation was very good, with plenty of room set
aside in the form of tables to record the system parameters
administrators in large corporate environments should never
commit to memory.

The Access Server manager provides the full range of management
and diagnostic utilities you'd expect from a top-of-the-line
corporate offering.
