Hello,

Thanks for your message. I think that we can resume our discussions in a few
months. We have currently a large group of highly skilled Enron employees
who, given that we have effectively an internal labor market, are looking for alternative
positions. We are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions.

Vince

Vince,

How are you doing?  I am following up with the conference-call interview
last Monday. Could you let me know if you think we should pursue further
discussions?  Thanks for your consideration.

Subject: Thank you


Vince, Paulo, Alex, Bob:

It was a pleasure speaking to you today and I got valuable insight into the
Enron Research Group.  I believe my background in swap and options trading,
fixed income risk management, and model validation can add value to the
group.  The work you described is very attractive and I hope we have the
opportunity to pursue further discussions.  Again, thank you for your time
and I look forward to your decision.

Regards,
Sen-Hao Lai
