Will it just be Ehud, you, Vasant and Zimin?  Or will there be others?

Shirley, 

Can you get tickets for either night Ehud mentioned?
Maybe Vasant and Zimin can join us?

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud
