Philip,

I have to decline the invitation with regrets.
I have too many commitments right now.

Dear Vince

Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you recently
inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001 Australia,
which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had an
opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon as
possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.

I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852 2545
2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.

Kind regards.

Philip
