I would like to schedule a time next week to get everyone together to discuss correlation methodology in Power.  I'm out of the Office on Mon and Tuesday, but I will be available Tuesday morn for conference call.  Kevin suggested Tuesday or Wednesday morn when I'm back in the office. 

Additionally, I've attached a spreadsheet showing correlations as Kevin suggested.  Using price change shows stronger correlations between gas and power.  However, incorporating this into value-at-risk may create additional issues. 

 

Thanks,
Frank
