As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging
all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about

Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give
this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income

recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking
Investments next year to be there.

Trading Tactics - phone trades vs. electronic trading

Speaker Profiles:

Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income

Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock's
Management Committee.   Mr. Anderson is responsible for global fixed income

twenty-five credit and quantitative analysts.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which

Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt.

Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in
Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage
securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion
Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.8
billion fixed income portfolio.

Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies,
including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: "Scenario
Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management" and
"Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income
Market".




Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed
Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at
the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman's Fixed Income Research,
Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments.

Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned
electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10
billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He
remains on TradeWeb's Board, and chairs TradeWeb's trading protocol

information within the system.

Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association's Committee for
Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee

Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now

articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative

CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the
first CMO for Freddie Mac.


This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.
