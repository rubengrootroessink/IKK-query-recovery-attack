Two messages distributed via the ALLDEPTS mailing list in the last two
hours have contained virus-infected attachments, probably because of 
mail-oriented virus rather than any knowing behavior on the part of the
nominal senders. Please delete *unread* the messages from

        Yuxing Yao <yyao@RICE.EDU>

and

        Chemistry <chem@RICE.EDU>

.

As an emergency measure, our mailing list software has been configured
to prohibit e-mail with attachments from being distributed.

If you have inadvertently opened one of the infected files, please consult
your local IT divisional support or the Consulting Center at x4983 as
soon as possible.

As always: *never* open attachments unless your virus protection is
up-to-date, and you're 100% sure that the attachment is what it appears
to be.
