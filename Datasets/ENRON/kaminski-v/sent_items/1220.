Hi, Vince
I hope everything is fine with you. I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction. 
I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand. 
The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call.
I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.
Sincerely,
Yvan
