Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Hope your day is going well. Philip Merrill suggested I contact you
regarding a conference I'm organizing on Implementing the Commodities
Futures Modernization Act. The conference will include sections on Single
Stock Futures, Clearing and Trading Facilities. The latter section will
include a session on the new electronic exchanges and I would like to invite
Enron to speak on their electronic energy trading exchange.

The conference will take place September 20 - 21, 2001 at The Drake Hotel in
Chicago. The session will be in the afternoon on Thursday, September 20. I
expect the conference will draw 100 executives from broker dealers, futures
commissions merchants, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators,
introducing brokers, investment banks, exchanges, and clearing firms.

The Institute for International Research (IIR) is the world's largest
international conference company with 120 different business units and 4,000
employees in 36 countries. Founded in 1973 by Irvine Laidlaw, the current
Chairman, IIR continues to provide unbiased, bleeding-edge business
information through our conferences, workshops, seminars, and the Internet.
For more information on IIR, please visit our website at
http://www.iirusa.com.

A draft agenda is attached for your review. Please note it is a work in
progress and I will be finalizing it over the next week. I welcome any
feedback on how to improve the program, as well as any speaker suggestions.

Thanks again for your assistance. I'll follow-up with you next week, but
please feel free to contact me in the interim with any questions.

Enjoy your weekend.
Jennie D'Apice
