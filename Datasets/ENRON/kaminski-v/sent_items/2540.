Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for your interest in Two Crows. Attached as you requested is the
PDF version of our booklet "Introduction to Data Mining and Knowledge
Discovery, Third Edition." It can be read using Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.01 or
higher (downloadable free from www.adobe.com if you don't already have it).
The contents have been bookmarked for your convenience. I hope you find it
useful.

Please note that the next session of our popular two-day course, "How to
Successfully Mine Data," will be held October 8-9 in the Washington, D.C.
area. This practical, unbiased course emphasizes the real-world application
of data mining. Using sample data sets, participants help solve problems
such as identifying good credit risks and targeting prospective customers.
For details, visit our website at www.twocrows.com/dmcourse.htm. Previous
sessions have sold out, so sign up soon!

If you're looking to compare the features of specific data mining tools,
consult our Data Mining Technology Report. This publication contains
detailed vendor specifications and feature descriptions for all the leading
general-purpose data mining products. We're in the process of updating it
right now, and the new edition should be available in early autumn. Bookmark
our website -- www.twocrows.com -- and check back soon for announcements on
when the new Technology Report will be published. (The current edition is
described at www.twocrows.com/dm99tr.htm.)

Two Crows Corporation also consults on data mining to both users and
vendors. Please let us know if you'd like to explore how we can be of
further help to you.

Sincerely,

Janet Millenson
Vice President, Marketing
Two Crows Corporation
