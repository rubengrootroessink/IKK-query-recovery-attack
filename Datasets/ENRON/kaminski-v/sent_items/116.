Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings "When I'm 64"

By Phil Hochmuth

Linux distributor Red Hat last week made two announcements that
should make proponents of 64-bit Linux servers happy: it
released Red Hat Linux 7.2 for both the Intel Itanium and
Compaq Alpha processors.

Although Red Hat was previously able to run on Alpha and
Itanium platforms, the software did not take full advantage of
their 64-bit processing power. But version 7.2 for 64-bit
computing includes the newest Linux kernel (2.4.9), with
features such as higher symmetrical multiprocessing scaling and
ext3 journaling file system.

The support for these features, Red Hat says, will allow the
operating system to take better advantage of the Alpha and
Itanium platforms, which can process much larger file sizes and
handle larger address spacing than 32-bit systems.

Red Hat Linux 7.2 includes other enhancements such as improved
USB support, network configuration and user management
applications, plus a firewall configuration program that can be
configured during server setup.

Itanium is the latest iteration of Intel's PC processor, and is
catching on with users who run high-end Web servers and
enterprise-level application. Prior to Itanium, the Alpha was
the big dog among the 64-bit processor platforms. Although
Compaq has said it will phase out its 64-bit Reduced
Instruction Set Computing processor over the next few years,
Alpha systems are still used widely in database and Web
transactions servers in industries such as finance, medical,
and supercomputing research.
