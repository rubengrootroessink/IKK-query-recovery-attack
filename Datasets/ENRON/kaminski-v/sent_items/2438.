Subject:=09Days of Caring - Details of Cleaning Project

Gentlemen/Ladies,

I've been asked by Julie Clyatt to help coordinate the volunteer assignment=
s and materials for the cleaning projects at the Center for the Retarded on=
 August 10th. =20

Project Assignments
There are actually three cleaning projects - all require volunteers in the =
morning and/or afternoon.  The details of the projects are below:

Project 268 - Clean glass throughout solarium and shade house.
Project 275 - Clean all interior windows on floors 2 through 6 (70-80 windo=
ws in common areas) in Cullen Residence Hall.
Project 279 - Clean ground floor windows (109 inside and 165 outside) in Cu=
llen Residence Hall.

When you get to the site there will be an orientation in the auditorium for=
 all volunteers at the the Center.  Everyone will then disperse to their di=
fferent projects.  There are not enough total volunteers for to cover all o=
f the cleaning projects listed above so just choose which one you'd like to=
 do and you'll be directed to that area.

Materials Required by Volunteers

The only materials required to be brought by the volunteers are boxes of La=
tex Gloves (1 box each project) and for Project 268,  two 100' heavy duty w=
ater hoses.  Can anyone bring these?

Logistics

You probably already have this but just a reminder....

Transportation: Shuttles will be provided to take you to and from the site.=
  Loading and unloading of buses will be on Shaw Street, between the Antioc=
h Church and 3 Allen parking lot.  Morning shifts will leave at 8:15am and =
return to Enron at 11:30am.  Afternoon shifts will leave at 1:00 and return=
 at 4:00pm.

Food:  The volunteer appreciation lunch will be from 11:00am - 1:00pm via t=
he Big E Cafe.  Lunches will be provided by Chick-Fil-A. =20

Water:   Water and ice will be provided at the Enron building before the bu=
ses leave.  Please bring coolers from home to load the water. =20

T-Shirts:  T-shirts can be picked up at EB 1624.  T-shirts will also be ava=
ilable while loading the buses.


Thanks,
Marilyn
