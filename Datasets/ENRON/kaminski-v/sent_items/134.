Today's focus: Panda: Virus authors getting trickier

By Jason Meserve


I got a couple of interesting items in my inbox this week. The
first was an antivirus vendor press release doing the annual
look-back-at-last-year and look-forward-to-this-year pitch.

The Panda Software release says virus authors are getting more
tricky in their attempts to spread viruses, using social
engineering techniques to get unsuspecting users to open their
malicious wares. Panda is hoping that 2002 will not be a repeat
of 2001, when a number of simple "bait" messages caused mass
mailing viruses to spread like wildfire.

Panda also suspects that viruses in 2002 will go after known
system exploits like buffer overflows to run code on infected
machines. Users are urged to keep systems and antivirus
software up-to-date with the latest patches and updates. Sounds
like common sense to me. For more, go to:
http://www.pandasoftware.com/

The second item was an e-mail alert sent around by the authors
of the SiliconValley.com newsletter warning that their systems
had been hacked and used to send messages infected with
Magistr.B virus. Not good when a major media outlet's systems
are hacked and used to attack unsuspecting readers. Let's hope
Network World's systems never suffer such a fate.


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* More mutt updates available from Linux vendors

A buffer overflow in mutt's e-mail address parser could be
exploited by a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary bytes in
memory. Red Hat users can download new versions of mutt from:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-003.html

Linux-Mandrake users can get more from:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-002.php

Conectiva users:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000449

* Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router vulnerability

According to an alert from Cisco, three vulnerabilities have
been discovered in Cisco SN 5420 Storage Router software
releases up to and including 1.1(5). Two of the vulnerabilities
can cause a denial-of-service attack. The other allows access
to the SN 5420 configuration if it has been previously saved on
the router. There is no workaround for these vulnerabilities.
For more, go to:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/SN-multiple-pub.shtml


* SGI reports NQE vulnerability

The Network Queuing Environment (NQE) that shipped in the past
with SGI contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability that could lead to a malicious user gaining root
access. SGI considers this product retired and will not be
releasing a patch for the problem. For more, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20020101-01-I


* Sun releases patch for CDE Subprocess Control Service

A buffer overflow flaw in the CDE Subprocess Control Service
(dtspcd) daemon could be exploited by a malicious user to gain
root access on the affected system. Sun users can download the
appropriate patch from:
http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch


* Debian patches libgtop

Two flaws in the libgtop daemon could allow a malicious user to
gain privileges of the application, usually those for the
"nobody" user. Debian users can get more information and
patches from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-098


* Microsoft investigating alleged flaw in IE browser

Microsoft said it's investigating an alleged flaw in recent
versions of its Internet Explorer browser software that could
allow attackers to spoof legitimate Web sites, steal content
from browser cookies and gain access to certain types of files
on a victim's system.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108ieflaw.html
Computerworld, 01/08/02


* Linux-Mandrake updates BIND

Previous versions of BIND 9.x that shipped with Linux-Mandrake
8.0 and 8.1 contain insecure permissions, configuration files
and executables. This new release tightens things up a bit. For
more, go to:
http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/advisories/2002/MDKSA-2002-001.php


* Red Hat fixes exim

A flaw in the way exim handles some incoming data could expose
the affected system to arbitrary malicious code. For more, go
to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-176.html


* Patch available for stunnel

Red Hat has released a patch for stunnel to fix a format string
vulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code
on the affected system. For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-002.html


* Conectiva patches proftpd

Two vulnerabilities in proftpd could allow a malicious user to
bypass some security features or launch a denial-of-service
attack against the affected machine. For more, go to:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000450


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* First virus identified that infects Shockwave Flash files

Antivirus software vendors say they have spotted the first
computer virus that uses Macromedia's Shockwave Flash files to
transmit itself once a victim clicks to run the Flash movie.
Identified as SWF/LFM-926 by antivirus software vendor Sophos,
this virus is not yet "in the wild," infecting computers. The
Shockwave Flash virus was sent to Sophos as a sample via
anonymous e-mail, and this specimen is now being shared and
analyzed among several antivirus vendors.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0108flashvirus.html
Network World, 01/08/02

* XM97/Bdoc2-A - An Excel macro virus that displays a message
on April 26 and attempts to shut down the current Windows
session if the day is a multiple of 5. (Sophos)

* WM97/Opey-AX - A Word macro virus that changes user summary
information in the infected document. It also makes changes to
the autoexec.bat file to display a Happy Birthday message on
certain days of the year. (Sophos)

* W32.Donut - A virus only Homer Simpson could love. Symantec
reports this is a concept virus designed to test potential
weaknesses in Microsoft's .Net architecture. (Symantec)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Suggested fix for AIM hole has back door, spyware

Software recommended by security group w00w00 to plug a hole in
AOL's Instant Messenger opens the user's system to hacker
attacks and can direct the user's Web browser to pornographic
Web sites," w00w00 said Tuesday.

IDG News Service, 01/09/02


* Many U.S. companies at risk for cyberattacks

U.S. computer systems are increasingly vulnerable to
cyberattacks, partly because companies are not implementing
security measures already available, according to a new report
released Tuesday.

Reuters, 01/08/02


* Wireless LAN security fix on tap from IEEE group

Network executives worried about the security of their wireless
LANs may soon be able to sleep a little easier: The standards
committee responsible for the broken wireless LAN encryption
algorithm, Wired Equivalent Privacy, has approved a fix to the
system that can be applied to existing equipment.

* McAfee touts antivirus pack for NetWare 6.0

Network Associates' McAfee division this week becomes the first
vendor to offer antivirus software for Novell's NetWare 6.0
server, although others, including Computer Associates, expect
to have competing products ready within weeks.

year, European antivirus tools vendor Panda Software this week
made the first U.S. release of its Panda Antivirus for Exchange
2000 software available.

IDG News Service, 01/08/02


* Secure IM software proliferates

The market for secure, business-grade instant messaging
software is picking up steam, with several start-ups now
offering packages that automatically encrypt real-time chat
sessions between users. However, these packages do not yet
offer secure communications with users of popular consumer-
oriented IM systems from AOL, Microsoft and others.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0109secureim.html
Network World Fusion, 01/09/02


* NetScreen offers new VPN-firewall gear

NetScreen this week introduced VPN gear that makes it possible
for users to tailor-fit protection for specific network
resources without having to buy multiple boxes. Four new
NetScreen VPN appliances have at least four 10/100 Ethernet
ports, each of which can oversee a separate, independently
configured security domain.
