Dear Vince,

I tried to call but your phone was busy. I'm an unofficial advisor to the
White House energy team and they've asked me if Enron's bankruptcy presents
a potential systemic risk. I told them I did not think so.

This is FYI only... as I am unencumbered by the facts, it was only a
judgment call on my part.

Feel free to call me at 781 245 2036.

Best of luck... we're thinking of you and wish for the very best.

Ed
