Sean,

This was exactly the advice I gave to Zimin this morning.

Vince,

   Thank you very much for your effort to set up this conference.

   Since Zhiyong just had an accident yesterday, I am afraid it might not be a good time to talk to him at this moment
   about my transition ( I have not talked to Zhiyong yet, yesterday Zimin told me to go ahead and Zhiyong had the accident).
    Could we wait till he feels better ? 
   What do you think about ? Maybe I worry too much.

 Sincerely,

 Sean Yang
