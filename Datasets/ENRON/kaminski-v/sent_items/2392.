Ehud,

Jeff agreed to participate. I suggested dinner as a better forum
to Jeff's secretary.
The decision regarding lunch/dinner issue is still to be made.

Vince

Rick / Vince:

Greetings.  I trust this e-mail finds you both well.

Further to my discussions with Vince two weeks ago, I write you at this
time in my capacity as Director of the Center for Energy Finance Education
and Research (CEFER).  As we did in Feb. '01, my colleagues and I are
planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 2002, tentatively
scheduled for 2/21 - 2/22/02.  The Conference will kick off with a
dinner/keynote address Thur. evening, then continue all day Fri.

I would like to extend an invitation to Enron Corp. President Jeff Skilling
to be the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner or the Fri. lunch
(whichever he prefers).  I appreciate your kind offer to relay this
invitation to Mr. Skilling's office for his consideration.  If at this
stage he has timing constraints in the late Feb. - early March 2002 period,
we would be happy to work around them in the scheduling of the Conference.

Although the format for 2002's conference may differ from that used in Feb.
2001, for completeness I enclose herewith a copy of the 2001 Conference
Program.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn
