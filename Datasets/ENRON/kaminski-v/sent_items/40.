EIA to Display Draft of New Storage Survey at GasMart/Power 2002

Dulles, VA -- January 25, 2002-The Energy Information Administration will display its plans for a new weekly natural gas storage survey, as part of an extensive program exploring the wholesale gas and power markets at GasMart/Power 2002, March 18-20 in Reno, NV, hosted by Intelligence Press, Inc.
In a special session Wednesday, March 20, 2002, EIA Senior Analyst Roy Kass will outline the agency's new weekly natural gas storage survey which will replace the current survey conducted by the American Gas Association. Due for release in early May, EIA's survey is expected to become the most critical piece of data informing the market. During the conference, attendees also will be able to visit EIA's Showcase area to see and discuss with its creators, the draft version of the agency's new product.
In other sessions at the 16th annual GasMart/Power forum key natural gas and power representatives will come together to hear about strategies in the current low energy price, high security environment, and --- the impact on the competitive market of the collapse of Enron, the market's largest and most zealous supporter.
Keynoter Richard Sherrill, Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of Duke Energy North America will assess the state of the wholesale natural gas and power market, offering his strategies for instilling customer confidence in the face of the wrenching market disruptions of the last few years. He also will offer his views as to the market share for electronic trading and the outlook for electric restructuring? 
Energy guru Ben Schlesinger will explore the impact of Enron's collapse on other marketers; on rules and regulations; and on the political scene.  Will Congress intervene to re-control gas and power prices?  How long will energy investors shy away from major commitments?  Are we in for another boom-bust price cycle? Did the skyrocketing energy prices in California and other parts of the nation in the latter half of 2000 and early 2001 carry the seeds of the current bust, weakening industrial customers, bankrupting the largest marketer, and ultimately reversing gains in the competitive market?
In others of the 18 sessions at GasMart/Power 2002, Dynegy Vice President Peter Esposito and Jim Macias, Sr. Vice President of Calpine tell what's ahead for power generation. ?Williams Energy Marketing & Trading President Bill Hobbs and TXU Vice President Jeff Shorter assess the winter...Futures analyst Cynthia Kase instructs on technical market analysis ?

Smith, Chairman & CEO, John S. Herold, Inc. strategize on how to survive for the long haul in E&P.
