Vince,

I was waiting till Kevin gets back - he's cleaning up 30c2

He has a file on it all

$300 per month seems like a lot, but we use the heck out of it 

for communications daily with Tony, for video briefing preparation

I know it needed it's own server, but I want to make sure we only pay our fair share

I'll let you know accurate cost allocation as soon as kevin returns

- Mike

Vince,

I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.  The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.  The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Diane
