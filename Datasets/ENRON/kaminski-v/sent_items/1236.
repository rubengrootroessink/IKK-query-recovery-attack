Traci,

I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday.
One of the students indicated that he is
interested in a summer internship.
He came across as a very bright person,
very personable.

I can take him as a summer intern.

Vince

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,

Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
Thank you for your time.

I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
in school.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
Thank you.
