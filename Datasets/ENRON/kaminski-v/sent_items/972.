Oh, I am sorry,
Somehow, I confused the ask and bid,
while thinking who's asking and who's bidding....etc.
I am still not very familiar with this type of market place,
but I bet I will not be confused bid and ask again.

Attached is corrected version.

Jinbaek,

There is still an error in the definition of
the bid-offer spread.

Can you look into it? I have sent it already 
to Greg Whalley, my boss, before I caught it.

How are you doing?
Attached is the summary of yesterday's presentation,
you asked me.

I have no idea whom I should circulate this report.
So please circulate this report to whom you think
appropriate. [Mark Hall]   (I am going to send this
to Zimin and Bob)
