Steve,

Two things. 

1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
want to make sure I did not miss any important point.

2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
Houston? Please, let me know.

Vince
