> Vince - Hrvojesuggested that I drop you a note.  I am with an Austin

> background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would
> like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more
> flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues,
> although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider
> contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while
