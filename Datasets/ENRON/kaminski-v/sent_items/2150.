ABSTRACT:

  SUBJECT AREAS: Risk management, financial innovation, options
  and derivatives.
  CASE SETTING: 2000, U.S.


  In October 2000, the chief financial officer of Pacific
  Northwest Electric (PNW) is considering whether to use weather
  derivatives to reduce the weather-related risk in the volume of
  megawatt hours (MWh) sold.

  The (A) case may be used to stimulate student discussion of
  how the derivative contracts work, why one might want or not
  want to take such a contract, and how one would decide whether
  to use the weather protection. No prior exposure to options or
  derivatives is needed for this discussion; indeed, the case may
  be used as an introduction to options.

  The (B) case involves valuing the available contracts and
  deciding, which, if any, is the best contract for PNW.
  Spreadsheet simulation can be used to determine the probability
  distribution of the payout of the contract and the probability
  distribution for the net operating contribution including the
  contract payout, which is the basis for comparing alternatives.
  It is instructive for the students to think about what would be
  the ideal contract to reduce exposure to the greatest intent.
  This pushes students towards the optimal hedge ratio.

  Specific learning objectives of these cases include these:

  - to expose students to the cutting edge in financial
    innovation

  - to illustrate the use of options to reduce business risk

  - to challenge the students to value options where the
    Black-Scholes model cannot be used, and simulation can be
    readily employed

  - to experience the perspective of top management in risk
    management activities.
