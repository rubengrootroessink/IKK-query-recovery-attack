Subject:	Re: Meeting with Bob Williams

Vince - - In the last hour, one of my partners has raised an issue about our representation of another client engaged in a significant transaction with Enron, and whether my proposed representation of you would require the consent of that client.  We are trying to sort it out as we speak.  I am hopeful that the issue will be resolved satisfactorily in the next hour, and that I will be on an airplane this evening (albeit later than planned).  In the off chance that we are unable to resolve the issue today, however, and it becomes necessary to postpone my trip, let's hold off setting up a specific time to meet with Bob Williams.

I will call you later this afternoon, as soon as I have further information.

Walt,

I have set up a meeting with Bob Williams,
Enron lawyer, to discuss the issue
of indemnification. The meeting is at 8:30, old Enron building.
Let's meet in the lobby of the building (the old building,
the bigger one) at 8:15.

Please, confirm.

Vince
