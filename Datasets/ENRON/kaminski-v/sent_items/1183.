Dear Vince,
Thank you for sparing some time to talk with me about the opportunities at
Enron.
As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I
am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the
opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of
my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project
with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing
Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in
understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a
fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a
project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating
environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy
markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in
honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a
significant insight into the global trading industry.

I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our
conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and
research.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Best Regards
Prakash
