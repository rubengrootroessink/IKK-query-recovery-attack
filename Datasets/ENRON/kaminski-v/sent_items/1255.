Vince-

Are you guys still working on that "project" to provide content via EOL?
The reason I'm asking is we have developed a particular technology to
deliver fundamentals data via web-based applets, and we could probably
talk to the vendor about a larger license to permit its dissemination
this way. There would have to be disclaimers, and it might not work
because of the liability, but I did want to let you know we have a neat
technology to permit people to visualize data. Let me know if you want
to talk about it.
