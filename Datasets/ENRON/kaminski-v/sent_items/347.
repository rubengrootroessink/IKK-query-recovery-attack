Vince,
I noticed in reviewing the e-mail list I incorrectly spelled your e-mail.  We
are really delighted to have you on the Energy Committee and look forward to
your important participation.
Regards,
Lane

I want to thank you along with Dean Warga, Bob Casey, and Dr. Praveen Kumar
for an engaging and successful inaugural meeting of the Energy Committee.
From our perspective, we achieved the key input and decisions desired of you.
 We hope that you saw the meeting as worthwhile and that it met your needs as
well. Any feedback that you have for me would be most appreciated.

I want to highlight the key outcomes and ask for your quick response on any
concerns.  First, the name which received the greatest endorsement and
therefore our choice was the Global Energy Management Institute, which as an
accronym would shorten to GEMI.  As discussed, the full name would actually
be the University of Houston's Global Energy Management Institute at the
Bauer College of Business.  Obviously, most references would be the Global
Energy Management Institute or GEMI.

Second, there was very valuable input and support on the concept of a
"partnership" having four fee based levels ($100k, $50k, $25k, and $5k).  We
will work at a first draft proposal of value received for those four levels
and send to you next week.  As suggested, we will not have an entrance fee
and we will think about some discounts or offsets with perhaps a minimum
amount not offsetable. Another suggestion was to call the levels something
which related to Energy.  We would offer up the Wood Level at $5k, the Coal
Level at $25K,  the Oil&Gas Level at $50k, and Nuclear at $100k.  Look for
your feedback here.

Attached is the outcome of the sub group selection.  We are thoroughly
delighted that your participation is very balanced which should strenghten
the overall results.  Hopefully next week we will be sending out separate
e-mails to the three sub groups seeking your detailed input.

I mentioned that we would like to schedule the next meeting of the Energy
Committee in January.  Please look at your calendars and let me know your
availability for the following dates:  Jan 10, Jan 15, Jan 23 and Jan 24.  We
will chose the one that the most members can attend.   As noted, the agenda
for that meeting for our discussion will be the sub group results plus an
important dialogue on Marketing (including alliances).

Again, thanks so much for your participation

Lane
