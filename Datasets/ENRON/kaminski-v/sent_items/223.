Hi Vince,
 
Hope my mail reaches you. I am really sorry that the Enron saga is coming to such an end. I have closely followed developments through the press. Personally, I continue to be proud to be associated with the company and more specifically with the Dabhol Project. I have learned a lot in my three years at Enron and hope to continue to learn from the experiences of its people.
 
I saw you at Rice a few weeks back, but you were very busy and was hence unable to talk with you. I am leaving for India tomorrow and will return only in the second week of January. Its probably obvious, but the enron debacle has affected my future career options and also does severely constrain me in more ways than one. Hope the lunch offer still stands open, will take you up on it in January. 
 
I hope the holidays prove to be a time of relaxation for you and your family. Wish you a merry christmas and Best wishes for the new year to you and your family.
 
Regards,
Anshuman
