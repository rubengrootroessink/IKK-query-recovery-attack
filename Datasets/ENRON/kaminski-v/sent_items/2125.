Rita,

I have postponed all the hiring decisions till late August - early September.
We can revisit Joao's case at this point. We shall have better information about the 
space in the new building we can count on and the time of the move.

We appreciate Joao interest in Enron.

Vince Kaminski

Vince,

Thought this might be a better form of communication since it has been so
difficult for us to communicate via telephone.

As I had mentioned this morning, Joao Neves is quite interested in joining
your team and I would like to ask you, if you feel it appropriate at this
time, for Joao to re-visit you and your team to discuss, possibly more in
depth issues.

Please advise.

Kind regards,

Rita DeClaris
