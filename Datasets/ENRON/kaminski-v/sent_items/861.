Stinson, 
I would like to give a talk at INFORMS 2001 Hawaii (http://www.informs.org/Conf/Hawaii2001) Maui, Hawaii - June 17-20, 2001. I will talk about Online Auction that I am working on with my professors.
http://www.informs.org/Conf/Hawaii2001/TALKS/WB07.html
Hope it is OK to go.
Thanks, 
-Chonawee
