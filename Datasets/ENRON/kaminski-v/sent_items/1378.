   Vince this is terrible news - I paid a $1300 registration fee out of my
   research budget to get you registered - this was nonrefundable.  I hope
   that I can get Mr Lu substituted.  Can you please confirm that Mr Lu
   will be coming if we can arrange a substitution?

   Mac

   Greeting from Brazil.

   Thanks for the invitation. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my
   participation
   at the conference. My associate, Zimin Lu, who has an extensive
   experience in modeling real options will go the conference in my place
   and he can participate in the panel discussion if it's OK with you.

   Vince
