Eric,

Do you have a list of the members of the Research Group who have/have not  contributed so far?
I am afraid that you may have an outdated list and a list including some temporary summer employees/
interns who cannot contribute even if they want (they are not in the system).
I think our participation may a bit higher.

Vince
