Subject:=09Livelink Add User Template

Hello everyone:

In order to add you to the Livelink being developed by Sandeep, they need y=
our user NT login name.  I am
attaching the excel spreadsheet and you can either go in and add it by your=
 name, or call me and let me
know what it is.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hello.  Creating users in Livelink requires the NT login name.  This is pro=
bably the most important piece of this task, without it, we would not be ab=
le to create the users in Livelink.  Please provide their NT logins.

Thank you!

Moyeaz/Analyn,

Her is the updated list of everyone in the Research Group.  Shirley has com=
piled this in record time. =20

I am assuming that you will be able to get their user IDs since, short of a=
sking each person, we have no way of getting them.  Please let me know if a=
nything else is needed to set everyone up with accounts for Livelink.

Regards,
Sandeep.
