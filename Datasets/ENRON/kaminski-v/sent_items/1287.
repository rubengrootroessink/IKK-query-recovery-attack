Lexi,
 
I agree, this is not an appropriate time to be bringing students in from the outside for Enron-focused projects.  I don't think it hurts us at all since we've never participated in the past.  
 
Please let me know if you need help on the messaging to UT.
 
Thanks,
Billy

Billy and Traci:
 
I think I am going to decline the opportunity to sponsor this practicum at UT since they need a commitment from us to define a "project topic" for the students to research.  They have also contacted Vince Kaminski as a prospective contact, so I will copy him on this decision if you approve.
 
Thanks!

Lexi-
 
For CEFER trustees, there is no financial commitment required to sponsor a practicum.  The only potential expense would be to cover travel expenses for the team if you want them to make their presentation in person to management in Houston.  The main commitment we need is a person who will define a project topic for the team and be available for periodic conference calls throughout the semester.  The project sponsor should help guide the team in their research, and provide any internal company data or other contacts within the company who may have information relevant to the topic.  If you feel that a non-disclosure agreement is necessary due the nature of the project topic, you may request that the students sign one.  Dr. Ronn is the faculty advisor for each team, so students use him as a point of reference as well.
 
Some potential benefits of sponsoring a practicum include:

Additional exposure to MBA students interested in pursuing careers in energy.  The project sponsor will get a close look at a handful of students in action (mostly 1st year MBA's), and can identify potential target recruits for internships or full-time hires later on. 
"Free" research.  Depending on how you structure the project, the students' results and presentation should be useful to your organization.  For example, I did a practicum with El Paso last year, and we studied their use of Master Limited Partnerships as a vehicle for their midstream business.  We were able to research in depth some questions they wanted to answer but didn't have the time to do themselves.  Our research confirmed some of their "hunches", and management was very pleased with the results.

The level of interest in practicums among 1st year students is quite high compared to last year (over 40 students responded so far).  So, we would be excited to have Enron as a sponsor this year. (If you would like to sponsor more than 1 team, we would certainly welcome that as well!)
 
I have attached the original practicum document with some more details in case you do not have a copy.  Let me know if you have any other questions I can answer.
 
Thanks,
Stephen

Stephen:
 
I am interested in learning more about the sponsorship.  What does a sponsorship cost?  What benefits do sponsors receive?  What activities are involved?
 
Please give me some additional details.  I will take care of circulating them to Traci.
 
Thanks!

Mr. Kaminski- 

I am an officer in the Energy Finance Group in the University of Texas MBA program, and I am in charge of coordinating our Energy Finance Practicum Program.  I would like to know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring one or more student teams in an energy finance practicum next semester.  I have attached a document with a description of the program, and details on what the level of commitment is for a sponsor (no financial commitment is required).  Sponsorships can only be given by the eight trustees of CEFER (the Center for Energy Finance Education & Research).  Dr. Ronn serves as a faculty advisor for each team.

Lexi Elliott suggested that you and Traci would be the appropriate people to contact for such a request.  Could you let me know if Enron would be interested in sponsoring a team next semester, and who my point of contact should be in the event that you would like to participate?  Feel free to contact me if you would like some more details on the program.

Thanks, 
Stephen Jensen
