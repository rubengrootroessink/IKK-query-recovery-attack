Vince:

Based on what I learn from you, Rakesh, and Gordon, I have put together this set of quick notes for David, Cassandra and Rudi.  Please take a look at your convenience.  I know that I have not touched a lot of details.  But I am hoping to just paint a big picture on the possible impact of the Raptor structures.  

Thanks,

Ding.
