Hi,

We have a club member who is planning a breeding soon.  Her name is Jan
Nuzzo, her numbers are 281-497-8033 or jannuzzo@nushow.com.

There is a litter now in Little Rock, Ark.  The breeder is a member of our
club here in town.  Lu Hart--numbers are 501-888-7333 or Escher321@aol.com.
She had a bigger litter then expected.  Contact her now if interested, they
will go quickly.

Good Luck,
Doris
