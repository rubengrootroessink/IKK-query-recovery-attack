Enclosed please find your roster for your class this Spring.  Of course,
you can plan on these numbers fluctuating by a few as students add and drop
over the next few weeks.  Will keep you updated.

Let me know if you would like the excel file with their e-mail
addresses.  I would be happy to send that to you.
