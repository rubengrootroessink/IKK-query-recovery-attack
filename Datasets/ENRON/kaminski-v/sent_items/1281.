Stan,

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to
offer the help of my group in providing analytical support in evaluating different options
that are open to us.

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.


Vince Kaminski
