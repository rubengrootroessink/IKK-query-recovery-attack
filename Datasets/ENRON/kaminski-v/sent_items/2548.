Dear Shirley,

Following our conversation, I am responsible for subscriptions to Credit
magazine. As Mr Kaminski's subscription has recently lapsed, if he wishes to
re-subscribe to Credit Magazine with a 15% discount, simply reply to this
email including his full invoice details and I can recommence instantly.

1 years subscription (15%) discount: $1019.15

This offer is only available until the end of this month.

Please do not hesitate in contacting me if you have any queries.

Kind regards,

Simon Sanderson
