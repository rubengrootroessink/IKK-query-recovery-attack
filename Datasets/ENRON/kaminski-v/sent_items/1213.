Ed,

Thanks for your message. I appreciate your kind words
and your concern.

I cannot open the file you sent me. Can you resend it as a .doc
or .pdf file?

Dear Vince,

We've been asked by our clients for our view on Enron's situation and
outlook. I feel a need to respond to these requests and have written the
attached one-pager.

I would like to offer you -- my primary contact at Enron -- an opportunity
to review and correct any factual errors. Interpretations, of course, remain
my responsibility.

I reiterate my long-standing admiration for the Company and all it has
contributed. I have had an opportunity to discuss the prospect with people
in policy positions and desire first of all to do no harm by misstatement
and second to be as helpful as I can be.

If you choose not to comment I will understand that as well, but would
appreciate some indication on your part. I will of course keep our
correspondence on this between us in any event. Thanks.

Ed
