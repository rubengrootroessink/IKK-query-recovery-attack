Hi Vince,

I hope all is well with you!

As for my coordinates.....I am trading (position trading--
futures)....primarily soybeans, 30-year bonds, swiss franc,
and British Pound......I observe the charts after the markets close...put in
my orders accordingly .....and sit and wait for
confirmation and/or for stop orders to be elected....:)...I continue
watching the gold charts.....eventually, that market will
wake up again!   Vince, I am curious of your fundamental analysis of the
currency, and/or equity markets...

Since most of my chart analysis is performed after the markets close....I
have extra time to explore other business opportunities.....at this time, I
am working on a initiative, to import nurses from India to the U.S.!  A
friend of mine, from New Delhi, has asked that I work with her on this
project.  She is talking w/Duke University, as well as the University of
North Carolina Nursing School to collaborate w/her, in India, and provide
their curriculum in India....We are talking to hospitals throughout the
U.S., and are finding an interest in Indian recruits.  Of the foreign nurses
now entering the U.S., the majority are Filipinos.  Did you know about the
shortage of nurses here in the U.S.?

Hello to Mike.....and also....How is Maureen?

Keep in touch......Anytime, you stop in Chicago, call me...312-643-1910....I
live very close to the Enron office on Michigan Avenue..

Take care,
Tricia
