Subject:	Thank You

Research Group-

I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell each of you "thanks" for a wonderful ride.  It has been such a pleasure getting to know you, and working with you.  I do not think that I have ever been exposed to such a talented and extraordinary group of individuals.  I am sorry that I have not been around these past two weeks- I have been running wild though.  If I can ever do anything for any of you, please feel free to email me at alabbe4@yahoo.com.

Best Wishes for your continued success. . . I know that you will not have any problems though because all of you are "Super Stars"!!

Thanks again,
Anne

Buca di Bepo could not take 34 people tonight so we have moved the dinner to NICK'S PASTA PLACE, 4057 BELLAIRE BLVD., HOUSTON, TX; PHONE:  713-661-0025.
