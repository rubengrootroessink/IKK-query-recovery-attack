Vince, 

We have backup tapes for deleted email.  David Cohen is aware of this and in fact we are following Wilmer Cutler's advice on all of these issues.  Britt's message is in response to a recently-received subpoena and is a precaution until we can speak with the Wilmer lawyers.  

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks. 

Bob

Britt, 

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than 
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite 
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates, 
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem. 

I hope you can look into. 

Vince

        For purposes of complying with outstanding subpoenas, effective immediately, please do not delete any e-mail from the Enron server until further notice.
