==================================================================
RiskNews Update - week ending 27/4/2001
http://www.risknews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

A week full of news for the risk management and derivatives professions
culminated in the RiskNews exclusive that World Bank treasurer and chief
investment officer Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss has stepped down to become
a partner of Carlyle Group, the Washington-based private equity investor.
Beschloss oversaw a $48 billion investment portfolio at the World Bank, as
well as its $12 billion pension fund. A successor to Beschloss, who leaves
in May, has yet to be named.

The BIS, which issued a number of reports this week, found that financial
firms using one-day value-at-risk (VAR) models could be seriously
underestimating their exposure to market risk. The BIS said
liquidity-adjusted VAR models, which estimate risk using holding periods
determined by the length of time that would be required to unwind
positions, produce, on average, five times higher estimates of risk than
standard VAR.

In the operational risk world, two of the leading players PwC and NetRisk
have tied their resources to create a joint initiative called OpVantage
that will be headed by Dan Mudge, a co-founder of NetRisk. It aims to take
advantage of the introduction of an operational risk charge as stipulated
in the Basle II capital accord proposals.

Meanwhile, the value of non-performing loans held by Japanese financial
institutions is ?151.1 trillion ($1.25 trillion), representing about 30%
of gross domestic product and 28% of total loans, according to the latest
figures released by the Democratic Party of Japan

On the technology front, GFInet's online FX options broking system is
likely to be postponed until May, due to delays in connecting clients to
the system, the firm said; while BNP Paribas and Commonwealth Bank
invested in BondsInAsia and asiabondportal.com, respectively.
