Peter,

Thanks for your words of comfort. The higher you fly, the harder you crash.
Books will be written about this company.

I don't worry too much about myself. I have about fifty employees in
Houston and 10 in London who need help. I am trying to find jobs
for them using my contacts in the industry. 

Personally, I have many options that have come up in the last few days but everything is
on hold for the time being till uncertainty is resolved here  at Enron.

Vince

Dear Vince: hope this reaches you. Just wanted to say how sorry I am about
what's happened to Enron. I hope things work out for you -- I'm sure with
all your brilliance they will. But it's so hard to believe that a company as
revered as Enron can unwind in such a short space of time. It makes you
re-think a lot of assumptions about how companies run and how markets work.

Enron is big news over here. On the main BBC t.v. news last night, Enron was
the third story, after Afghanistan and the memorial service at Westminster
Abbey for the British killed on Sept 11 (which a lot of us attended with the
Bristow, Bennett and other families).

Anyway, please keep in touch.

All the best, Peter
