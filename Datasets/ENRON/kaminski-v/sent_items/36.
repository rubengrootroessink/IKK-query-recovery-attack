Subject:	[JGSADJ] Enron Meltdown Lecture

Prof. Bala Dharan delivers a special lecture on "The Enron Meltdown:  Was it an Accounting Failure, A Business Failure or a Regulatory Failure? What Can We Learn?" from 7 to 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, January 31, at McMurtry Auditorium in Duncan Hall. 
 
Dharan will discuss various issues and address these questions: Were there red flags? Could we have spotted problems last year? Were there problems with the application of accounting standards or with the standards themselves? What were the accounting issues with SPEs and related parties? What can we learn from this sad event that has destroyed $80 billion and robbed thousands of employees of their jobs and life savings?
