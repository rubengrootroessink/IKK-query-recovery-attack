Billy,

I have received an invitation to speak to a graduating class of
the Quantitative and Computational Finance program at Georgia Tech.
The URL is included in the message below.

Would you be interested in arranging for  a presentation at this school
about the A/A Program, coinciding with my visit?

Vince

Vince,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, I am attaching below the URL for
our QCF program here at Georgia Tech for your corporate recruiting folks.
http://www.qcf.gatech.edu/
It will be great if we could have your recruiting people meet with our
first graduating class of the QCF program.

Regarding your visit, we'd be glad to cover the coach airfare and
lodging.  How about the first week of October, say on either 10/2 or 10/4,
or the last week of October, say 10/30?  The arrangement would be that you
come in on the evening of a Monday or a Wednesday and give a seminar on a
Tuesday or a Thursday.  Please let me know what works best for
you.  Thanks.

Shijie
