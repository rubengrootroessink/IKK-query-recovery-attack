Ken,

We called Tom Limpers and talked about the services his company can offer to
Enron. It seems that they don't have any great product sitting on the shelf. It's rather
a group of university professors who are ready to offer their brain power to solve different
problems of interest to potential customers. 

We talked about different potential projects and suggested in what ways they could
demonstrate their problem solving skills before we go into more detailed discussions.

They promised to get back to us in a few days.

Vince
