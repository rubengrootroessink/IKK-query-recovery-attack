Stinson,

Let's talk about it. It seems like an open personality clash developing 
for the first time in the history of the group.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on Exotica documentation ?

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,
