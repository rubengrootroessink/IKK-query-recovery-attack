Gil,

Thanks for your message. I stay in touch with many academic centers and
shall be glad to bring up to your attention other potential candidates. 
I often hear about academics who contemplate moving to this
part of the country.

Vince

Vince -

The finance faculty and I have reviewed the vita of Richard McMinn.  He
appears to be a very good person but we are attempting to find someone who
is already or has the potential to be a major star to fill the Enron
Chair.  McMinn is not at that level in our judgment even though I am sure
that he would be a good person to have on a faculty.  At our stage of
growth and development, we need to fill tenured positions with extreme care
and with individuals who are or have star potential.

Thanks for bringing him to our attention.
