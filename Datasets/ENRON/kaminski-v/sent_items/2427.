Liz,

Frank Wolak can meet Greg and me in his office and  for dinner Thursday night,
August 16,  at Stanford.
 
Can Greg fly to San Francisco or San Jose  from his Asset Tour trip in late afternoon on that day?


If Greg can get a co plane to go San Francisco on Thursday, we could  fly together to Santa Fe 
on Friday morning, August 17. Norman Packard can meet us on that
day. I could go to San Francisco Thursday morning on a commercial flight. 


Vince
