Vince,

I hope you do not mind that I contact you at work, but in light of the
situation with Enron, I wanted to make you aware of a senior level
Quantitative Analyst position that we currently have available.   If this
position is of interest to you, I welcome a call or email from you.

Best regards,
Melissa
