Hi Vince, I can't believe this is actually it?what a waste.  I have so enjoyed working with you over the years.  You are one of the reasons Enron was a great place to be.

Thank you for offering to be a reference for me.  I really appreciate your support.

Below, I've listed my personal info so we can stay in touch.

Take care and all the very best,
Andrea
