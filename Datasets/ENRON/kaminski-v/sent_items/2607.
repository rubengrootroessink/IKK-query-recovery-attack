Good morning everyone:
=20
Lance Cunningham had this information and wanted me to forward this to you
This is important!

Here's a  public service announcement... please let me know if you'd prefer
to "opt out" of any future announcements



Listen to all the options.  1 is for 2 years and 3 is permanently.


THIS LAW TOOK EFFECT ON JULY 1 AND YOU HAVE 60 DAYS TO "OPT OUT"
I called and the message explains what you need to do.

IMPORTANT

Just wanted to let you know in case you haven't already  heard, the four
major credit bureaus in the US. will be allowed, starting  July 1,
to release your credit info, mailing addresses, phone  numbers.....to
anyone who requests it. If you would like to 'opt out' of this release of
info,  you can call 1-888-567-8688. It only takes a couple of minutes to
do, and you can take care of anyone else in the household while  making
only one call, you'll just need to know their social security number. Be
sure to listen closely, the first opt out is only  for two years, make sure
you wait until they prompt you to press '3' on  your keypad to opt out for
good.
