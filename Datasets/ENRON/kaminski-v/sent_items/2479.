Hi Witek,
     It was really a pleasure to talk to you after so many years.  Whenever
you have a chance to come to New York, please let me know so maybe you
could come to spend a few days in my home in Greenwich or I could go to New
York to meet you there.

     Thank you for your help regarding book references, and also for a
possible reference regarding a quant to cover energy trading in Market Risk
Management Department that I run at AIG Trading Group.

     Please say the best greeting to all your family, talk to you soon.

Richard
