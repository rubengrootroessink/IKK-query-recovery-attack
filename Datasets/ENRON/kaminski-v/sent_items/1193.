Please take just a few minutes to read the following message and then forwa=
rd to others in your group.

Once again Mike McConnell has volunteered to be the chair of the Juvenile D=
iabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) walk.  This year the walk will be held o=
n Sunday, October 28, 2001, at Greenspoint Mall.
=20
As some of you may know, Mike has diabetes and JDRF is an organization that=
 is very important to him.  There are two types of diabetes and Mike has Ty=
pe 1, insulin-dependent diabetes which is also known as Juvenile Diabetes. =
 The other type of diabetes is Type 2, adult-onset diabetes that can often =
be controlled with a combination of diet, exercise and oral medication.  Ev=
ery day Mike must prick his finger to test his blood sugar at least 7 times=
, in addition to giving himself at least 3 or 4 injections of insulin.  Jus=
t think of it, at least 10 times a day Mike has to stick himself with a nee=
dle to manage his disease.  I don't know about you, but I am a wimp if I ha=
ve to get a shot just once every few years and I can't even begin to imagin=
e what it must be like to stick yourself over 70 times in just one week!  B=
ut for Mike it is not just one day or one week, it is every day of every we=
ek for the rest of his life -- until a cure is found.  Diabetics can never =
take a break from their disease.  It requires constant management of their =
food intake, monitoring of their blood sugar and the administration of the =
proper amount of insulin.  If diabetes is not properly managed it can lead =
to kidney disease or failure, blindness, heart disease, amputations, among =
other complications.
=20
I wanted you all to know that I have volunteered to help Mike in his effort=
s with the JDRF walk again this year.  I am serving on the steering committ=
ee and I plan to walk again this year to raise funds to help find a cure fo=
r this terrible disease.  I am doing this to support Mike, but I also have =
a personal interest in doing whatever I can to help find a cure.  My husban=
d has adult-onset diabetes and we lost his mom and her three sisters all to=
 diabetes and diabetes-related diseases several years ago.  In addition, I =
have an uncle and a cousin that both have juvenile diabetes.
=20
I am sending this message to ask you to join our team for the JDRF walk thi=
s year.  It would mean a lot to me (and to Mike) to have support from the p=
eople in our Enron Global Markets organization, as well as people from prev=
ious groups we have worked with, along with other friends throughout Enron.
=20
Some of you receiving this message have already signed up and I want to tak=
e this opportunity to say thank you very much!  For those of you that have =
not yet signed up, please consider one of the following three opportunities=
 that are available to give your support to this important effort:
1.      Team Leader.  The team leaders help solicit walkers and handle the =
collecting and reporting of funds raised by their group of walkers.  Based =
on the donations raised by your group, you may also be eligible for prizes =
available only to team leaders.  If you are interested in becoming a team l=
eader, please contact me right away so that I may get the team leader infor=
mation and materials to you.=20
2.      Walkers.  If you want to sign up to walk and raise funds for JDRF, =
I will make sure that you get on one of our teams -- just sign up!  The JDR=
F walk is a very fun event with music, entertainment and great food.  All w=
alkers are asked to raise at least $25 in donations and will receive a grea=
t T-shirt to wear the day of the walk.=20
3.      Supporters.  If it just is not possible for you to join us for the =
walk on October 28th, then please sign up as a supporter by sending a retur=
n e-mail with your pledge amount and you will be contacted later in October=
 for collection of the donation.=20
The bottom line is raising money to support research to find a cure!  The J=
uvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is very well managed and for every dol=
lar that is donated to JDRF, over 85 cents goes directly to research.  In a=
ddition, this year Enron will match all donations dollar for dollar.
=20
Thank you for your support, time and efforts.  And please, let's Walk to Cu=
re Diabetes!
