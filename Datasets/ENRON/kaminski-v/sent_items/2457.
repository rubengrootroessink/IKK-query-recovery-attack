Norman,

My apologies for the delay in firming up the date of our trip.

Ay you may know, we had an explosion at our Teesside plant in
Northern England. The accident coincided with Greg's trip to London
and Greg got immersed in all the problems related to it. 

I hope to have a final decision on Monday morning when he comes back 
to Houston.


Vince

Vince,

Thanks for the package of material.

On our side, Aug 24 is looking better than Aug 17, but we can do Aug 17 if
it is much better for you.

    Best,
    Norman
