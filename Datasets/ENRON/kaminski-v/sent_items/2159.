Hi Julie,

Rice asked me to teach another course on energy derivatives and I plan to use the 
book as the main source. You can inform them that they should keep the books in stock
and probably order a few more copies.

I am in London right now and will stay here for a few more days. Swamped
with work as usual. I was on the road for the last 2 weeks.

The tropical storm unleashed the fury on my neighborhood (20 inches in  one night)
but we survived without major problems. The only problem I had was an overflowing 
swimming pool (it took 45 minutes to go  from a comfortable slack to a full condition).

Vince

Vince,
 
Hope you are well.  
 
We've been in contact with Rice University's bookshop and they informed us  that they have a few books left over from the course.  We told them  originally that if they didn't sell them all we would take them back.  We  would rather have them sent over to you as complimentary copies if that's  OK with you?
 
What's new?  Busy summer so far?  Hope that the storm didn't  cause you any problems.
 
Julie
