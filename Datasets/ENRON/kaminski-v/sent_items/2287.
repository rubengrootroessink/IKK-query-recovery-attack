Billy,

We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.

He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
complain that the question is too detailed.


He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).


Vince

Billy,

We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying
to leave a very good company after a relatively short time.

Vince,

This person looks "scary smart", and when I see that, I always think of you.  Please let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you,
Billy
