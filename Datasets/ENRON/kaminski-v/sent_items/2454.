Dear Colleagues,

Today is my last day at Enron and I would like to say how much I appreciate your making my time such an exciting experience. I have learned a lot during the summer and I consider myself honored for having the opportunity to work with you.

My permanent email address is kf2@andrew.cmu.edu. Please stay in touch.

May the Force be with you,

Kyriakos
