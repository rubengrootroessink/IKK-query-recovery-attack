Dear Director Kaminski,

I am an MBA student at Rice University. Through our director Peter Veruki's
introduction, I expressed my interest in having a summer intern or part-time
job at your department by email and by talking with you in telephone in
June. Now I am taking my summer intern at JP Morgan Chase. Since your
department is called the development brain of Enron, I am still very
interested in having a learning opportunity to work part-time under your
direction. My updated resume is attached. I will call you next Monday
morning to follow up. Thank you for your consideration.

Guang (Alex) Yu
