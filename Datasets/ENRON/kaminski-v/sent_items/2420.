Dear Mr. Strickland,
We co-operate with EPRM, and  publish a few of their articles from time to
time on our web. Currently I  am looking for stories in any of the following
areas;
* Back office  management
* Technical analysis, Power analysis
* Financial power  trading
* Power derivatives
Dawn Briddon at EPRM mentioned that a  few contributory articles provided by
you cover these areas, however she  can not pass these articles on without
prior consent.
Would it be ok for  us to publish these articles?
Most sincerely
Ralf  Larsson
Partner & Web  Manager
