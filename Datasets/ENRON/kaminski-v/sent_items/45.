Vince:

I received this email from Kevin - you may want to answer it.
I do not know exactly what to tell him.

I was wondering if Vince was still on the lecture circuit.  I recently gave
a talk at the Univeristy of Michigan, and thought that Vince might want to
do the same.  They have a financial engineering program, and even if he is
not actively recruiting, it would give him a chance to look the program
over.
