David,

The card for Vince Kaminski has been activated - here is the IP address:  166.149.0.244.  I have submitted a Change Control for access through the firewall and IRM has approved Vince's request.  Please notify the appropriate technician at once.  Thanks!

Vince:  Thank you for your patience and cooperation through this process.  You will contacted by a technician as soon as he/she is ready to install your aircard.  FYI - your customer account number is 26433.  Thanks!
