Candice,
 
Thanks for your kind offer.
Please, get in touch with us when you come to Houston. 
We may not be around much longer.
 
Vince

Hi Vince,

How are you? I will be back in Houston for December break as well as the

month of January. If the group is in need of any help, I will be more than

happy to work with or without pay in the month of January.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Candice
