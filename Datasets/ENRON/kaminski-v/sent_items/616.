Just wanted to get an update on how the tiger team program has been going and if any of the student are going to be joining us for the summer.  Could we sit down for 15-20 minutes sometime this week?  I'll be travelling tomorrow, but could meet anytime that works on Wednesday afternoon.  Please let me know what time is best for you.
