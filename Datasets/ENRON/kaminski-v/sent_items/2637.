Enron impact takes its toll, FI lenders scrips plunge on bourses, Sharad Mi=
stry & Laxmikant Khanvilkar=20

THREE major financial institutions - ICICI, IDBI and IFCI - are witnessing =
an increased selling wave on the bourses over the past few trading sessions=
, thanks to their collective exposure in the controversial Enron-promoted $=
3 billion Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The total exposure in DPC of these FI=
s, and a few banks like the State Bank of India and Canara Bank, including =
foreign currency guarantees, works out to over Rs 5,500 crore. Little wonde=
r, therefore, that investors fear more red ink splashed over the balance sh=
eets of the FIs and are hurrying to move out of their investments in these =
FIs.=20

The stock prices of all the three FIs have been sliding. While the stock pr=
ice of IDBI and IFCI have touched new lows of Rs 16 and Rs 2.90, respective=
ly, that of ICICI is still holding at around Rs 50-55 levels. Early this mo=
nth, IDBI was quoted at Rs 19.90, IFCI at Rs 3.60 and ICICI at Rs 59.30. IC=
ICI, however, had touched Rs 51 on August 9, a new low from previous levels=
. This clearly indicates that, plagued by the rising share of non-performin=
g loans (NPLs) to total assets of all the three FIs, the share prices of th=
ese FIs have came under severe pressure.=20

Analysts tracking the banking and FI counters say that the sliding trend is=
 feared to be continued over the days and weeks ahead, especially because o=
f the tightening of the non-performing assets guidelines by the Reserve Ban=
k of India (RBI). Moreover, the kind of trading activity witnessed at these=
 counters is alarming. While the volume of share trade is substantial, ther=
e is a sharp fall in the stock prices of these stocks. Quite clearly, these=
 are no good indicators, at least for the time being. However, these compan=
ies disbursal/approvals to DPC are well within the stipulated RBI norms, i.=
e., 15 per cent of total disbursal/ approvals.=20

For example, ICICI's gross NPL as of March 2001, stands at a whopping Rs 5,=
988 crore. Power sector leads the approval and disbural list of ICICI at Rs=
 6,424 crore and Rs 2,400 crore, respectively. Its exposure in the power se=
ctor, which stood at Rs 8,531 crore or 11 per cent of the total exposure of=
 Rs 77,279 crore, has been on the decline. Last year they stood at 11.6 per=
 cent of Rs 65,495 crore. On the other hand, IDBI's stock price is on the s=
lide since the beginning of this month. It is currently quoting at Rs 16. T=
he counter is experiencing heavy volumes with daily volumes being in the ra=
nge of 35,000 plus. The situation is worse for IFCI which is quoting below =
par for quite sometime now. Further, the scrip has been losing steam since =
August 2, when it was quoting at Rs 4. Currently, it is quoting below Rs 3.=

FIs initiate search for buyers for Enron stake, Samik Dasgupta & Soma Baner=
jee=20

THE SEARCH for getting a buyer for Enron's equity in the Dabhol power proje=
ct has started with financial institutions initiating discussions with pote=
ntial buyers. FIs have been entrusted with the responsibility of preparing =
a roadmap for Enron's exit and finding a solution to pending MSEB payments.=
 The first job for FIs is to determine the actual cost required to complete=
 the Dabhol project. Although, about 96 per cent of the project is complete=
, the stoppage of work for the past few weeks has led to cancellation of co=
ntracts and possibilities of the cost escalating. With Enron having already=
 announced its unwillingness to pump in additional resources, the new inves=
tor will not only have to pay for the equity but also fund the project's co=
mpletion. Speaking to ET, finance secretary Ajit Kumar said: "FIs have been=
 told to work out details about the prices that each of the interested buye=
r can offer for the Dabhol project. Since it is totally buyer driven, FIs w=
ill have to take this into account while holding their discussions with the=
 potential buyers. Enron may demand any price but there have to be takers f=
or that too.'' Tata Power, Hindujas and some other leading industrial house=
s are interested in buying out Enron. FIs are going to talk individually to=
 all the interested companies, and the equity will be sold to the highest b=
idder, Kumar said.=20

According to FI sources involved with the Dabhol negotiations several angle=
s are being looked into as the matter is now complicated with Enron invokin=
g legal provisions. "The aim is to work out an out- of-court settlement to =
the issue. Valuation is not an issue as the project has a 25-year life cycl=
e,'' an official said. FI sources claimed that their role is that of a faci=
litator where they will try and bring the buyer and seller at a common poin=
t.FIs are also discussing with the Centre if it is possible for them to get=
 a cover for the second phase of the project. As of now, the first phase of=
 the project has been given the counter-guarantee while the promoters are p=
ushing for a similar cover to ensure payments.=20

Dabhol dispute unfortunate: Govt

THE GOVERNMENT on Monday described the dispute over the Enron-promoted Dabh=
ol Power Project as an `unfortunate' experience in foreign investment in th=
e country's infrastructure sector. ``Enron is a very unfortunate episode in=
 our experience with regard to inviting foreign investment in the crucial i=
nfrastructure sector and I wish it had never happened,'' minister of state =
for external affairs, Omar Abdullah said here. Nevertheless, the country's =
judiciary has decided a large number of cases in Enron's favour thereby pro=
ving its fair and independent nature, he added. Speaking after launching th=
e Confederation of Indian Industries International, the international arm o=
f the chamber, he said Indian industry has had enough protection and should=
 not ask for more. ``Unless we start looking outwardly and start tapping ne=
w markets abroad, our economy may not be able to achieve and grow to its po=
tential,'' Abdullah said.Indian missions abroad have to realise that their =
role is changing, he said it is now clear that economic diplomacy is integr=
al to foreign policy and a key determinant of a country's political and str=
ategic influence. He said the ministry of external affairs had also started=
 working on these lines and would make every possible effort to provide nec=
essary support to the country's business chambers and industry to position =
itself as a global player in the emerging global scenario.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
Power Play (Editorial)

With emotions running high over the Dabhol issue, Enron chairman Kenneth La=
y understandably showed great alacrity in denying reports that he has threa=
tened India with sanctions. In a letter to prime minister A B Vajpayee, Mr =
Lay clarified that Enron has not asked the US government to take any such a=
ction, and "is far from suggesting that we have decided to pursue these mec=
hanisms". Fair enough. But are the remarks as innocuous as Enron is making =
them out to be? Consider the facts. In the course of the controversial inte=
rview, Mr Lay said that if Enron was "squeezed'' to accept less than the co=
st incurred by it on building the power plant, that would amount to "exprop=
riation" by the Indian government. He added, for good measure, that US laws=
 prevent Washington from assisting countries which expropriate the property=
 of American companies. Significantly, an Enron team is slated to negotiate=
 with Indian lenders this week. One of the proposals doing the rounds is th=
at the financial institutions (FIs) buy out Enron's stake in Dabhol Power C=
ompany (DPC) and `warehouse' the shares till they can find another buyer. T=
he FIs, on their part, have indicated their willingness to slash interest r=
ates on the loans to DPC in a bid to make the project viable. But they're n=
ot willing to be the only ones to make a sacrifice. So, they're expected to=
 ask Enron to accept a discount of 25 to 35 per cent on its asking price. T=
he bargaining is likely to be tough, and savvy negotiators routinely try to=
 `psyche' the opposition beforehand. Mr Lay is known to be close to the Bus=
h administration. In the light of all this, is the timing of his remarks pu=
re coincidence?=20

Mr Lay, of course, has his own compulsions. While the Dabhol imbroglio has =
undoubtedly hurt India, Enron's armour is not without some chinks  which In=
dian negotiators would do well to note. The company faces accusations, whic=
h it denies, that it manipulated power prices in California. Its share pric=
e has fallen more than 55 per cent since the start of the year, and chief e=
xecutive officer Jeffrey Skilling recently quit abruptly, forcing Mr Lay to=
 take over the CEO's job as well. Unfortunately, Indian negotiators are unl=
ikely to use what should be their trump card  the Godbole Committee's obser=
vation that the Dabhol deal was a failure of governance at every step of th=
e decision-making process. Because doing so could embarrass too many promin=
ent people on both ends of the political spectrum. Even so, the Indian side=
 should hang tough. There have been suggestions that the LNG plant be spun =
off as a separate power centre, Enron let out its harbour facilities to oth=
er LNG importers, and the foreign currency loans be converted into rupee lo=
ans. These could form the basis of a fair deal that would allow both India =
and Enron to move on from the mess they have landed in. Hopefully, the Dabh=
ol debacle will also send out warning signals to both Indian politicians an=
d multinationals about the perils of non-transparent, negotiated deals, as =
opposed to a genuinely free market. If it does, and if India gets its act t=
ogether on power sector reforms, we may yet see some light at the end of th=
e long, long tunnel.

Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol, Sanjay Dutta=20

US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washington seekin=
g sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra government =
over the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project, even as domestic financial inst=
itutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by about $483 m=
illion (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion. In a letter to Prime Minister A=
tal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of which was available with The Tim=
es of India, Enron CEO Kenneth said: "A recent story in the Financial Times=
, which mischaracterised discussions with me, appears to have caused signif=
icant, unintended concern. Counter to the impression given in the story, I =
have not asked anyone in the US government to consider imposing sanctions."=
=20

Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicab=
ly by selling its stake. "Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power =
plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publishe=
r) I did factually explained the several possible options available, includ=
ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr=
otect its businesses. However, that is far from suggesting that we have dec=
ided to pursue these mechanisms," Lay said. "Our preferred approach approac=
h continues to be to resolve this issue amicably by selling our stake to In=
dian governmental and financial institutions," Lay said.=20

However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, "Without agreement =
on that, we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi=
ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement." Lay also sent copies of th=
e letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and power minister Suresh Prabh=
u. PTI ADDS: The IDBI-led FIs' consortium may increase their exposure to en=
able the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Company's equit=
y at a 25 per cent discount to its face value. The FIs are exploring a poss=
ibility of taking out offshore equity by investment institutions and utilit=
ies after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion, the report said.

 If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs, then IDBI=
's revised exposure would be at Rs 2,742 crore from existing Rs 2,121 crore=
, ICICI Rs 1,904 crore from Rs 1,473 crore, SBI Rs 2,261 crore from Rs 1,74=
9 crore, IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore f=
rom Rs 407 crore. "Even in the best case, the exposure requirements from do=
mestic institutions exceed the prudential exposure norms," the report quote=
d FI sources as saying. Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks=
 like IDFC, PFC, PNB, Union Bank, Bank of India among others would be accru=
ed through syndication. FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a =
backup for their exposure, the report quoted the sources as saying. Last we=
ek, the FIs had made a presentation to the finance ministry on a possible b=
ailout package for Dabhol. The proposals envisage concessions from stakehol=
ders, around 22.38 per cent concessional duty on the energy major's liquefi=
ed natural gas plant, a mega power project status and offset of custom duti=
es on LNG supply.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Tuesday, August 28, 2001
'Enron has not discussed Dabhol with Bush', Vidyadhar Date=20

Enron has denied that it had approached the U.S. government in an effort to=
 obtain sanctions against India in its dispute over the Dabhol power projec=
t. The denial came in the wake of a report in the Financial Times of Thursd=
ay which carried an interview with Enron chairperson Kenneth Lay. The repor=
t quoted Mr Lay as saying there are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. g=
overnment from providing any aid or assistance to India if it expropriated =
properties of U.S. companies. An Enron spokesperson said Mr Lay had not dis=
cussed the Dabhol dispute with President George Bush.=20

Meanwhile, the legal tussle between energy activists, the Maharashtra gover=
nment and Enron continues in India. The state government is preparing a fre=
sh affidavit with strong arguments against Enron in the case filed in the s=
upreme court by the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), which is the lab=
our wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and activist Abhay Meht=
a against the Dabhol project. The affidavit will make a strong case against=
 Enron unlike the previous statement filed by the earlier Shiv Sena-BJP dom=
inated state administration which was seen to be favourable to the controve=
rsial multinational.=20

The case has been pending in the supreme court for the past four years and =
since then major changes have taken place on the Enron front with more and =
more evidence emerging against the project. The government will rely substa=
ntially on the M.D. Godbole committee report which found a number of infirm=
ities in the project and expressed serious concern over the irregularities.=
 In the petition, CITU and Abhay Mehta, author of the book Power Play, whic=
h gives a detailed account of the the Enron drama, have challenged the clea=
rance given to the project by the Central Electricity Authority. They argue=
d that since the project had been renegotiated, it required a fresh review =
by the CEA. They described as false the claim of the previous government th=
at by holding renegotiations it had secured a good deal with lower tariff.=
=20

Anti-Enron activists feel that their stand has been vindicated by the recen=
t setbacks received by the company. Regarding the explosion in Enron's Tees=
ide plant in England which left three workers dead, Mr Pradyumna Kaul, ener=
gy activist, said Enron should have prepared a disaster management plan for=
 the Dabhol plant.Enron suffered a serious setback last week with the resig=
nation of chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, the drastic fall in stocks and =
the explosion in the Teeside plant. Mr Kenneth Lay, the company's chairpers=
on, is now trying to limit the damage by travelling in the U.S., explaining=
 the events to company divisions and trying to improve sentiment on Wall St=
reet. While Enron wants to exit from its operations in India, it is also re=
ported to be trying to wind up the wind turbine manufacturing business Acti=
vists are also encouraged by protests against privatisation of electricity =
being voiced in other parts of the world. Anti-privatisation activists inva=
ded the legislature building in the Brazilian state of Parana last week, pr=
otesting against the move to privatise the state's electric generation, tra=
nsmission and distribution utility.=20
