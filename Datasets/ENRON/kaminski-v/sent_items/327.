The January 23, 2002 All Faculty Meeting has been changed to accommodate a
Dean's Lecture on that date.

The revised information is as follows:

Monday, January 28
9:45 a.m. to 10:45 a.m.
Room 124

Please change this date on your calendar. For your convenience, I have
attached Revision 3 of the 2001-2002 All Faculty Meeting Schedule.

Thank you.
