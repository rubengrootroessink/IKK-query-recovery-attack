Hi Vince,
 
I hope all is well with you.  I sure miss  working together with you and Mike. 
 
I thought you would want to know about this site:  www.structurallogic.com << File: http://www.structurallogic.com >>    
 
I have found it to be quite accurate,  and useful for both short and long-term technical analysis on the  markets.  Your son
may find it interesting, as well.
 
Take care,
Tricia  Tlapek
