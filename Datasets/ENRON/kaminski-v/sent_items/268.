The  Jones School has a newly designed website: please take a look at http://jonesgsm.rice.edu .  Look more than  once, please, because the homepage changes each time you visit.  Like all  websites, this one is -- and always will be -- a work in progress. Our goal is  to have the most useful and attractive business school website possible, and  your suggestions and comments will be greatly appreciated. Assistant Director of  Public Relations Maileen Hamto is the webmaster and project manager with ESX.  The design was done by RandomSky Design Studio. Comments and suggestions are  welcome: contact Debra Thomas, dthomas@rice.edu , 713-348-6343.
The website includes the Jones School calendar that will feature  all on- and off-campus events hosted by the Jones School, including the academic  calendar, student club activities and meetings, social events, recruiting trips,  CPC-sponsored events, etc. The calendar will replace the schoolwide internal  Yahoo! calendar. Please add the URL http://jonesgsm.rice.edu/calendar  to your "favorites" or "bookmarks" folder on your web  browser.
Alumni will be able to use the Association of Rice Alumni  Online Directory -- a web-based database of alumni information  -- at its scheduled launch January 1, 2002. Students should have access to  the directory once the online career component is implemented, hopefully in the  spring. http://www.jonesgsm.rice.edu/jonesgsm/Alumni_Directory.asp?SnID=$LC:SnID$
