Vince:

Perfect.  I forgot what year your son was.  Did he graduate with Chelsea and
the Clintons?  Tons of Bay Area TV coverage of the Clinton graduation (with
honors they said) from Stanford.  (How can you graduate with honors when you
are traveling all over the world with mom and dad.)  Fortunately, they plan
to be gone when you get here...lot less crowded.  I will look forward to
hearing from Krishna via email or via cell phone at 650.218.3069.  Thanks
very much for accelerating this and putting it on your agenda.

Dale

Dale,

I shall be in your part of the world on Friday (Palo Alto).
I shall ask Krishna to meet you in my place.
