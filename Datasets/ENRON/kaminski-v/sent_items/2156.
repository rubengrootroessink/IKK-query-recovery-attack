Natural Gas Futures Steady Again=20
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX settled nearly flat Friday for the sec=
ond consecutive day with traders hesitant to take on new positions ahead of=
 the weekend. Trade and commercial activity was almost non-existent and muc=
h of the activity was confined to low risk spread trading. Bearish sentimen=
t was offset by short covering ahead of the weekend, although most traders =
say the downtrend is still intact in the absence of any significant weather=
 change or hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. The July contract traded in a $=
0.06 range, ending up $0.005 at $3.742 per MMBtu. August gained $0.008 to $=
3.802 per MMBtu. The market was expected to dip to the $3.670 mark, but cou=
ld not slide past $3.720, leading to some short-covering. The market remain=
s under pressure from mild weather and a series of larger-than-normal stora=
ge injections that have filled storage to 49% of capacity. Texas should ret=
urn to very warm conditions this week. In addition, the Northeast and Midwe=
st are expected to see a rise in temperatures early this week that will cre=
ate stronger demand. At test of support at the May 30th low of $3.67 is lik=
ely this week. The next level of support after $3.670 is seen at $3.570 and=
 then $3.50. Resistance was pegged at $3.98 and then again at $4.14. Natura=
l gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally mixed to=
 down $0.05 Friday, except out west where spot prices continued to tumble. =
The Southern California delivery point of Topock fell about $2.50 per MMBtu=
, while Kern River and Opal dipped well below $2.00 per MMBtu. Natural gas =
for next delivery at the Henry Hub slipped $0.01 to $3.68 per MMBtu.

California Power Bonds Delayed Again
    California's plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in bonds to pay for powe=
r will be delayed until at least October. The delay is another a series of =
setbacks since the state first pushed back the initial offering date for th=
e debt, originally planned for May. Proceeds from the sale, of what will be=
 the largest municipal bond in US history, will fund future energy purchase=
s and repay the treasury drained of billions of dollars from previous power=
 purchases. Also, further delays are possible if a number of factors do not=
 fall into place by mid-July. Including a failure of the California PUC to =
suspend its 'retail choice program' or to extend a $0.03 rate increase on S=
DG&E customers. Both of these revenue sources are needed to pay off the bon=
ds. Still, California has secured an additional $1 billion on top of the $3=
.5 billion bridge loan secured earlier this week to help see the state thro=
ugh until officials can bring the bonds too market. The bond sale is expect=
ed to include $10 billion in tax-exempt debt, of which $6 billion will be f=
ixed rate and $4 billion will be variable rate. It will include an addition=
al $3.4 billion in taxable bonds that will also be priced at both fixed and=
 variable rates. The huge amount of tax-free bonds will boost supply of Cal=
ifornia debt, forcing the state to offer higher yields to attract investors=

California Power Bonds Delayed Again
    California's plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in bonds to pay for powe=
r will be delayed until at least October. The delay is another a series of =
setbacks since the state first pushed back the initial offering date for th=
e debt, originally planned for May. Proceeds from the sale, of what will be=
 the largest municipal bond in US history, will fund future energy purchase=
s and repay the treasury drained of billions of dollars from previous power=
 purchases. Also, further delays are possible if a number of factors do not=
 fall into place by mid-July. Including a failure of the California PUC to =
suspend its 'retail choice program' or to extend a $0.03 rate increase on S=
DG&E customers. Both of these revenue sources are needed to pay off the bon=
ds. Still, California has secured an additional $1 billion on top of the $3=
.5 billion bridge loan secured earlier this week to help see the state thro=
ugh until officials can bring the bonds too market. The bond sale is expect=
ed to include $10 billion in tax-exempt debt, of which $6 billion will be f=
ixed rate and $4 billion will be variable rate. It will include an addition=
al $3.4 billion in taxable bonds that will also be priced at both fixed and=
 variable rates. The huge amount of tax-free bonds will boost supply of Cal=
ifornia debt, forcing the state to offer higher yields to attract investors=

CMS Joins Enron with India Problems=20
    CMS Energy's LNG-based power project at Ennore in southern India is now=
 completely stalled because of the need for a credit support mechanism from=
 the Indian government. CMS's problems come against a backdrop of a bitter =
payment battle between Enron's Dabhol Power and the state-run utility in In=
dia's Maharashtra state. CMS, along with India's Grasim Industries, leads a=
 consortium to build a $1.6-billion LNG terminal and 1,850 MW power plant a=
t Ennore port, just north of Madras. In January, India's finance ministry i=
ndicated it may scrap a plan to extend sovereign guarantees to 3 huge=20
power projects, including the Ennore LNG project. The  Ennore project has b=
een promoted by the Dakshin Bharat Energy consortium which also includes Ge=
rmany's Siemens, Australia's Woodside and Unocal. The CMS-led consortium wo=
n the LNG project from the Tamil Nadu state government in 1998 and plans to=
 build a 2.5-million tonnes a year LNG import, storage and regasification t=
erminal. The LNG is to be imported from Qatar's RasGas and the electricity =
from the power plant will be sold to the federal government-owned Power Tra=

FERC ALJ Says California Power Refunds Likely
    The FERC administrative law judge, who is overseeing refund settlement =
talks in California's power market, says that generators that sold electric=
ity in the state will probably have to pay back overcharges of several bill=
ion dollars. However, one would have to be paid in the first place before a=
nyone could repay anything. The ALJ says California's claim the state is ow=
ed $9 billion is too high. Enron, Mirant, Duke, Williams, Reliant Energy, a=
nd Dynegy are among the producers that FERC could compel to make the refund=
s. The companies have said they did nothing wrong. The California PUC and t=
he utilities will join in the negotiations at FERC headquarters in Washingt=
on. If no agreement is reached, the ALJ will have 7 days to make a recommen=
dation to the 5 FERC commissioners on the refund issue.=20

California Senate Hears Allegations Against Duke
     Three former Southern California power plant employees gave testimony =
on Friday to a state Senate committee investigating alleged price manipulat=
ion. Allegations against Duke Energy, as the plant's operator, included thr=
owing out spare parts to prolong the time a unit was out of service and ram=
ping electricity output up and down to manipulate power prices. Duke denied=
 the latest allegations by former workers at its South Bay power plant, say=
ing it finds the charges disturbing and incredible. Duke says the time has =
come for it to take a stand against this daily barrage of misinformation. C=
alifornia has for months been accusing the Duke and other generators who pu=
rchased many of the state's power plants of taking advantage of a chronic s=
hortage of electricity and price gouging. The governor is demanding $9 bill=
ion in refunds, and numerous lawsuits have been filed. The rhetoric has esc=
alated into branding  the generators as pirates and even murderers and rapi=
sts of the California economy, most of which is a smokescreen to hide their=
 true agenda, the forced donation of power to the state.  When Duke took ov=
er the Southern California plant they kept on all of its employees for 2 ye=
ars under an operating agreement. Once that agreement expired, Duke hired a=
bout 80% of the staff. The 3 that testified were among those not offered jo=
bs.=20
