Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level.

Thank you.

Gwyn Koepke
