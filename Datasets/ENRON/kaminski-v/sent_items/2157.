Sandeep,

This looks great. I would talk to all the heads of structuring desks, including
the right persons (Zimin, Krishna, Vasant) in the conversations.
Also, please talk to Andrea Reed and ask who are good targets in the EIM 
organization.

We can talk about other targets when I get back.

Vince

Vince,

Just a short note to update you since you are not here for the Tuesday meeting.  

I had sent a mail to Chris Calger on Friday copying you too.  I will be following up with a phone call.
I have fixed a meeting with Bill Rust (Mgr. East Desk), and Tom Dutta (Mgr. Generation Investments) for Friday.  I will be presenting our skill set to him; would like to include Martin and Lance.
Am working with Krishna on the EES contract, and he will talk to you about a meeting date
Am working on a request from LNG group on their Nigeria LNG contract (meeting at 10.30).  Will like to include Paulo; have already talked with Zemin.
Would like to talk to you about which people to target as regards the Marketing Plan.

Regards,
Sandeep.
