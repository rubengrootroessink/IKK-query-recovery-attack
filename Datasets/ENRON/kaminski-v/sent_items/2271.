Hector,

Thanks for the update. I am likely to come to CMU this semester

Hi Vince!
 
How are you? This is just a brief note to let you know I'm very much enjoying my time here at Carnegie Mellon. Adapting to the student lifestyle after working for three years was a bit discouraging at the beginning, but with time I began to appreciate it. This is the second week of our second mini-semester... I am finding the finance related coursework a good review, and the math and programming related coursework very interesting and useful. Our class is very small, approximately 30 people. I really miss Houston and Enron... Pittsburgh is a nice city, although I have little time to truly explore what it has to offer. 
 
I hope you're doing well. 
 
Sincerely,
 
-Hector
