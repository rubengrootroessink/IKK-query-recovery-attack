Vince,

Sorry for being terse.  It is Hanover Compressor.  R2 was long swap @ $44.875 (about 5.5 MM shares) with a collar ($34.875 and $94.68), according to my information. It is presently trading around $30.

Vince,

I met with Gordon yesterday and have up-to-date information on the public and private hedges we placed in Raptors 1 and 2.  There has been value loss there.  The following are the current values for R1. I shall cross-check the values again before we model these into our liquidation valuation.
For R2, HC is the only remaining value, it appears.  However, we have already entered into a contract with Bear and Stearns who are shorting HC presently and wll settle with Enron around October, 2001, after Enron makes its sale.  So, it may not be relevant if we want to look at the liquidation value at maturity from a volatility perspective.

Thanks.

Rudi,

Makes sense. Let's meet with Gordon. I shall ask Rakesh to set up a meeting. 

Another question: do you know if the collar was hedged by the equity desk?

I would expect a cash event related to the exercise of the put that will affect Enron's
liquidity at some point.

Vince

Ding --

As ENE stock and the stock market in general has been hammered lately, perhaps it is a good time to call Gordon McKillup and determine how the various Raptor portfolios are postured.

As you may recall from the prior analysis, they placed a option collar around the collateral (ENE stock).  At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!
