Hello guys:

Listed below is an email from Osman Sezgen, a former
Research employee.  He is in California and will not
be returning to Houston and wants to turn his laptop
and blackberry into the San Francisco office. 

I just needed to be sure that the Research Group was
given credit for it. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Shirley,

I would like to return the Enron equipment that I have
to the San Francisco Office. Could you check with the
appropriate department to whom I should give the
equipment at the San Francisco Office. 

I know that April Hrach is the Administrative
Coordinator at the SF office and she deals with the
equipment issues. Please ask the appropriate
department to give me a name of a person from the SF
office and also notify that person.

Here is the equipment list:

(1) Blackberry (14879) 1-877-455-1927
(2) Laptop     (40115)

Regards,
Osman Sezgen
