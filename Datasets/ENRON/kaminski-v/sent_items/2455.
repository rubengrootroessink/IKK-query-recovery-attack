Sheridan,

I am going out to lunch with Rick Buy today and will
mention the valuation seminar. 
I shall ask Rick how many employees from his
group he would send to this program.

I have no suggestions regarding the program,
except that the last year selection of topics
was very interesting. You can include e-bus
and on-line trading as the topics for 2002.


My address is:

1400 Smith
Houston, TX 77002 - 7361
Room EB1962


Vince

Vince:

Ehud and I will meet tomorrow to start sketching out the February
conference.  Let me know if you have any strong opinions of issues that you
think we should discuss.  Ehud will write a formal letter to Skilling
inviting him to the conference.

When we have the opportunity, I would like to have a discussion with you
about what the people at Enron think they understand and do not understand
about valuation.  Also, do you think it is an advantage that you are doing
business with relatively naive financial institutions or a disadvantage?

I'm thinking that it might make sense to run a one or two day executive
program on valuation which would include participants from energy companies
and financial institutions.  Let me know if you think you could get support
for this at Enron?

By the way, I still need a name and address to send my check back.  I think
Shirley can take care of it.

Thanks,

regards,

Sheridan
