I just wanted to let you know that I am going to start working on a couple of projects for your group as a result of yesterday's meeting.

1)	Establish a Toastmasters "club" at Enron in order to give the members of your team, as well as other employees, the opportunity to be proactive in developing their leadership and presentation skills.
?	Yesterday I learned that we do have Toastmasters here at Enron that meets on Thursday at lunch.  I am scheduling a meeting with the lead and will report back to you as to whether another club that would meet at a different day/ time (perhaps in the evening) would be successful, and how we can more effectively market this program. 

2)	Continue to work with our organizational development and training team to develop a specialized program that will address the following needs:  ESL, effective communication, presentation skills, and selling/ networking skills.  Currently we are sponsoring an ESL class a group in Networks group, but I would like to try and take that concept further so that your specific needs can be adequately addressed.  

If you think that there are any other areas that I can focus on, please do not hesitate to let me know.  

Thanks,
Anne
