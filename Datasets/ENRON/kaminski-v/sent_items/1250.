Paula,

I am forwarding you the resume of Marilyn Mielke. She is a very highly
educated and accomplished person. She has a background in science but 
no skills required in my group. I was impressed with her excellent
communication and social skills - maybe she can help in your area.

She was knocking on the Enron's door for a long time.

Vince

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you so very much for your time on Wednesday. It has been
challenging to find out, from the outside, exactly what your group does
on a daily basis and what type of people make up your team. I do not
feel that there is any substitute for the information, and feel, that
one can get directly from the source itself, thank you for making your
team available to meet with me as well.

You mentioned that the Associate Program at Enron could be a great
starting point for me to acquire the business skills and experience that
I seek. I would be a most enthusiastic candidate as I have looked into
the program, and I too, feel that it would be an exciting and logical
starting point for me.

It is my understanding that in order for me to enter the program I would
require sponsorship. Would you be able to sponsor me for this program?
If so, I have attached my cv (as a Word '97 document) and understand
that the person to be contacted with a nomination would be Mr Jeff Davis
in Human Resources. Please let me know if there is anything further that
I can do to realize my goal of working within Enron while gaining
business skills and experience.
It was a pleasure speaking with you.

Thank you again for your help and encouragement.

Sincerely,
Dr. Marilyn Mielke
