Sorry it took me so long to email this to you.  My computer locked up and I had to get the Resolution Center to fix it.  

Rakesh is staying at the Toronto Hilton - 1-416-869-3456; Sherri is with him and her cell phone number is 832-725-5529

I do not have any numbers for the conference itself.  Let me know if you need anything else.
