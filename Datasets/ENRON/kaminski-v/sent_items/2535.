Please find attached a draft of the Technical Corner article.  I wanted to include the equation forms for Faraday's Law and Ampere's Law, but the equation tools are not installed on my machines.  If you like, I can try to get the added Monday morning after IT can install the equation tools.
 
Thanks,
Martin
