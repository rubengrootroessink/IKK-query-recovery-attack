Gina, 

I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only" 
lunch. I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati, 
who studies Italian on his own. 

What about Tuesday next week?

Mr. Kaminski; 

It was a delight talking with you the other day, and I was especially happy to have such a pleasant conversation in Italian.  

I hope that we can get together again sometime to for a chat, and maybe a lunch.  I look forward to meeting you again.  

  
All the best 

Gina Corteselli
