Great knowing you Vince.  You're a good man.

I have a job offer at Duke and will need someone good to work with in a "best practices" in modeling.  Any names ?  Someone as good as Kristin with a strong analytical/modeling mind (who also works well with others and can coach as well as do ?)

Let me hear from you at slimpme@aol.com.

Regards.
