Please, try to mobilize the members of the group
who have not made a contribution yet. Research is shown
as a separate group in all the reports and we may stand out as unit
at the end of this week.

As of this morning, EWS Research has $19,355 in pledges from 13 out of 47 employees.  The final 34, who have not accessed the system, are:

	Stephen Bennett		Rakesh Bharati
	Shirley Crenshaw		Lance Cunningham
	Chuanli Deng			Amitava Dhar
	Anita Dupont			Youyi Feng
	Shane Green			Anguel Grigorov
	Thomas Halliburton		Paulo Issler
	Seksan Kiatsupaibul		Sandeep Kohli
	Jaesoo Lew			Martin Lin
	Zimin Lu			Jose Marquez
	Praveen Mellacheruvu		Kevin Moore
	Mitra Mujica			Wichai Narongwanich
	Christopher Pernoud		Maureen Raymond
	Michael Roberts			Osman Sezgen
	Wiliam Smith			Adam Stevens
	Sofya Tamarchenko		Leann Walton
	Sarah Wooddy			Sevil Yaman
	Roman Zadorozhny		Oren Zimmerman

In order to access the system, all they need to do is click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/.  They will need their GIS ID and password.  If they don't know what their ID and password are, have them go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"

Keep in mind that they are counted as having participated whether they contribute or not, as long as they access the system and indicate their preference.  However, I would encourage them to contribute something.

Thanks.

Eric
