Team,

Attached is my current framework for a possible movement model.  This is 
quite a complex problem and much work needs to be done.  At a minimum I hope 
this will facilitate a valuable discussion.  I have also blended in some 
slides on my thoughts about what CreditStream should do for our clients.

Best regards,
Lee
