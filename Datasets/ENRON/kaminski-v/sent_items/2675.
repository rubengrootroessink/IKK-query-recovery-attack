Hi Vince,

I wanted to let you know that I received  Jill's resume ( via Molly Magee & Anne Labbe) and added her  to the Executive Referral program. 

I called Jill to let her know I received her resume and have forwarded it on to another recruiter for review.

I will keep you up to date on her status when I receive feedback from the recruiter. Please feel free to call me with any questions or specific people you wish to see her resume.

Thank you,

Andria Stevens
Enron Executive Referrals
