Kal,

This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.

Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
in the energy industry.
It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
for Enron employees.


Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.


Vince

Vince -- Even if we post this internally, I have some concern about the heading of this article and with the section with recommendations for EnronOnline.  Is this something we really need to do?  If so, pls. let me know since we'll have to edit some of the text and make it very clear that this is simply an article written by some students outside Enron and Enron does not agree or disagree with the content.  We would also have to add a note that this article is for internal use only.  We can discuss and finalize on Tues.

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Vince

Vince,
I thought this subject might make for an interesting technical corner article.  If you think it appropriate, please feel free to edit and return to me.

thanks
