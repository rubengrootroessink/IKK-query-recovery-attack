Michael,

The person who can help you is Zimin Lu. Due to the death in his family, he
will be unavailable in the next few days. Please, work directly with me to 
coordinate the project. We can meet tomorrow (Tuesday or Wednesday)
for 15 minutes to discuss the details.

Vince -

I had spoken with Joe Deffner concerning your prior conversation on the calculation of our cost of funds.  Is there someone in your group who you would like us to work with concerning the possible conversion of our established cost of funds curve to one based upon zero coupon bonds?  Thanks for your help and please let me know if you have any questions.
