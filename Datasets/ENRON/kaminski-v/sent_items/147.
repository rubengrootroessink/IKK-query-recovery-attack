Barbara,

My tenure at Enron is coming to an end. I am passing your data request to another person 
and hopefully you will get some help. When can we call you next week?

Vince

Vince - You are the greatest!  Duke was in our minds as a possible new
sponsor but we had not figured out yet where to start.  I will talk with
the others and we will definitely pursue this Mr.  Ladd.  I really can't
begin to express how appreciative I am that you thought to mention this to
him.  I am in New York right now so it will be next week before we can
start the process.
