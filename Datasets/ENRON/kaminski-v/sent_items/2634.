Vince/Brian;

I have made reservations at Arco d'oro for 6:45 tomorrow night.  I suggest that, if your work schedules permit, you come to my place at 6:00ish for a drink before dinner then we can proceed together to the restaurant.  Brian has graciously offered to drive-and he knows where I live, so  Brian perhaps you and Vince arrange to meet here and come over?   

Looking forward to a good Sardo dinner.  Gina
