Our MBA for Executives Program is not included in the recent Financial Times
rankings because we are too young. The Financial Times surveyed alumni from
1998. Our first EMBA class graduated in 2000.

Dean Gil Whitaker was featured in the global business edition of the October
29 issue of Time magazine where he was identified as a "World Beater: People
to Watch in International Business." Whitaker was chosen for his efforts to
diversify the school and pictured with a number of black, Hispanic and women
students. The entire article and photos will be posted on the website soon.

John Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of H-E-B's Central Market, will be
the Dean's Lecture Series featured speaker Wednesday, November 28, from 9:45
to 11:15 a.m., Herring Hall. Campbell, who began his career as a store
checker at H-E-B 30 years ago, led the way to create the premier fresh-food
emporium for people who love food. After years of witnessing customers armed
with coolers driving hundreds of miles to the first Austin location, H-E-B
has expanded the Central Market concept with an additional store in Austin,
one in San Antonio, and another in Houston, which opened May 2001.
