Shawn,

Sorry again. Breakfast on Friday would work.
What about Hyatt Regency, 7:00 or 7:30?

I've got a conflict on Friday. How about Tuesday or maybe breakfast during
the weekend?

Shawn,

I was about to call you. I have an emergency here.
Can we push the lunch to Friday?

   Vince:

   Would it be trouble if we started lunch at 12:30?

   If it is, I'll still pick you up at noon.

   Thanks.  Shawn
