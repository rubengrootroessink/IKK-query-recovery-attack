Dear Mike and Vince,

I will be travelling to the US for two weeks (max. time I can leave the office at the moment). From the 26-28 June I will be visiting the 
6th workshop for the Community Climate System Model in Breckenridge, CO. Afterwards, I will be coming to the Houston office. 

I will call you regarding the various points on the agenda. 

Regards,
Christian
