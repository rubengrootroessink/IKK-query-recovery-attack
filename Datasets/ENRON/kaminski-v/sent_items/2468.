Nelson,

I fully agree. They are free to donate as much as they want to charity as they wish,
but it does not have to be through Enron.

Vince,

I have had several requests from interns who are interested in giving to the United Way campaign.  Personally, I am of the opinion that the campaign drive really does not pertain to the summer folks and that they should keep their money.  While I have appreciated their efforts/thoughtfulness in this regard, it doesn't seem appropriate for them to pledge given a) the amount of money they're making over the 3 month period and b) the time of service to the company.  I'll be happy to suggest otherwise to them if you think that it is appropriate.

Nelson
