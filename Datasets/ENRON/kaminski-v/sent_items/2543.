Vince,
 
We met several months ago with Peter Nance of Teknecon Energy  Risk Advisors (TERA) to discuss Enron's possible participation in our  benchmarking study.
 
Our original schedule has slipped, and I was wondering if you  might reconsider participating.  Here is a presentation that Peter did for  us in Washington DC where 50 companies came to learn more about the study.   Also attached is a sample list of metrics.
 
The kick-off meeting will be in the second week of October in  Houston.  Please let me know if Enron would be interested in joining the  study team.  We have several companies in the top 20 signed up.  I  would be happy to review the list with you over the phone.
 
Best regards,
