Thank you, Vince.  I might have a job opening for a manager of public relations within the next week or so, and I would be happy to pass his resume along to the hiring manager.  I'll also give it to the other recruiters in case they are aware of other positions.

Hope all is well with you,
Molly

Molly,

This is the resume of my friend who is interested in a job with Enron.
He is a very capable and hard working person.

Vince
