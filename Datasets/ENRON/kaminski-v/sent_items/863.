I am letting all participants know that I have revised the agenda for June
21-22 at Stanford.  Commissioner Michal Moore has agreed to make opening
remarks on Thursday morning.  I have also added presentations by Severin
Borenstein and by Shmuel Oren and Rajnish Kamat.  You can see the revised
agenda by visiting the June 21-22 entry under

I am looking forward to a great session.

Regards,
Hill
