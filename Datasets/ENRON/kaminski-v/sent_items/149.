Barabara,

I had a lunch today with Rob Ladd from Duke (company, not university).
He is a Rice graduate and I mentioned to him the seminars that Enron was sponsoring.
He is willing to talk to you about substituting Duke for Enron as a sponsor of the 
seminar program. 

Please, contact him at rtladd@duke-capitalpartners.com.
His cell phone number is 704 756 5354.

I am working on the power price time series for you but I may run out of time.

Vince
