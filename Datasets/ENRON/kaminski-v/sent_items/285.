Just wanted to write a quick note to say thankyou for your assistance and advice over the the last 5.5 yrs. It was really a privilege working with such great people. I may be back in the office within the next few weeks so hopefully I can track you down on 19 & say good-bye. 

I shall be returning to the UK on Dec 23rd, and will proceed to look for a job along with the other 1,500 ex-employees.

Well it's been quite a ride & I'm pretty much ready to get off & move on. 

I hope that I have the opportunity to meet with you again. Please do look me up if you are ever in London. 

Kind regards,

Soma
