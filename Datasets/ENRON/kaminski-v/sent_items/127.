Vince --

I realize you may be busy with the news that UBS is the winning bidder for
Enron's trading organization.

Looking ahead, I invite you to speak at the Market Price Volatility
conference, to be held May 1-3, in Houston.

This follows on the Gas Volatility and Storage Valuation conference held
last October. This spring's conference will focus on power volatility, and
will include a number of applied econometric presentations.

The format of the preconference workshop, on Wednesday, May 1, will be much
the same as in the past. Your speaking slot is for a one-hour presentation
in the afternoon, followed by a roundtable.

I hope you will join in what promises to be a stimulating event.

Please confirm your participation by e-mailing or calling me by
Thursday, Jan. 17.

Following your confirmation, Jim Naphas of INFOCAST will be in touch
regarding the usual details.

Best regards.
