Richard,

I have made discreet inquiries at Rice and it seems they are looking for somebody
with a different profile than the one you represent. I think that the interest is more
in a person with more financial institution risk management experience, with special applications
to trading and energy trading in particular.

Vince

Dear Vince

I recently saw an announcement of Enron's risk management chair at Rice
University.  Do you know about it or the people at Rice?  While I'm having a
great time working with Swiss Re here, I am thinking about coming home for
my wife's sake.  Do you think that Rice would be open to a person in risk
management with an insurance as well as a finance background?  That was
certainly not true at Texas and that's why I'm asking.

I hope all is well there with you.  I did appreciate your presentation to my
finance classes there at the University of Texas a couple of years ago.  I
also appreciated the assistance that you recently gave one of my Texas Ph.
D. students.  He was and I still am working on pricing weather derivatives.

Best regards
Richard
