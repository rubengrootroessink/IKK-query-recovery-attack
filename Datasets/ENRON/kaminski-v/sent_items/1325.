Makes sense. The customers were engaging in risk reducing trades to lower
their exposure.

I am curious about the most recent volumes.

Vince,

I thought you might just like to have this information: several people have been asking about our trading volumes and whether or not they have decreased significantly. According to the graphs in the attached spreadsheet, the only significant drop in EOL trading came on 09/11 and 09/12. In fact, the largest number of transactions on EOL was on 10/23, which is since many of our problems started.

Tom
