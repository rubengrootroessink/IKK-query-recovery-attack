Natural Gas Futures Jump on News of Tropical Storm Barry=20
    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX gained 3.6% yes=
terday, up $0.111 to $3.192 per MMBtu on hot weather across much of the nat=
ion and the approach of a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico off the coas=
t of Florida. The October contract rose $0.107 to $3.232 per MMBtu. Tropica=
l Storm Barry is expected to strengthen today and move into the north-centr=
al Gulf of Mexico. Some weather forecasts expect that the storm will turn i=
nto a hurricane, and the growing likelihood that workers will soon have to =
be taken off Gulf of Mexico natural gas platforms has put traders on alert.=
 But, despite the storm risk, there was only limited short-covering and vol=
ume was fairly light. However, strength in crude and products as well as Tr=
opical Storm Barry encouraged buying by both trade, commercial accounts and=
 the locals. Fundamentally, the market is still bearish, but that could cha=
nge quickly if the storm does impact production. Sell stops were triggered =
as prices moved through the $3.20 level late in the session, bringing the m=
arket off its highs. On Wednesday, the market dropped over $0.20 following =
the release of AGA report data showing an injection of 77 Bcf last week. Ho=
t weather is forecast for much of the nation early next week, with the West=
 Coast returning to hot weather next week. Natural gas for next day deliver=
y across the US and Canada was generally $0.10 to $0.15 per MMBtu lower yes=
terday, except out West where spot price climbed. Natural gas for next day =
delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $3.15 per MMBtu. Look for cash pric=
es to jump higher today.

Storm on Track to Disrupt Gulf Production
    Tropical Storm Barry formed off Florida's Gulf coast on yesterday and c=
ould become a hurricane today as it churns its way through the oil and natu=
ral gas fields of the Gulf of Mexico this weekend. The storm is most likely=
 to make landfall on Sunday in Louisiana. Companies with offshore productio=
n have already taken steps to protect workers by moving them onshore until =
the storm passes but they added that they had not yet suspended any product=
ion. The National Hurricane Center forecasters predicts that Barry would mo=
ve slowly to the northwest, taking it through the main producing areas of t=
he central Gulf with a 55% chance that it would attain hurricane strength a=
s it heads toward New Orleans. Chevron has evacuated 700 workers from offsh=
ore platforms as a precaution against the storm and will make further evacu=
ations today. The Gulf of Mexico provides about one quarter of nation's pro=
duction of both natural gas and crude oil; about 13 Bcf of natural gas per =
day and 1.4 million barrels of oil.=20

House Bill Addresses Energy Bond Status
    The House of Representatives has passed a wide-ranging energy bill that=
 includes measures to permit tax-exempt bond financed public power utilitie=
s more access to deregulated power markets. Public utilities which are loca=
ted in competitive markets would no longer be bound by existing tax law str=
ictly limiting private use of facilities financed with tax-exempt bonds. Ho=
wever, they can continue to issue tax exempt financing for a limited amount=
 of generation to serve their own load, but not for service outside their l=
ocal area. Private and public utilities say they are satisfied with the bil=
l, nut private utilities are disappointed that the bill left out a provisio=
n eliminating taxes on contributions in aid of construction. The bill inclu=
des measures that allow public power systems to join RTOs in order to impro=
ve the national transmission grid, without endangering outstanding bonds. T=
he bill also makes an exception for prepaid natural gas contracts, which wo=
uld apply only if at least 85% of the purchased volumes were for use by gov=
ernmental utilities in the state where the bond issuer was located.=20

El Paso Chairman to Testify Again=20
    El Paso Chairman, President and CEO William Wise will testify for a sec=
ond time Monday in FERC's investigation into alleged manipulation of Califo=
rnia's energy market. The California PUC claims that El Paso unfairly award=
ed 1.2 Bcf per day of firm capacity to its affiliate, El Paso Merchant Ener=
gy. Before the start of testimony, the FERC ALJ said that an April 2000 mem=
orandum sent between Wise and another  official relates the minute details =
of everything that is happening in the company, showing that Mr. Wise was w=
ell aware of everything. That seems to run contrary to Wise's testimony at =
the previous May  hearing, where testified he did not micromanage the affai=
rs of El Paso's subsidiaries. The California PUC testified that El Paso awa=
rded the capacity in question by skewing the rules of an open season, sayin=
g it biased the open season in favor of the 'total package' bid. If a singl=
e bid for all of the capacity exceeded $37.5 million, then individual bids =
could only succeed if they exceeded the value of the total package bid to E=
l Paso.  Therefore, even if they submitted partial package bids at reasonab=
ly high rates, their success was totally dependent upon the other partial p=
ackage bids by other shippers. A total of 24 shippers submitted partial bid=
s, and none of them were awarded any capacity, the PUC said. But El Paso di=
sputed those claims, saying that it made the minimum economic criteria befo=
re the open season, thus giving no one an advantage.=20

Ladyfern Discovery May Yield Tcf of Natural Gas=20
   Canadian Natural Resources is the latest to drill in what is being toute=
d as one of the richest natural gas discoveries in Canada. The Ladyfern are=
a, located in an isolated section of northeastern British Columbia, is esti=
mated to contain up to 1 Tcf. Murphy Oil and Apache jointly drilled the fir=
st discovery well in the region a year ago, which is about 60 miles northea=
st of the oil hub, Fort St. John, BC. Acreage in the Ladyfern region has so=
ld for 17 times the median paid for acreage in other parts of BC. It is lik=
ely second in size to the 1.8 Tcf Caroline, Alberta field in terms of Canad=
ian onshore discoveries. Production is estimated at 480 MMcf per day. Canad=
ian Natural is now producing 55 MMcf per day from one well, which is restri=
cted by pipeline capacity. It expects to be producing 200 MMcf per day by t=
he end of the year. Alberta Energy's output is about 170 MMcf per day.=20

Conflict of Interest Charged in California
    One California energy official has a stock portfolio full of big energy=
 firms, while holds a million dollars in Enron stock. Even the governor's c=
hief spokesman has $12,000 invested in Calpine. Consumer groups and Republi=
cans are claiming conflict of interest among top Democratic officials charg=
ed with helping California out of its energy crisis. But the governor says =
it is a politically inspired witch hunt aimed at smearing his administratio=
n by implying something is illegal. Whatever, but it is still another pie i=
n the face the governor whose political viability seems to be fading almost=
 as fast as his friend, Gary Condit. Charges of conflict of interest surfac=
ed last month as the Secretary of State called for a probe of consultants n=
egotiating long-term energy deals designed to protect California from price=
 swings on the spot market. The governor fired five consultants last weeken=
d after belatedly asking them to file required economic disclosure statemen=
ts. Journalists have been busy digging up financial details on a bunch of D=
avis appointees that create the impression personal greed was driving Calif=
ornia's official energy policy. In one case, the chairman of the California=
 Energy Commission owned as much as $510,000 in energy company stock at one=
 point last year, it was reported.=20
