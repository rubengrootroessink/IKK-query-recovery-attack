Mike,

Perhaps it makes sense to shorten it a bit. I think the highlighted paragraphs can be removed.
Makes no sense to sound too apologetic.

Another observation. I have just talked to Christian and suggested a conference call
Monday evening our time with Paul. You can mention this conference call  request to Paul.
The oservation: Christian may be smart
but he will one hell of a person to manage given his personality.

Vince

Vince, 

How about this to keep the peace?....

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Paul,

Vince and I were just closing the loop on the recent misunderstanding regarding a potential rotation of Christian Werner into the Research Group in Houston, and I wanted to drop you a brief note to assure you that although it is very common up here for intra-group transfers to occur, it is never done without the input, advice and consent from the current supervisor at the very inception.

The first response I had when Christian proposed the arrangement was (and I quote myself) "What does Paul think of the idea?"  Christian properly responded that the whole idea would be contingent on finding and training a replacement meteorologist for the Sydney office and getting your buy-in that the move would be good for Mother Enron in totality.

It was only with that understanding that any conversations along those lines proceeded.  Christian showed me the modelling progress he had made (Vince was out of town for this and thus unaware of it), but, quite frankly, I was very impressed with his achievements. I can see how he has become a valuable asset to your efforts.

The way we left the matter when Christian returned to Australia was that he would propose the subject to you for any further action.

Then, before I even had an opportunity to update Vince upon his return on my discussions with Christian, Christian called Vince to get his ideas on the subject (My hours aren't as conducive to Houston-Sydney phone link-ups, but Vince is here late into the night).   Vince's first and immediate reaction to the idea was to set up a telephone conference with you before even proceeding with the concept.

That is what somehow triggered the misunderstanding, but while at the same time, clarified what was happening and alerted you to the situation.  

You have a great asset there in Christian, but be assured we're not poachers!

Hope this is the last beating the dead horse needs.

- Mike
