David,

What about coffee sometimes on Thursday, November 29?
We could have coffee at Hyatt or at the lobby of the Enron
Building (1400 Smith, 2 blocs from the Hyatt). I could show you our
trading floors in the new building.

Please, cc vkaminski@aol.com as well.

Vince

Vince:

I screwed up on my email.  I am coming THIS week, not next.  Are you still
available Weds or Thurs a.m. breakfast?  I am staying in the Galleria area
but could meet you at the Doubletree or Hyatt at say 7:00 a.m. either day.
Would one of those work for you?

Regards,

David
