Hello Vince;

Joseph Doucet has passed along your name to me, in regards to exploring
opportunities between Enron, and the Natural Resources and Energy MBA
students at the U.of A. I would be pleased to assist in any capacity, from
helping organize an information session by Enron to our students in the fall
at the U.of A., to co-ordinating job interviews for permanent or summer
internship positions, and everything in between! My function is to assist
MBA students and appropriate corporations to find each other! I look forward
to hearing from you.

Regards, Barry.
