Everybody,

this week our regular meeting will be devoted primarily to 2 subjects:
1. Simulating power prices in VAR;
2. Capturing correlations across commodities as well as across term structure of
forward prices.

Research will present some suggestions based on data analysis.

Detailed agenda is enclosed.

Please, let Shirley Crenshaw know if you are not planning to attend.

Tanya.
