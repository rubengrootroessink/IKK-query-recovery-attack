Mike,

I am sending you a message regarding a potential candidate.


Please, take a look at him and see if he fits better our
group or Mark Tawney's group.

Vince

Dear Vince and Christie,

 

I hope that you are both well, and are ready for the onset of summer in Houston!  I was disappointed that I was not able to see you at the final Tiger Team presentations last month due to a family emergency.  I hope that the teams' analyses will be helpful to your work, and echo their appreciation of your involvement and support.

 

I am writing with a question regarding recruiting for Enron's weather risk management group.  My boyfriend, Greg Hunt, is currently seeking opportunities to combine his background in meteorology (MS and 2 years of research at Lawrence Livermore Nat'l Lab) and an MBA in finance and information technology.  I began thinking about Enron's work in weather derivatives, and realized that there could possibly be a great fit there.

 

I have copied Greg on this message, and would appreciate any suggestions you can offer regarding opportunities in this group.  Thank you very much!

 

Best regards,

 

Heather
