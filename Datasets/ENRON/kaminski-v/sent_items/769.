Vince, you may remember me as the writer who helped on the natural gas chapter for the Risk Management book. As you know, I work for Enron full-time as a writer of many articles and publications.

I will be in Houston next week and I wondered if you had a half hour on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday to talk about market trends. I'm also available until 11 a.m. on Thursday.

Thanks,
Jeannie
