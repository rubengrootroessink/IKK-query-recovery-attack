Dear  Vince,
 
This is  a kindly reminder for the recommendation letters for my academic faculty  application. There are total of 11 schools that I am applying. Four of  them will contact you and ask for the recommendation letter only if they  want to pursue further (Prof. Nau from Duke is one of them). For the other seven  schools, they have asked for the recommendation letters at the first stage  of the application process. The  deadline for these seven schools (listed below) is next Tuesday (1/15/02).  I do understand totally on how busy you are at this critical moment of our  group. For your convenient, I have attached the old recommendation  letter you gave me for my greencard application in August. We can  just use this letter if you agree.
