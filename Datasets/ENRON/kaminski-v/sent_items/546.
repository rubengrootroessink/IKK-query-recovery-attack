Vince and Stinson,

I did some reserach on the option visualization.  Here is one of the findin=
gs.

Check this web site, the image looks impressive:  http://home.online.no/~es=
pehaug/VirtualWorld/VirtualOptionWorld.html
This is done through a free software LiveGraphics3D and Mathematica.=20

Take a look of the demo on the web site mentioned above to see if it is goo=
d enough for our purpose.

What Is LiveGraphics3D?=20

     LiveGraphics3D is a non-commercial Java 1.1 applet to display and
     rotate three-dimensional graphics produced by Mathematica in
     HTML pages. It may be used without charge for any
     non-commercial purposes. Mathematica is a program for symbolic
     and numeric mathematics by Wolfram Research, Inc.. Wolfram
     Research is also responsible for licensing LiveGraphics3D for
     commercial purposes.=20

     LiveGraphics3D enables all Mathematica users to put almost any
     three-dimensional graphics computed by Mathematica directly onto
     a HTML page, such that everyone with a web browser supporting
     Java 1.1 (e.g. Communicator 4.0 or Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher)
     can view and interactively rotate the graphics without any additional
     software.=20

     Additionally LiveGraphics3D is able to show animations, calculate
     stereo graphics, integrate hyperlinks, and display bitmap
     backgrounds. =05=20
