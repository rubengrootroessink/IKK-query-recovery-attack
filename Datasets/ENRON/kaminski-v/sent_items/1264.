Hey,

11/15 sounds good, everybody pencil it in. We'll confirm as day gets nearer,
and if Mike wants to go somewhere that serves Spanish Rice, that is fine by
me also:)

Vince & Steve,

I'm available any time for dinner other than Mondays or Wednesdays
(taking Spanish at Rice)

Thursdays are best, then tuesdays next.

This week, though, taking off Thursday after work to visit my dad in
North Carolina, so gone Friday too.

Even fridays generally OK, though I'd need to bring Mary Jo!

Bottom Line:  How about next Thursday 11/15????

Also, the earlier the better........(office hours 5am-4pm)

looking forward to it......


--- Mike
