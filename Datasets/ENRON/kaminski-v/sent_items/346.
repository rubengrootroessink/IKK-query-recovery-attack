David,


Thanks for your message. I am doing fine, considering the circumstances.
What about Wednesday, December 5. I can meet you at your hotel.

My cell phone number, just in case, is 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Hi Vince:
 
Hope the Enron crisis hasn't turned you upside down personally...
 
I'm going to be in Houston next week on a client call, and wondered if  you'd be interested in having breakfast Wednesday or Thursday.  We're  hoping to open an RCM office in Houston, and I wanted to speak to you to see if  you had any ideas on how we might staff it.
 
Regards,
 
David
