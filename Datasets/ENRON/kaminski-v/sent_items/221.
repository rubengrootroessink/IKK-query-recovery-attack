I am forwarding a copy of a message I sent some time ago to the same address.
The lawyer representing the Special Committee (David Cohen) could not locate it.
The message disappeared as well form my mailbox. Fortunately,
I have preserved another copy.

David, 
I am forwarding to you, as promised, the text of the 10/04/2001  message to Ryan Siurek regarding Raptor valuations. The message is stored on my PC at home. It disappeared from my mailbox on the Enron system.
