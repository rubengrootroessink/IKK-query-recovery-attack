Please find attached an input form to begin the dialogue for our sub group.
To be ready for our next Energy Committee meeting in January, I would suggest
that everyone try to respond by December 15th.  Please copy all the members
of the sub group on any response.  Feel free to comment back and forth on
each others responses.  Thanks so much for your participation.
