Steve,

Praveen is coming in tomorrow. We shall figure out a way to
give you a great recommendation.

I always appreciate your trading suggestions.

What about P, OXY, DVN, PGN, LU, EMC?


Vince

Good Morning Vince,
 
I talked with Pravine Kumar this morning. He wants  me to e-mail my resume to him. Apparently they are trying to set up a trading  room that would be an educational process for eventually producing traders that  can step into energy trading firms. That is right up my alley.
 
I've had four stock positions move up more that 25%  over  the past two weeks. Do you still want trade ideas?
 
 
Steve
