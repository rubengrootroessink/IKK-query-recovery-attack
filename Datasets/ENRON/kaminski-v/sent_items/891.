Maria Teresa,

Please, forward the message to Dr. Kloucek.
Thanks.

Dear Dr. Kloucek,

I shall be glad to speak at your seminar. Please,

Hi Vince,
    My name is Maria Teresa Aguilera-Peon, and Dr. Kloucek was one of my professors back at Rice.  He was having difficulties being able to contact you, so he asked me if I could please forward this email on to you.  
  Maria Teresa

Dear Vincent,

I am one of the organizers of the SIAM conf.  where you gave a presentation.
I missed your talk but I talked to you just after your presentation. I
wonder if I could get a copy of your PP slides.

On a related matter. Would you consider to give a talk at Rice at my
seminar, taking to applied and statistics audience? I would be happy to
arrange for your visit.

Yours,

Petr
