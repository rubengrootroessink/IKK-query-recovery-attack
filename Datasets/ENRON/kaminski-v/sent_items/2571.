Molly,

Jill is a daughter of my friend. She contacted our Analyst/Associate Program
but her background makes her a better candidate for an HR position.
Do you know  if we are looking for somebody with her skills?

Vince

Hi Vince,

I'm Presly's daughter, Jill.  I believe that he had told you I would be
sending my resume your way.  I am interested in the Associate HR and Analyst
program that Enron offers.  I have actually spoken with someone in Hr
regarding the program.  Her name is Adrianne Engel.  I have not heard from
her any further at this point.

I have been trying to get into the HR field here in Austin and it has been
very tough in this tight market.  I would love the opportunity to interview
with Enron.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Sincerely,
Jill Schoenemann
