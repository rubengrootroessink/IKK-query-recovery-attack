Vince:

Iris had asked if it was possible to get a room in London with a kitchenette so she could make some of her own meals since she is vegetarian .  The Anetheum has apartments with kitchens but they cost a $100 a day more than the regular room.   Should I just give her a regular room?    Sorry to bother you with all of this, but I don't know the appropriate thing to do in this case.
