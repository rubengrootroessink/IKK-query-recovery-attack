Latha

Thanks for asking!

I'd like to leave San Francisco
non-stop to Houston on United
1556 at 11:10 am Jan 9, arriving 4:44pm,
then go to Austin on the late
afternoon of the 10th (for a seminar at UT),
then I need to get from Austin to San Francisco
on the evening of the 11th.
(There is a United flight 419 connecting through Denver
that leaves Austin at 5:30 pm,
connecting to United 409 out of Denver).
If there is a non-stop from Austin to
San Francisco or San Jose, that is even
better. (United, my preferred, does
not have a non-stop from Austin to
the Bay Area.)

The cost will be shared 50-50 with U. Texas,
if that's OK with you and them. I have copied
the organizer of the seminar there,
Professor Ron Kaniel.

Warm regards,

Darrell
