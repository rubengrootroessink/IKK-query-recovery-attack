Vince,

I work with Jayshree Desai and Mark Wadlington in Corporate Development.  I know you are compiling a great deal of information, however, I have one question.  I am working to gather the market size information for the various markets, and I am having difficulty finding the size of the fixed income market.  Would someone in your group have this information or have any suggestions on places to look?

Thank you,
Sarah Taylor
