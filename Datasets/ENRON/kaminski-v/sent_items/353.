Kate,

Thanks for your message. With all the turbulence going on in Enron
it's difficult for anybody to leave the office for an extended period of time.
We shall have to abstain this time and hope to join you in the future.
Vince

Dear Vince and Vasant :

Since you both won't be able to come for our Advisory Committee meeting on
Dec 7, can you send someone else to come? Please let me know, it is critical for us to have
someone from your team to come!!   As you can see from the attached RSVP list,
we have a quite good mix of people to come. FYI, I am attaching an agenda and
"possible issues" for your review.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Kate
