Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.
