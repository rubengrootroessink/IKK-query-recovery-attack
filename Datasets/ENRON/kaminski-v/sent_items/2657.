Norman,

I have confirmed in my messages to Jim and Laura our visit in Santa Fe on Wednesday, September the 5th.
What about arriving at your location 9:30 a.m.

Vince

Greg,

Congratulations on your new role in Eron!

We realize that your schedule might well be in turmoil as a result of
changes going on, and wanted to check on the solidity of the Wed Sept 5
Santa Fe meeting.

Let us know if it changes, and if it is far more convenient for you to have
us come to Houston again, we are also open to this.  We continue to be
excited about the possibilities of getting together on a project.

    Best regards,
    Norman
