Vince/Brian;

How about Tuesday evening for dinner at the Sardinian restaurant (Arco d'oro) sound?  
Zagat's gives the food high marks, but notes that the service can sometimes not be good.  If they are truly Italians I am sure that between Vince and me, however, we can win them over.  

Let me know, and I will make a reservation for 6 or 6:30.  Gina
