Vince: 
I too enjoyed meeting you, and I wish you all the best in the SEC testimony and otherwise.  Should you at any time conclude that counsel would be helpful (even if only marginally) or if you simply want to confer in connection with the SEC or any other governmental investigation, please feel free to give me a call.  I'd be happy to help.
Sincerely, 
Michael Levy

Michael, 
To follow up on my first message, I want to inform you that I decided 
to appear before the SEC investigators without a legal counsel. I simply 
feel 
that your highly competent help is not required in my case. 
I want to thank you for the time you spent with me on Wednesday. 
My only regret is that I shall have no opportunity to spend more time 
with you and learn from your experience. 
Vince

   Michael Levy will be out of the office on business until on or about 
   January 22, 2002.  He will have some limited access to e-mails and 
will 
   respond as quickly as he can.  In addition, please feel free to 
contact 
   his secretary, Megan Morgan, at (202) 295-8416, if you need to reach 
him 
   immediately.  You may also leave him a voicemail at (202) 295-8414, 
and 
   he will get back to you as soon as he can. 
   Thanks.
