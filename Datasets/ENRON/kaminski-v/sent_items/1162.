Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
