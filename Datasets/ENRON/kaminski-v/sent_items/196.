Today's focus: Flaw in AOL Instant Messenger

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Hole in AOL Instant Messenger discovered

A security flaw in the way AOL's Instant Messenger handles game
sharing requests could be exploited by a malicious user to run
arbitrary code on the affected machine. The victim may be
helpless, short of powering down the machine, to stop the
request. AOL is working on a fix, which will be applied to the
servers that run IM. Users will not have to download a patch.

For more:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0102aim.html


* Vulnerability found in IE 6.0

Microsoft bug hunter Georgi Guninski has discovered one of the
first bugs in the new Internet Explorer 6.0. According to
Guninski, the GetObject() function has a poor security
mechanism that can be easily exploited to transverse local
files and execute arbitrary programs on the affected machine.

For more, go to:
http://www.guninski.com/getob3.html


* Patch release for mutt

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in mutt, a mail user
agent for Linux. The one-byte overflow can be exploited by a
malicious user. For general updates and to get more
information, go to:
http://www.mutt.org/announce/mutt-1.2.5.1-1.3.25.html

Debian users can download the appropriate patch from:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-096


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* JS/Seeker-E - A JavaScript-based virus that attempts to set
Internet Explorer's home and start pages to a pornographic
site. (Sophos)

* Win32/Maldal.G.Worm - An e-mail worm that spreads via Outlook
by sending itself to everyone the Outlook Address book and by
searching the infected hard drive for addresses embedded in
HTML pages. Infected messages have the subject line of "ZaCker"
and an attachment called "ZaCker.exe". The virus also will
overwrite a number of file types. (Computer Associates, Sophos,
Symantec)

See story at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0103zacker.html

* Troj/Download-A - A Trojan Horse program that comes as two
files, "dlder.exe" and "explorer.exe". They can be used to send
information about an infected computer to outside sources.
(Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* CIA-backed analysis tool eyed for passenger checks

Data analysis software backed by the CIA and used by some
casinos to catch gambling cheats is now being tested for its
potential to detect suspected terrorists and their associates
when they make airline, hotel or rental-car reservations.
