Vince,

I am pleased to hear you will be returning to MSCF this year, participating
in the Speaker Series on December 7.   Enron has a tremendous reputation in
quantitative finance circles and your obvious interest in our students is
deeply appreciated.  I know, too, our students are very much looking forward
to your visit.

On a separate but definitely related matter, would you consider serving on
our Advisory Board?   You will note our present membership
(http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/advisory.html) reflects no representation
from an energy firm.  I speak on behalf of the MSCF Steering Committee in
expressing our hope that you would be willing to correct this!

The Advisory Board meets once a year, usually in the late fall in New York.
Its six (or so) members serve for a three year term.  Enron's participation
on the MSCF Board would allow you to influence the direction of the program
to the advantage of the energy companies and give you access to a "first
look" at the "MSCF Resume Book."  From our standpoint, your experience and
counsel would be of tremendous benefit to us as we consider challenges and
opportunities in the MSCF program in the years ahead.

Our 2001 meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 12 in mid-town Manhattan.
Would you be willing join us?

Rick
