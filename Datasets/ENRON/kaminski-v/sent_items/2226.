Dennis,

Thanks. I have seen some of the papers you mentioned but missed one about
discriminative auctions.

Dear Mr.  Kaminski,
=20
I don't know if  you've seen this, but I thought it may be of interest to  =
you.
A new document has been added to PSerc Document  Archive:
Western States Power Crisis: White  Paper
EPRI
You can view this document by going to:http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/p=
ublicatio/specialepr/westernstatessynthesi1.pdf
There are a number of documents from PSERC researchers  that have also been=
 uploaded toour website (www.p << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/=
publicatio/specialepr/westernstatessynthesi1.pdf >> serc.wisc.edu << File: =
http://www.pserc.wisc.edu >> ). You can find the  documents in the Publicat=
ions << File: http://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/ >>  folders.  =
You may be particularly interested in the following new  additions:Testing =
the Performance of Uniform Price and  Discriminative Auctions << File: http=
://www.pserc.wisc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/2001public/rutgers_tim2.pdf >> . =
 This paper reports on a series of  laboratory experiments to assess the pe=
rformance of different electric power  markets with respect to price volati=
lity and average market prices.An Engineering Approach to Monitoring Market=
 Power in  Restructured Markets for Electricity << File: http://www.pserc.w=
isc.edu/ecow/get/publicatio/2001public/houstoniaee.pdf >> . This paper  exp=
lores the potential for using an engineering approach to measure the  exist=
ence of market power in the real-time operations of a power grid and gives =
 the results of two experiments designed to test the exercise of market  po=
wer.
We've also updated the  descriptive information about PSERC. That informati=
on is in the General  Information About PSERC  << File: http://www.pserc.wi=
sc.edu/ecow/get/generalinf/aboutpserc/ >> folder.
I am sorry you weren't  able to join us at our last Industrial Advisory Boa=
rd meeting. You and others  from ENRON are certainly invited to our next me=
eting which will be December 5-7,  2001 in College Station, TX, hosted by T=
exas A&M and TXU. We'll send you  more information when it is available.
Dennis
