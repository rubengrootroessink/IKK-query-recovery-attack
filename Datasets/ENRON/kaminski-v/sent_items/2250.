Billy,

We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying

Vince,

This person looks "scary smart", and when I see that, I always think of you.  Please let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you,
Billy

Bobby,

Thank you for your interest in Enron.  I've copied Traci Warner who leads recruiting for our program.  Traci or someone from her team will follow up with you.
