John,

I will teach the option class in the spring (starting sometimes in February).
I don't see any problem if you want to audit the  class.

Vincent,

Very nice to talk to you the other day on the bus.  You had mentioned that
it might be possible to audit courses at Rice...  I would be interested in
auditing the course you teach on Options when you teach it again.  Would
you let me know when it will be offered ?

Regards,
John Wisniewski
