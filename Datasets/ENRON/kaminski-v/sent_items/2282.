Vince,

Here is your presentation on the exotic energy options with slightly modifications.
I added a few slides about Asian options and spread options. I used the Asian strip options as an
transition technique for the forward curve modeling.  For the weather presentation
I did a summary at the end. From the audience responses, it seemed the presentations
went well.
