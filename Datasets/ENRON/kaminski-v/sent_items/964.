Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Vince

Vince,
I thought this subject might make for an interesting technical corner article.  If you think it appropriate, please feel free to edit and return to me.
