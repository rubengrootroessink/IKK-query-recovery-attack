Angelika,

Sorry for a short notice but unexpected is part of the
corporate life. Zimin will cover both my presentation and
the workshop - he is a very good speaker and I am sure
he will do a better job that I could do.

Vince

Thanks for letting me know. We regret that Vince Kaminski will not be able
to make it, but I appreciate that there can always be unforeseen
circumstances like this. I assume that he will not be able to attend the
workshop, either - could you confirm this?

Thank you for providing a replacement - I am looking forward to meeting Mr
Lu in Paris. We will need his presentation tomorrow by 12, as the van will
leave at 1 to go to Paris.

Kind Regards,

Angelika Staude

Angelika:

Unfortunately, Vince Kaminski will not be able to attend the conference
in Paris next week due to unforseen circumstances here at Enron Houston.
He will be sending Dr. Zimin Lu, Director, Enron Research to replace
him.

I will be sending Zimin's presentation to our London Office and they
will get the copies to you sometime on Friday.  The Enron London Admin.
who is handling this for us is Karin Ahamer and her phone number is
44-207-783-4419.

I will forward your original email attachments with the changes later
this afternoon.  Let me know if you have any questions or I can help in
any way.  Thanks.

Shirley,

Thank you for letting me know.

Would you send the copies from the US or from your London office (which
is
just across the road from ours)? If you could get them to copy the
presentation, that would be brilliant. If not, I think it is too
complicated
and too expensive for you to send them from the US. I would then try and
take care of the copying myself (but would prefer not to, as it the run
up
to the conference is fairly frantic as it is...).

Thank you for your help!

Kind Regards,

Angelika Staude

Angelica:

I apologize, but I spoke with Vince and he is unable to get his
presentation to you as
requested.  We will have to make copies and mail them.  Please let me
know where to
mail them.

He will email you a copy as soon as he can.
