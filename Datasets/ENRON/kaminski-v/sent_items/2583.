Paolo,

I should finish the review in a day or two. 
We were quite busy here in Enron for the last few days.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I would appreciate if you could let me know if you have completed to review
the article entitled: "Let's Swing Again (Pricing Non-Storable Commodity
Options" by Grimwood and Hodges.

I have recently received a call from one of the authors and I promised him
that I would have sent them the report as soon as possible. Please let me
know.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

Best regards,

Paolo
