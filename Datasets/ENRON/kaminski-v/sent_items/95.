Vince,

Happy New Year.  Would you mind if I used you as a recommender for a job I am
currently chasing at Cisco Systems, Inc.?  I have been talking to them about
an Assistant Treasurer job.  The opportunity came through an executive search
firm, Heidrick & Struggles, and they would like to visit with some people in
regard to my background, deal skills, origination skills and integrity.
Thank you very much.  I hope all is well and I look forward to catching up
soon.

Kind regards,

-Larry-
