Alex,

It probably makes sense to wait a few months to see if you really like Dynegy.
We can meet for lunch anyway sometimes in the next few weeks. Please, call me at
713 853 3848.

Vince

Hello Vince:

  We had spoken over the phone in late May, and setup an appointment to see
each other on 24 July 2001.  A few days later Yannis Tzamouranis called me
from Dynegy, and Dynegy moved very quickly to hire me.  I have a wife and a
kid, and I was a $25K/annum post-doc.  I simply couldn't wait.  From lunch
on 25 May, I was essentially hired by Yannis on 3 July.
  Yesterday I attended an INFORMS meeting with a presentor from Enron:
Chonawee Supatgiat, Research Group, Enron Corp.  I enjoyed his talk.  I am
enjoying Dynegy, but I'm learning that the possibilities of doing research
will be limited for a while to come, the weather group being so new to
Dynegy.  Ultimately, I'm interested in working both in the research and in
the business side.  Regarding looking for research work, I am now literally
in a much better position to consider my options - including Enron.

Alex
