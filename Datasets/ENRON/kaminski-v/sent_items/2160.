Ed,

I am sure I shall screw up sooner or later (given my aging brain and
amount of work). This  guy will have to change his name
to Ed Krapels to stay employed.

Vince,

I think this other guy used to be named John Smith but changed his name to
Vince Kaminski to get a job in the power sector!

Ed,

I am still here.
Kaminski is a very popular Polish name.

My next stage in life, when it happens , is a small cottage
close to a beach, not another corporate job.
