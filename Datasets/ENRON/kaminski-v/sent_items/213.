Britt,

It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
complained to me about the same problem.

I hope you can look into.

Vince
