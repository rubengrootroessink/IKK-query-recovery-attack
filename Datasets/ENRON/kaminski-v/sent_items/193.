Vince,

We have backup tapes for deleted email.  David Cohen is aware of this and in fact we are following Wilmer Cutler's advice on all of these issues.  Britt's message is in response to a recently-received subpoena and is a precaution until we can speak with the Wilmer lawyers.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Bob

	Britt,

	It seems that the problem starts with our IT department. Recently, messages older than
	30 days disappeared both from my Inbox and Sent Items folders. This happened in spite
	of the recent decision to extend the 30-day retention period indefinitely. Several of my associates,
	who were interviewed by David Cohen (for the Special Committee), 
	complained to me about the same problem.

	I hope you can look into.

	Vince
