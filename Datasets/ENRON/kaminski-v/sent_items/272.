Ann,

I shall be glad to help you in any way I can. Please, give me a call
(713 853 3848) to set up a meeting.

I shall ask Shirley to distribute your message to the entire group
and ask for the volunteers who will be interested in discussing
their experience with you.

Vince

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the r=
ichly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created amon=
g members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" =
issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse=
 team environment.  =20
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like =
to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and shar=
e learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron iss=
ues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with y=
ou and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be app=
roved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed a=
nd approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive=
 any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing=
 the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, pre=
viously-published works I've done. =20
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  =
On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture t=
he wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you ha=
ve interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with m=
e further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully,=20
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)
