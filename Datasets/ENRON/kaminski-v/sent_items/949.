Iris

I have just had  confirmation of your acceptance as a Securities and Financ=
ial Derivatives Representative by the SFA.  The confirmation document will =
be maintained on your SFA file here in Compliance - please let me know if y=
ou would like a copy for your own records (are you still in London?)

Please note that any future events that may effect your registration status=
 (change of departments, job change/promotion etc) should be discussed in t=
he first place, with your immediate supervisor to see whether your existing=
 registration is sufficient for your new role.  Registration as an SFDR all=
ows you to carry out the duties of a registered representative in relation =
to any investment or security for which Enron has been authorised by the SF=
A with the exception of commodity derivatives.  If you did move to one of t=
he commodity desks based within the UK, then you would need to upgrade your=
 registration by passing the 'commodity derivatives' module and becoming a =
General Representative.  If doubt remains please contact either myself or J=
onathan Marsh (SFA Compliance Officer) for further advice.  Other factors s=
uch as change of personal address, events that may effect your good reputat=
ion and character (please see the attachments to this message), transfer to=
 a different Enron office etc should be advised to Jonathan Marsh (SFA Comp=
liance Officer) or me as soon as practicable.

As your registration was the result of a transfer, I would be grateful if y=
ou could complete the attached qusetionnaire relating to your 'good reputat=
ion and character'.  We require all our SFA representatives to submit this =
upon first registration and thereafter on an annual basis.=20
