Vince, I sent the message below to Darrell today.

Hi, Darrell,
how are you?

We reviewed and modified the paper about our new VAR method, tried to
make it
readable and take in account your comments. Discussions with Vince
helped a lot also.

Can you, please, review the paper again?

Highly appreciate your input,

Tanya
