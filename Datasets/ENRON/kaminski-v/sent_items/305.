I don't know if it makes a difference now, but I want to let you know where I'm at, at this point.  My doctors visit yesterday confirmed that the blockage has returned and some action is recommended to try and correct it.  The problem is that actions short of a by-pass leave a 40% chance of a second recurrence.  A significantly reduced work schedule seems an important part of any long term solution.
 
As a result, Ann and I plan to return to Michigan no later than February where I would take a few months to recover my health.  Part time work, at best, may then be an option for me.
 
As I expect you will have to eliminate many research positions, I would prefer to be included in the first wave.
 
I want to thank you for the opportunity to work in your group for the last year and a half.  I have enjoyed the work and the tremendous learning opportunity.  The collegial atmosphere and the broad range of expertise you have assembled made it a delight to come to work each day.  All of us have gained from the time we spent at Enron.
 
I've chosen this e-mail because I expect you will be extremely busy for the next few days.  I would be happy to talk more if you like.
 
Bob
