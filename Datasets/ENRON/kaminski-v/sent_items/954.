Nelson,

June 19 works for me.
We have to double check with Gary to make sure it's 
OK with him to proceed at this time.

Nelson,

I have scheduled the Sparks meeting in Memphis for June 19th.  The only other day available during the month is June 18th.  Can you please confirm that this date works for Vince, Vasant and you.  Thanks and I'll see you later today at Cabo's.

Ted
