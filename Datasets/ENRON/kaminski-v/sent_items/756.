ANALYSIS
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_analyses.asp
?	Who matters most - stakeholders or shareholders?
?	Risk managers neglect overseas operations at their peril.
?	Mobile banking is on the way - but will banks benefit from it?

BASLE RESOURCES
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp
Now you can find all ERisk&#8217;s comprehensive coverage of the Basle II proposals on bank capital adequacy in one place: www.erisk.com/news/news_basle.asp.

BASLE SPECIAL
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
Continuing our special coverage of the proposed new regulatory capital rules, we look at Basle&#8217;s approach to operational risk. Rob Jameson explores the proposals to set a regulatory capital charge for op risk, and canvasses industry opinion on how they might work in practice.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
In this special Q&A, Ashish Dev of KeyBank talks to ERisk about what his bank has discovered so far from its internal testing on the impact of the new Basle proposals. It&#8217;s too early to say for sure, but many banks may not find much reason to improve their risk management practices. You can find out Dev's perspective on the Basle proposal in our iConference archive.
