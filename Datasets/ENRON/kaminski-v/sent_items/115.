Michael Levy will be out of the office on business until on or about January 22, 2002.  He will have some limited access to e-mails and will respond as quickly as he can.  In addition, please feel free to contact his secretary, Megan Morgan, at (202) 295-8416, if you need to reach him immediately.  You may also leave him a voicemail at (202) 295-8414, and he will get back to you as soon as he can.
Thanks.
