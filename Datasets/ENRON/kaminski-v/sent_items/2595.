Vince:
         I apologize for the lateness of this notice, but we are offering
our first "Econophysics" course this fall.  The course announcement from
Joe McCauley is attached.  If there are any individuals there who might
want to take or sit in on the course, they can do so as Post Bac. students
with minimal complications...  We will have our Econophysics program web
site up shortly, and I will send you the URL when that happens.

                                                 Larry Pinsky
