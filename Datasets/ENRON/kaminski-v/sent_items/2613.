Vince:

The proposed topics are sketched out in Amy Richard's message below (basically what the Bonn Accords mean for the future of energy, especially in the U.S.), but Steve may, after further discussions with Amy, decide that another topic is a better choice.  I am sure they are flexible.

We'll wait a day or so and give Steve a call.  I am sharing this with Amy Richard who will call Steve.  I will be in close touch with Amy on this matter and I look forward to meeting Steve.

Thanks very much in advance for giving us an introduction.

Paul

Paul,

Thanks for your message. Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years
with the company.
The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF
OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586
EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .

I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can
you indicate the subject
of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?

Vince

   Vince:

   We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good
   meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now
   interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

   On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would
   be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron
   (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).
   Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his
   replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in
   asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so
   that he knows we are doing some work together.

   Thanks in advance.

   Paul

   Paul,

   The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested
   in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn,
   senior vice president, Environmental and International Government
   Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said
   he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though
   I could not verify that he is now.

   The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the
   near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus
   strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How
   is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse
   gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30
   to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

   I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let
   me know if there is any other information you need.

   Thank you,
   Amy

   Hi Amy,
   Did a little search on Enron's website and happened upon the guy's name.
   Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International
   Government Affairs. Not sure if he is still with the company but see
   what your professor thinks. I will try to get my hands on his paper from
   the March 1997 meeting as well.

   Michael

   Hi Michael

   Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
   Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
   ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
   of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
   that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
   for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
   Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
   the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
   still be there but we can try.

   Thanks-
   Amy Richard
