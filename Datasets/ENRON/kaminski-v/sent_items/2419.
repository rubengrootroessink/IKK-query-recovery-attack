Hi Presly,

Thanks for the message.
Things have slowed down for me
and it's time to enjoy the summer.

I wander if you have heard from Enron's HR people?

Talk to you soon.

Vince

How are things going? We just got back in from back to back trips. Dawn had a
Shoe Show in NY City and Vegas. I tagged along for an inexpensive vacation
for myself. Dawn worked pretty much all day, each day, but I had a lot of
free time to enjoy.

Hope all is well. Drop us a note when you get a chance.

Presly
