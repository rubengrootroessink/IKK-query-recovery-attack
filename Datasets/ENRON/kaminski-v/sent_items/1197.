Shijie,

My apologies for the delay. As you know we have hit some turbulence here at Enron
and I was quite busy.

The title of the talk:


Measurement of  Volatility in the Energy Markets:

1. Importance  of volatility in financial engineering
	a. option pricing
	b. risk management
	c. legacy software systems

2. Is volatility the right tool for energy markets?

3. The dynamics of energy prices in the US markets in recent years: a few stylized facts

4. Alternative theoretical tools to represent price dynamics: the importance 
   of dialogue between academics and practitioners


Also, can you give me some indication of the timing
of different meetings?

Vince

Vince,

As your upcoming visit to our school is on next Thursday, could you please
send me the title and abstract of your talk as soon as possible so
that I could make the seminar announcement to our faculty and students
soon.  Thanks.
