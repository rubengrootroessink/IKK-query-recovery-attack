Forecasting Challenges in Electricity Markets

Today's electricity markets are more challenging to predict than ever. Discover the keys to managing risk in volatile energy markets.
The conference venue is the beautiful Skamania Lodge in the scenic Columbia River Gorge--45 minutes East of Portland International Airport, Portland, Oregon.  A mind expanding setting for an executive-and professional level exchange of information and strategies concerning North American energy markets. 
Navigating Today's Energy Markets
The challenges of taming energy markets don't begin and end in California. Volatility and risk are present in every market region, forcing all participants to carefully examine the underlying factors and accurately assess their current and future market positions. 
For the 4th year, EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORA? electric market model, has assembled a stimulating program of interest to any company exposed to energy market risks.  This year's agenda includes a detailed look at the various energy trading regions in the U.S. and Canada - an exploration of market conditions and market dynamics. 
This year's conference will feature thoughtful exchanges on:
Electric and Gas Markets - 2001 and Beyond
U.S. Markets: Crisis in the West, Emerging Issues in the East and ERCOT
Keys to U.S. Electric and Gas Forward Markets
Issues in Canadian Markets
Gas Hedging Strategies and Electric Markets
Price and Volume Volatility in Turbulent Markets
New Resources: When and Where to Develop?

You'll hear from top-level speakers representing companies that have been there - Williams Energy Marketing, FPL Energy, NYMEX, ENRON, DTE Energy, Deutsche Bank and others. Plus there will be informative "roll-up-your-sleeves" sessions on applied forecasting techniques by Williams Energy Marketing, Pinnacle West, GenerSys, Southern California Edison.
