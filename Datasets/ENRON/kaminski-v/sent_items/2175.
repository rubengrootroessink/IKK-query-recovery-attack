Ehud,

Sorry for the delay in replying to your message.
I was on the road a lot. I am in London right now and
plan to attend the conference.

I am leaving on Saturday morning for Houston.

I have asked Shirley to get tickets for one of the evening you mentioned.
I should know by Thursday if the tickets are available.

Vince

Vince:

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
-- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.

Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.

Hope all is well.  Best,
Ehud
