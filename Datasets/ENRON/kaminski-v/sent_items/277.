Dear Vince,

Thank you for meeting me the other week when I came to Houston. As
discussed, please find attached the draft agenda for EPRM 2002 USA which
will be taking place in Houston on 14 & 15 May next year. I would be pleased
to hear your opinion of the programme - in particular if you feel I have
missed anything out or confused any of the issues.

We also discussed you speaking at the event again. I do not know what your
situation is now with the events of the past couple of weeks, but I would be
delighted if you could take part in the conference - please feel free to
choose any of the talks on the programme. (No titles or bullet points are
rigid - you can alter one to suit you.)

Many thanks for all your help with this. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Victoria
