Vince-

Good news. Martin's box is working wonderfully- I'll have everything transferred to it and give him the keys by Friday.

This was (another) nice deal for Enron. We save $21,000 in real money this way, the cash refund Sun is giving Enron for our other server, using a box that wasn't being used by anyone. I'm happy about this.

Clayton
