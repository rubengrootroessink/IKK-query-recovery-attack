Siebel Summary
EIM's ability to rapidly transform its designated forest products and steel markets is dependent upon its ability to effectively manage the market participants and accelerate their adoption of EIM's business strategy.  To achieve this objective, EIM will implement Siebel Sales Enterprise, a customer-focused centralized database that effectively leverages all information learned about our customers and enables sharing of this information throughout the front, mid and back offices.  Siebel is designed to help in-house and mobile sales professionals in large organizations manage accounts, contacts, activities and opportunities associated with the sales cycle.  EIM Fundamentals is leading the Siebel implementation effort.
