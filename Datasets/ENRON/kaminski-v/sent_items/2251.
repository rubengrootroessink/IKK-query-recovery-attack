Vince:

The only association that I show that you belong to is the IAFE.  Is that correct?

Let me know if there are any others.

Thanks!

Dear All:

I am gathering information for a project in Corporate Human Resources. We are in the process of compling a list of Professional Associations that the Managing Directors are members of.  Would you please take a few minutes and respond with the name of
any association(s) that the your manager is a member of.

Thanks in advance for your prompt response and attention in this matter.

Regards,
