Steve,

Shirley  sent you the info about the dinner,  in case you can arrive in time
to join us on Sunday evening. Please, let me know, so that
I can adjust the reservation at the restaurant. 

Bob Lee may be out (a possible operation).

You can reach me over the weekend at my E-mail address: vkaminski@aol.com or call me at home
(281) 367 5377. My cell phone number is (713) 410 5396. I look forward to meeting
you on Sunday or Monday. 

Vince

I'll book my flights in that case, and I'll see you on Monday.

Will Bob Lee be around for me to talk "George" with him too?

Steve

Steve,

Yes, They are coming.
It makes sense for Shirley to confirm it on Friday for you
(I shall be in Dallas) before you hop on  the plane.

The meeting start at 9:00 at the Greg's office.
Hope to see you on Monday.

Vince

Hi Vince/Shirley

Is the Prediction Company still visiting this Monday 30th July?  If so I'll fly over to meet them with you.

Thanks,
Steve
