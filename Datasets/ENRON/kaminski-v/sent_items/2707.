Larry,

I shall be glad to join you at the Colloquium as well.
I haven't lost even one million dollars  yet and I have 
to get up to speed.


Vince

Correction to the last message...

The Colloquium at 3:00 PM on Tuesday, Sept. 25 will be:

COLLOQUIUM TITLE
My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
Adventures on Wall St
Nigel Goldenfeld
Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
1110 West Green St
Urbana
IL 61801
http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel

Abstract
Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
employers of physicists? What is the
quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
might academic physicists gain
experience of real world applications? And
why bother? I discuss these and
other questions in light of my own
experience, starting a software company
to market ultra-fast tools for risk
management of derivative securities.







Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
his visit, at 713 743 3558 (or Gorman@uh.edu).


                                                 Larry
