Gayle,

I need an LDC projector and an overhead projector as a backup.
My PowerPoint  presentation will be on a PC. I shall come early
to test the equipment.

Please give me a few hints:

- exact address
- best parking lot for the building
- how to contact you on arrival.

Vince

Please let me know what equipment you will need for your presentation, so it
will be available in the room in advance.  The location has changed to the
18th floor at the Chase Center. I'll forward the address.  All else remains
the same. Thank you.
Gayle

Gayle,

I got home quite late last night. Here is the title of the presentation:

Credit Risk Management.

   Vince, NACM tells me all they need to approve CEUs is an outline, so
   that's
   all we need.

   Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully,
   this
   has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
   title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.
   If
   you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward
   the
   attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something
   to
   provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
   appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is
   needed
   as soon as possible. Please advise.
   Thank you.

      Gayle,

      November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be leaving
      later
      that
      day for our annual  management conference in San Antonio (around 3:30
      p.m.).
      My recollection is that the presentation is from11:30 till 1:00 so I
      should
      have plenty of time to get to the airport.

      Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall
   send
      you
      the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

      Shirley Crenshaw, my assistant, will send you my bio.

      Vince Kaminski

         Vince, I want to be sure the Houston Energy Group is still on your
         calendar
         for Wed, Nov 14.  The National Association of Credit Managers
   (NACM)
         main
         Houston office has asked if we could invite credit managers from
      other
         industries to attend your session.  I certainly would like to do
   so.

         Can you send me the title of your presentation to be included in
   the
         meeting
         notices?  It would also be helpful if you could send me a bio, so
      that I
         can
         introduce you Properly.
         Thank you very much.
