A meeting is scheduled with Bill White and Don Schroeder at 4:00pm at 19C2. 
Bill and Don would like to talk about P+ pricing / hedging issues and NYMEX
calendar spread option model that Pavel built before his departure.

Please review  the P+ model and the doc prepared by Stinson. Let us talk on
Thursday.

Zimin


Shirley,

Could you secure the meeting room from 4-5pm on Thursday ?
And mark that on Vince's calender if possible. Thanks.
