Dear Vincent,

Thank you very much for your offer. We very much appreciate it. Here
attached you will find a copy of the paper entitled "Let's Swing Again.
Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options" by Russell Grimwood and Stewart
Hodges.

I would appreciate if you could return me the report by the 14th of August.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any problem opening the
file.

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,

Paolo
