Steve,

Yes, They are coming.
It makes sense for Shirley to confirm it on Friday for you
(I shall be in Dallas) before you hop on  the plane.

The meeting start at 9:00 at the Greg's office.
Hope to see you on Monday.

Vince

Hi Vince/Shirley

Is the Prediction Company still visiting this Monday 30th July?  If so I'll fly over to meet them with you.

Thanks,
Steve
