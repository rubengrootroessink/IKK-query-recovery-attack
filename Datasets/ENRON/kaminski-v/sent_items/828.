Let's meet for drinks before you head for the Big Apple.

Dear Vince and Stinson,

Today I announced my resignation from Enron. It's been very interesting and exciting 5 years and I enjoyed working with you. But for various reasons I decided that I need a fresh start in a new place. So I am moving to New York to trade crude oil financial derivatives for HETCO. I may stick around for a couple of weeks to finish up some stuff, the management should tell me today what they want. But if I leave today and cannot stop by to say good bye, then good luck to you and thanks for giving me the opportunity to work at Enron. I can be reached at pzadoro@yahoo.com.

Pavel
