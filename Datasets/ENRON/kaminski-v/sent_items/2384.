Subject:=09Full-Time Associate Orientation - Happy Hour


On Monday August 6, about 75 new full-time Associates will be starting thei=
r careers at Enron.  Attached is a schedule of Orientation Topics, as well =
as an invitation to welcome these Associates at a Happy Hour Monday evening=
.  It would be great if you could stop by, even for just a few minutes, to =
welcome them to the company.  For your convenience, the Happy Hour is at Fa=
rrago, which is less than 6 blocks from the Enron Building.  =20

Members of the Program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is a=
n area that we can improve on, so your participation in events like this ve=
ry important.  An RSVP is not required, but if you plan to attend, please l=
et us know so we can prepare a name tag for you.  Feel free to extend this =
invitation to other senior members of your team.

As always, we appreciate your continued support of The Program.

Regards,
Billy =20
