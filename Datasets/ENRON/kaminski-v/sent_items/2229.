New Add-in Manager

@GLOBAL 5.0 comes with a new add-in manager that makes navigating between
different FEA templates very easy.  Simply open the fea\xlutil\readme.xls
and follow the instructions specified in the spreadsheet.

New Module

@GLOBAL.5 Baskets & Averages  has been added. Prior to this release,
functions in this module were part of the SPAV product.

New Templates

Templates have been added for the new functions and existing templates have
been updated.

New Features

All options now allow for positive or negative input amount. Negative
amounts can be useful to represent short positions. All options can now be
consistently evaluated on expiration date (zero time to expiry). An error is
still returned if the option has already expired (negative time to expiry).
European spread option models (EUDU, ECMXX, EPMNX) now support an
alternative tree implementation.

Speed Improvement

Our tests show a substantial speed improvement (40%-60%) from version 4.2,
especially for computationally demanding models.


If you have any questions please feel free to contact us. We appreciate this
opportunity to be of continuing service to Enron North America Corp..
