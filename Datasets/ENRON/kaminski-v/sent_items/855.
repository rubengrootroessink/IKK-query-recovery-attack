Hi Andrea!

What we have found is the following:

Housing starts by state does not exist from a U.S. Government statistical source however we have been able to find a monthly data source that maybe useful and correlate with housing starts. The U.S. census presently provides building permits on a monthly basis from 1995 to April 2001. The website gets updated on the 20th of each month (i.e. May's statistics will come out on June 20th).  This data is available by state and metropolitan areas (MSA) (e.g. cities and counties). Before January 1995 they have only annual data on a state by state and on a city-by-city basis which starts in 1980 . This website has the monthly data divided up into the actual number of permits given that month and another chart that has year to date permits from the beginning of the year.

By Metropolitan Area

By State:

Although the U.S. Government does not have a statistical source for Housing Starts, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) does provide the information. 
Please note that the NAHB website only displays regional breakdown of housing starts by region.  We called the National Association of Home Builders and they informed us that they do have annual data by state and it is published twice a year for a nominal charge of $250.00.  The person we contacted at the NAHB is Dean Christ at (202) 822-0478.
