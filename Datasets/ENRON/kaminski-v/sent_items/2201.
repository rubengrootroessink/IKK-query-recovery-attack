Attached is a brief note on liquidity with references to a couple of surveys which provide further information.  My attempt was to write at a reasonable degree of simplicity while providing a general familiarity with the attendant issues.  Please comment.  Thanks.

Also, Profs. Maureen O'Hara, Lawrence Glosten, Haim Mendelson, Joel Hasbrouck, Hans Stoll, Albert Kyle, Lawerence Harris, and Ananth Madhavan are some of the leading academics in the field.
