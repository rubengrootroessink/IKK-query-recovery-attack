Mr. Kaminski, 
Thank you for responsding to my voice mail.  I was referred you by Mr. Shilling's office and Alex Triantis who is chairing this conference. Currently, I am developing an executive level conference on Real Options Valuation. This our fifth conference in our successful series on ROV.  I would like to invite you to present at this Conference.  I have several ideas with regards to the potential topic. I am in the preliminary stages in the production cycle.  This conference will take place October 15-16, 2001 in New Orleans.  I have enclosed a copy of the agenda outline.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks, 
Mike
