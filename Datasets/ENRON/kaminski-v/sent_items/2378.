Vince:

Greetings.

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
Affairs Mike Rosen.

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
whether you would prefer a subset thereof.

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
Finance Director Angela Dorsey at Angela.Dorsey@bus.utexas.edu (Tel.:
512-232-7386) to coordinate matters.

Best,
Ehud
