                        as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."



                        "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human
                        stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."

                        "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World
                         War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."



                        "I never think of the future - it comes soon enough."

                        "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is
                        at all comprehensible."



                        "The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem. It has
                         merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one."



                        "The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."



                        "You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war."



                        "If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts."



                        "Imagination is more important than knowledge..."



                        "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious.  It is
                        the source of all true art and science."
