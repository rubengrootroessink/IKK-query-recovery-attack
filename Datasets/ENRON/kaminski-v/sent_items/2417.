Frank,

I looked at your resume. There is no good fit with my group.
I have forwarded your resume to 2 different units of Enron
(Enron Industrial Markets) and Enron Networks. They may be interested in your skills.

It was a pleasure talking with you a few moments  ago.  As discussed, please find attached my resume in Word.  For your  convenience, I also copied a plain text version at the bottom of this  e-mail.
 
I would appreciate the opportunity to briefly visit  with you at your convenience to learn more about the energy industry and  where I should further seek to identify opportunities.
 
The easiest way to reach me is at 281-531-7990 or  by return e-mail.
