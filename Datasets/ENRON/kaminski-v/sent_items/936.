Thanks Beth,

I tried this address twice and have twice been notified that the message
could not be delivered. Would please pass the attached message on to Vince.

On other matters, I wonder if your firm would be interested in hiring some
of our very outstanding finance grads. We have an undergraduate, MBA, M.Sc.
and Ph.D. program. I could provide you with more information if you would
like.

all the best
ron

Vince, I received a message that the first message was not delivered and
hence am resending. I apologize if you in fact receive two messages.


Hi Vince,

During our chat at the Texas Finance Festival you spoke of the need to hire
technically competent yet creative individuals. I know of someone you might
be interested in.

We run an M.Sc. program in Finance at UBC. One of our graduates came into
our program with a Ph.D in physics and went on to be one of our top
graduates. He spent his summer at the Bank of Canada and they hired him upon
graduation. He is currently in their Calgary office. I happened to be
corresponding with him recently and he mentioned that he would like to leave
the Bank but stay in Calgary. I thought of Enron as a possibility and
wondered if you thought there would be some interest. I think he would make
an outstanding contribution to any firm he worked for.

I hope you don't mind this imposition but I didn't want potential gains from
trade to pass by. If you are interested, please let me know.

Hope all is well with you.

Cheers
ron
