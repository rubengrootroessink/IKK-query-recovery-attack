Shirley:
Vince will be arriving in Austin at 8:36 AM on CO flight #1841
He will probably be at your office around 9:30 AM.Permit me to recommend that you consider re-booking him on CO #1045, with an ETD of 9:35 a.m. and an Austin airport ETA of 10:28.  I teach a (non-energy) class from 9:30 - 11, so Vince's arrival on that later flight would work.  Alternatively, if he arrives at 9:30 he is most welcome to attend my 9:30 class or simply work in my office as he wishes.
Either way, let me know what you have confirmed for him.  Thanks,
Ehud Ronn
