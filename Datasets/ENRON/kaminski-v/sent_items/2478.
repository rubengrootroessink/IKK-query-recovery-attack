Cost Center Managers:

I must turn in preliminary headcount numbers for the 2002 plan no later than tomorrow.  Could each of you please return your plan headcount spreadsheets or let me know your expected headcount for 2002?  Please keep in mind that these numbers can be adjusted later as necessary.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Thanks,
Diane
