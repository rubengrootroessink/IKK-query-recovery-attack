Brian,

What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.

There are several bars at the center.

The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
interesting - it's a comedy day.

Vince
