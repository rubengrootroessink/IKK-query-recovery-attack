Hello Vince
 
It was good talking to you yesterday. I am sure you will be beseeched with numerous new opportunities.
 
Find enclosed the electronic copy of the TrueHelp documents I gave you.  Could you pls send me your home email address and phone number.
 
Should I conclude that you will be happy to continue on the board of TrueHelp or are you still trying to decide ?
 
Regards 
 
 
Harry
