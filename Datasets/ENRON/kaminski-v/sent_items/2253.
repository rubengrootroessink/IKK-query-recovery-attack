Les,

Thanks. I shall take a look at the article tonight.
Would you like to meet for dinner on Monday or Tuesday
when you are in Houston? If you have made commitments for 
the evenings, we can meet during the day either on Monday or Tuesday.

Vince

Hi Vince

Attached is a draft of the next EPRM article. Apologies for the short notice
again but if you can send us comments by Mon that would be good.

Also I'll be in Houston from Sun 22nd July to Tue 24th - would you like to
meet up?

Regards

Les.
