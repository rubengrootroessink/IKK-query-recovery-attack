Ehud,

Thanks for your  message.

I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley 
for Jeff. I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.

Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.


Vince

Vince / Rick,

Greetings.

With the two-week passage of time since the 8/14 announcement, I write at
this time to inquire:

1.  Has sufficient time elapsed for this to be a propitious time to raise
this issue?
2.  Does the issue require re-visiting, and would a renewed invitation be
favorably received by both Skilling and Enron?

My colleagues and I look forward to Vince's 9/10 visit.  Best,
Ehud
