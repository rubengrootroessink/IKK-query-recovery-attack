>ABSTRACT:
> In earlier work we showed we could not reject the hypothesis
> that returns to investments in Turkey's stock market were
> positive functions of risk generated by the World outside Turkey
> and by risks unique to Turkey. We found statistical evidence of
> Turkey's internal risks producing substantial returns and
> changes in returns over time. This article carries the analysis
> further by bringing our earlier results into a more concrete
> environment, asking whether these risks can be profitably
> managed as a practical matter. In particular we consider results
> of two strategies in trading cross-market portfolios. We examine
> a long position in the ISE Dollar Return Index, offset by a
> short position in the S&P 500 Composite Total Returns Index. In
> this analysis we verify profitability directly by computing
> actual profit produced by an implementable trading strategy. We
> identify our two portfolio management strategies using
> Value-at-Risk-inspired measures of risk and return. We also
> examine the importance of secondary issues in portfolio
> management, such as identification of buy and sell signals and
> selection of a trading position.
>
> We examine two issues determining the performance of a trading
> position in this cross-market portfolio. First, are there
> predictable and substantial periods of time when it is good to
> be long Turkey and short the Rest of the World and the reverse?
> Second, how important is it to monitor the time path of the
> risks unique to Turkey's Financial Markets in comparing returns
> in Turkish and World Markets? Our answers are first, Yes and
> second, Very.

>ABSTRACT:
> Electricity prices are known to be very volatile and subject to
> frequent jumps due to system breakdown, demand shocks, and
> inelastic supply. As many international electricity markets are
> in some state of deregulation, more and more participants in
> these markets are exposed to these stylised facts. Appropriate
> pricing, portfolio, and risk management models should
> incorporate these facts. Authors have introduced stochastic jump
> processes to deal with the jumps, but we argue and show that
> this specification might lead to problems with identifying the
> true mean-reversion within the process. Instead, we propose
> using a regime jump model that disentangles mean-reversion from
> jump behaviour. This model resembles more closely the true price
> path of electricity prices.

>ABSTRACT:
> We propose and test a novel economic mechanism that generates
> stock return predictability on both the time series and the
> cross section. In our model, investors' income has two sources,
> wages and dividends, that grow stochastically over time. As a
> consequence, the fraction of total income produced by wages
> changes over time de-pending on economic conditions. We show
> that as this fraction fluctuates, the risk premium that
> investors require to hold stocks varies as well. We test the
> main implications of the model and find substantial support for
> it. A regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor
> income to consumption ratio produces statistically significant
> coefficients and adjusted R2 's that are larger than those
> generated when using the dividend price ratio. Tests of the
> cross sectional implication find considerable improvements on
> the performance of both the conditional CAPM and CCAPM when
> compared to their unconditional counterparts.

> This paper models the incentives created by career concerns for
> opinion-producing agents. We find that career concerns can
> create an incentive for exaggeration or anti-herding, since
> high-ability agents will have opinions that are more different
> from the consensus on average and potential clients will learn
> more quickly about how different an agent's opinions are from
> the consensus on average that about whether or not they are
> exaggerating. The model predicts that agents should exaggerate
> more when they are under-rated by their clients, when the
> realizations of the variables they are forecasting are expected
> to be especially noisy, and when they expect to make fewer
> future forecasts. We find that these predictions are consistent
> with the empirical data on equity analyst's earnings forecasts.

>ABSTRACT:
> We examine the relative prices of "sibling" American Depositary
> Receipts (ADRs). These ADRs are issued by the same foreign firms
> against shares with different voting rights. Though superior and
> inferior voting siblings begin their US trading experience at
> nearly equal values, relative prices of Mexican and non-Mexican
> sibling ADRs quickly move in opposite directions. Superior
> voting ADRs command a median premium for non-Mexican firms, but
> a median discount for Mexican issuers. The Mexican evidence
> represents an extreme exception to the inverse relation between
> the voting premium documented in other countries and the degree
> of legal protection enjoyed by outside shareholders. This
> apparent anomaly cannot be explained by differences in cash flow
> rights, total or systematic risk, liquidity, voting control of
> major blockholders, or ownership restrictions. Despite voting
> premiums and discounts, neither sibling in most pairs appears to
> have been an attractive investment for US investors.

>ABSTRACT:
> We use data during 1989-97 to compare the quality of three
> quarterly earnings measures: 'The Street', a pro-forma operating
> income proxy obtained from firms' earnings releases and two
> earnings measures obtained from 10-Q and 10-K reports: EPS from
> operations and EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued
> operations. Three techniques are used to assess quality:
> predictive ability, valuation relevance and information content.
> Predictive ability is examined by determining which measure is
> the most accurate predictor of future quarterly earnings four
> quarters hence. We assess valuation relevance by identifying
> which earnings measure has the most explanatory power and the
> highest earnings multiplier. We determine information content by
> finding which measure has the most explanatory power and
> generates the highest earnings response coefficient. Based on
> our three techniques to assess earnings quality, we find that a
> timely pro-forma operating income measure released by managers
> ('The Street') is of higher quality than either EPS from
> operations or EPS before extraordinary items and discontinued
> operations. Regulators are concerned that users of financial
> statements are misled by pro-forma earnings releases, and that
> they should rely instead on information in financial reports.
> Our findings suggest that users of financial information can
> obtain higher quality earnings measures using pro-forma
> operating income numbers released by managers than they can by
> perusing less timely 10-Q and 10-K filings with the Securities
> and Exchange Commission.

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper analyzes the timing of IPOs by treating the
> going-public decision as a real option. Investors value the
> private firm using publicly observed market prices of firms from
> the same industry. With stochastically evolving market values
> firm insiders want to leave open the option of taking the firm
> public later, after a positive price shock. Going public
> exercises this option, which must be viewed as a cost of
> undertaking an IPO. Optimal exercising of the option dictates
> that IPOs should only occur after price run-ups. Firms never go
> public in a down market because the value of waiting is too
> great. These incentives can lead to clustering of IPOs near
> market peaks. The results generalize to seasoned issues. Each
> equity offering is for a unique fraction of the total ownership
> claim for the firm and is associated with its own timing option.
> Each equity issue is independent of all the others, and
> therefore the timing of an offering is unaffected by subsequent
> issues. Each equity issue is likely to follow an abnormal price
> increase.
