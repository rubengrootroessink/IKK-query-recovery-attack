Good to hear you are enjoying a little slower summer schedule. Never hurts to
have a change of pace.

Wish I could say so, but no I have not heard a word from anyone over in HR.

And speaking of Enron, ironically I finally met Beth Perlman (and her Mom) at
a party Dawn and I attended while we where in NY.
