Louise,

Jim Fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to NETCO takes place. He is my current boss.

I am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here. All I need 
is a formal letter or an E-mail. Another alternative is to extend 
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion.

Vince

There is clearly an issue here - we have been asking for this for weeks now.

Mark please help resolve.

Please, keep in mind, that the members of the Research Group
who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving 
for good, in a week. We have to accelerate the process.

Vince

Does the state have copies of all programs?  Should systems manage the migration?  Muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen?
