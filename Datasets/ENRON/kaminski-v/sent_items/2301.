Gina,

I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only"
lunch. I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati,
who studies Italian on his own.

What about Tuesday next week?

Mr. Kaminski;

It was a delight talking with you the other day, and I was especially happy to have such a pleasant conversation in Italian.  

I hope that we can get together again sometime to for a chat, and maybe a lunch.  I look forward to meeting you again.  
 
All the best

Gina Corteselli
