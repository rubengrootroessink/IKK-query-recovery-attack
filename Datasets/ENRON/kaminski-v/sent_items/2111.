Vince,
 
Henwood is in the process of developing a new  product that, for lack of a better name, we are calling Market Stack.  The  purpose is to allow traders to utilize the load and supply data in EMSS without  the hassle of a full-blown simulation.  The software would be designed to  allow traders to develop a market (or supply) stack with a minimum number of  keystrokes.  The stacks could be developed for a utility, transarea, or  region, would contain load data, and would be capable of incorporating real-time  information to provide fundamental insight and market advantage.   
 
At this point in the process we are looking for  ideas (and sponsors).  If you think your traders might be open to the idea,  I would like to talk to you and them about it, and potentially as early as next  week.
 
Please advise.
 
Thanks,
Eric
