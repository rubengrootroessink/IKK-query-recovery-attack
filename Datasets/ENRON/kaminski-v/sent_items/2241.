Dear Vince,

I am curious whether you are familiar with the attached Darden school case
on Enron... FYI.

John Martin and I would really like to try to interest you in coming to
campus sometime this fall to present a faculty seminar.  Selfishly, I would
also like to try arrange such a visit so that I can have you present to my
risk management class.  I called Shirley Crenshaw today, and she mentioned
that you were on your way back from Poland, so I hope we'll be able to talk
soon about the possibility of a visit this fall.  The best number for
reaching me is 512-751-3709.

Thanks,

Jim Garven
