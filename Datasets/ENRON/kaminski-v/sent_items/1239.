Todd,

Thanks for the opportunity to speak at the conference.
It was a great pleasure to see you again.

Zimin Lu briefed me about Tuesday and Wednesday and told
me the presentations were very interesting.

Vince

Vince --

Thanks again for participating in Monday's preconference workshop on
Volatility. Your remarks on modeling volatility and option valuation were
most appreciated by the attendees and me.

I am sorry you weren't able to make the storage conference on Tuesday and
Wednesday. It was a very engaging discussion of valuation issues, from many
different perspectives.

Best wishes in your business activities during these volatile times.
