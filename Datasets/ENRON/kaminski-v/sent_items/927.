Sandeep

Attached is the Dabhol Report in PDF format. It could be that the Enron
server does not accept winzip attachments and therefore, I have converted it
to PDF format. It has also been sent separately to the yahoo email address.

As per our telephone conversation today, I am resending the email message
(report attached) that I had sent earlier. I assume that you must have
received the report as I did not receive any undelivered email message.

Could you me give me a call to confirm receipt of this email.

Regards

Narottam



Sandeep

Here is the copy of the Dabhol Report. Just to be sure, I have also sent
separately a copy attached with the earlier message.
