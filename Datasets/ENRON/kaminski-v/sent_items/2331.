Dear Dr. Kaminski,

On behalf of Dean Arthur Warga, I would like to confirm our visit to Enron
on August 3 at 10 a.m. I will also be leaving a phone message to this
effect. We are very much looking forward to meeting you and discussing some
of the issues we talked about on the phone today. Thank you for making the
time, and for your hospitality in arranging the lunch.


Best wishes,

Praveen
