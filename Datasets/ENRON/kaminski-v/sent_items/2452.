Subject:	United Way Campaign Update - Friday, August 10

As of 8:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $685,125 in pledges, which is 53.69% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate is 21.32%.  In comparison to last year, Enron, as a whole, had already reached over 70% of the campaign goal with participation in the 35 to 40% range across the business units.  We are well behind last year's campaign at this point.

If you are encouraging your direct reports to rally the troops, here are the instructions into the system.  Additionally, if employees are out of the office or do not have the time, they can call or e-mail me at ext. 3-9053 to complete their contribution.

Click on https://hrglobal.enron.com to make a contribution and learn more about this year's campaign. You will need your GIS ID (which is your "9" number, not your "P" number) and password.  If you are not sure what your ID and password are, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"  If you have questions regarding access, please call the HRGIM help desk at ext. 3-5666.

Please make your electronic pledge no later than Friday, August 17.
