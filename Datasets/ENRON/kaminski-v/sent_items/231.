Seminars/Forums, etc. Sub Group

I met with Denise on December 16th and here is a recap of the discussion
relative to our sub group for your information.

Seminars

-Probably no more than 4 per year
-Good curriculum makes a significant difference (ie. quality)
-Keep at a reasonable cost
-Nymex provides seminars which have an audience of 35 to 50
-Denise's experience is that people like topics that are practical adding to
their skill
  base

Forums

- Broader topics than seminars with range of experts
- Can range in size from small groups to very large ballroom settings
- Marketing makes a big difference in turn out

Conferences

- Generally not as excited about conferences
- Shouldn't try one this year
- If do one, keep focused on one topic, not multiple tracks
- Should be lean and mean, cost effective, 2 days max

Nymex has many contacts and should be able to help on marketing events and
perhaps  doing some sponsorship.  Probably should charge for non members for
these events but needs to be reasonable.  Small training sessions could be an
opportunity.

Denise, hope this is a reasonable summary; please add anything I have left
out.
