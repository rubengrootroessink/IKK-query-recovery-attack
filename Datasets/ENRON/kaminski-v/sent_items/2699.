Dear Mr.Kaminski

As suggested by you in your below message, I am getting in touch with you in
September. Please consider my application for a suitable position in
Quantitative Research / Structuring / Trading / Risk Management. I have a
strong quantitative finance background and investment banking experience for
energy projects, in particular, valuation of energy assets and modelling for
power projects.

I have knowledge of pricing, hedging and modeling Energy Derivatives and
have experience in valuing energy assets both by conventional techniques and
newer methods like real options. Also, knowledge of VaR other risk
management systems, Monte Carlo simulations, etc. My thesis during my
Masters was for Dresdner Kleinwort in Singapore on newer energy sources. I
have done extensive modeling work and am very knowledgable about the energy
industry in the US.

I am a graduate in Financial Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and
Nanyang Technological University. I have also completed my MBA from XIMB, a
reputed business school in India. My research interests include real options
valuation, risk management, energy trading & derivatives and structured
products.

I believe that with my background, knowledge, skills and experience I will
do my best to meet the challenges and responsibilities of a demanding
assignment. The company will have to sponsor my employment visa in the US. I
have no location preferences and am willing to travel.

I look forward to hearing from you. You can reach me at 469-241-9775. Thank
