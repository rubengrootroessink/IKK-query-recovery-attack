Vince,

I'm glad you can come.  I'm very sorry about what happened at Enron.

I look forward to getting a chance to hook-up with you.

I will go ahead and have you registered, without affiliation, unless you
give me one.

Look forward to it.

Michael

	Michael,

	I really appreciate it. It will be a great opportunity to give
you
	an update about my plans. I hope to continue working
	in the energy industry and continue as a customer of CERA once
	I move to a new position. My last day at Enron will be January
the 31st.
	My personal E-mail address in the interim period is
vkaminski@aol.com.

	I assume I can just show up on the first day of your conference.


	Vince

	   Vince,

	   The CERA contract with Enron has expired, but it would be my
pleasure to
	   invite you as my guest this year.  Let me know if you would
be
	   interested.

	   Michael
