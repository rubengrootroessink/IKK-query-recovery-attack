Donald,

Thanks for your interest in Enron. I shall be glad to talk to you
about the energy industry needs for quants and what you can
do to prepare yourself for the job search.
Please, call me at 713 853 3848 to set up a meeting
or call my assistant, Shirley Crenshaw, at 713 853 5290.

The prospects for employment with Enron, in your field, are rather uncertain
at this point. I do not anticipate any hiring over the next 12 months.

Vince Kaminski

Hello Vince,

I would like to reiterate my interest in meeting with you to gain a better idea of the type of work conducted within your group at Enron.  This would provide me with an opportunity to see if the activities within your group fit with my expectations.  Additionally, I could expound on my interest and work concerning numerical methods for pricing and hedging derivative securities.  A formal interview could be established at a later date.  For your reference, I've attached a copy of my resume.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
-donald
