Anne,

No problem. I have retained Debra to offer a course for 20 persons in October.
You are very welcome to attend.

Vince,

Please accept my apologies for not being able to meet with you and Debra on Friday.  I was in a meeting that I could not gracefully depart from.  However, I am very interested in learning what Debra suggested, and what decisions were made.  

Thanks,
Anne
