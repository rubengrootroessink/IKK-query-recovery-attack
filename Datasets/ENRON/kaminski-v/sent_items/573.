I have talked twice to Althea.  Once last week and once after your email this morning.  She has told me both times that she would arrange with Shirley to put Rusty on your schedule and on mine.

Dear Stinson,

I would like to call your attention to Rusty Parks, who is an MBA student here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall.  Rusty is a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest in topics such as financial engineering and technology, particularly as these issues pertain to the energy industry.   In fact, you met Rusty during your recent visit to Baylor (specifically, last month over dinner at the Gamma Iota Sigma chartering  ceremony).

I happen to know that Rusty is already scheduled to visit Enron for an interview for a summer internship on April 19.  He has been invited by Althea Gordon.  If there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his visit, I am sure that he would be most grateful.   Rusty is one of the very best research assistants I have ever had, and I am sure that Enron would benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

P.S.: Please find Rusty's resume attached to this email.
