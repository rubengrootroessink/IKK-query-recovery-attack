EATHER ANOMOLIES QUICKLY  Using Syncrasy's proprietary visualization tools,=
 a user can quickly compare the output of up to 4 weather forecasting model=
s for a specific time period. Syncrasy's visualization tool projects each m=
odel over an identical national grid, and a zoom feature allows synchronize=
d zooming into any particular region of the continental US. For an example,=
 view the Multi-Panel Graphic?  on our website.      [IMAGE]   QUANTIFY YOU=
R WEATHER RISK     [IMAGE]   Syncrasy provides individual forecasts for ove=
r 1,600 weather stations in the continental US. For any one of these statio=
ns, you can compare all 14 weather forecasts side-by-side either to gain st=
atistical confidence in a particular outcome or to quantify the weather ris=
k of a specific forecast.  If you rely on weather forecasts, you should be =
aware of the extent to which all 14 forecasts agree (or disagree) with each=
 other. For an example, visit Syncrasy's  Forecast Analysis and Confidence =
Trading System (FACTS)?  on our website.   WHICH WEATHER FORECAST IS MORE A=
CCURATE?  Discover which weather forecast has been historically the most ac=
curate for a particular city over any selected time period (such as last we=
ek, month, season, etc.). Refine your analysis with data filters.  For exam=
ple, use a filter to determine which of the weather forecasting models is m=
ost accurate when actual temperatures are greater than 90 degrees, or when =
temperatures change more than 10 degrees within an hour.  For an example, s=
ee Syncrasy's  Weather Accuracy & Vendor Evaluation System (WAVES)?  on our=
 website.   CONDUCT DETAILED, PRECISE ANALYSES USING "DIFFERENCE GRAPHICS" =
    "Difference Graphics" refers to the spatially calculated difference for=
 a single output. Difference Graphics allows a user to analyze discrepancie=
s between any 2 weather forecasting models for any time period.  For exampl=
e, using Difference Graphics, a user can view the difference in surface tem=
perature between "Weather Vendor A" and "Weather Vendor B" across the US fo=
r tomorrow at 2pm.  A user could also view how "Weather Vendor A" has chang=
ed since the prior forecast. For an example visit Syncrasy's   Difference G=
raphics.       [IMAGE]          ENHANCE YOUR WEATHER COMPARISONS TO INCLUDE=
 TRAILING AVERAGES  The meteorological community frequently relies on one d=
ataset for comparative purposes: the "30 year average." This "30 year avera=
ge," however, may not be an ideal comparison as it is defined as the 30 yea=
r average over the period from 1961 to 1990. Syncrasy broadens the user's i=
nformation by including options allowing users to compare any weather forec=
ast to the trailing 30, 15, 10, or 5 year averages.    A REAL COMPETITIVE A=
DVANTAGE: YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION FIRST!      [IMAGE]        Syncrasy's"Ma=
ch-5" technique expeditiously reports information to users in advance of ty=
pical weather data feeds which may experience bottlenecks during peak traff=
ic (or rely on slower satellite communication). To prove Syncrasy's superio=
r reporting speed, our system allows users to test our reporting speed for =
themselves by comparing our time stamps to that of their best alternative w=
eather data source. Syncrasy records the time at which each weather forecas=
t is available on Syncrasy's system (timestamp in dark green) as well as th=
e anticipated time the weather forecast should update (timestamp in black).=

 Weather Analysis Tool (SWAT?  SWAT? collects timely and comprehensive  met=
eorologically diverse weather forecasts   from multiple forecasting groups,=
 such as National Weather Service, universities, armed services, NASA and o=
ther research oriented institutions.  The data is integrated into a single =
analysis platform.  This platform includes a number of tools which may be u=
seful to a trader and/or meteorologist.  For example, SWAT? assists users i=
n the following tasks:  identifying and quantifying weather risk for some f=
uture time period; tracking the historical performance of different weather=
 forecasting methodologies; and, creating a proprietary forecast.   SWAT?cu=
rrently collects  14 forecasts  covering next hour through 16 days in the f=
uture.  This data (and risk analysis) is available on the SWAT?before most =
companies (especially those companies that depend on traditional satellite =
links).  All these weather forecasts can be viewed graphically (as a nation=
