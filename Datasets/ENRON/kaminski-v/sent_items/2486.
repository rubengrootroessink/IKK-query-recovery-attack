Shirley,

Please, let's review it and see if any re-class is involved.

Vince,

Please see Brett's message below.  From the plan files I can tell only that the $21,041/month allocated to Enron Europe is calculated as 2.4% of plan expenses and should be trued up to actuals.  I do not have any detail on what you do for them.  Can you answer Brett's question?

Thanks,
Diane
