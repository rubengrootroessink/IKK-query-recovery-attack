yes. Management just went through 2 days of pessimism. I think we need to talk with them and agree upon how they need to be supported and what information they will want from your team.

Michael,

We would be happy to put them on our mailing list of the GMM and send them the final electronic version of the presentation with the scenarios.  Due to the critical nature of Argentina we are monitoring it on a weekly basis in the GMM.  Do you think it would be useful to provide regional updates on some regular basis, eg.on a quarterly basis or more frequently for Argentina.

We will be handing this draft out today. 

We met with Goldman and Citibank yesterday and have reviewed the regions macro econ status. 

We need to get you more active in our activity. I do not think everyone knows your team exists. Put John Lavoratto, louise kitchens and Jim Hughes, stan horton  on you e mail list at least. I would reccomend you set a meeting up with them directly to let them know what your team is doing. I will talk to them again today. 

I am in Houston next week. I will stop by.

Good work everyone who saw the first draft was surprised we had this in house expertice. 

MFG
