Dear Dr. Kaminski,

How was your Thanksgiving holiday?
I had a good time with an American Family.
They were so friendly and all the dishes were so delicious.
I hope you had a good time too with your family and friends.
These days, I am tasting some internet traffic models.
While reading papers, I am bumping into lots of ideas and getting familiar
with those.
Someday when I contact with traders in the real market, hopefully I would
like to ask some meaningful questions.
I appreciate your time.

Sincerely,

Hee Jung Sim
