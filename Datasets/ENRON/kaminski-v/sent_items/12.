Hi Vince -
Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the
circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an
advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather
than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto
office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to extend an
invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if our
interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?
