Jose,

Thank you for your interest in Enron. 
I don't know at this point if we are going to offer any
internships in the summer of 2002.

My assistant, Shirley Crenshaw,  will send you the reprints of my publications.

Vince

	Dear Dr. Kamiski,


        I am a student of the master in Quantitative Computational Finance
in Georgia Tech and also a Ph.D. student of the school of Mathematics. I
had the opportunity of attending the talk you gave in Georgia Tech two
weeks ago. I found the field and your work extremely interesting and
exciting. Since I am finishing the master degree in QCF this Fall and I
am in the initial  stages of my dissertation research, I am really looking
forward to having exposure to some real problems that the industry has
related to price modeling and pricing of financial instruments. I believe
that such a exposure will serve to motivate my dissertation and research.

        I firmly believe that my mathematical background is particularly
suitable for the problems you explained in your talks. I have another
master degree in Statistics and probability, in which I had exposure to
practical and theoretical aspects of statistics and probability. As part
of my master dissertation, I had the opportunity to study in depth
Self-similar Stochastic Processes and Levy Processes with particular
emphasis on papers of Taqqu, Samorodnitsky, Sato, Mandelbrot, and
Bandorff-Nielsen. Also, I have extensive experience in C and Java
programming as well as standard statistical and mathematical packages like
MatLab, Maple, S-plus, Minitab, and Statgraphics. You can read my
resume attached to the e-mail.

        I am really interested in working on an internship next Spring
and/or Summer in your group or maybe to work individually with you in
reading sections and research projects related to the energetic field.

	One last thing, I wonder if you can provide me with a copy of your
slices or some bibliography.

	Thanks for your time and I expect to hear from you.

	Sincerely yours,

	Jose E. Figueroa-Lopez
