VInce:

Long time no talk.  Things are going pretty well with the new business
not so well with my marriage, but the kids are very good.  Anyway, I was
wondering if you being the consummate researcher that you are might be
able to get hold of a copy of the May, June, July (or around there) 1996
Power Risk magazine that had the article about me going to Southern.  It
will be useful for me in my litigation.  Hope all is well with you and
yours especially for Vincent now that he's left school.  Do you ever get
to Atlanta?  I may be coming to Houston for a short assignment and will
look you up if I do.  Take care.
