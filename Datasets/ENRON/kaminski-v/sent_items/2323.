Alex,

Thanks a lot. I could open our resume.
We hire part-time employees to help
us with our weather effort: the work is
concentrated in the early morning hours
6:00 to 10:00 a.m.

I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group
about our needs.

Please, let me know if you are interested in
a summer internship in 2002. The decisions
are made in late January and February and 
you should let me know by then.

Vince

Dear Director Kaminski,

Thank you for your reply! I am trying to use
Yahoo!Mail to send my resume since something is wrong
with my default email system, Microsoft Outlook.
Please tell me if you still cannot read my resume.

Take care,

Alex
