Vince,

I have contacted each person on the attached list regarding UW participation.  I think that we should reach the 100% mark by the end of the day.

Here are the names of EWS Research people who have not participated in the United Way campaign as of 4:30 PM today.

RAKESH BHARATI
CHUANLI DENG
SHANE GREEN
PAULO ISSLER
KEVIN MOORE
ROMAN ZADOROZHNY

Tomorrow is the last official day of the campaign.  If you can get these people on board - to either pledge or decline - you will have 100% participation.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.
