Milly:  I have been asked to contact you to determine the status of the Permanent Residency application for Mr. Krishnarao.

On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995.  There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process?

I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time?  Hopefully, we are very close to completion! 

Many thanks
Margaret
