Mike & Vince:

This woman called Steve's office yesterday asking about his participation.  I told her that it would probably be someone other than Steve.  She went ahead and sent me the questions/topic for the speaker and asked me to help coordinate with her.  

Please keep me in the loop regarding who you decide to send (just in case she calls me back).  I ask that the person you pick, call Amy directly and coordinate with her.

Thanks.

Dear Ms. McVicker,

Thank you for your help in arranging a speaker from your group to come to Wharton. There is a lot of excitement here currently about the energy industry, and we have a very active Energy group that arranges engagements and discussions. 

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry, though we are open to any suggestions of the speaker. Questions include:
   ---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
   ---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
   ---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
   ---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

   The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday at
4:30 PM. Dates open are September 24, Oct 1, Nov 5, Nov 12. A presentation is followed by Q&A and then a suggested dinner and cocktails with Prof. Paul Kleindorfer and a few students.

Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing back from you or someone in your group.

Sincerely, 

Amy Richard
