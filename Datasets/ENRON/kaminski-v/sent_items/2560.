Subject:	United Way Campaign Update - Tuesday, August 21

As of 8:00 am this morning, EWS had reached $1,224,660 in pledges, which is 95.98% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000 and our participation rate is 69.02%.

If employees are having problems with the system, have them call or e-mail me with their pledge.  I can do it for them.  They will receive a confirmatory e-mail, which they can use to check for accuracy.

Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by business unit/functional group:

	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
	EA			$207,021	71.77%		(175 employees unaccounted for)
	EBS			$157,180	43.75%		(387 employees unaccounted for)
