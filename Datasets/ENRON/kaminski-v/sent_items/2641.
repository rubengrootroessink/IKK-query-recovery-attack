>ABSTRACT:
> Based on the peculiarities of electricity as underlying
> commodity of forward contracts we develop a time-continuous
> pricing model for short-term electricity forwards. The suggested
> stochastic volatility model utilizes the non-tradeable spot
> price of electricity and its variance rate as state variables.
> This enables us to capture the non-linearities, and the high and
> time varying volatility seen in electricity prices. Using
> maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filtering we
> report empirical results on electricity data from the
> Californian market.
>
> Keywords: Electricity forwards, stochastic volatility,
> time-continuous model, equilibrium pricing, Kalman filtering.

>ABSTRACT:
> This paper examines the relationship of futures floor trader
> proprietary positions to their market making activities. In
> particular, we examine interdealer trading, its function as an
> inventory management tool, and its costs. In addition, we
> develop the concept of a dealer hierarchy, where some floor
> traders, who are more successful, profit from their trades with
> other dealers. On average, we find that dealers earn relative
> profits when they execute position reducing trades. However, a
> surprising finding is that more successful traders are more
> likely to use interdealer trading in position reducing trades,
> which we find to be consistent with the existence of a dealer
> hierarchy. The research builds on the empirical work of Manaster
> and Mann's 1996 article on futures floor trader inventory
> control, and Reiss and Werner's 1998 article on interdealer
> trading. The synthesis of these two lines of research benefits
> from the elaborate futures data, and the highly competitive
> nature of dealer trading on the floor.

>ABSTRACT:
> The paper assumes that the implied volatility of options with
> some given expiration is a quadratic function of the moneyness.
> The coefficients of this quadratic function (the smile) are time
> dependent and stochastic. The paper derives exposure parameters
> of the price of the option to the local change in each of the
> smile coefficients, and an approximate formula for their risk
> adjusted expected value. These are important in managing the
> exposure of the price of an option portfolio to changes in the
> smile coefficients.

> Traditional methods for the computation of the Greeks with Monte

>ABSTRACT:
> We investigate whether the volatility risk premium is negative
> by examining the statistical properties of delta-hedged option
> portfolios (buy the option and hedge with stock). Within a
> stochastic volatility framework, we demonstrate a correspondence
> between the sign and magnitude of the volatility risk premium
> and the mean delta-hedged portfolio returns. Using a sample of
> S&P 500 index options, we provide empirical tests that have the
> following general results. First, the delta-hedged strategy
> underperforms zero. Second, the documented underperformance is
> less for options away from the money. Third, the
> underperformance is greater at times of higher volatility.
> Fourth, the volatility risk premium significantly affects
> delta-hedged gains even after accounting for jump-fears. Our
> evidence is supportive of a negative market volatility risk
> premium.

>ABSTRACT:
> In this paper we investigate the claim that hedge funds offer
> investors a superior risk-return trade-off. We do so using a
> continuous time version of Dybvig's (1988a, 1988b) payoff
> distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not
> require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution
> of the funds in question, is applied to the monthly returns of
> 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices over the period May
> 1990-April 2000. The results show that as a stand-alone
> investment hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return
> profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be
> inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76%
> per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of
> the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified
> away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for
> this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their
> double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio
> context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation
> outcomes. Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72
> individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone
> basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when
> mixed with the S&P 500. The best results are obtained when
> 10-20% of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds
