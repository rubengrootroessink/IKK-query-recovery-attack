Dear Mr. Vincent Kaminski

Please consider my application for a suitable position in Quantitative
Analysis, Trading or Risk Management. You will find that my profile,
knowledge of investment products and derivatives, and experience in
investment banking and securities meets your requirements.

I bring together a combination of financial and energy experience. I have
knowledge of all financial products and the acumen to apply quantitative
techniques and tools to various valuation methodologies. Additionally, I
have experience and exposure at all stages of investments: seed stage,
venture capital, private equity, and secondary markets. My interest in
energy is manifest in studying and applying valuation methodologies to fuel
cell companies. You can expect my very proactive involvement in your
organization, a trait I cultivated working for and with startup companies.

I am graduating in Computational Finance and Financial Engineering from
Carnegie Mellon University and Nanyang Technological University. This course
is an intensive course in derivatives, risk management, financial modeling
using Visual C++, Java and Matlab, financial maths, etc. My research
interests include risk management, real options valuation, energy trading &
derivatives, and structured products.

I believe that with my background, knowledge, skills and experience I will
do my best to meet the challenges and responsibilities of a demanding
assignment. I am available to join from August 1, 2001. The company will
have to sponsor my employment visa in the US. I have no location preferences
and am willing to travel.

I look forward to hearing from you. You can reach me on 1+412-681-0152 till
June 28th and by email thereafter. Thank you for your consideration.

Shriram S.
Suite No.202B, 5415 Shadyside Inn,
