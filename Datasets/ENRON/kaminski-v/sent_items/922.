My flight (UA 160) arrives in Boston at 4:43pm, and I should be at the hotel
by 6pm.  We can plan on any time after that.  Would you prefer to have
dinner at the hotel or go elsewhere?

   Opt4 is currently interviewing for two software engineering positions.
   Our
   needs currently center on Java and integrating Java with Oracle,
   WebLogic,
   and XML.  Your son looks like he may have background in those specific
   frameworks, but I couldn't be entirely sure. We have integration needs
   in a
   few proprietary interfaces also, so a general capacity to learn new
   interfaces quickly is a priority for us.  I'll get our job descriptions
   and
   forward them to you.  Additionally, we do our risk analytics in
   Mathematica
   (for the time being), but we have a full team.  If you son's work took
   him
   into Mathematica as a framework for crypto, I would be interested in his
   ability to interface Java and mathematica.  We find few people who know
   how
   to do this right.  I also know one of the key storage system designers
   at
   IBM in San Jose.  (He was a key inventor in IBM's CompactFlash micro
   hard
   drive.)  Your son's prior work in storage systems may be relevant to
   him.

   Can you meet for dinner Monday or Wednesday night in Boston?

   Bill,

   Yes, I am coming to Boston.
   Look forward to meeting you there.
   My son has not made any decision yet.
   I am enclosing his resume: please, let
   me know what you think.

      Hi Vince -
      I wanted to check on a couple of items following our discussions
   earlier
      this year: 1) has your son decided where he will work? and 2) will
   you
      be in
      Boston for the Risk 2001 conference?
      Development is moving along at a good pace here at Opt4.
      Best regards,
      Bill Balson
