Thanks. Any resolution to Krishna's problem yet?

Vince,

Wade was in town today and I caught him for lunch.  I conveyed your thanks for his efforts with the US Embassy on Krishna's behalf.  

I also had a disucssion with him on Dabhol, and will give you the details upon return.  The gist is that though we are unsure, 90% probability is in the direction of terminating the PPA and arbitrating.

Regards,
Sandeep.
