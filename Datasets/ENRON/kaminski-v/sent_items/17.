Steve,

Things seem to be under control as of noon today (Tue).
I look fwd to the evening with you, your wife and the
rest of the Woodlands gang on Saturday. I eat everything
except for broccoli.

Vince

Vince,

Sean tells me that the structured deal libraries, probably requires a more thorough hand-over....

...do we have that expertise still in the building?... can we extend someone here to make that happen?

regards

Steve

PS: I hope you and your wife can attend on Saturday 6pm?.... is there anything you both can't eat? (vegetarian etc...)
