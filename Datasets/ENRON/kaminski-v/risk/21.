Dear all,

Firstly, I would like to thank you for all your help on the Energy & Power
Risk Management 2001 event. The line-up is exceptional and I am extremely
excited about this event.

As the course leaders of our annual financial mathematics training course, I
would like to notify you of the dates for the event this year. We plan to
hold the courses at the following venues on the following dates:

HOUSTON - June 21 & 22
LONDON - June 28 & 29
NEW YORK - July 9 & 10

I would like to confirm availability for these events and to take on board
any update suggestions for the 2001 course. I do hope that these dates
enable you to participate in this event and I look forward to speaking with
each of you soon.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow
