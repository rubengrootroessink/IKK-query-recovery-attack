Dear Vince,
?
I just wondered whether you have had chance to  look at your bullet points 
and bio for the maths course. If so please could  could email them to me as 
soon as possible. Could you also let me know whether  your company 
affiliation should now be Enron North America.
?
Thanks Vince and best regards,
?
