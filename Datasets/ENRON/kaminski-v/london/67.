I'll probably be in Houston sometime in the next couple of months, otherwise 
if
you let me know when you'll be in London we'll rearrange for then...

Hope to meet up eventually!

I would very much like to meet Vince, unfortunately I am in back to back
meetings all day today.  Maybe we could rearrange next time Vince is in
London
or I am in Houston.

Regards

PAUL

Wendy:

I am so sorry for the late notice, but Vince will be in London for 1 day
only,
Monday, October 2nd.  He has had some time freed up and if Paul and
Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the Grosvenor House,
870-400-8500.  His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
would work.

Regards,

Shirley
