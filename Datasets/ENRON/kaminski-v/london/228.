Hi Dale & Vince,

For your benefit I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on 
over the past five months:

1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March)
2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
4) Energydesk.com models & support
5) Compound options for UK Power desk (options to build power stations)
6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified 
distributions)
7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward 
curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha)
8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old 
Asian models)
9) Continental gas volatility curve construction

The best summary for this is in the attached presentation that I gave to the 
London and Oslo staff recently.

Regards,

Anjam
