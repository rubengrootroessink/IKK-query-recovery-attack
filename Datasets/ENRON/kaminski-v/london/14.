Don't worry I haven't forgotten about Stephen.  He will be moved and sit next 
to Tony.  Don't know what they are talking about loan computers but I am  on 
the case.

Regards

Karin

Avistar has been all set up as far as I know but  someone has to come in 
again on Monday to re-install it on Tonys new computer.

Hello Karin ,
I noticed that Tony is taken care of , but what about Stephen.
Tony and Stephen are a team , they work very closely together.
Stephen also needs to be aware of  what is taking place as well.
If there is a problem with cost centers please contact me , but
please try and have both guys set up for Monday morning.

                                                              Thanks so much .
                                                                Kevin Moore

By the way have the Avistar set -up been completed.......
Please inform...

I have ordered a computer for Tony which IT should know about.  I believe the 
contact person is Steve Deakin.  I am in a course all day today but will look 
into it at lunchtime.

Hi Karin,

I just wanted to check the status of our change in equipment for start of 
business Monday.  I've been told that Tony and I will be using loaner PC's.  
The folks in IT are asking me where that loaner PC is so they can install all 
of the software that I need.  Slava has told me that you are the point of 
contact.  I just wanted to check with you to see if you need any additional 
information from me - or if I can be of help in any way.  Thanks!!

Steve
