I do not think minor changes would allow you to just use the same file.  You 
will have to check with Risk.  This is Risk Books, a specialist division of 
Risk Publications in London.  Address: Haymarket House, 28-29 Haymarket, 
London SW1Y 4RX.

The publication was in a book, entitled "Credit Derivatives: Applications for 
Risk Management, Investment and Portfolio Optimisation," publishd in 1998.  I 
am not sure if a lawyer was involved, maybe Vince will know.

Subject: Credit Article

Hello Vasant!

Bijoya has updated me on the discussion you have been having on the article 
from Risk Magazine about Credit.

We have found that the attachments you sent her are actually not 
word-for-word the same as the published version we have - the changes are 
only minor, wever, and have not altered the article in any way.

My question now concerns the copyrights. Since the version you sent is 
slightly different, do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it 
without the consent of Risk?

And if not - can you tell me if it was published by Risk UK or Risk in the 
States? And which issue was it? I just want to have all of the details if I 
need to call someone at the magazine ... 

Also - was there a lawyer involved in the publication procedure, or was this 
handled by London/Houston PR? Or by Vince himself?

Sorry about all of the questions ... I just want to avoid problems well in 
advance.

Thank you!


Regards,

Katja
