Hi Martina & Trena,

I think this is a reasonable smoothing method between the short and long-term 
models - let me know if you need me to explain it.  I also included the 
short-term models so this is now a self-standing spreadsheet, but probably 
still needs cleaning up a bit.

ZIMIN & STINSON:

We agreed on short-term and long-term models for DZCV and PLLU PPI indices in 
a meeting with Dale and Trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the 
results as follows.  Blue and red curves are the proposed DZCV and PLLU PPI 
index forward curves whilst RPI is the market-derived black curve.



Regards,

Anjam
