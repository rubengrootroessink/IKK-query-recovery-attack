Hi Steve,

Thanks for the FYI; I'd be happy to interview him if you need a second 
opinion at the telephone interview you're arranging next week.

Regards,

Anjam

Steve,

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Vince

Vince

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the Research group in 
London?  One of our Analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume 
attached).  I'm sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me 
know what you think.

Many thanks,
Steve
