SPECIAL REPORT: TELEWORK

Sept. 11 changed everything - including telework. Formerly
viewed as a way to boost morale and productivity, lure the best
hires and cut costs, telework was almost instantly transformed
into a vital component of U.S. business continuity strategies.

Today's focus: Windows Media Player vulnerability

By Jason Meserve

It's a short workweek here at Network World central, so there
is not a lot to report today in terms of bugs and security
alerts. (And who wants to be patching a server on Thanksgiving
Day anyway?)

Given the smaller than usual edition, those looking for holiday
shopping ideas can check out our annual Yule Tools Gift Guide,
put together by Senior Reviews Editor Keith Shaw with the help
of some merry Network World elves. You can view all the latest

Happy Thanksgiving!


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Flaw in Windows Media Player lets any code run

A bug in the way that Microsoft's Windows Media Player 6.4
handles a certain type of streaming media file can allow
attackers, given the right conditions, to execute any code on
target systems, Microsoft said in a security bulletin released
Tuesday. At the same time, Microsoft issued a fix for the
problem.

* SGI releases temporary sendmail patch

A number of vulnerabilities have been found in sendmail, which
could be exploited to gain access to sensitive information or
the mail server itself. SGI does not have a permanent solution
but a temporary patch is available inside this advisory:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20011101-01-I


* ISS warns of HP-UX lpd vulnerability

Internet Security Systems (ISS) is warning of a vulnerability
in the HP-UX line printer daemon (lpd). A malicious user could
exploit the flaw to execute code with superuser privileges. For
more, go to:
http://xforce.iss.net/static/7234.php


* New version of OpenSSH available

Version 3.0.1 of OpenSSH, an open-source version of the SSH
protocol, is now available. The new version fixes a security
flaw and other miscellaneous bugs. The new version can be
downloaded from:
http://www.openssh.com/


* Caldera patches xlock in UnixWare and Open Unix

Caldera has released a patch for the xlock program that ships
with Open Unix and UnixWare 7. A vulnerability in previous
releases could be exploited to gain privileges. The patch can
be downloaded from:
ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openunix/CSSA-2001-SCO.34/


Today's round up of virus alerts:


* WM97/Marker-JX - A Word macro virus that creates a file
called Jon.html in the Windows directory. It attempts to delete
all .DOC and .DOT files in the Word application start-up
directory and changes the summary information. (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Opinion: PsyOps and network security

A significant component of cyberwar and cyberterrorism is
called psychological operations, or PsyOps. Simply, PsyOps is
the manipulation of the psyche of an adversary or target
population with information, misinformation, disinformation and
propaganda. It involves perception management, or controlling
what a group of people think and believe is the goal.

* IBM creates global security services division

Looking to offer a broader suite of services to companies and
the government, IBM Monday announced the formation of a new
division that will focus on security, safety and privacy.
