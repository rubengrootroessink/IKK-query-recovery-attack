We all need a laugh!

The pastor, speaking to the younger priest, said, "I know you were reaching
out to the young people when you had bucket seats put in to replace the 
first four pews. It worked. We got the front of the church filled first."

The young priest nodded and the old one continued, "And, you told me a 
little more beat to the music would bring young people back to church, so I
supported you when you brought in that rock'n roll gospel choir that packed
us to the balcony."

"So," asked the young priest, "what's the problem?"

"Well", said the elder priest, "I'm afraid you've gone too far with the
drive-thru confessional."

But Father," protests the young priest. "My confessions have nearly doubled
since I began that!"

"I know, my son, but the flashing "Toot 'n Tell or Go to Hell" neon sign
really has to go."
