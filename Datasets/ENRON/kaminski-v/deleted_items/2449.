Vince,

	I've just confirmed that I will be flying to NY Monday evening (Gary Taylor will already be there) to meet with Longitude on Tuesday morning to discuss possible applications of their technology to the European and Asian weather markets. If you have any words of advice to offer, or would like to discuss what we've learned so far, let me know.

Joe
