Southwest Gas Data Fix
 
One of our users has correctly pointed out that there is a small bug in the Location table of recent GPCMdat databases, which could cause some confusion in some reports.
 
The bug was introduced when the Southwest Gas pipeline model was split into two zones:  north and south.  In the location table Zone ZN194 became ZN194-N and ZN194-S.  Unfortunately, the Zone name "Southwest Gas Corp." did not get the North and South appendages.  
 
So, the fix is really easy:  from Case Definition click the Data button then the Location button.  Select Type "Trans" and then browse down to the Southwest Gas Corp. entries and change them to Southwest Gas North and Southwest Gas South respectively.  Then your reports will also read correctly.
 
Thanks for letting us know about this!
