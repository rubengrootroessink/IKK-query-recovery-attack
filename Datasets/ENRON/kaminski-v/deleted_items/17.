Today's focus: 802.11a access points, Part 1

By Neal Weinberg

The Reviewmeister couldn't wait to test the new 802.11a
wireless access points. These babies run at a screaming 54M
bit/sec, compared to only 11M bit/sec for 802.11b products.

We tested four products from three companies: Proxim's Harmony
(targeted at the enterprise), Proxim's Skyline Access Point,
Intel's Pro/Wireless 5000 and SMC's 2755W access point. All are
based on the same wireless chipset/reference model from
Atheros, but unlike cookie-cutter 802.11b products, their
flexibility, management and performance varied.

In our tests, two of the three vendors, Proxim and Intel,
submitted products that performed consistently. The speed demon
(over the widest broadcast range) in the bunch, SMC, had very
fast performance - and occasionally, highly erratic behavior
until we downloaded "another Version 1.0" of its firmware.

Compatibility between different access points and the CardBus
adapters supplied was very good. In 802.11a mode, all the
adapters could connect to every access point - even with Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption enabled. In ad hoc mode
(connecting two PCs without an access point), all the adapters
worked well together with the other access points, with some
cards having better speed.

But when we used "turbo mode" (a multichannel, nonstandard
mode) between an access point and a competing adapter, we
couldn't achieve a connection between that card and the access
point. For now, turbo mode shoots compatibility dead between
different products, resulting in disappointing performance.

* Proxim

Proxim clocked in the fastest rates, both in compatibility mode
and with its own access point. Running against the Intel access
point, the Proxim card turned in a 22M bit/sec score. Proxim
also turned in the best score with its own access point, with
17.6M bit/sec.

Proxim's Harmony product line uses a central wireless hub
management appliance to control the Harmony access points. The
management appliance then controls the Proxim access points
(802.11a or 802.11b) on a subnet. We found the Web-based access
point controller application to be incredibly thorough and easy
to use with multiple Harmony access point deployments.

If the Harmony access points are located on the same subnet, an
access point controller can be set to apply rules to any newly
joining Harmony access point. Indeed, we found that when the
controller goes offline, the access points stopped within a few
seconds - they're slaves to the controller.

Proxim also produces an access point in its Skyline product
line, and its characteristics were virtually identical to
Harmony's in performance. The main difference between Skyline
and Harmony is that the Skyline access points can't be managed
by the access point controller.

The Harmony line also includes a proprietary encryption
algorithm that's different from WEP, but Proxim refused to say
how it's different. This encryption method is in addition to
the 54-bit through 128-bit WEP encryption methods available and
common to all the access points we tested.

Another Harmony feature is a forced VPN tunneling method that
can also force logons to a single server. This adds a great
deal of security to mobile networks and could potentially
reduce drive-by logon risks dramatically. Additional security
imposed at the server that is the target of the tunnel requires
the "drive-bys" to get past whatever security is imposed at the
server as well.

The Harmony access point controller also supports Remote
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) for added
authentication, media access control (MAC) layer address
admittance control and SNMP for monitoring. Multicasts can also
be filtered. This helps improve performance on wireless
segments.

While the Harmony line was easiest to set up from a multiple
access point perspective, its "2X" performance was
disappointing except in ad hoc mode. Proxim's 2X mode is
designed to operate at a theoretical rate of 108M bit/sec,
approaching the speed of Fast Ethernet. In our testing, we
didn't come close. Worse, we saw a severe drop-off in range in
2X mode, to the point where we had difficulty completing tests
in the 72-foot range. We were disappointed, as we wanted a good
excuse not to wire 100Base-TX.

* Intel

Compared with Proxim's access point, Intel's Pro/Wireless 5000
has no frills. The Pro/Wireless 5000 is managed through a Web
interface. Unlike Proxim and SMC, Intel doesn't have a turbo
mode. The Pro/Wireless 5000 uses a fairly utilitarian setup,
with an "express" setup that will be sufficient for most
installations.

The Pro/Wireless 5000 also lacks encryption beyond WEP standard
encryption. This means that the maximum encryption available is
128-bit. While MAC admittance control is available, there's no
provision for RADIUS authentication or any other authentication
capability. Like the other access points tested, the
Pro/Wireless 5000 can be configured as a Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol server.

The Intel access point has fixed antennae. An option is
available to limit the antenna pattern to "half circle front"
from an omnidirectional pattern, but we found only a nominal
boost in performance when we chose this option. Like the other
access points tested, the Intel unit allows a wide choice of
channels to be chosen. No provision is made for traffic or
protocol filtering.

While slow on performance, it was consistent across the ranges.
We tested the Pro/Wireless 5000 less than the others because it
had no errors and no additional modes to test. Sometimes
"boring" has its place in connectivity; Intel's product was
consistent and satisfying in its consistency.
