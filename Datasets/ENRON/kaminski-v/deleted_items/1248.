Conoco to Help Arctic Pipeline Plans

    Conocos takeover of Gulf Canada Resources should add political power to
the plans of a group of major oil companies to build a natural gas pipeline
from Canada's Arctic, according to Gulf's CEO. Conoco has offered C$12.40
per share in cash for Gulf. Gulf's partners in the study of the C$3 billion
pipeline include Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Exxon Mobil. Gulf has an
estimated 1.3 Tcf of natural gas reserves in the region. Last week, the
group negotiated an agreement with native leaders from the Northwest
Territories that would have the Aboriginal Pipeline Group owning up to a
third of the pipeline. Debate has long centered on whether a pipeline from
northern Alaska or the Mackenzie Delta would be built first, or whether the
market could initially support both.

Looks like the race is on!  If producers and others in Alaska don't get
their act together soon, Conoco and the NWT could win.  I still don't see
how ANGTS and Mackenzie Delta Pipeline can be built simultaneously and the
Over the Top Pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Mackenzie Delta has too many
legal, environmental, and operational obstacles.
