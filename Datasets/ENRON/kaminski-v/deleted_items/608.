Palm's Resolutions for 2002  
1. Download at least two new software titles (the  
coolest apps are on Palm's Software Connection ). 
2. Perform HotSync(r) operations more often-better to  
be safe than sorry..   
3. Delete old contacts, to do's and memos from my  
Palm(tm) Desktop. 
4. Accessories, accessories, accessories.  (The Palm  Store  has the best deals in town!)   
5. Have more fun with my Palm(tm) handheld. (Who said  
life should be all work and no play?) 
The Palm Store has some fantastic specials to kick off  
the New Year. Like the Xircom(r) Wireless bundle  and the  
Games and Essentials Packages, among other terrific,  
money-saving packages.

And don't miss Palm's new Software Connection . You'll  
find tons of new titles to help you work (and play)  
more productively this year.      
In the meantime, let's all resolve to make 2002 our
