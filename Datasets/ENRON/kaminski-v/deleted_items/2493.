		What's New at ERisk.com - 26 October 2001	


Weekly Review	In  this week's round-up   of economic, banking and P?insurance news from an enterprise risk management  perspective: US markets rise above gloomy economic data; European bank investors nervously await results; Merrill goes back to the drawing board; Swiss Re goes on the offensive over WTC payout; Lloyd's of London confirms massive exposure to US terror claims. 	
		
		
Analysis 	 The  financial implications of the events of September 11 are still being digested  by the P?insurance industry. One possible consequence could be a  greater focus on enterprise risk management (ERM), which would allow insurers  and reinsurers to take a more holistic view of their exposures. But, as  we discover in this week's analysis,   the experience of the industry to date suggests that ERM is still not  widely practised, and many obstacles to its implementation remain.  	
Feature	Business  risks that were once thought unavoidable and unmeasurable are slowly becoming  "manageable" using the tools of risk transfer. One result of this  is that some senior risk managers are moving beyond their traditional role  as watchdogs to contribute to strategic decision making in a variety of  businesses. In this feature ,  which complements our Business  Risk Jigsaw , ERisk editor-in-chief Sumit Paul-Choudhury asks whether  strategic risk management will be redefined by developments such as alternative  risk transfer, weather derivatives and real options analysis.	
Viewpoint	FleetBoston  entered the upper echelons of the US banking sector when Fleet Bank and  BankBoston merged in 1999. In our latest CRO  Profile , we talk to Paul Hogan, chief risk officer at the $200 billion-asset  company, about FleetBoston's risk management initiatives, the challenge  of managing credit risk in a slowing economy and the changing role of the  risk manager.	
Job Listings	A number of new positions  are currently being advertised in our Job  Listings  section. These include vacancies for a senior risk management  analyst, a director of operational risk and a head of credit risk. Whether  you are recruiting to fill a risk management post or looking for a new position  yourself, ERisk's job listings page is rapidly becoming one of the industry's  premier resources.
