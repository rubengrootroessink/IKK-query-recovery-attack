Today's focus: Novell to release security flaw details

By Jason Meserve

Novell has sent out a warning to GroupWise users that it will
soon be unveiling details of the security flaw in its Padlock
product. Back in August, the company announced that it had
discovered a problem in the application and issued a patch.

The company says 85% of its customers have downloaded the patch
and is urging the rest to do so before Nov. 23, when it details
what the flaw entails. The remaining 15% of users can download
the appropriate patch from:
http://support.novell.com/padlock

Novell claims none of its customers have reported any security
breaches as a result of this flaw.

The announcement comes as Microsoft's Security Response Center
published a column about how vulnerability information is
shared and what should be done to change the current system.
It's an interesting read:

Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* ISS: Citrix MetaFrame has remote denial of service
  vulnerability

A vulnerability in Citrix MetaFrame, which works with Windows
Terminal Services, could allow a remote user to crash the
affected machine, requiring the machine to be restarted
manually. A hotfix for this problem is available via the Citrix
Support page at:
http://www.citrix.com/support


* GroupWise file viewing vulnerability

According to an alert from Foundstone, a flaw in Novell's
GroupWise server product could be exploited to view files
anywhere on the affected machine, including the root directory.

its impact, visit:

* Linux-Mandrake updates Zope

Zope, the open-source applications server, contains a security
check flaw that could allow a malicious user to force the
application to call methods to which it would not normally have
access. Linux-Mandrake has issued an update that fixes this
problem:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3


* Openssh patches available

A flaw in the way multiple keys are handled in various openssh
implementations could allow key-based logins from unauthorized
hosts. For more on this problem and a link to patches, go to:

Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* Flawed Anthrax worm hits 'Net

A new mass mailer worm, purporting to provide information about
the disease anthrax, has appeared on the Internet but is being
hampered because of a flaw in its design, antivirus companies
said Wednesday.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/1017anthrax.html
IDG News Service, 10/17/01

* WM97/Myna-AZ - This is one of those Word macro viruses with
no malicious payload. (Sophos)

* Dark Machine - A self-propagating worm that spreads via e-
mail. It comes in a message with varying subject lines and body
text that reads, "heh.  I tell ya this is nuts!  You gotta
check it out!" Attachment names include Si.exe, UserConf.exe,
Disk.exe, Rede.exe and Common.exe. (SecureWorks)


>From the interesting reading department:


* It's time to end information anarchy

It's high time the security community stopped providing
blueprints for building these weapons. And it's high time
computer users insisted that the security community live up to
its obligation to protect them. We can and should discuss
security vulnerabilities, but we should be smart, prudent and
responsible in the way we do it.

* Wireless nets could allow attacks of fixed networks

A security study Monday sounded another call to arms for
network administrators to secure wireless networks, showing how
hackers can use traditional methods to attack otherwise secure
fixed networks from a wireless entry point.

* Opinion: Don't be lulled by firewalls

The recent Nimda virus caused untold damage to companies
throughout the world. IT administrators spent days disinfecting
and patching infected systems, as well as belatedly applying
current security patches to systems running Microsoft's
Internet Information Server software. Nimda did an incredibly
thorough job of finding systems running IIS, even if those
systems weren't really Web servers.

* Court reinstates guilty verdict on computer saboteur

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia Friday
reinstated the guilty verdict in the case of a former network
administrator who had been convicted in May 2000 in the first
prosecution of computer sabotage.

* WatchGuard upgrades Firebox security software

Looking to expand the range of services offered and protected
by its Firebox line of security appliances, WatchGuard
Technologies Monday announced an upgrade to the software that
runs its Firebox security hardware, adding DNS security,
expanded VPN support and integration with intrusion detection
systems.

* ISS aids management with RealSecure SiteProtector

Looking to offer its customers a single console from which to
manage their desktop, server and network security products, not
to mention improve their effectiveness, Internet Security
Systems Monday announced its RealSecure SiteProtector software.

* Microsoft to prioritize security bugs

In an effort to help customers better respond to security
threats, Microsoft said it will begin adding severity ratings
to its security bulletins. Under the new severity rating
system, vulnerabilities in Microsoft's products will henceforth
be classified as either "critical," "moderate" or "low,"
according to a document released by the company's Security
Response Center.
