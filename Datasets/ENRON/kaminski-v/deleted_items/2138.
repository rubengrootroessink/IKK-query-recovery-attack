Good Day to you, Vince!  I hope you are doing well in Brazil.  I didn't get your column over the weekend, so I'm not yet able to put our newsletter out this week.  Would you be able to forward a copy from your laptop in the next day or two?  If so, I can publish this week.
 
Thanks and have a safe trip,
 
Sam
