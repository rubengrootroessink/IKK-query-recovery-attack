Vince,

Took a few days to get back to you.  This guys works for the US Sales VP, our contact at Samsung.  Samsung is going to send him out to review the business and present his ideas.  I'll let you know how it goes.

Dear Dr.Kaminski:
 
It was really nice to talk to you tonight.   Tonight, my willingness to explore Enron's innovative culture became much  stronger.  To your question, "who will sell it?", my answer is "Enron will  sell it."  My current idea is to create  hedging portfolio against DRAM price movement and sell the insurance based on  the payoffs from the hedging portfolio.
 
FYI, I attach my resume.  Thank you very  much.
 
 
Best regards,
