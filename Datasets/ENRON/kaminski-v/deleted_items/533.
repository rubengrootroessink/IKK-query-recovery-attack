As we prepare for the Spring 2002 semester, I am listing below some information regarding the schedule and procedures for distribution of class rosters&.
 
1-     The first class roster will be sent on Friday, January 11. We will print them immediately that morning and call your department coordinators when to pick them up. These rosters will have a status column that will indicate either enrolled or request .
2-       Enrolled means a student is officially enrolled in your course and has made all necessary payments. 
3-     Request means a student has pre-registered for your course but has not completed their fee payment. Once they make their payment AND THERE IS SPACE AVAILABLE IN YOUR CLASS, they will be officially registered. If the class is closed, the student will be notified and will then require your signature.
 
If at any time during the semester you would like a copy of your class roster sent electronically to you, please e-mail me at jmontag@rice.edu  We will send additional rosters at the start of the third week of the semester and again at the start of the ninth week of the semester.
 
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
