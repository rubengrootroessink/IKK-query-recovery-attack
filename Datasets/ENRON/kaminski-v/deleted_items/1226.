Vince,

Enclosed is information on textual mining and expert systems I spoke to you about in the lobby.  

EDS is currently providing commercial applications using experts systems and textual mining to derive value for our customers.  The presentation below has two examples of current applications.  It seems to me that there a multiple applications for this type of program within Enron which would have short payback periods.

Please let me know if you wish to investigate further.
