Today's focus: Non-tech security pays off

By Jason Meserve

I had an interesting experience walking into Network World's
headquarters yesterday. There were signs posted all over the
place warning us that a virus could be in our e-mail inbox and
not to open any .vbs extensions. Why the signs?

When the Goner worm spread across our organization last month,
it moved quickly before IS could warn all of our users.
Yesterday's virus was old code but infiltrated a system with
old virus definition files. Instead of warning people via e-
mail, which people may read after opening the infected message,
the IS staff posted helpful signs that were hard to miss. It
worked.

Of course, if all users knew better than to open a .vbs file,
then there would be no need for the signs in the first place.


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Linux vendors patch sudo

A flaw in sudo, a program that gives limited root privileges to
users, could allow a malicious user to obtain full superuser
privileges on the local machine. Users can download updates
from:
FreeBSD:
ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:06.sudo.asc


Debian:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-101

Conectiva:
http://distro.conectiva.com.br/atualizacoes/?id=a&anuncio=000451

Red Hat:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-011.html

Linux-Mandrake:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2002/MDKSA-2002-003.php

EnGarde:
http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/


* CERT: Exploit circulating for Solaris hole

Hackers are actively exploiting a known vulnerability in Sun's
Solaris version of the Unix operating system, security experts
said late Monday, urging administrators to check if their
system is vulnerable.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0115solarishole.html
IDG News Service, 01/15/02

CERT advisory:
http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-01.html

Cisco Media Control Gateway is also affected because it sits on
Solaris:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/Solaris-for-MGC-pub.shtml


* SGI warns of IRIX nsd vulnerability

A flaw in the way IRIX name server daemon uses its cache could
lead to the entire hard drive being filled. SGI "highly
recommends" users download the fix for this problem. For more
information, go to:
ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20020102-03-P


* Debian, SuSE patch at

A bug in the at package could lead to a heap corruption. A
malicious user could exploit this to gain the daemon's user
privileges. For more, go to:

Debian:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-102

SuSE:
http://lists2.suse.com/archive/suse-security-announce/2002-
Jan/0002.html


* XChat patch available

A flaw in the XChat IRC client can be exploited by a malicious
user to take over a chat session. A malicious user could
exploit this to launch social engineering attacks and other
mischief. For more, go to:

Debian:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-099

Red Hat:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-005.html


* Debian patches CIPE

A problem with the CIPE VPN package could cause an affected
system to crash. The package does not check to see if an
incoming packet is too short. If it is, the system crashes. For
more, go to:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-104


* New version of gzip available

A potential flaw in gzip could be exploited to cause a buffer
overflow when files with long names are compressed. Debian
claims the chances of someone exploiting this are slim, but it
has released an update to be safe:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-100


* Updated glibc package available

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the glob function of
the glibc library. The flaw can be exploited via programs that
use the function, including shells and FTP applications. For
more, go to:
http://www.debian.org/security/2002/dsa-100


* Red Hat patches groff

According to an alert from Red Hat, a vulnerability exists in
the groff document formatting system. The groff preprocessor
contains an exploitable buffer overflow. If groff can be
invoked within the LPRng printing system, an attacker can gain
rights as the "lp" user. For more, go to:
https://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-004.html


* EnGarde patches pine

A vulnerability in pine, a popular e-mail client for
Linux/Unix, contains a vulnerability that could allow a
malicious user to execute arbitrary commands on the affected
system. The flaw is in the way URLs are handled by the program.
EnGarde users can find the appropriate patch at:
http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/


* Flaw in EnGarde LIDS

A vulnerability in LIDS, an access control system, could allow
an attacker to gain root access to the affected system and
possibly disable LIDS completely. To download a fix, go to:
http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/


* ICQ has same security hole as AIM

Users of the instant messaging application ICQ are urged to
upgrade to the latest version of the software because of a
potentially damaging bug in older versions, according to a
notice on the ICQ Web site.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2002/0115icq.html
IDG News Service, 01/15/02


Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* WM97/Fifteen-A - On the 15th or 30th of any month, this Word
macro virus will password-protect an infected file with the
password ">>xvx<<". It also displays a message on the infected
system. (Sophos)

* W32/Maldal-F - This Windows worm spreads via Outlook and
comes in a message titled "Happy New Year" with an attachment
called "Christmas.exe." (Sophos)


>From the interesting reading department:
