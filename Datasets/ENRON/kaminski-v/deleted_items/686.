David,

Maureen Raymond's Group in addition to her
includes Mitra Mujica and Gwyn Koepke.

They are responsible for producing forecasts of I/R
and F/X curves that are used in assets valuations.

Unless your group is willing to absorb this unit of
Research, Maureen's employment with Enron
will be terminated on January 15 (Jim Fallon's decision).

Vince
