Dear Wade: 

	Just a note to let you know that visa applications along with your letter and all the supporting documents have been mailed to the Chennai Consulate today (Wednesday June 6th). It should reach the consulate on Friday the 8th. We are praying for a positive response.

Thanks and best regards,
Krishna.
