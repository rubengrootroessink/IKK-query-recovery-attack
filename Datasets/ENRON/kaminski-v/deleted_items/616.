    ATTN

  I m an accountant with the South Africa department of
  minieral resources and Energy and I am also a member
  of the South Africa contract award and monitoring
  committee in the South Africa department of mineral
  resources and Energy.  I am also on a special
  diplomatic duty in the South Africa foreign office in
  the foreign land.

  Sometimes ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign
  firm in Japan by my committee.  This contract was over
  invoiced to the tune of US$25.5 million.  The over
  invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from
  the project.  We now desire to transfer this money,
  which is presently in a suspense account of the
  Central Bank of South Africa (CBSA) into any overseas
  account where we expect you to provide for us.

  For providing the account where we shall remit the
  money, you will be entitled to 30% of the money, 68%
  will be for myself and my partner, the remaining 2%
  would be set aside to settle all expenses incurred by
  both parties.

  I would require the following:
  1.Bank name and address
  2.Telephone, fax number of bankers
  3.Name of beneficiary / company name / address /
  account.
  4.Confidential telephone and fax number of
  beneficiary.

  The above information would be used to make formal
  application as a matter or procedure for the release
  of the money and onward transfer to the nominated
  account you would provide.  It does not matter whether
  or not your company does contract or project of this
  nature describe here.  The assumption is that your
  company won the major contract and sub contracted it
  out to other companies.  We have strong reliable
  connections and contract at the apex bank and the
  Federal ministry of finance and we have no doubt that
  will be release and transferred if we get a reliable
  and trust worthy foreign partner to assist us in
  mutual beneficiary deal.

  Therefore, when the business is successful concluded,
  we shall through our same connection withdraw all
  documents used from the entire concerned government
  ministry for 100% security.  We are civil servants and
  we will not miss this opportunity.
  Please contact me immediately through my above
  telephone and fax number whether or not you are
  interested in this deal.  If not, it will enable me
  scout for another foreign partner to carry out this
  deal.  But whereby, you are interested, send the
  required information without delay, as time is of the
  essence in this deal.


  I await your swiftest response.

  Best regards.
