I am in the process of planning an event that will bring together senior
executives from across the energy industry, to discuss the development of
renewable energy strategies.  The conference will take place in early April
2002 in London.

I am seeking to identify speakers from 	- oil and gas companies
- power generating companies
- governments
- financial and advisory organisations
- technology companies
- associations, institutes and federations

The programme will examine the whole spectrum of renewable energy sources,
with the dynamics and needs of energy companies themselves in mind.  I would
appreciate your thoughts on topics that should be included, potential
speakers/contributors that you could recommend and which sources of
renewable energy you consider to be the most significant.

If you would like to discuss any aspect of the conference please do not
hesitate to contact me, and I very much welcome your suggestions.

Kind regards

Emma Watts
