Jeannie:

I have scheduled you for 3:00 PM on Tuesday, the 5th of June.  If that does not work
for you, please let me know.  Vince cannot meet on Wednesday, he has an all day
PRC meeting.  Thursday might work if Tuesday does not.

Vince, you may remember me as the writer who helped on the natural gas chapter for the Risk Management book. As you know, I work for Enron full-time as a writer of many articles and publications.

I will be in Houston next week and I wondered if you had a half hour on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday to talk about market trends. I'm also available until 11 a.m. on Thursday.

Thanks,
Jeannie
