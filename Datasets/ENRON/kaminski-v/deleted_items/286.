Following our highly successful conference last year in Brussels, we are now
in the process of planning this year's event, which should take place by mid
June in Canada.

Our previous corporate art conferences in London & Paris have demonstrated
to various industry sectors the benefits of corporate investment in national
and local community art, as a vehicle for marketing communications, in what
is becoming a highly charged stakeholder society.

The conference will cover themes such as integration of art into corporate
strategy, the practical issues of building and managing art collections and
an examination of the legal and tax incentives as well as insurance,
applicable to the North American market. We also intend to address the
shareholders' and employees' reactions to their company being involved in
art, and to research more practical matters such as budgeting and planning
for a corporate art collection. Speakers will be invited to provide as many
visuals and case studies as possible.

I am presently researching the topic with a view to identifying
well-qualified speakers on the subject, and assess who would be prepared to
participate in the conference as a speaker, delegate or sponsor.

If this message falls within the remit of another of your colleagues I would
be very grateful if you could forward this message to them.  I would welcome
your thoughts for the conference and look forward to hearing from you
shortly.


Kind regards
