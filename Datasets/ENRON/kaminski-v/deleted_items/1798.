Today's focus: A peek into MyRealBox

By Dave Kearns

MyRealBox is a free e-mail service for anyone who wants to use
it. More importantly (from our point of view), it's a
demonstration site for Novell's Internet Messaging System
(NIMS). I've mentioned before in this space that I didn't like
Novell's GroupWise, even though (or maybe because) I formerly
administered its predecessor - WordPerfect Office - for a half
dozen years. GroupWise is too complicated, too non-standard,
and too cluttered with unneeded (by many) functionality.

NIMS, though, suffers from none of those drawbacks. It's
simple, straightforward messaging based on standard Simple
Message Transfer Protocol tools which have driven e-mail over
the Internet for more than a dozen years. It supports any e-
mail client (even the GroupWise client, as well as Microsoft's
Outlook and Outlook Express, Eudora, and many more) that can
handle the Post Office Protocol or Internet Message Access
Protocol, besides providing a Web-browser based interface.

The latest version of NIMS also includes (if you want to use
it) basic calendaring functions. It's scalable up to 100,000
mailboxes on a single server, but is also written to take
advantage of a multiprocessor or multiserver (i.e., a cluster)
environment. It's tightly coupled with NDS/eDirectory for
security, supporting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0, the Open
SSL implementation of Transport Layer Security, and Secure
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension protocols for the highest
possible levels of encryption and security.

Typically, in evaluating a messaging product you use a small
test group of people to try it out then hope those results will
scale to your entire enterprise. Myrealbox.com, though, has
current stats listed right on the home page with a link to more
detailed stats for the cluster of mail servers running the
program so that you can see for yourself what the performance
is like.

NIMS is intended for large enterprises - Fortune 1000
companies, universities, government departments and the like.
There is also a move to aim it at ISPs, but that activity seems
to have dropped recently. While it might not be right for small
businesses (and small businesses get GroupWise thrown in when
they buy NetWare Small Business Suite), medium- and large-sized
enterprises running NetWare servers should definitely consider
it. Even those without NetWare servers might reasonably look at
it as an efficient, secure mail server.
