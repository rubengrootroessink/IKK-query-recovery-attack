Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update - 18/1/2002

The future viability of the Global Association of Risk Professionals (Garp) this week was again thrown into doubt, as a significant number of ex-Garp regional directors splintered off to form their own risk management association - the Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA). The new body, which will include local chapters in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North America and South America, will be strictly not-for-profit and plans to run a new risk management certification programme in likely competition with Garp's Financial Risk Manager exam. The creation of PRMIA - pronounced 'premia' - comes as many senior Garp officials failed to reach satisfactory terms with Garp founders Marc Lore and Lev Borodovsky to convert that association back from a for-profit to a not-for-profit organisation. PRMIA plans to offer clear bylaws, publish a members' code of conduct, plus provide members with fully audited financials, all to be made available on its website, www!
.prmia.org. Regional chapters will include: London, New York, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, Montreal, Zurich, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Charlotte, Australia, Japan, Korea, Singapore, India, Russia, Poland, Italy, Israel, Denmark, Sweden, Chile, Argentina and Spain. Others are in the pipeline.

Meanwhile, increased familiarity with credit derivatives is leading to a greater appetite for synthetic securitisation, according to Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's. The agencies expect a sizeable increase in the synthetic securities market this year, following high growth levels in 2001. Greater investor sophistication, and decreasing yields in traditional investments are also driving the market. The two biggest growing asset classes in the synthetic market last year were collateralised debt obligations (CDO) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). European CDO transactions saw a 50% jump over 2000 figures, while CMBS more than doubled, said Moody's. A large proportion of these deals were being used to capture enhanced yields through speculative arbitrage.

On the same theme, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein has undertaken a major reorganisation of its credit derivatives operations, and named Rick Weinstein its new head of credit derivatives. Weinstein will report directly to Matteo Mazzocchi, global head of credit derivatives and securitisation. He will lead a group that now consists of four units: trading, collateralised debt obligations, collateralised synthetic obligations and structured credit products. The German bank has also hired Darren Smith as co-head of CDOs, where he will work alongside Jeremy Vice. Smith joins from the global structured products group at UBS Warburg.

The Risk Waters World Trade Center Appeal - http://www.riskwaters.com/wtcappeal

This Appeal has been set up for the immediate families of, and any persons financially dependent on, those attending the Risk Waters financial technology conference on the 106th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, who lost their lives in the terrorist attack. Those attending the conference included many delegates, speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, as well as 16 people working for Risk Waters (UK, EU and US individuals).
The initial trustees of the Appeal Fund will be Peter Field (chairman & chief executive, Risk Waters Group Ltd), Dennis Waters (chairman & chief executive officer, GenomeWeb LLC, and director, Risk Waters Group Ltd ) and Andrew Farley (solicitor, Boodle Hatfield, London). Risk Waters Group Ltd will be able to appoint new or additional trustees.
The trustees of the Fund will have discretion over how and to what extent to benefit individual claimants and their decisions will be final. As long as the trustees act honestly and in good faith they will not be legally liable for the exercise of their discretion nor for any loss that may occur to the funds raised, howsoever caused. The Fund will not itself be a charity, but any surplus will be applied for such charitable purposes as the trustees think most appropriate to commemorate those who died.

If you would like to donate to the Fund or find out more information please visit the Risk Waters World Trade Center Appeal website on http://www.riskwaters.com/wtcappeal
