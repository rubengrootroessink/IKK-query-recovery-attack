Natural Gas Futures Slip Slightly Lower



    Natural gas Futures for February delivery on the NYMEX settled $0.003
lower yesterday at $2.272 per MMBtu. The March contract lost $0.004 to
$2.261 per MMBtu. With short-covering from locals and funds in the front
and trade buying in the back months, the market reached $2.35 by
mid-afternoon but then quickly sold off late in the session. The technical
buying on what was being termed an oversold market came in late morning as
locals and funds tried to cover positions, then punched in buy-stops into
the mid-$2.30 before corporate trading houses took profits and sold down
the contract late. It turned out to be a long day's journey to just about
nowhere. Look for the market drop lower early today as yesterday's late
sell-off continues. However, the AGA is expected to report higher
withdrawal tomorrow afternoon than in recent weeks. Early predictions are
for a withdrawal of about  150 - 160 Bcf, compared to 167 Bcf a year ago.
The 5-year average for the week is 118 Bcf. More short-covering later
today could push the market as high as $2.40-$2.50, but it is more likely
to wait for the storage report for direction. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.05 - $0.10
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.06
to $2.30 per MMBtu.

FPL Begins Operation of New Wind Power Projects

    FPL Energy has began full operation of 2 large wind power plants, one
in Texas and the other in Washington.  FPL says the 278 MW King Mountain
Clean Energy Center near Odessa, and the 263 MW Stateline Clean Energy
Center near Walla Walla began operations last month. The two plants join 3
other wind power facilities FPL started in last year: 160 MW at Woodward
Mountain, also near Odessa, 112 MW in Gray County, Kansas, and 30 MW in
Monfort, Wisconsin. FPL Energy operates 1,830 MW and owns 1,439 MW of wind
power facilities in 8 states. FPL will continue to look for appropriate
sites for wind power development, but has expressed concern about the
future of the renewable energy source following the December 2001
expiration of the federal wind energy production tax credit.

PG&E Chromium Lawsuits Could Be Moved to Federal Court

    The judge presiding over Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy will soon
rule on litigation connected to the 1993 case that led to the movie Erin
Brockovich. That case involved 650 people who were paid $333 million by
PG&E to settle claims they drank water containing chromium six, a
potential cause of cancer, near a Hinkley, CA natural gas pipeline station
owned by PG&E. The new claims involve 1,250 people seeking $500 million
for alleged personal injuries that are pending in 15 lawsuits involving
chromium at PG&E's Kettleman, Topock and Hinkley pipeline stations. PG&E
has said its potential liability is $160 million. Chromium six was used at
the pipeline stations in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent the pumps' cooling
systems from rusting then dumped in unlined ponds near the stations.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs say the chromium seeped into underground
water supplies and caused a number of illnesses, including cancer.
Although PG&E has said it used the chemical, it denies that chromium has
caused the illnesses. PG&E attorneys have said that bankruptcy law
mandates that personal injury and wrongful death claims be moved to a US
district court to ensure that the claims are handled as quickly and fairly
as possible. Plaintiffs attorneys contend that the suits were filed long
before the utility filed for bankruptcy and that moving them now to a
federal court would prolong the cases.

Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval

   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to developing
almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region on the coast of
the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy process of applying for
regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 years. Led by Imperial Oil,
the group consists of Conoco, Shell Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a
company controlled by Northwest Territories native people. The partners,
known as the Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250
million before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The
natural gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field,
the 1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and
Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline to
carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the Mackenzie
River valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The natural gas would
then be transported to Canada and the US. Last year, the group signed an
agreement with Northwest Territories native leaders that would give the
region's people a 33% share in the pipeline and provide other economic
benefits. Even if the Mackenzie Delta project did not start pumping for 5
or 6 years, it likely will still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where
BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are planning development of their reserves.

Platts Says Natural Gas Prices Climb 12.6% in January

     Average monthly natural gas spot prices for January rose 12.6 % from
December, to $2.51 per MMBtu, but are 75% below the average reached in
January 2001, according to Platts. In a survey by Inside FERC's Gas Market
Report, the average price of natural gas delivered to the premium New York
and New Jersey markets for January was $4.92 per MMBtu compared with $3.12
per MMBtu in December and $19.33 per MMBtu last January. In Southern
California, the monthly average reached a high of $16.39 per MMBtu in
January 2001, the average monthly spot price for January 2002 climbed to
$2.62 per MMBtu, up 15.4% from $2.27 per MMBtu in December. The January
average is 84% below the January 2001 level. Monthly spot prices for
January climbed higher because weather was cold across most of the nation
at the close of December when most of the January deal making was
happening and because forecasts for the first part of January were for
more of the same. On January 4th, the average price for futures contracts
for the coming 12 months was $2.569 per MMBtu, down 9.25% from the $2.831
average on December 4th and 51% from the $5.241 average on April 4, 2001.

Dynedy Says FERC's New Market Power Proposal Too Risky

    All wholesale power transactions would be vulnerable to default if the
FERC adopts a strict new test for granting wholesale trading rights to
utilities, according to Dynegy.  Last Novermber, the FERC introduced a new
standard for sizing up market power for utilities big enough to influence
energy prices in their areas. The plan has raised a storm of protest from
many utilities. The proposed new market power test is based on the peak
power demand in any given area. If a company controls generation in any
area greater than its peak demand, FERC would require it to base rates on
per-unit production costs, not market-based rates. The previous
market-power test was any firm controlling more than 20% of supplies could
be subject to penalties. The new rules would call to question the finality
of all power market transactions and invite buyers to walk away from
purchase obligations, Dynegy says. About $100 billion in merchant
generation investment could be shelved if the FERC proceeds with a
proposed new rule, Dynegy warned saying all generation investment would be
exposed to a regulatory risk that did not exist before. In December, the
FERC delayed implementation of the new rules for several months until a
technical conference to give companies a chance to offer suggestions.
Dynegy says id the proposed new rules could also stunt the development of
renewable resources like wind, hydro and solar supplies by requiring them
to sell their power at no incremental cost. Entergy has also complained
that the FERC's sweeping changes are not justified by current laws. The
FERC is working to design 4 RTOs nationwide with built-in
market-monitoring capabilities which would negate the need for the new
market power rules. RTOs with approved monitoring systems will be exempt
from the new agency order.

ALL BAD NEWS SEEN IN THE MARKET According to a top industry analyst
traders are going to have to bide their time if they expect natural gas
prices to get much help from recovering industrial demand. Last week the
NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Managers) issued a positive
report concerning industrial activity, but natural gas traders showed
little interest. "Industrial demand could be improving slowly, but what is
going on out there is overshadowed this time of year by weather
developments," says Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. "There
should be some indication of growing industrial demand. The stock market
is a leading indicator of industrial activity and those markets are
looking strong, and some of the other indices are looking OK, but for the
time being industrial activity is being buried by other overwhelmingly
bearish factors. The forecasts for industrial activity and what goes on in
the natural gas market seem to be a bit tenuous at best. for the next
couple of months the focus is going to be on the weather and once we get
to tne end of February, then the industry will focus on industrial
demand." "I do think that all the bad news may be presently factored into
the market. Even though there were new lows made early this week, I think
any low prices much below those levels are going to be difficult to
sustain," he said. GET YOUR FIVE WEEK FREE TRIAL TO GASTRADER NEWSLETTER.
