Today's focus Linux management galore

By Phil Hochmuth

Announcements from Red Hat, Hewlett-Packard and BMC at
LinuxWorld this week should get the attention of anyone looking
to better manage a Linux network, or those interested in
migrating some older Unix servers to Linux.

Red Hat's Network Workgroup service can allow a business to
group systems of Linux machines together in a network to be
managed as a single unit. The service provides Web-based
management software for access to the Red Hat Network, an
online management service that provides automated software
updating and security alert monitoring.

Aimed at helping businesses devise a Linux strategy, HP is
launching its Global Deployment Services for Linux. The service
provides companies with advice on where to use Linux, as well
as installation, testing and post-installation support of Linux
servers. The company is also expanding its pay-per-use support
offering to cover Linux systems, as well as HP-UX and Windows
servers from HP.

BMC is releasing a product that can allow users to make
predeployment decisions for Linux server installations or
migrations from other server platforms. BMC's Patrol for
Perform, Patrol for Predict and a product called Configuration
Manager for Linux, can be used to evaluate workload, capacity
and underlying hardware requirements of supported applications.
This could help users avoid unpleasant surprises when porting
software from Unix to Linux, or when setting up new Linux
servers in general.
