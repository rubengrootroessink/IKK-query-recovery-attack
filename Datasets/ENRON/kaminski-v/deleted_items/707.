Today's focus: Wireless LAN security, Part 1

By Neal Weinberg

You may have heard reports that Wired Equivalent Privacy, the
protocol designed for wireless security, is flawed. The
Reviewmeister heard the same reports, so we decided to test out
a bunch of wireless LAN security products that go beyond WEP.

We tested the following products for their security,
manageability and suitability for enterprise use: 3Com's Access
Point 6000, Avaya's Access Server 1, Cisco's Aironet 350 access
point and Access Control Server (ACS), and Colubris' CN1000.

Our favorite product was the Cisco Aironet 350 and ACS. Cisco's
access point is a sleek, dark-gray box with two flip antennas.
Instead of a power jack, Cisco uses a "power injector" that
sits between your LAN jack and the access point.

You will probably want to configure the unit via a browser, but
a serial port is available as well. Installing the wireless LAN
adapter was quick and easy.

When it came to configuring the card, Cisco's voluminous
documentation was a little troubling. The wireless access point
and the wireless network interface card each have three guides,
for a total of 650 pages worth of documentation.

You can set the system for three different levels of security:
Extensive Authentication Protocol (EAP), Lightweight EAP (LEAP)
and none.

EAP was developed to support multiple authentication
mechanisms. Instead of selecting a specific mechanism, it waits
until the authentication phase. This allows the authenticator
to request more information before determining the specific
mechanism. EAP is a complex standard that's not widely used.
LEAP is Cisco's proprietary implementation of EAP that ensures
mutual authentication using private and public keys.

If you want maximum security, you can set up the access point
to accept LEAP-only, but you also can set it up to use both
LEAP and 128-bit state WEP connections. Both LEAP and EAP
require a Remote Authentication Dial In User Server (RADIUS)
for centralized management of users.

In our tests, we found that we could crack the 128-bit static
WEP in less than 18 hours, but when we switched to a LEAP-
enabled RADIUS server, our network security was still intact 48
hours later.

* Colubris offers innovation

Canadian company Colubris uses embedded VPN technology to
enhance 802.11b security. Colubris largely succeeds with its
CN1000 Wireless LAN Router.

Instead of using a different set of electronics for its access
point, the top of the CN1000 is a PC card slot into which you
slide one of its wireless network interface cards.

The CN1000 includes a built-in network address translation
firewall and the ability to act as a gateway for a hard-wired
subnet. However, support for security is the most important
feature. The product supports VPN pass-through, but the CN1000
is a VPN server. Access control lists can be managed directly
on the access point, which provides good flexibility for most
corporate networks.

The CN1000 comes with a real-time link status, a site survey
tool and a monitoring tool that helps system administrators
plan for the best layout and coverage of wireless LANs.

The Web-based management tool gets a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
enabled link, allowing remote administrators to securely manage
its VPN capabilities through any SSL browser.
