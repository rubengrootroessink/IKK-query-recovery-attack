Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download

By Christopher Cormier

Welcome to this edition of Whitepaper Downloads.  In this
edition we have a landslide of featured whitepapers with a
staggering total of eight.  Today we start off with a
previously featured whitepaper from NetQoS, which demonstrates
the importance of monitoring application response time.  Along
with other previously featured whitepapers we have three brand
new whitepapers posted on Network World Fusion.  The first of
our new whitepapers is from Loudcloud.  In this whitepaper
Loudcloud examines the benefits of Opsware which could help
your company automate its Internet operations.  Next is a
whitepaper from Lucent Technologies, which is an IP services
solutions guide.  Rounding up the latest additions to our
library of whitepapers is an article from Cisco.  In this
whitepaper Cisco illustrates the trends and their solutions
for data, voice and video convergence.


NetQoS
Uptime is Not Enough - Monitor Application Response Time

The applications running on your network are unresponsive,
resulting in end-user dissatisfaction and reduced productivity.
Everyone is looking at you to solve the problem. However, it's
hard to pinpoint the problem and you're spending valuable time
troubleshooting every avenue. Is it the application, server, or
network? Monitoring Application Response Time, a white paper
from NetQoS, will explore the components of application
response time, the response time monitoring approaches
available, and how you can analyze sources of delay in
networked applications without the costly deployment of
endpoint agents.

Winternals Software
Enterprise Defragmenters For Windows NT/2000: Cost and Benefits
Compared

In this whitepaper Winternals Software explains the impact of
defrag software.  Disk defragmentation is an area many
companies are exploring in an effort to cut costs.  According
to Winternals Software many defrag companies claim the use of
defrag software may have a cost savings of nearly $350 annually
per user.  Supported by figures and charts, Winternals Software
demonstrates how ambitious this number appears to be.  In
addition to the cost savings analysis, Winternals unveils other
possible hurdles involved with defrag software.  To provide you
with an alternative, Winternals Software introduces Defrag
Commander. In this article the functionality, effectiveness and
potential cost savings of Winternals' Defrag Commander is
explained.  Click the link below to see how Defrag Commander
may be a benefit your company and your budget.

Loudcloud
The Internet Powered By Automation

Loudcloud has dedicated itself to Internet infrastructure with
the goal of helping companies automate their Internet
operations. This whitepaper outlines the many benefits of
Opsware, which automates many of the tasks associated with
deploying and managing the entire Internet infrastructure of an
enterprise.

Lucent
IP Services Solutions Backgrounder

Lucent begins this article with a look at CPE-based IP services
and how service providers are fighting to utilize their
existing infrastructures while increasing profitability.
According to Lucent, Access Point
 products can deliver multi-
access routing, IP Quality of Service (QoS) with Class-Based
Queuing (CBQ, VPN security, and management services from a
single package.  In addition to benefits such as low cost and
ROI, Lucent demonstrates the capabilities of all of the Access
Point
 products from service providers to end-users.  To

Cisco
SAFE: A Security Blueprint for Enterprise Networks

Cisco, using design guideline sections and configuration
snapshots, has developed a blueprint for designing and
implementing a secure network.  In this whitepaper you can read
about the numerous potential holes typically exploited by
hackers.  Cisco describes various types of attacks, where they
originate, and suggestions on how to combat each type.  Cisco
also explains how hackers use all areas of the network for
their attacks, from routers to applications to hosts.  Along
with all the other features of this whitepaper, in Appendix B
is a Network Security Primer.  To see how Cisco recommends you
secure your network, click the link below.

Cisco
Raising The Bar: Extending Cisco Intrusion Detection with A
Host-Based Solution

This paper examines the combination of the existing NIDS and
the new NIDS components in the Cisco IDS solution by exploring
relevant security issues. It continues with an analysis of the
extent of coverage provided by the combined solution and
examines how well the different components complement each
other.

Cisco
Converging Voice, Data and Video Networks

This whitepaper starts with a brief look at the trends of
voice, data and video convergence.  After the overview of the
trends of convergence, Cisco introduces their answer for the
convergence of data, voice and video called Cisco AVVID
(Architecture for Voice, Video and Integrated Data).  In the
following article Cisco offers a general guide to prepare any
network administrator through the implementation of a Cisco
AVVID network.  For an in depth look at the future of
convergence with Cisco's AVVID, click the link below.
