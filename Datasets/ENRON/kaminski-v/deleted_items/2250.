Dear Vince,
I hope you're well. I am going to print this afternoon and wanted to make
sure that you are happy with the bullet points for the brochure.
I've copied the original ones below. If you would like to alter them please
let me know as soon as possible - if not I'll assume that they are okay.

Kind Regards,
Alix

Understanding Real Options and Their Role Within Decision Making
*	How diversified do you need to be in terms of managing risk in a
company?
*	What are real options and how can they influence your decision
making?
*	Real options as a flexible tool to optimise investments and enable
forward planning in seasonal, annual and long-range price cycles
*	How can you structure your studies and actions to take full
advantage of the different options?
*	The paradigm shift to real options thinking: making uncertainty part
of your strategy and culture instead of driving it out
*	Integrating real options into the decision making process to avoid
competing methodologies for doing evaluations
*	Vince Kaminski, Managing Director,
*	ENRON CORP
