Hello Vince,
 
I just wanted to confirm that I have you scheduled for a one-on-one training session on Friday, June 8th at 9:00 AM.  Please bring your laptop to EB2249B at your assigned time.
 
The process will take approximately an hour and we will go over making sure that your dial-up software works and that you understand the process.  If you are an EBS employee, be sure to bring your secure id token, otherwise, all you will need to bring is your laptop (we provide power supplies for Compaq and IBM laptops.)
 
If you need to cancel, or you are running late, please page me at 713-327-6618 and notify me.  Also, if you are 15 minutes late, you will need to reschedule.
 
Thanks,
 
Melody Gray
Ready2Go

P.S.  At this time, we are unable to help with personally-owned laptops.
