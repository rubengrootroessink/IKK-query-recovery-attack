EIA Says 2002 Natural Gas Prices to Average Just $2.05 
 
    High storage inventories are expected to keep downward pressure 
on natural gas prices throughout most of the year, according to the 
EIA. However, a sharp downturn in drilling activity and growing 
demand should rally prices for 2003, but for 2002 pressure on 
domestic wellhead prices will keep them near $2 per Mcf, the agency 
in its latest short-term energy outlook. Wellhead  prices are 
expected to average $2.05 per Mcf this year before jumping to $2.65 
per Mcf in 2003. Both estimates reflect dramatic reductions from the 
2001 average of $4.14 per Mcf. The agency's quarterly and annual 
price estimates are up slightly from its December report, when EIA 
pegged the 2002 gas price at $1.96 per Mcf.
