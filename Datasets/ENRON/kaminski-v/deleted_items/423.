Today's focus: Think thin

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise users looking to deploy thin client technology with
Linux should be aware of a new product released last week
called WinConnect from Thin Computing.

The software allows a Linux-based PC or terminal to connect to
a Microsoft Windows server. WinConnect software would be
installed on a Linux-based PC with a minimum of 16M bytes of
RAM, a 486 processor or higher, a network connection, X-Windows
and at 400K bytes of storage for the WinConnect software. The
software allows the Linux terminal to access applications and
files on servers running Windows NT 4 Terminal Server or a
Windows 2000 Server.

Like any terminal/server setup, all applications and files
accessed by end users reside on the server. According to Thin
Computing, the software could be used to recycle older PC
hardware as Linux terminals, and allow access to applications
such as Microsoft Office on a central server. The company also
bills the product as a cheaper alternative to deploying Windows
CE or Citrix for larger enterprise terminal server projects. A
version of the software is also available to allow Linux-based
PDAs to access Windows server data.

The idea is kind of the reverse of the open source program
Samba used to allow Windows-based clients to access files and
programs on Linux servers. However, unlike Samba, the software
is neither free, nor open source.
