		What's New at ERisk.com - 25 January 2002	


	  We've reorganised the content on our website! You'll find all of our award-winning  editorial content within the Portal section of the site, where  you'll find our News, Community, Reference and Resource sections. Take  a moment to explore and let us know what you think 	
Weekly Review	In this week's round-up   of economic, banking and P?insurance news from an enterprise risk  management perspective: more financial pain for Japan; Enron's Ken Lay resigns  and Andersen auditor takes the Fifth; concern grows over Argentina; US banks  face up to non-performing loans; UK government withdraws airline terrorism  coverage; and a study shows under-reserving by P?insurers. 	
Analysis	 Aviation  insurers and reinsurers had their worst year ever in 2001, but it was  by no means the first loss-making year for the sector. In this week's  analysis ,  we ask whether the rise in commercial insurance rates - and the spectacular  hardening of aviation rates - can help to bring the industry back into  financial health. Recent analyses: The bleak future for Argentina's  banks ; and the outlook for credit  insurers  in 2002.  	
Viewpoint	 A  founder member of Merrill Lynch's first market risk group back in the  1980s, Mark Lawrence is now chief risk officer at ANZ, one of Australia's  'big four' institutions. In our latest CRO  Profile , he talks to ERisk's Duncan Wood about the changing mandate  for risk management, operational risk, and the need for transparency.   Still  available: ERisk's Sumit Paul-Choudhury on the close  scrutiny  that companies can expect this year from analysts, auditors  and regulators.  	
Research Archive	 This  month, we've added links to the Enterprise  Risk Management  section of the Research  Archive  to help you find recent papers on a range of topics, including:  the incentive effects of the Basle Capital Accord; correspondent banking  fees as an economic capital problem; and the problem of whether risk-adjusted  return on capital (RAROC) methodologies might accentuate the credit cycle. Still available: Moody's Stanislas Rouyer on assessing   the enterprise risk efforts of financial institutions.
