 www.keselimages.com    The  Southwest Region of the United States is one o=
f the most beautiful,  enchanting and mystical places on earth. We searched=
 for an artist that  truly captures and documents the essence of the area. =
Not a flagrantly commercial  artist who wholesales his work to anyone who w=
ill buy it - but an individual  that is sincerely committed to the magnific=
ence and extraordinary energy  of the Southwest.    We  believe Kesel is on=
 his way to becoming the next Ansel Adams!    Kesel  is a photographer who =
has spent two decades exploring, discovering  and capturing the heart and s=
oul of the Southwest. Kesel has spent days,  weeks, months and years docume=
nting the immensity of the Southwest as  well as the most minute, wondrous =
details. Kesel's work is always differentiated  from other artists' because=
 his images always evoke a profound emotion  that speaks to one's soul.    =
"Kesel  does not commence "clicking" until he has fully embraced the passio=
n  of the venue he is viewing. Time and again, when people acknowledge  the=
 beauty of one of the photos that hang on our wall, it is a Kesel."   Lisa =
 G. Asaro   Lisa  and Vince enjoy several of Kesel's images. Vince is CEO o=
f Sun America  Securities.    "I  sometimes travel into the desert or one o=
f the old mining towns  for days. I could be in search of what, I don't kno=
w? In fact, I  usually have no specific agenda. I only know what I'm after =
when  I see it. Sometimes, it takes days to find what I suddenly realize  w=
hat it is I had been looking for. In the end, nature and history  always pr=
ovide a special moment that makes the journey worthwhile."   Kesel Buy  now=
 at:www.keselimages.com     We  have researched a great many photographers =
and found the biggest  difference between a Kesel image and another - is th=
