Today's focus: Bringing Kerberos to NetWare

By Dave Kearns

There has been a fair amount of talk recently about Kerberos
authentication. Kerberos is a network authentication protocol
that provides strong authentication for client/server
applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free
implementation of this protocol is available from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/).

Kerberos is also available in many commercial products. We keep
hearing it in reference to the authentication protocols used by
Windows 2000 and Active Directory (a "Redmondized" form of
Kerberos).

Lots of folks are also asking for some form of Kerberos
authentication for NetWare, either as part of Novell Directory
Services (NDS) eDirectory, or through the Novell Modular
Authentication Service, but as far as I know, no one at Novell
is working on this. However, there is a slight ray of hope.

The University of Pittsburgh is a major user of NetWare and NDS
eDirectory and also has quite a lot of Unix hosts installed. It
uses the Transarc Kerberos 4 authentication protocol to provide
access to the dial-up modem pool, the computing labs, Internet
Message Access Protocol e-mail, and the Timesharing systems.
Unfortunately, it also uses an antiquated process of passing
files around to create these Kerberos and Unix accounts.

Because the process that does this runs only once per day, it
could take up to 48 hours for a computer account to be fully
activated. Additionally, these files do not have a mechanism
for updating information after the account has been created. So
Pitt has created a project to automate this process, and has
decided that Novell's DirXML technology - using Novell
Directory Service's eDirectory as the core data store - is the
right tool.

Pitt is working with Novell Consulting on this project, but you
can follow its progress at http://www.technology.pitt.edu/itplan/cds2/

If you want to try your hand at creating a Kerberos driver for
DirXML, you can get a copy of Pitt's specification at
http://www.technology.pitt.edu/itplan/cds2/appendix.html
along with a copy of the Novell Developer Kit
http://developer.novell.com/ and do it yourself.

Check out the documentation http://developer.novell.com/ndk/dirxml.htm
for the DirXML Driver Kit first, though, just to be sure you understand
what you're getting into!
