Vince,

 It was really nice to be able to discuss things further over lunch
yesterday. Arthur and I would also like to grab the opportunity to visit the
Enron Trading facility. Would next Monday afternoon (December 10) be
convenient for you---anytime after 1 p.m. would be fine with us. Many
thanks.

Praveen
