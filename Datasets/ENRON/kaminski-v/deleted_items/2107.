Today's focus: Limitless Linux clustering

By Phil Hochmuth

Unlimited Scale, a Minnesota-based computer firm, recently
announced a new iteration of Linux, which it says can scale
Linux clusters into the tens of thousands.

Unlimited Linux is the name of the product, and the company has
partnered with Compaq to help deliver large-scale Linux
clusters on Compaq's line of Alpha-based PC servers and
workstations.

According to Unlimited Scale, Unlimited Linux product can be
used to build and manage large-scale, Linux supercomputing
clusters.

The software behind Unlimited Linux was built on a morphed
version of Linux developed by the Sandia National Laboratories
in New Mexico, which runs one of the largest Linux
supercomputer clusters in the world (see "Don't think
'Lintel,' Part 2: Supercomputing with Linux on the Alpha,"
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/linux/2000/0605linux1.html)

The Sandia Lab cluster - called Cplant - has 2,500 Compaq Alpha
nodes in its Linux cluster, which is used to run high-powered
mathematical modeling applications, such as the simulation of
nuclear or biological war scenarios.

Unlimited Linux consists of a standard Linux distribution,
which runs on top of a proprietary software layer based on
Sandia's Cplant clustering code. The code helps tie together
the thousands of nodes in a cluster into a single system image.

Specifics on Unlimited Linux availability and pricing will be
released next month.
