Dear All,

Paul briefed me today that my last day withe Enron Australia will be the 14th Dec. Next step would be to determine my first day with Enron in Houston? 

My wife booked holiday accommodation until the 19th Dec. for a place up the coast (before today's decision). 

Could we please have a call to determine the date of my first day in Houston? 
Maybe in approx. 5 hours time (for the call)?

Regards,
Christian
