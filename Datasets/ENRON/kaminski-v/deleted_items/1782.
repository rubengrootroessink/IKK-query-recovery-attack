Today's focus: More Novell management gaffes

By Dave Kearns

On top of letting go Eric Schmidt as its chairman of the board
of directors last week, Novell also found another 19% (1,400
people) it could do without.

The cuts come a year after Novell reduced its workforce by 15%,
followed by another 5-7% of job cuts made during the
intervening months. Cambridge Technology Partners (CTP - the
so-called "subsidiary" that took over Novell last summer) has
also cut a considerable number (almost 1,000) of its own people
over the past 18 months.

While final numbers aren't in yet, it appears that Novell
Consulting (a separate organization from CTP) was heavily hit
along with European marketing and engineering (once again).
Another way of putting it is that the cuts will affect the
people who know NetWare and its implementation the best. Look
for a large number of new independent consultancies soon.

Previous cuts at Novell have impacted on particular products -
so much so that those products, such as DigitalMe, are no
longer being maintained or improved.

NetWare 6 has been very well received by the press, analysts
and network managers. But it's too soon to say if the product
is enough to stop the hemorrhaging of server installations
going to Windows NT and 2000, though.

In making the job cuts, Novell CEO and new chairman of the
board Jack Messman, reiterated that the company, under his
leadership, would be less about products and more about
services, such as consulting. Why he would cut consulting jobs
wholesale while explaining that consulting would become a
bigger part of the business, he didn't bother to explain.
Perhaps someone should ask him.

The cuts and the nature of the announcement don't augur well
for Novell's future. We can only hope that the outstanding
technical quality of NetWare 6 overcomes the management gaffes.
