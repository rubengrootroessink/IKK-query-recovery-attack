With our economy in a continuing slowdown, the stock market in flux, and fixed income yields dropping, real estate has become the closest thing to a sure bet, or more accurately, a stable investment. As we move into an era of increased uncertainty, real estate may also add a moderating force to worldwide volatility. IIR's REIP 2002 will address the need for real estate investing and share strategies to help you define the characteristics of a successful real estate portfolio. Join some of the leading professionals in real estate investing as they discuss cutting edge ideas and theories, including:
What real estate opportunities exist in today's market  
Does international real estate pay? - Analyzing the legal, tax and overhead issues  
The pros and cons of mezzanine investing - Why is it so hot?  
Getting out of an investment - Should you refinance or sell? 
Why you should invest in under-served markets and property types  
Sector by sector reports - Discover how recent events affect individual sectors
