Vince,

Greetings.

I write at this time for two reasons, one personal, the other formal.

It would be an understatement to say that much has transpired, locally and
globally, since we last spoke Sep. 10th, and since we last exchanged
e-mails Sep. 17th.  If your schedule permits, I would welcome the
opportunity to speak with you.

On a formal note, I write at this time to extend an invitation to you to
participate in the Feb. 22, 2002 Spring 2002 University of Texas Energy
Finance Conference, as a member of a panel entitled "Future of Energy Trading."

As I have in past years, I take this opportunity to extend to you, your
wife and son, Best Wishes for the Holiday Season.

With Respect, and With Best Regards,
Ehud
