Today's focus: Hanging Cisco firewalls

By Jason Meserve


Today's bug patches and security alerts:


* Hardware flaws hang some Cisco firewalls

Hardware flaws in some Cisco firewalls for corporate central
and branch offices have caused the systems to hang or shut
themselves down and forced Cisco to replace the affected boxes.
Some Cisco Pix 515, 515-DC and 506 Firewalls have suffered
system hangs when traffic on the network becomes too heavy,
requiring IS staff to manually restart the firewall, Cisco
reported in an Oct. 18 field notice on its Web site.

* Linux-Mandrake releases new version of kernel 2.2

A flaw in the ptrace module of the Linux kernel version 2.2
could lead to a local user gaining root privileges. The kernel
is also vulnerable to a symlink attack that could lead to a
denial of service. Linux-Mandrake users should download this
kernel update:
http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security/2001/MDKSA-2001-082.php3


* SuSE patches kernel

SuSE's kernel suffers from the same ptrace root privileges and
symlink denial-of-service attack vulnerabilities as other Linux
flavors. Kernel versions 2.2 and 2.4 have been updated:
http://lists2.suse.com/archive/suse-security-announce/2001-Oct/0003.html


* New RWhois patch available

ARIN Engineering has released an updated version of its RWhois
code to fix a recently discovered vulnerability. The patch can
be downloaded from:
ftp://ftp.arin.net/pub/rwhois/rwhoisd-1.5.7-1.tar.gz


* Red Hat patches print spool

According to a Red Hat alert, when used in a spooling
environment, it is inappropriate to allow programs to read
arbitrary files as a result of print requests. Ghostscript, a
postscript interpreter, can read arbitrary system files with
the same permissions as the print spooler, potentially exposing
the system to an information compromise. For more and links to
the appropriate patch, go to:

Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* W32/Antset - This Windows virus comes as an attachment called
"ants3set.exe" in a message titled "ANTS Version 3.0." It
spreads by sending itself to everyone listed in an Outlook
address book as well as by searching Web-related files for e-
mail addresses. The virus uses the infected user's SMTP server
as well as a number of hard-coded servers. (Panda Software,
Computer Associates, Sophos)

Troj/Septer - This is the Trojan Horse program that pretends to
be a Red Cross donation system. It steals credit card data and
other personal information. (Sophos)

I-Worm/Redesi.A - A worm that displays a dialog box on the
infected machine's screen and e-mails itself out to everyone in
the computer's address book. Its cousin, Redesi-B, also
modifies the autoexec.bat system to reformat the C: drive on
Nov. 11, 2001. (Panda Software)

W32/Toal@MM - An e-mail worm that spreads via an attachment
called "BINLADEN_BRASIL.EXE." It creates several files in the
Windows directory of the infected machine. No word on what
other damage it causes. (Panda Software)

Win32/Krn132 or Win32/Klez - A Windows virus that comes in a
randomly named e-mail with random attachment names from a list
of specific addresses. The worm spreads via e-mail and open
network shares. (Computer Associates, Sophos)

W98/Elkern - This virus is dropped by Win32/Klez (see above).
It only infects Windows 98 and ME machines. (Sophos)

WM97/Thus-FB - A Word macro virus that displays the following
message on the 12th of any month: "It's TOO much violence in
this world! Have MOT to stop it!" (Sophos)

WM97/Marker-JT - Another Word macro virus that has a 1-in-3
chance of changing a document's summary information so that the
title will read "Ethan Frome," the author will be listed as
"EW/KN/CB" and the keywords field will show up as "Ethan."
(Sophos)
