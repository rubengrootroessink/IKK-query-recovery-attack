Today's focus: IBM offers Linux clusters to-go

By Phil Hochmuth

IBM, Linux's biggest friend, last week announced new pre-
configured Linux server cluster offerings that could help
businesses quickly get powerful database or high-availability
systems running in their networks.

IBM will offer Linux clusters ranging from four to 1,000-plus
servers. The Linux server hardware will be based on IBM's X330
and X342 PC servers running Red Hat 7.1. Cluster and file
management software from IBM, based on its SP supercomputer
software, will be used to tie the server clusters together.

IBM's Linux clusters act as a single system, with processing
power distributed among the nodes in a cluster. The cluster
maintains a single file system image, supported by all the
nodes. Users of Linux clusters say the system's high
availability comes from the fact that the cluster cannot be
brought down by a single, or even multiple, server failures,
depending on the size of the cluster.

IBM's clusters will be targeted at specific applications, such
as high-availability e-mail, database serving, transaction
processing and e-commerce. IBM's DB2 and WebSphere e-business
software will be preloaded on the database and on the e-
commerce/transaction processing clusters, respectively.

Linux clusters from IBM will be available at the end of the
month. Pricing for an eight-server cluster will start around
$85,000.
