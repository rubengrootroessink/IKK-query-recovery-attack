Today's focus: Lots on tap at Linux World 2002

By Phil Hochmuth

While Linux World Expo in New York next week will be the first
of a myriad of Linux events in 2002, it could become the year's
biggest Linux gig.

Keynote names at a conference are always a good sign of its
importance, and this year's New York Linuxfest has drawn the
likes of Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, and Computer
Associates CEO Sanjay Kumar. The show will also be the launch
pad for many Linux announcements (and a source for endless free
stuff).

On the hardware front, HP is expected to announce new Linux
products in the telecommunications area, while AMD will outline
its plans for Linux on its 64-bit processor architecture.
Server-related announcements will also be on hand from Compaq,
IBM and Dell, among others.

Geodesic, a maker of application management software, is
expected to launch a new software suite for Linux that can
monitor, fix and report on errors in an application running on
enterprise Linux servers.

Serena Software will announce a version of its ChangeMan DS
product for Linux on the IBM S/390 mainframe, which can be used
to manage the development and deployment of applications on a
mainframe in an enterprise. Also showing management wares will
be Aduva, which makes applications for automating the
installation process of Linux servers and workstations.

King of the Linux applications announcements will be Computer
Associates, which will launch 22 software products for Linux
including Linux server management tools, plus security and
software for managing Linux in mixed network environments.
