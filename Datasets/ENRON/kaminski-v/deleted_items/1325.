Anurag, 
I forwarded the resume to London but I have not heard from 
them. I shall be in London late in June and I shall bring it up 
in person with the IT people.

   Vince, 
   I  wanted to follow up with you concerning our earlier exchange 
   regarding my  brother Vikas Saksena. Have you had a chance to speak to 
   your IT folks? I will  be meeting with Vikas in London by the end of 
   this month and will get a chance  to talk to him in more detail. May I 
   ask him to call you directly. For your  reference his phone number in 
   London is 44 208 343 3298. 
   Thanks 
   Anurag
