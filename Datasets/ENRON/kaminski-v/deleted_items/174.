Just a little note....
Since the Research Group will be gone on Jan. 31, 2002, I want to make sure that you know that the Research Group Laptop (asset tag # 990860) that was returned to me will managed by Kevin Moore as of today 1/24/02.  Kevin will be the only remaining employee from this group.  If there is anymore information needed pertaining to this please feel free to contact me at x35245.

Theresa,

I returned the laptop labelled 'Research' to the cubicle right outside of 1968.  I was told that the person who sits there is not in today, so I wanted to let you know what has been done with it.
