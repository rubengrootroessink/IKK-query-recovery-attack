Paul, 

I am in Brazil today. The best time to talk would be Mon  eve 
my time (5 p.m.), Tue morning your time. 

Mid-December would work for us. 
By the way, did you receive my msg re Tom 
Halliburton. He is a very competent quant 
and he would take a job in Sydney.

Let's discuss Christain's cross-over date.  We have found a replacement and consider 8-10 weeks as a suitable period.  This would have him ending mid-December.

Let me know the best time to speak.
