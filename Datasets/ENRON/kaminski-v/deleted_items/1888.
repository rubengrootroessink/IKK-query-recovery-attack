GPCM Version 9.0.8.3 Now Available
 
An enhanced version of the GPCM User Interface is now available to GPCM licensees.  This version has three improvements over version 9.0.8.2:
Improved Check Routine:  now finds instances where Min_Flowis greater than Max_Flowin any input table
Storage_Statustable no longer needed:  all storage related information is now contained in Storage_Data, Storage_Plan, and Storage_Link.  There is no longer a necessity to maintain compatibility between Storage_Statusand Storage_Plan
Send E-Mail on run completion:  a new option:  when GPCM has finished a run (even as part of a batch), an e-mail is sent to the e-mail address you specify

 
Enhancements in 9.0.8, 9.0.8.1 and 9.0.8.2 released earlier included:
Build New Pipeline Models and Model Changes More Easily
Greater Flexibility in Creating New Supply and Demand Scenarios
Major Upgrade to Flow Constraints Report
Enhancements in Supply and Demand Summary reports
Enhancements in Supplier Delivery and Customer Receipts Summary reports
Storage Utilization Report modified to work with input capacities expressed in mmcfper day
