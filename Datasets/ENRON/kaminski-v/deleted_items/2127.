> administrator of the world's largest competitive wholesale energy market and
> operator of the electric grid for the mid-Atlantic region, today announced the
> successful completion of a Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) 70 type II
> audit. Performed by the independent firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the

> comprehensive set of control objectives designed to protect the integrity of
> market settlement data.  PJM, the nation's first fully functioning Regional
> Transmission Organization (RTO), is the only Independent System Operator that
> has successfully completed this type of audit. By accomplishing the SAS 70
> type II audit, PJM provides assurance to its 200 members that the information
> and activities they rely on from PJM are operated in a well controlled and
> risk managed environment.

> demonstrate to our members that our control and business practices meet
> stringent guidelines," said Phillip G. Harris, PJM president and chief
> executive officer.

> audit encompassed all control objectives related to the PJM market settlement
> process as well as PJM's eSuite of tools - the information technology
> infrastructure that supports the multiple PJM markets.  According to PwC's
> findings, the controls that were tested were operating with sufficient
> effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance that the specified control
> objectives were achieved during the time period covered by the audit.

> PJM has voluntarily initiated both SAS 70 type I and type II audits.  Both
> reviews evaluate the design of the internal controls surrounding processes and
> application systems, as well as the suitability of the design capabilities to
> achieve specific objectives.  The recently completed type II audit is more
> comprehensive in that it also evaluates and tests whether the designed
> processes are operating effectively over a specific period of time.  PJM will
> continue to volunteer in this intense type II audit process on an on-going
> basis.  The company has already commenced the next SAS 70 type II audit
> process.
