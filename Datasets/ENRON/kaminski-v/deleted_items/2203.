Rick:

Greetings.

You may recall my 9/18 e-mail to Greg Whalley inviting him to keynote our
Spring 2002 UT Energy Finance Conference at dinner on Thur., Feb. 21, 2002.

I take the opportunity of your Austin visit tomorrow to inquire whether Mr.
Whalley has made a decision, hopefully positive, to accept our invitation.

I look forward to seeing you tomorrow evening.  With Best Regards,
Ehud
