Hi Vince,

	I just learned that all 10 seats are available at the table for us.  So we need to fill four seats.  Maybe we could stop by Rick Buy's office in the afternoon.  Regarding the other two seats, I was thinking of Jim Bouillion or David Gorte or even Cassandra Schultz or David Port, maybe to improve relationships with RAC.
