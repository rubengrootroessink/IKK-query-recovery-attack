Hi Vince!

As the SFO conference draws near we are gearing up for the panel session.
Rita McGrath at Columbia is the chair.

There are four presenters of which you will be the representative from practice.

The others are Rita, Max Boisot of ESADE in Spain and I.

We would like for you to talk for 20 minutes on the major and most successful applications of real options at Enron.

I think the greatest impact will take place if we finishwith you because of the practical implications of your talk for the attendees - there are usually about 400 academics and 400 practiotioners at the conference, though we will be in smaler rooms due to the fact that there are multiple, simultaneous presentations

The conference is at the Westin St Francis
