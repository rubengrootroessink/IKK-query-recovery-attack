---------------------------------- Technical -------------------------


(1) Bluetooth Voice Simulink Model
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless networking technology that enables
easy interconnection of mobile computers, mobile phones, headsets,
personal digital assistants, and computer peripherals without the need
for cables. When designing Bluetooth systems and semiconductors, it is
crucial to simulate and test them in the presence of interference from
these other devices. Simulink enables you to simulate the behavior of
their devices...

(2) The Technical Support Guide to Graphics Rendering and
    Troubleshooting
This Technical Note provides information on renderers, how to
diagnosis some common OpenGL issues, and troubleshooting of these
issues.  It also covers known conflicts and behaviors that occur
during graphical rendering.

(3) MATLAB File Exchange
The File Exchange at MATLAB Central features hundreds of free M-Files
and Simulink models, all written by members of the MATLAB community.
You can quickly sort the contributions several convenient ways and
contribute your own files.

----------------------------- Product Information --------------------


(4) Instrument Control Toolbox support for TekVISA
Tektronix, Inc. and The MathWorks now provide connectivity between
Tektronix mid- and high-performance lines of oscilloscopes and MATLAB.
This interface was created by adding support for TekVISA...

(5) DSP Blockset
The DSP Blockset is a Simulink block library that provides the
algorithmic  foundation for many applications in speech and audio
processing, telephony, wireless and broadband communications, computer
peripherals, radar/sonar, and medical electronics. It contains blocks
for filter design, including adaptive and multirate filter design,
spectral and parametric estimation...

(6) New API for Stateflow
A new API for Stateflow 4.2 provides convenient programmatic access to
Stateflow(R). Through individual MATLAB commands or scripts of commands,
you can manipulate Stateflow objects (machines, charts, states, boxes,
functions, notes, transitions, junctions, data, events, and targets)
to perform actions that were previously only available through the
Stateflow graphical interfaces...

(7) Third Party Product: PowerDAQ PCI-based Data Acquisition Products
    from United Electronic Industries, Inc.(UEI)
MATLAB users can communicate directly with UEI's PowerDAQ hardware
using the MATLAB Data Acquisition Toolbox with a driver that is
provided along with the PowerDAQ Software Suite.  This enables you to
bring data directly into MATLAB...
