RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN REALIGNS RUSSIAN DIPLOMACY WITH THE WEST

Russian President Vladimir Putin has surprised Western governments by strongly
supporting the antiterrorist alliance and offering to join NATO. Regardless of
the outcome, Putin's decisive course suggests a president who feels strong at
home and has grown on the job. There could be important consequences for energy
and investment issues.

*  Russia could increase oil exports from 2.8 million barrels per day (mbd)
today to 4.0 mbd by 2005.

*  Russia's overtures to Europe could give new life to the Prodi-Putin "gas
bridge" between Russia and Europe.

*  Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization will be accelerated.
