ANALYSIS

The $1 trillion credit derivatives market has been through a testing time recently. The bankruptcies of Swissair and the UK's Railtrack &#8211; both companies with actively traded default swaps &#8211; have focused attention on the efficiency of the market. So far, things seem to be working fine. But concerns are growing about some of the issues surrounding coverage for convertible bonds. In this week's banking analysis, ERisk's Duncan Woods investigates.

How to get credit systems up to scratch will be the big issue in banking in 2002, and the same problem is already occupying many energy risk practitioners. But why are some credit system projects successful, while others fail? And are software vendors the providers of a 'solution' or purveyors of hot air? In this exclusive ERisk feature, Karl Sees, principal at CreditRisk Advisers, sounds out banking and energy practitioners on the ingredients for a successful project.
