"Houston, Compaq and Technology"
Houston is not only the energy capital of the world, but there is growing recognition nationwide of the important role Houston plays in technology in a number of technology sectors.  The crown jewel in our technology sector is Compaq Computer Corporation under the leadership of Michael D. Capellas.  No sector of the economy has spurred greater growth and recently, greater volatility, but has greater long-term promise than the technology sector.
Mr. Capellas will address these and other issues when he speaks on technology in Houston.  Michael D. Capellas is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Compaq Computer Corporation.  A leading expert in information technology and supply chain management, he joined Compaq in 1998 as Chief Information Officer.  He was named Chief Executive Officer in July of 1999 and Chairman in September 2000.
Immediately prior to joining Compaq, Mr. Capellas held senior positions at Oracle Corporation and SAP America.  At Oracle, he served as Senior Vice President and General Manager for the company's global energy business.  As SAP America, he was Director of Supply Chain Management.  Prior to joining SAP, he was managing partner of Benchmarking Partners, a leading information management-consulting firm.
From 1981-1996, Mr. Capellas held several senior positions at Schlumberger Ltd., including serving as the company's first Corporate Director for Information Systems.  He also served as Controller and Treasurer of Schlumberger's operation in Asia Pacific, Chief Financial Officer of Dowell Schlumberger Inc., a joint venture between Schlumberger and Dow Chemical; and a senior position in operations management at Schlumberger's Fairchild Semiconductor unit.
Mr. Capellas began his career at Republic Steel Corporation.  He is a 1976 graduate of Kent State University.
