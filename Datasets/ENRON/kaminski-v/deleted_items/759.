Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download

By Christopher Cormier

Welcome to the first edition of Whitepaper Downloads in 2002.
To begin the new year we have three whitepapers highlighted for
you this week. The first highlighted whitepaper is brought to us
by Stalker Software.  In this whitepaper Stalker demonstrates the
diversity and functionality of their Internet messaging system,
CommuniGate Pro.  Next we have a whitepaper from Net QoS which
deals with how to monitor and maintain application response time
using NetQoS's SuperAgent.  Finally we have a whitepaper brought
to us by NSI Software.  In this whitepaper Gartner Consulting
asks why installation of continuity systems and disaster recovery
solutions has not grown significantly.  Using real world
examples involving outages for major industry leaders, Gartner
outlines the benefits of continuity systems and disaster
recovery solutions.

NetQoS
Uptime Is Not Enough - Monitoring Application Response Time

The network is up, so your worries are over. Right! The minute
an end user has a problem with a poorly performing application,
you can expect the phone to ring with complaints about "the
network is slow". Given the time consuming process of
researching problems - in between additional complaint calls
and answering to management - you can look forward to being on
the hot seat for a while. This NetQoS white paper will explore
the components of application response time, the response time
monitoring approaches available, and how new approaches can
greatly simplify the process of analyzing sources of delay in
networked applications.

NSI Software
A Gartner Consulting Report: "How Will You Get Your Data Back
After the (insert catastrophe here)?"

In this whitepaper, Gartner Consulting asks the question: Why
has the installation of continuity systems and disaster
recovery solutions not grown explosively in the past few years?
After a brief introduction, this article clearly defines the
differences between industry terms disaster recovery, business
recovery, business resumption and contingency planning.  Using
specific examples, Gartner has demonstrated the financial
impact of system outages on major industry leaders.  According
to Gartner, despite the potential crippling consequences of
neglecting a business continuance plan, IT managers are often
faced with the challenge of how to justify the expense.  To
read more on how important a solid business continuance plan
may be to you and your company, click the link below.
