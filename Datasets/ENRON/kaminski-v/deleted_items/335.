		What's New at ERisk.com - 18 January 2002	


Weekly Review	In this week's round-up   of news from an enterprise risk management perspective: bad news for the  audit profession; mixed news on corporate earnings; Citigroup reports strong  results despite Enron and Argentina worries; Morgan Chase hit by fourth-quarter  losses; Hamilton Bank closed down by regulators; Lloyd's of London proposes  radical reforms; federal coverage for terrorism is back on the agenda for  US insurers.	
Analysis 	 Argentina's  domestic banks are in a desperate situation - and foreign banks without  an exit strategy from their Argentine investments have plenty of problems,  too. But, as Duncan Wood reports in this week's analysis ,  the needs of the banking sector are likely to remain a low priority for  the government as long as the domestic situation remains so volatile. 	
Viewpoint	In  the wake of the Enron bankruptcy - as well as some of the other, less dramatic  problems experienced by firms last year - companies of all sorts can look  forward to increasingly tough scrutiny in 2002. In the first of our new  Opinion   columns, ERisk's Sumit Paul-Choudhury looks at what they can expect from  analysts, auditors and regulators, and asks how management should respond. Still available:  Our Q?   with the developers of Risk Values.	
Feature	With  enterprise risk management (ERM) now emerging as a distinct activity in  financial institutions, third parties such as regulators and rating agencies  have begun to probe ERM's real worth and to offer new perspectives on its  most useful components. In our latest feature ,  "Enterprise risk management for financial institutions", Stanislas  Rouyer of Moody's Investors Service offers his view of the key components  of ERM, and discusses how ERM relates to third-party analysis and the growing  pressure for risk disclosure by financial institutions. Still available: Our review of 2001 ,  featuring contributions from a range of bank risk managers. 	
Bookstore	The latest Book of the  Month in the ERisk Bookstore   is The Pretender. Subtitled "How Martin Frankel Fooled the Financial  World and Led the Feds on One of the Most Publicized Manhunts in History",  our featured book takes a lively look at the most outrageous insurance sector  scandal of the late 1990s.
