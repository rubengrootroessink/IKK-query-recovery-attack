Attached is a draft version of the Alliance of Energy  Suppliers' comments on the Generator Interconnection ANOPR and industry  collaborative process. Please provide comments, suggested edits or  inclusions by COB Wednesday to both Jonathan Gottlieb at jonathan.w.gottlieb@bakernet.com  and  myself.
 
Again, we thank all that participated on the drafting  conference call and provided valuable input. We have incorporated those issues  and concerns in this draft. As you will notice in the draft, we applauded the  Commission for its efforts in coordinating the industry collaborative and the  positive results the process yielded. We then addressed several components of  both the Interconnection Agreement and Procedures documents that generators are  pleased with and those inclusions in the final collaborative  documents that we believe do not go far enough. Finally, we stated that the  support for these documents are contingent upon the continued use of the  cost principles and pricing assumptions in Attachment B of the ANOPR, which the  Commission directed industry to work from. 
 
Thank you,
Tonja Wicks
