Dear Vince and Mark
 
I am writing concerning the GARP 2002 Convention -  which will be held in New York on 11th to 14th February 2002. In particular, I  am writing concerning the Energy Risk Management Workshop that you will be  co-leading.
 
It is really a matter of absolute urgency  that I have the final topic title and the agenda for this workshop by the close  of business on Monday 15th October. I really can not wait any  longer, as I have sent all information except the energy risk management  workshop to the brochure designers and printers.
 
I have attached a draft of what I have devised, but  this is just a basis and I really do need your expert opinions on the  subject.
 
If you have any questions please do contact me as  soon as possible, otherwise I look forward to receiving the information by  Monday.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
