As was announced in today's Jones News, the school wide events calendar has
moved from Yahoo to the Jones School's web site.  The Yahoo calendar will
be disabled this afternoon.

The address of the new calendar is http://jonesgsm.rice.edu/calendar  As
with the rest of the web site the calendar is an evolving project so check
back often for the latest events and features.  This is a publicly
available calendar so please tell friends and family to check here to see
what's up at the Jones school.

Linda Werckle is still the primary point of contact to have your event
placed on the calendar.  The best way to contact her to have your event
placed on the calendar is by e-mail to werckle@rice.edu or telephone
