Hi Anne,
 
we are getting requests for payment from Dun & Bradstreet.  This is presumably (I have not seen the invoice) for data that Enron Credit purchased from them to build credit models.  We were asked to use this data to build the models.  The Enron Credit main contact was Craig Chaney, who I believe is no longer with the company.  Who (in the company) should I refer Dun & Bradstreet to?
 
Thanks,
Vasant

Hi Karen, I received a bill from D&B for 26,028.71.  Please let me know what it is about, I guess the billing responsibility for this project resides in the head of someone in EES or EnronCredit.com.
 
thanks
