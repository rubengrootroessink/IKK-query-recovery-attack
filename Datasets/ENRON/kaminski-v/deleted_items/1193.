 Tropical development takes place in the Gulf of Mexico. We were acutely aw=
are of t-storms yesterday along the Texas and Louisiana coasts and then in =
the afternoon Allison was born. She came ashore last night in SE Texas and =
is located north of Houston. The surface circulation should disappear later=
 today, but the remnants may hang around for quite sometime. Some models su=
ggest this well into next week. Combine this with a front that approaches f=
rom the North and stalls over the region towards the weekend and you have a=
 recipe for very heavy rains. In the extreme, you could see some areas get =
well over a foot of rain the next several days in Louisiana, Mississippi, a=
nd Alabama. The rest of the Gulf Coast into the SE and Tennessee Valley sho=
uld see significant rain as well from these features.  ! The rest of the sh=
ort term forecast appears as advertised earlier in the week. A cold front i=
n the Midwest now gets to the East coast by the weekend. This brings more s=
cattered Showers and T-storms to areas East of the Mississippi. Another dip=
 in the jet stream follows this front for the East this weekend into early =
next week. The trough is not expected to be as strong as the last several s=
o the air will not be as cool. Still, it looks like low AC demand for much =
of the East into early next week and lower than normal demand in the South =
due to the heavy rain threat. The ridge reforms later this week in the Inte=
rior West. Warmer than normal temperatures spread from the Desert SW into t=
he Rockies and Plains. Temperatures should remain moderate from the Pacific=
 NW into the Northern Rockies.    Tomorrow: Summary Forecast for Thu, Jun  =

 6 6    Day 6-10 Discussion:  There appears to be considerable disagreement=
 in the models today with regards to the longer range. With that in mind, I=
 will leave my predictions from earlier in the week intact until I see evid=
ence from the actual weather that a change is in order. I will leave it to =
others to flip-flop daily depending upon what a particular model does. Most=
 of the modelling shows evidence of troughs near both coasts with a ridge i=
n the middle. The disagreements are on strength and size. The American mode=
ls take on more of a status quo look with the potential for another deep Gr=
eat Lakes/Northeast trough late next week. Granted this has been the patter=
n the last month, but it seems overdone for Mid June. The European and Cana=
dian models meanwhile expand the Continental U.S. Ridge more than I am comf=
ortable with. The European in particular may have some forec! asters scream=
ing heatwave next week. Given the recent heavy rains in most of the Eastern=
 two thirds of the country, this too is overdone. So, a compromise still lo=
oks to be the best solution at this point. Therefore, I see a definite warm=
 up in the five day period, but anything much above normal will have a toug=
h time getting East of the Mississippi.    Day 6: Summary Forecast for Mon,=
