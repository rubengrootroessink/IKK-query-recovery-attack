Vince, 

Here is my thoughts on the upcoming reorg.  In my mind,
it seems logical to create a team specialized in EWS trading/origination
support.  

I would suggest Vasant to oversee EBS support.  Where do you
want to put  the power fundamental team ?  Vasant has more 
experience to manage this team although they can be also classified
as trading support.  In term of head counts, I am inclined to let Vasant
supervise this team.
