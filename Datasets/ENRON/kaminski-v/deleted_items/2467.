Today's focus: Putting Linux on Windows

By Phil Hochmuth

Last week, a new Linux distribution was announced - no big
deal, right? A new one seems to be launched every other week.
LindowsOS, however, hopes to differentiate itself by being the
only Linux flavor that can run popular Microsoft Windows
applications, such as Word and Excel, natively from a Linux
desktop.

Lindows.com, the purveyor of the LindowsOS, claim that its
Linux application can not only run Windows applications
straight from Linux, but also run them as fast as they world
perform under Windows using the same hardware.

In the past, users have had to use programs like WINE to run
Windows applications from Linux, and the result was often a
little slower than desired. People also have run dual-boot
Linux/Windows PCs for years, and some Linux distributions, such
as Mandrake, allow users to run Linux in a separate windows
from the Windows partition of a dual-boot machine (through the
Linux4Windows tool).

The key to Lindows is a layer of translation code, which will
run on an Intel-based PC along with a Linux distribution and a
graphical user interface designed by Lindows. This software
will do the actual conversion of Microsoft binaries and run
them on Linux as a native application, the company claims, as
opposed to running the programs through a Windows emulation
program on Linux. LindowsOS will be available before year end
for $99.

Incidentally, Lindows was established three months ago by
Michael Robertson, who also set up MP3.com. No stranger to
using disruptive technology to rile big, powerful companies,
Robertson, hopes to ruffle feathers at Microsoft, just like he
did with major record labels with his MP3.com site. Whether
LindowsOS is up to delivering on its lofty technical claims
remains to be seen.
