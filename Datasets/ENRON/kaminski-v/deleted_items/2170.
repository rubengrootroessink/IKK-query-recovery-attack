Today's focus: With friends like these...

By Dave Kearns

Normally, I wouldn't use this newsletter to mention a NetWare-
to-Windows 2000 migration product. It just seems a little
tacky. But when one of the oldest companies in the NetWare
third-party utility market joins forces with a former Novell
competitor to, according to the press release,  "accelerate
the migration from Novell NetWare to Microsoft Windows 2000
Server," I think it's something you should know about, and
perhaps act upon.

It's not surprising that ePresence (http://www.epresence.com/)
would join with others in the migration to Win2K business.
Formerly called Banyan, ePresence two years ago abruptly
abandoned the Vines network operating system, which at one
time was NetWare's biggest competitor, to concentrate on the
delivery of services, especially the delivery of Windows NT
and Windows 2000 network design and implementation services.

What is surprising is that security tools vendor BindView, would
now join with ePresence in an attempt to exploit whatever
uncertainty there is in the NetWare market. The uncertainty was
recently stoked by Microsoft's misleading advertisement against
Novell and the subsequent lawsuit (see "Novell sues Microsoft over
ad campaign," http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/1002newnovell.html).

BindView founder and CEO, Eric Pulaski, was just another
NetWare consultant when he created BindView, one of the first
third-party NetWare utilities, almost 15 years ago. At that
time, the program gave network managers a way to see all of the
information in a NetWare Bindery - hence the name BindView. The
name continued even as the company grew more successful and
switched emphasis to NetWare's directory (NDS/eDirectory),
which replaced the Bindery.

NetWare managers made Pulaski's fortune for him - enough so
that he's a board member of two major Houston charitable
organizations. Now he's going to pay you back - by telling your
boss (by means of ePresence's consultants) that upgrading from
NetWare to Windows servers is the thing to do. According to
Scott Silk, senior vice president of marketing and business
development for ePresence,  "This alliance with BindView helps
us to provide Novell users with an ideal solution." Ideal for
Microsoft, perhaps.

Maybe it's time you let BindView know what you think.
