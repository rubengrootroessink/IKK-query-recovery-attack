Dear Wincenty Kaminski:
On November 7, we wrote you regarding CORPORATE BUDGETING IS BROKEN--LET'S FIX IT, a new "Harvard Business Review" OnPoint article. We wanted to make sure you had a chance to respond before this special offer closes. The original offer is presented in its entirety below. If you are simply not interested, we apologize for the intrusion. 
--------------------------------------------------
Are your managers lying, cheating, and scheming?
Probably--if you tie their bonuses to budget targets.
In the name of corporate budgeting, are people working against your company's best interests?
Consider this all too typical story: To meet a quarterly revenue target, managers at a heavy-equipment manufacturer shipped unfinished products from their plant in England to a warehouse in Holland, for final assembly near the customer. The managers earned their bonuses--but the high cost of assembling the goods at a distance eroded the company's profits.
It doesn't have to be this way--if you take radical action. No, don't eradicate budgeting--the budget process itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's the use of budget targets to determine compensation that wastes time and encourages deception. So, sever that budget-bonus link. Reward people for real performance, not just their ability to hit targets.
The new "Harvard Business Review" OnPoint article "Corporate Budgeting Is Broken--Let's Fix It" reveals how to keep your managers honest. In addition to the full-text article, a one-page distillation and annotated bibliography are included.
