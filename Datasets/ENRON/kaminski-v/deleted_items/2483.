Vince,

I hope this e-mail finds you well.  As you have probably deduced, the financial events of the day have me a bit flustered and I'm not my normal self.  Sorry about all the other e-mails, I hit the sent button before I attached the final version.  I wish they had retrieval function.  Let's try again.

Thanks for the suggestions, the column reads much better now.  I was a bit without resources last night.


   

Sincerely,

Maureen
