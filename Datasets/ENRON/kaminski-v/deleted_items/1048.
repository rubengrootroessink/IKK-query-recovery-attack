Today's focus: HP sharpens its Linux blade servers

By Phil Hochmuth

Users looking to cram lots of Linux servers into a small area
should look into Linux blade server technology soon to be
released from Hewlett-Packard.

Blade servers are complete server systems - including
processors, hard drive, memory and network interface cards -
built onto a single circuit board which fits into a chassis
with a CompactPCI (CPCI) bus. Instead of regular servers, which
talk to each other over network cables with Fast or Gigabit
Ethernet, the server blades communicate with other servers over
the CPCI bus. This eliminates the need for cabling to
interconnect servers, allows servers to share a common power
supply, and provides up to 1G bit/sec speeds between the
blades. Up to 38 blade servers can fit in a standard CPCI bus.

HP's new blade servers are being billed for applications such
as streaming media and Web hosting. The bc1100 model blade will
come with a 700-MHz Intel Pentium III processor, 312M bytes of
RAM and a 30G-byte hard drive. The server blades will support
Red Hat Linux, SuSE and Debian.

The bc1000s could be used by enterprises looking to consolidate
several servers in a rack - such as Web, database, file and
application servers - into a smaller space for easier
management. The platform would also be used to shrink down a
large, collocated Web server farm into one box, saving on
collocated space charges.

Network professionals will be able to get their hands on the
bc1000 Linux server blades in January at a cost of $1,925 per
server. Don't cut yourself!
