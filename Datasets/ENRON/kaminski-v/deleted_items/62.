Lab on a Chip - Revolution and Portable Instrumentation, 4th Edition
Microfabrication and the drive to analyze thousands or hundreds of thousands of samples quickly and efficiently have led to the development of a new form of analytical technology: "The lab on a chip." Standard laboratory techniques such as electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequencing can now be accomplished with a speed only dreamed of a decade ago. The outlook for labs-on-a-chip (LOCs) is optimistic....  
There have been a significant number of major developments in the LOC landscape since the last edition of this report was published in 1999.
