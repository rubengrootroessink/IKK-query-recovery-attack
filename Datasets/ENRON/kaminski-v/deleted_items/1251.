Westcoast to Expand Pipeline Capacity

    Westcoast Energy plans to expand it system by 250 MMcf per day of
natural gas transportation capacity offered in two proposed pipeline
expansions in western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. A recent open
season
to sell the capacity on the proposed pipeline expansions aimed at meeting a
surge in demand from power plants was successful. Total volumes from both
pipeline expansions, which could begin commercial service in 2003, would be
more than enough supply for 1,500 MW of power generation. The expansions
will link markets in the BC Lower Mainland and Pacific Northwest with
supplies from BC, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. Westcoast is
preparing to award 200 MMcf per day of expansion capacity on its Southern
Mainline facilities to ten shippers with an average term of 27 years. It is
also preparing to award 50 MMcf per day of new capacity on its Westcoast
Alberta facilities to four shippers with an average term of 30 years.

The southern system expansion will coincide with a similar expansion of
200/day
on Northwest Pipeline scheduled for June 2003.

From Gas Daily:

TransCanada Cuts Back Expansion Plan

Gas Daily reports (June 5, 2001) that TransCanada Pipeline will cut back
its planned expansions in BC and Alberta from over 200 mmcfd to about 130
mmcfd.  Scheduled to be in service in 2002, the expansion will increase the
delivery capacity from the Nova Gas Transmission system to ANG at the
Alberta-BC border and from ANG to PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest at the
BC-Idaho border.
