Vince,
 
I  wanted to follow up with you concerning our earlier exchange regarding my  brother Vikas Saksena. Have you had a chance to speak to your IT folks? I will  be meeting with Vikas in London by the end of this month and will get a chance  to talk to him in more detail. May I ask him to call you directly. For your  reference his phone number in London is 44 208 343 3298.
 
Thanks
 
Anurag
