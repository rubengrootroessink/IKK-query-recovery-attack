Today's focus: Intrusion detection systems


By Neal Weinberg

Intrusion detection systems are key components to any security
system. So the Reviewmeister decided to check out network-based
IDS products from Cisco, Computer Associates, Enterasys
Networks, Intrusion.com and Internet Security Systems (ISS).

The intrusion detection systems (IDS) products from Cisco,
Enterasys and Intrusion.com are appliances, while CA and ISS
offer software-based systems.

We conducted several tests to measure performance. First, we
measured how well the product could detect a random sample of
commonly recognized intrusion attacks, such as ping floods,
Jolt2 attacks, SYN floods, finger bombs and others. These were
tested initially under no background traffic load. To achieve a
passing score, the IDS had to correctly identify the attack
within five minutes of the attack's launch. We tallied whether
the intrusion was recorded, if it was correctly identified and
the approximate time it took to recognize the attack.

Next, we ran stress tests to see how the products would work as
background traffic load increased from 40M to 60M bit/sec, then
up to 90M bit/sec. A third test determined whether the products
could detect attacks specifically designed to avoid traditional
IDS systems.

Enterasys' IDS Dragon took the gold in performance. In addition
to its excellent showing in the first two tests, Dragon also
beat the competition by detecting attacks that are specifically
designed to avoid traditional IDS systems. IDS Dragon also
performed with near bulletproof reliability, demonstrating
minimal performance degradation under traffic load and solid
system stability during all of the tests.

The IDS Dragon missed only three out of 27 random attacks and
detected 24 out of the resulting 24 attacks sent to it under
the 40M and 60M bit/sec traffic load. With the 90M bit/sec
traffic, IDS Dragon correctly detected 21 out of 24 attacks.

No other product performed as well with the basic intrusion-
detection and stress tests, although Cisco Secure IDS performed
well under load. The ISS RealSecure performed well under 40M
and 60M bit/sec loads, detecting 22 out of 24 attacks, but fell
down to 17 attacks out of 24 when the traffic load went to 90M
bit/sec.

Intrusion.com's SecureNet Pro had the hardest time under heavy
background traffic loads. After a strong start - detecting 24
out of 27 attacks with no load - performance steadily declined
as load increased. It detected only four out of 27 attacks
under the 90M bit/sec load. Curiously, SecureNet detected the
highest number of attacks (25) under no load, but supported the
smallest database of known attack signatures of the products
tested.

All the products tested did well in detecting certain attacks,
including Whisker (various types), Targa3 and Bind, which are
specifically designed to evade network-based IDS products.
Cisco, CA, Enterasys and Intrusion.com detected 16 out of 17
attacks, and ISS got them all.

While CA's eTrust IDS performed adequately in our stress tests,
it did not perform consistently under high (90M bit/sec) loads.
It appeared that the longer we let the background traffic
stream run (up to 10 minutes or more), the less consistently
eTrust detected the attacks.
