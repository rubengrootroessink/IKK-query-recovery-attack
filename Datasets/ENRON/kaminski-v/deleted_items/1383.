Today's focus: Test Pilot on the Compaq Aero 8000

By Neal Weinberg

This week's guest reviewer is Glenn Baker, who took the Compaq Aero
8000 handheld PC out for a spin.

Baker says, "I find the Aero 8000 a pretty good machine overall. Its
plug-and-play ability with a Proxim wireless PC card adapter was an
unexpected treat - it simply works."

On the other hand, he adds, "I find Compaq's apparent silence and
notable absence in the launch of the new Handheld PC 2000 a bit
troubling as to the future of the product. One of the most notable
features of H/PC 2000 over CE professional 3.0 is an IE4 compatible
browser. One can actually connect to secure and financial sites with
128-bit security and make use of HTML 4, DHTML, certificates and Java
script features.

"If the Aero 8000 had better graphic resolution, USB port(s) and
support for the next generation handheld CE OS (Handheld PC 2000), it
would be hard to beat," he continues. "But since Compaq is not even
listed on the Handheld PC 2000 Web site or in the press releases, I
believe Compaq is abandoning it for their Pocket PC line."

If you have opinions on the Compaq Aero or any other product, become
a Test Pilot.
