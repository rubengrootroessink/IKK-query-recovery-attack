Vince,

I thought I would just send you a personal note to say that I hope you are well. Being part Brazilian, I feel responsible to make sure that you enjoy the great country you're visiting. It is a shame that you will be spending time in Sao Paulo and not Rio, which is a far more beautiful city - I know since I grew up in Sao Paulo. I hope that your experiences of the past few days will not put you off paying further visits to this land.

When I arrived at work on Monday morning, Shirley asked me if I could call the Brazilian Consulate in Argentina, and she explained the predicament you were facing. I tried and tried to get through but all the numbers at the consulate were continuously busy. Eventually, we agreed that it might be best if handled from the Brazilian side of Enron. I understand from her that you have finally been able to get to Sao Paulo, so I hope that the business you went to discuss has gone successfully.

I imagine that by now you may have been introduced to a good Brazilian churrasco, tasted some real coffee, and perhaps sampled some of the many tropical fruits that Brazil boasts of (speaking from a culinary perspective). If you haven't yet been to any of the Brazilian restaurants here in Houston, I would be happy to introduce you to them when you return. I wish I could recommend good places to visit in Sao Paulo, but it is not really a city for tourists. If you had more time, I could suggest some art museums, a visit to the municipal theatre, or some relaxation in one of Sao Paulo's parks; a trip down to the coast would also be worthwhile.

Well, I wish you a safe return journey and look forward to seeing you back safe and sound. You were greatly missed yesterday morning at our Bosses Day Breakfast.

Regards,

Tom
