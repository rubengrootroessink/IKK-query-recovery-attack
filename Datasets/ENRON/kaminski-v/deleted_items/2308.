More with Less

Budgets are either stagnant or shrinking this year, and net
executives are being forced to do more with less money - and
often fewer people. We've compiled a series of Network World
articles, newsletters and columns you can use to make the most
of your budget and resources.

Today's focus: Improve Linux event log management

By Phil Hochmuth

Linux network administrators looking for an easier way to
identify and manage potential system problems should check out
a tool called Linux Event Logging for Enterprise-Class Systems.

This free piece of open source software aims to help enterprise
Linux users better manage their servers by filtering and
extracting only the most critical and useful information from
kernel and system logs.

Linux comes with its own tools for logging kernel and system
events - such as crashes, buffer overruns, or other application
errors - with the "printk/klog" and "syslog" commands. While
these tools are fine for Linux PCs or small single-process
servers, a mountainous build up of system messages can result
when used in larger, multiprocessor servers. These messages
could be scattered in different server directories and
important events are often buried within these files, without
indication of event severity, or priority over other system
events.

The Linux Event Logging tool can be used to consolidate system
events into a single log view, and filter and alert
administrators to pre-defined kernel or system events. The
software also provides more details on system events, such as
the time of events, and their severity (also a predefined by
the user). Administrators can use the tool to manage their
single event log, such as dictating the size of the log and
removing old log items.
