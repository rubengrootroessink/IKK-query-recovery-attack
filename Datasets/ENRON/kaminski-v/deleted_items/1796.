Today's focus: StoreAge gets on TV

By Anne Skamarock

Another type of storage virtualization was in the news last
week. StoreAge Networking Technologies announced the use of its
Storage Virtualization Manager product by Guangdong TV, the
official operator and broadcaster of the ninth Chinese Sports
Games.

So what makes this announcement so interesting? Guangdong TV,
with its partner Sobey Digital Technology, are responsible for
deploying a video broadcast and storage system that could take
multiple, real-time, video input streams and immediately make
the video data available to multiple sites for editing.

StoreAge's Storage Virtualization Manager (SVM) is implemented
in, what the vendor calls, an asynchronous manner. That is, SVM
sits in an appliance on the storage-area network (SAN), but not
in the data path like many SAN virtualization products. SVM
uses the SAN to communicate configuration and mapping
information to the hosts' host bus adapters, where a thin
driver sits. Once the information is loaded, the host addresses
the storage directly, with no intervention. This approach
provides high-performance data access.

For the Chinese Sports Games, the storage was configured to its
highest performance capability. Then, the storage was
aggregated into a virtual pool by SVM and the data was striped
across the multiple redundant array of independent disks
subsystems. This configuration provided the highest possible
performance to keep up with the real-time operations support
for more than 90 clustered servers accessing over 11T-bytes of
storage.

Along with this StoreAge announcement, Raidtec announced its
SNAZ SAN Virtualization Appliance (SVA). Looking at this
announcement, it is not difficult to realize that the SNAZ SVA
is "powered by" StoreAge technology.
