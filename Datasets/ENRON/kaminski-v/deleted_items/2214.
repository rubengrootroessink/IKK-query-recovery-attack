NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN EU GAS AND POWER RETAIL MARKETS

As the European Union energy directives take hold, the new opportunities in gas
and power retail markets transcend geographic borders. Energy companies are
seeking to leverage into new markets their knowledge of trading and selling
wholesale energy or retailing products, where they either have or can acquire
an energy supply asset base or customer base, develop strong retail marketing
skills, and expand product slates.

* Incumbents will need to compete fiercely for initial retail market
opportunities, using information technology to reach a much wider cross-section
of energy customers.

* Winning strategies are successfully integrating retail, customer, marketing,
and risk management expertise.

* Real obstacles persist-and the playing field will continue to change.
