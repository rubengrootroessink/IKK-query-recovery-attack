Mike:

Here are the Market Data applications, subscriptions and publications that have been identified to go with Netco.  Please add any additional systems you will need.  If you have the vendor contact or contract information please add it to the list.  

These systems have been requested by the Gas, and Power group if you know of any other departments that may have additional needs please let me know.


Thank you,

Danielle Marcinkowski
