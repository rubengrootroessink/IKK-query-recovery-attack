Attached is the notice issued by FERC which acknowledges the  Alliance of Energy Suppliers' filing requesting FERC to stay the effects of the  Section 206 proceeding on market power and delay applying certain aspects  of FERC's new Supply Margin Assessment (SMA) screen to test for market  power. This is a major victory for the Generator and Power Marketing  community...
 
In addition, FERC announces an upcoming technical conference  to allow industry to weigh in on the discussion and provide FERC with an  operation's perspective and illustrate possible ramifications of such extreme  measures as the ones FERC proposed in its November 20 order. 
 
Also of note, FERC directed transmission providers, who  perform studies pursuant to a request for interconnection, to treat unaffiliated  entities, at their request, as competing network resources in meeting load and  load growth and to post optimum areas (from a transmission perspective) on their  systems for locating prospective generation.
