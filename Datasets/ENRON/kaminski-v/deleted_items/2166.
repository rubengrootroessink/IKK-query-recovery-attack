today, but with very little change in sensible weather. The only significan=

in the Western U.S. It clearly has not happened though I mentioned that a z=
onal flow would also accomplish the forecasted warm up. This milder air sho=
uld stay in place into the middle of next week. The Western Atlantic ridge =
has also strengthened in recent days which should force Gulf and East coast=
 temperatures to go above normal by ea! rly next week after a couple of mor=
e coolish days. There are no named storms in the tropics at this time. A co=
uple of flare-ups in the Caribbean bear watching, but likely would not deve=
lop until Monday at the earliest, if then.  Tomorrow: Saturday, October 20,=

e should become much more interesting and bullish. All of the models foreca=
st a strong dip of the polar jet to occur into the Plains late next week. T=
here are some discrepancies in the intensity and how fast it moves East. Ho=
wever, given some very strong winds in the Pacific and some very cold air n=
ow over the Arctic, I expect this to be significant. Persistence also shoul=
d pay off in this forecast. These troughs have not had any problem digging =
into the Eastern U.S. since Labor Day while troughs into the West have been=
 non-existence. This could be giving us clues on how the winter will go. Th=
e good news is that will aid in verifying my winter outlook, the bad news i=
s it could result in a long season in the East. Specifics can wait until ne=
xt week as the event gets closer. A couple! of highlights though would like=
ly be accumulating snows in the Northern U.S. and double digit below normal=
 temperatures invading the Plains and spreading East. As is usually the cas=
e, a strong trough in the East results in significant ridging(with warmer, =
drier air) in the Western U.S.  Day 6: Wednesday, October 24, 2001   Syncra=
