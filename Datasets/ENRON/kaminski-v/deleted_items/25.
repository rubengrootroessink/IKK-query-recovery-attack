 Have you developed plans?  I'd be interested in your evaluation of Lakima
Group, whom I believe you've worked with.  How big are they?

   Hi Vince -
   Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under
   the
   circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning
to
   an
   advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode,
   rather
   than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo
   Alto
   office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to extend
an
   invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if
our
   interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?


   Bill Balson
   Vice President
   Charles River Associates
   285 Hamilton Avenue
   Palo Alto, CA 94301
