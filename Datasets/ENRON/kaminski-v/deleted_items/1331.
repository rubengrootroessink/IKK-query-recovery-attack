I shall ask my assistant to forward you my itinerary.

   A couple of months ago you agreed to serve on a panel on real options
   that Rita McGrath at Columbia had assembled.
   We have been informed that you have not registered for the conference -
   in SFO October 21 to 24
   Can you please register - they are getting antsy about it.  Go to
   sms@mgmt.purdue.edu
   When are you due at Wharton again?
