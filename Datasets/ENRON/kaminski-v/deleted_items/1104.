Dear V

We are delighted to announce the redesign of the website for Reactions, the leading insurance/reinsurance and risk transfer magazine. The Reactions website now sits on a technology and security platform shared with other titles published by Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC - the world's leading financial publishing group.

You will find the new site more user friendly. Our peoplemoves section will keep you up to date with all the latest changes in senior executives in the market. We will be adding more free sections giving you essential market intelligence soon -  make sure you log on today.

NEW:
REACTIONS CONFIDENTIAL is a new area of the site where you will find:
- The four most recent editions of Reactions magazine
- Each new edition of Reactions available on the website two weeks before the print edition is mailed.

Subscribers to Reactions magazine pay only a small upgrade fee for activating access to Reactions Confidential.
