>>All,
>>
>>FYI- On Wednesday an unknown male suspect entered the building around 4:40 pm
>>posing as a carpet cleaner. The suspect fits the description, and uses the
>>same mode of operation of a suspect that I informed you about previously.
>>Sgt. Reiter will be handling the case. Sgt. Reiter can be reached at the
>>station between 2pm and 10pm Mon-Fri, or email: reiter@rice.edu, if you have
>>any information that may be of help to the case.
>>
>>The suspect was a male/black approximately 5'5" tall, in his mid 30's,
>>wearing a brown v-neck sweater and black pants. The suspect also wears
>>glasses.
>>
>>I also want to take a moment to remind everyone that in the event that you
>>spot a suspicious person or a suspect that you postively identify, please do
>>not confront them. Maintain a discreet visual on the person and get a good
>>look at his/her race, gender, and clothing. Immediately call the police and
>>stay on the line with the police dispatcher. Should the suspect move his/her
>>location in the building you will be able to relay that information to the
>>dispatcher who will relay it to responding officers.
>>
>>Thanks again for all your continuing support of our collective effort. Let's
>>all be safe in these types of situations.
>>
