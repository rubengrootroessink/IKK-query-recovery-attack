TURKEY ABOLISHES THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO IMPORT NATURAL GAS

The gas bill's passage into Turkish law in May has far-reaching consequences
for international power developers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers into
Turkey, and incumbent players. CERA identifies two critical consequences
emerging from the new legislation:

*  Power developers may be able to renegotiate their gas supply agreements.

*  More opportunities for LNG suppliers will emerge.
