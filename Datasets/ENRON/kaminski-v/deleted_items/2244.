MEXICO'S PROPOSED NATURAL GAS REGULATION: PROMOTING CROSS-BORDER TRADING

The Energy Regulatory Commission of Mexico (CRE) recently published a document
that describes possible measures and concrete proposals to update the
regulatory framework of Mexico's natural gas industry. Two key proposals are
the inclusion of US pipeline transportation costs for imported gas in the
domestic pricing formula and changing the current benchmark index use to
calculate the price of Mexico's domestic gas to the Houston Ship Channel (HSC).
The potential benefits to be derived from these changes include

*  increased interest in the construction of cross-border pipelines and a
physical bypass of the Pemex pipeline system

*  increased trading liquidity and price transparency at the trading point
index to be used in creating Mexico's natural gas sales price
