Today's focus: IP videoconferencing services, Part 1

By Neal Weinberg

The Reviewmeister is interested in videoconferencing, but I'd
rather go with a service provider than deal with the hassle of
setting up a full-blown videoconferencing network. So we tested
six IP videoconferencing service providers. Four were Internet-
based and did not offer quality of service; the other two used
private networks, rather than the public Internet, and offered
guaranteed QoS.

In this newsletter, we'll focus on the Internet-based services;
next time, we'll talk about the guaranteed QoS type services.

The four Internet-based services we looked at were: Reality
Fusion's SeeSaw, FVC's CUseeMe World, Eyeball Networks'
Communicator and FocusFocus' Conference.

Reality Fusion's SeeSaw came out on top in our testing. It met
our expectations in terms of features, and had good-quality
video and audio. We also found that Reality Fusion's service
management portal gives network executives significant control
over enterprise network traffic and the use of resources.

All of the Internet-based services charge on a pay-as-you-go,
no-contract basis, except for FVC's CUseeMe World, which is
free. So if you're dissatisfied with these services, you can
easily go elsewhere.

With Internet-based services, the provisioning issues are borne
entirely by the customer. Each end user must obtain the client
application and perform routine installations. We installed
client applications on multiple operating systems, and found
that with one exception (FocusFocus' client doesn't support
Windows XP), the vendors are prepared to support the range of
desktop environments found in enterprise networks.

We also were pleasantly surprised at how well each application
(FocusFocus was the exception again) used built-in Windows
drivers to discover and configure the camera, speakers and
microphone to maximize video quality and minimize echo.

The Eyeball Communicator client application is only 3M bytes in
size, while the CUseeMe Pro and SeeSaw clients are about the
same footprint, in the 5M- to 6M-byte range. The FocusFocus
client application came in at a lean 300K bytes.

During point-to-point and multipoint calls, we found that
quality varied. Regardless of the bandwidth available at the
last mile, the sessions began with an active chat session
during which we needed to adjust audio or reposition our Web
camera to produce the best effects.

Some notes on each system:

* We did not like the graphic design of the FocusFocus client
  application because it was too crowded and lacked graphic
  "treatments."

* CUseeMe Pro was more like a "light" application, in contrast
  with previous software clients published by the company.

* Eyeball's client was intuitive to use and elegant in the way
  that multiple windows could be detached from the communications
  application interface and then reattached.

* SeeSaw's user interface is a stylish black navigation window
  with controls on the right and status indicators and a meeting
  participant list on the left of the screen. We liked the use of
  icons to show the moderator and speaker roles, as well as the
  audio and video quality produced by the codec in the
  application.

* With the exception of FocusFocus, which did not offer a
  satisfactory multipoint usage scenario, the remaining service
  providers could support meetings of four to five users
  comfortably, and could support larger meetings as needed. In
  the case of SeeSaw, Reality Fusion says it can support up to
  150 participants in a single meeting, although only six can be
  seen on the screen at the same time.
