Vince,

Unfortunately, Mary Jo and I have class at Rice on Mondays and Wedbnesdays at 6

But to update you on the Research modeling front, Adam hits the ground running on the 25th, and I'm confident that we'll have a model up and running in record time.

On the GRIB extraction front, the stuff we're getting from WSI has already moved us up 2 hours from previous ensemble availability - they've basically already done what I had hoped Christian could do for us.

- Mike

We have not spoken for a while.
