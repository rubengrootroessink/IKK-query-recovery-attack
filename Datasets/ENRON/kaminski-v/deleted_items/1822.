		What's New at ERisk.com - 23 November 2001	


		
Weekly Review	In  this week's round-up   of economic, banking and P?insurance news from an enterprise risk management  perspective: stock markets mixed, but oil markets rise on production pact;  hopes of a new approach to Japanese bad loans; German consumer confidence  falls sharply; reputational risks trip up US banks; P?insurance rates  keep on rising, but fears mount over terror coverage exclusions. 	
Analysis 	 US  energy giant Enron's problems continue to mount, while hearings on the  failure of Australian insurer HIH are about to begin. How is it that companies  entrusted with managing risk for others can fail so spectacularly to manage  their own risks? In this week's  analysis , Rob Jameson looks at some of the factors that make such  firms vulnerable to unpleasant surprises. 	
Viewpoint	By  the first quarter of next year, companies and investors should be able to  hedge or speculate directly on consumer confidence, GDP and other economic  factors. In our latest Q? ,  ERisk talks to Deutsche Bank's head of foreign exchange options, Kevin Rodgers,  about the new financial instruments that will allow positions to be taken  on such economic statistics.
