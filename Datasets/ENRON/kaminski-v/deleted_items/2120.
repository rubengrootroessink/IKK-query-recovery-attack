I am going to have to leave (11:30 AM)  My heater at home is not working and I have
a service man coming between 1:00 - 3:00 pm.  It is supposed to get down in the '40s
tonight.  Teresa is going to sit at my desk and Anita is here.  I am going to leave my
email open if you need to send something, plus I will have my blackberry.
