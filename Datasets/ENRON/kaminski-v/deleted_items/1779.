Immediate & Strong BUY Recommendation

Huge Analyst and Newsletter Coverage for DPRI

DPRI will be profiled by some major analysts and
newsletters along with the release of significant
news regarding explosive sales for the Company.
There will be huge volume and a strong increase in
price for several days. The same groups that featured
CPTH will begin coverage on DPRI. CPTH exploded from
$ .55 to $3.05! We know for certain that the same
groups are going to feature DPRI and even better
returns are expected.

DPRI, a 10-year old fully-reporting company, is a
leading provider of independent product investigations,
air contamination, and fire investigations for the
Insurance Industry.  The demand for the Company's
services has exploded due to present US conditions,
with DPRI servicing over 50 major Insurance carriers.
This has led to significant Revenue for the Company.

We are very proud that we can share this information
with you so that you can make a profit out of it. It
is highly advisable to take a position in DPRI as soon
as possible, today before the market closes or tomorrow.

The stock could easily reach $4.00 in less than a month
on the strength of their upcoming contract announcements
and Strong Analyst Buy Recomendations.

When word gets out this stock will SOAR!
