Title: Microturbine Generator Test Program Report: Spring 2001 Update
URL(s):
http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2470

***********************************************************************

MICROTURBINES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE

Extensive testing has shown that microturbine generator performance continues
to improve as products mature. Southern California Edison's testing program has
continued to generate useful information despite the company's financial
problems.

*  The two Capstone units continue to operate reliably and perform well.

*  Honeywell's Parallon 75 unit is performing acceptably so far but has fallen
slightly short of the manufacturer's claims.

*  Practical issues such as the need for adequate gas supply pressure; a lack
of streamlined, standardized interconnection requirements; and emissions
restrictions will play an important role in microturbine technology's future
role in the marketplace.
