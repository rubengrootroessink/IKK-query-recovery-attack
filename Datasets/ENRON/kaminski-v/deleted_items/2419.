Sorry that I missed your message....  I took off Friday at about 4:30 in order to do volunteer work in the name of Mother Enron.  I will, however, be available for drinks at any time!

I understand that this will be a turbulent and interesting week.  It may be a nice contrast to the programming that I will be buried in.    Paula tells me that you were stuck in Argentina last week - one of my old stomping grounds.  I have read that the economy there has crashed - quite a change from when it was my second home from 1991 to 1994.  Even then their prosperity appeared to me to be a facade but I hear that that has fallen away.  You'll have to tell me what it was like.

I had a nice visit with Kristin Walsh yesterday primarily to inform her how much her workplace has changed during her six weeks maternity leave.  She looked a bit shell-shocked.  She returns today.  There is another candidate for drinks!

Let me know when you need to converse on all things non-Enron.  I possess a wealth of such knowledge.
