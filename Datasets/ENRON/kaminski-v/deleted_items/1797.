Dear PMA Subscriber-- We're pleased to present a recent issue of The Risk Desk.   To see this sample, download:http://www.pmaconference.com/0111Risk.pdf
This monthly on energy trading risk management is by far the most readable, and altogether useful publication on this critical subject. 
Through a special arrangement with the publisher, you can subscribe to one-year of the Risk Desk for the one-time low rate of $299. 
This is the last time you will see this rate in 2001! Corporate-wide site licenses are also available for $2,500.
