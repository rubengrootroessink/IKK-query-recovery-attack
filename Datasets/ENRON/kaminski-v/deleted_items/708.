Hello,
 
This is a reminder for the upcoming North American Regional  Gas model user meeting to be held in Sacramento, California, on January 17  and 18.  Attached is a draft agenda for your perusal.  We have also  attached a list of hotels close to the meeting facilities, that may be of some  help to you.
 
We currently have about 35 participants signed up to attend  the meeting.  It is not too late to RSVP for the NARG meeting; if you are  interested in attending, please contact us as soon as possible to help us plan  the meeting.
 
We still have a few open slots for presentations; if you would  like to make a presentation, please let us know, so we can include you on the  agenda. 
 
If you are already signed up to make a presentation, we would  appreciate it if you could send us a copy of the presentation, so we can have  copies available for the attendees.  If not, please have  approximately 40 copies of your presentation at the meeting.
 
Please feel free to contact us, if you have any suggestions or  questions.
 
Thank You.
Pamela Yoo
