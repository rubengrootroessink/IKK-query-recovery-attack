The Alliance of Energy Suppliers will conduct  a conference call tomorrow, Friday, January 25 at 3:00PM EST to  identify issues for purposes of filing comments on the Interconnection  ANOPR and the collaborative interconnection agreement and procedures documents  at FERC on February 1, 2002. Our earlier conference calls updated you on the  process of the drafting of the interconnection agreement and procedures  documents. But as stated earlier, we recognize that not all parties fully  support all aspects of the final documents, therefore we look for  you to provide us input on the outstanding issues  and those inclusions in the final documents and the ANOPR that you do not fully  support. The Alliance has also identified several issues we believe could be  used as a basis for comments. Below is a list of these issues.
 
Again, the final comments on the ANOPR and the  Interconnection collaborative process are due to be filed  at FERC on February 1, 2002. We strongly encourage your  company to participate on the call and file in support of those inclusions  in the collaborative document that benefit the generator community, e.g.,  designation as network resource, strict time lines for TOs to comply with with  regards to studies, etc. We want to stress to FERC the "best practices" from a  generator perspective. Please reply back to this e-mail if you or  someone from your company plans to particpate on the call.  
 
In addition, Phase II of the Interconnection ANOPR process on  "Cost Allocation and Pricing" will begin in March. This issue will be highly  contentious and will require a strong generator showing. We believe it  prudent to insert a generator perspective on the cost allocation issues in this  pleading to FERC on February 1. 
 
The call in number is (800)  860-2442
