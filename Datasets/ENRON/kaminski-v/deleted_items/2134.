Dear Speakers:

In preparation for the upcoming, above-mentioned conference; I am in the
process of compiling the conference course book material before it is sent
off to the printer.
At your earliest convenience, please email me a copy of the following:

Short one page biography
Written presentation for the course book
Audio visual equipment needs -- our on-site representatives do bring an LCD
projector to the conference.  All you need to do, is bring your respective
presentations loaded on your lap-tops and we'll run the presentations from
there.

We are running against an impending printing deadline.  The books must go
off to the printers by the end of this coming Monday -- October 15, 2001.
Please forward your materials at your earliest convenience.

Thank you very much for your kind understanding.  I do look forward to
receiving your materials.

Sincerely,

Luke Eleftheriou
Event Coordinator
