Dear Wincenty Kaminski:

Optical networking technology is radically changing the foundation of
carrier backbones, boosting Internet bandwidth exponentially while
slashing costs dramatically.

Network World Fusion's Optical Networking newsletter focuses on the
technologies that carriers need to bring together in order to provide
platforms for rolling out next-generation services, ranging from
outsourcing business and electronic-commerce applications to programmable
TV. The editors at Lightreading.com, including founder Stephen Saunders,
produce the Optical Networking newsletter twice-a-week exclusively for
Network World Fusion, for the benefit of readers at legacy carriers, new
alternative local carriers, Internet Service Providers and application
service providers.
