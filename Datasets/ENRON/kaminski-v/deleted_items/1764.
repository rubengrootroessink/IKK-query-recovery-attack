Today's focus: Test Pilot on Netobjects Fusion MX

By Neal Weinberg

Our ace Test Pilot BadBoo is at it again. Here's his evaluation
of Netobjects Fusion MX by Netobjects.

He says he has been using Netobjects Fusion 4 for a couple of
years to design several Web sites, but wanted something that
would allow him to easily customize his sites and make them
look different.

Positive comments:

* He is pleased with the support of the Netobjects community,
and the API that allows third-party vendors such as Coolmaps,
Bimotion and others to write add-on components that essentially
double the capability of the base program.

*  The ease of conquering the learning curve merely by
following the accompanying tutorial or downloading tutorials
online from the company site or various support sites, such as
http://www.gotfusion.com

* Extraordinary control of object placement.

* Component availability.

* Price ($49 for upgrade, $99 for full version).

Shortcomings:

* The 'import doc' file (a Word Document) failed while
following the manual, and was confirmed by one of the support
team.

* There is no easy way to import an existing Web site off the
Internet. You can't select  'import existing Web site' and make
it immediately useable.

One final comment: "I think you'll find MX is the most cost-
effective, rapid Web development tool available," he says.

conditions. User submissions are reviewed by a Network World
editor and then posted on Fusion, where other users can read
and comment on them. To read reviews from your peers, write
