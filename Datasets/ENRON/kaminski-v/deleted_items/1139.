Dear Energy Supply/Power Marketing Executive:
The following information includes:

The Supreme Court brief EEI filed May 31 responding to the two appeals that the court accepted, one filed by the New York Public Service Commission, 8 other state commissions and NARUC and the other by Enron.  (attached pdf file)
Background on the litigation and a summary of the main points of the brief.
Listing of recent filings at FERC
5/29/2001 issue of FERC Orders - analyses of significant FERC orders. (attached pdf file)

****EEI's Supreme Court Brief - Background****
The states claim that FERC exceeded its jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act when it held in Order No. 888 that it has jurisdiction  over transmission when it is unbundled from a retail sale of energy, as in states that have adopted retail competition.

Enron, on the other hand, argues that FERC incorrectly concluded in Order No. 888 that it lacks jurisdiction over transmission that is sold as part of a bundled retail sale of electricity, as in states that have not adopted competition and still maintain the traditional service to bundled native load customers.

EEI's brief supports the position taken by FERC in Order No. 888 that when transmission is unbundled from the retail sale, FERC has jurisdiction of the interstate transmission aspect, but that where states maintain the traditional scheme of regulation involving bundled retail sales, the states retain jurdicition over the bundled retail sale.

The main points in EEI's brief are:

The result in Order No. 888 is consistent with all of the language in the jurisdictional provisions of the FPA and with the legislative history of the Act.  While recognizing FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission, it comports with the statutory language by retaining state jurisdiction over "any other sale of electric energy" and maintains that which was subject to state regulation when the FPA was passed in 1935 --- that is bundled retail sales.

EEI's brief highlights the changes in the industry and the changing uses of the interstate grid.  Order No. 888 also recognizes and accommodates these changes.  We dispute the claim made by both the states and Enron that "unbundling" is just an accounting change that does not change jurisdiction.  The states argue that they always had jurisdiction over transmission when bundled and that unbundling cannot change that.  Enron argues that since FERC has jurisdiction over interstate transmission, the "accounting" issue of whether it is bundled or unbundled cannot eliminate FERC jurisdiction.  Instead, we explain that unbundling at the retail level is a necessary step to implement the fundamental policy made by states when they adopt retail competition.

Responding to the states, we argued that when states make the policy choice to adopt retail competition, unbundling of transmission from energy is necessary to implement that policy.  In order to allow access to transmission by competitive suppliers, FERC jurisdiction over transmission is appropriate.  It is also consistent with the FPA proviso that states have jurisdiction over the retail sales of energy.  The sale of transmission service separately is not a sale of energy,

Responding to Enron, our brief argues that to adopt Enron's argument that FERC should regulate all transmission, even that in a bundled retail sale, ignores six decades of history and judicial interpretation leaving to the states jurisdiction over any transmission sold as part of the retail electricity sale.  Congress has amended the FPA on several occsadions, but has not altered the allocation of federal/state responsibility.
