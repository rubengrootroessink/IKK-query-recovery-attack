xt trough set to enter the Western U.S.  There is currently a long and stro=
ng fetch of NW winds driving cold air through the Plains and then South and=
 East. Some Lake effect snows are occurring with this as well though much o=
f the Great Lakes moisture is a cold rain. Sprawling high pressure covers a=
lmost the rest of the country and the trend in temperature is about to beco=
me one of moderation. The surface high in the Plains will shift to the East=
 coast by early next week and the NW winds now will shift to the SW allowin=
g the warm up to commence. It will start in the Plains this weekend and go =
East of the Mississippi by Monday. My five day temperature departures are s=
till largely below normal, but they s! hould be used with caution in a see-=
saw pattern such as this. After all some areas(especially in the Plains) ma=
y start out 15-20 below normal today and go 10-15 above normal by Day 5(Tue=
sday). By the end of the period, the Eastern trough will be out to sea, a n=
ew trough will invade the West and Pacific style air will rule coast to coa=
st. That air can be damp along the West coast, but as it sinks over the mou=
ntains it quickly warms up and dries out. This pattern is allowing the wet =
season to get started in the PNW. It appears each successive Pacific storm =
is getting a little stronger and forming further South. If the trend contin=
ues, we could start seeing moisture getting into Northern California next w=

  I continue to see good agreement with the models in the 6-10 day period. =
The country should remain bathed in Pacific air well into the first week of=
 November and I believe even beyond. Troughs continue to move into the West=
 and then in a progressive pattern stay fairly weak in their move East. Wit=
hout any blocking in Canada, it is hard for me to see much likelihood for a=
ny arctic air to get entrained. My confidence remains high in a largely abo=
ve normal temperature forecast. It is a little less optimistic in terms of =
precipitation. I question how much Gulf of Mexico moisture can be worked ba=
ck to the North, but some models suggest the Plains could get wet next week=
. I have not discussed the tropics much this week because there has not bee=
n a storm to mention. There still isn't, but the overall pattern we are goi=
ng into ne! xt week can in a climatological sense sometimes crank something=
 up in the Caribbean and push it North towards Florida. My guess is there w=
ill not be a named storm as such, but some potential for heavy rain.  Day 6=
