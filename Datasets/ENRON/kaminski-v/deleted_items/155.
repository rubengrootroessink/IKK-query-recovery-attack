Today's focus: IP videoconferencing services, Part 2

By Neal Weinberg

Last time, we looked at four Internet-based IP
videoconferencing services. This time, we'll finish up by
looking at two entrants that offer guaranteed quality of
service: InView IP and WireOne Technology's Glowpoint.

Results varied with the ordering and provisioning of our
circuits between WireOne and InView. After each local exchange
provider brought in a line, WireOne promptly shipped a
preconfigured Netopia router (Model R5300) to each office with
a small page that included all of the IP addresses, subnet
masks and gateway addresses. We installed the router and set up
the videoconferencing endpoints and PCs in minutes.

For InView, we had to complete an IP address justification
form, and once the circuit was ready, we needed a separate
phone line for the carrier's access to a 33.6K bit/sec modem.
Using the modem, remote technicians configured a DSU/CSU once
the components were delivered on site. After the IP addresses
were assigned, it took nearly two days at one location to
troubleshoot the deployment before it correctly mapped in the
wide-area service provider's network.

A disappointment with WireOne's Glowpoint service was the lack
of support for data collaboration. Because of strict filtering
of all traffic on the service, users cannot establish T.120
sessions in parallel with the H.323 session. On the InView
service, there were no traffic restrictions, permitting
establishment of a parallel NetMeeting or Web conferencing
session.

For the guaranteed network services, a gateway can be
introduced when a participant is using ISDN. (H.320-based
devices use ISDN; H.323 is the IP-based videoconferencing
standard.) We liked that WireOne offered a clear gateway
dialing manual. We could initiate calls from the IP network
through the gateway at the data rate of our choice (using a
dialing prefix) to ISDN videoconferencing systems in our
respective locations.

In the end, we decided that we liked WireOne's Glowpoint the
best. Other companies will find it difficult to match the
reliability, efficiency and feature set that WireOne has
developed.
