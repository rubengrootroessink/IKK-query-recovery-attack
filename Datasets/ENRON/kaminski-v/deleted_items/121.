Today's focus: Protect your NetWare

By Dave Kearns

I've been telling you for some time how good NetWare 6 is. Most
major technical publications have also been telling you how
good NetWare 6 is. Even the occasional story in the mass media
has generally spoken well about NetWare (when the writer has a
vague understanding of networking technologies). What's been
lacking, though, is recognition by third party vendors and
other so-called "after market" suppliers that NetWare 6 is an
important player in enterprise networks.

I was surprised to see, for example, that almost six months
after the release of NetWare 6 there are still no books in
print about the operating system - not even from Novell Press!

That's why it's so gratifying to see a new release of a
software package intended specifically for the NetWare 6
platform. Network Associates' McAfee division has just released
a new version of its flagship NetShield product for the new
NetWare operating system.

NetShield 4.6 for NetWare 6 allows you to protect all of your
NetWare servers from malicious attacks and viruses through a
single console installation. Moreover, NetShield 4.6 includes
integration with McAfee's ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO), which
provides reporting and trend analysis, as well as remote
software deployment.

Also new in this release is support for Novell Cluster
Services. That's important since each box of NetWare 6 includes
a license for a two-server cluster. You can view, select and
scan mounted cluster volumes with NetShield 4.6, which also
provides "survival support" whenever a cluster server is off-
line. McAfee's ePO works in conjunction with NetShield to
extend the technologies used for antivirus protection to more
generalized network management, including policy management and
software deployment.

NetShield 4.6 will run on NetWare 4.11 or higher - although
NetWare 6 specific functions, such as clustering support, won't
be available with earlier versions of the Novell operating
system.

McAfee products have always been at the forefront of virus
protection and at the forefront of NetWare-based applications
for many years. Now McAfee is at the forefront of NetWare 6-
specific applications. McAfee deserves your support and you
should, at least, take a look at its offering.

more about SecureLogin," the URL to Novell's Web Seminar
Conference Center should have been
