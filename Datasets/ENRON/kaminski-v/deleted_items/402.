	[IMAGE]The first Energy Venture Fair was held in Boston in June 2001, with over 325 private equity investors and executives of leading energy companies represented. The event was met with such positive response that a second session was compelled by one and all. The event is being held in Houston, the energy capital of the world, and we have expanded our coverage to include exciting new ventures in the oil and natural gas space, as well as in electricity.
