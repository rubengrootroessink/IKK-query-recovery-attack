Just FYI to keep you updated on the "advanced" hiring techniques of the London office.

We will continue supporting Tony's efforts from Houston, but whenever the opportunity arises to hire, I hope we can jump on it.

Absolutely - you would need to approach Michael Brown again to get the position reapproved.

Kate Hollis will be able to advise you about this if the situaton with recruitment changes.

Tony,

let us wait for a while with our hiring procedures until we get confirmation from one or another desk that they are prepared to pay for such a person.

Hi Anna,

I have talked with Slava in research regarding the above.  Whilst there is currently a hiring freeze, we both feel that it is imperative to push ahead with advertising and interviewing of potential candidates for this position in the understanding that, with time, the hiring freeze will eventually be lifted.

Hence, could we meet at some point next week to discuss the way forward in recruiting for this position.

Many thanks,

Tony Hamilton
