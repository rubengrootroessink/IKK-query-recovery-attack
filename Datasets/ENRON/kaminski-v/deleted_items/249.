Has anyone ever heard of a company sending out a RFP to a recruiter? No, of
course not. On the trade floor, a Request For Physical is a common
occurrence. If they did send out this request to a recruiter it would read,
"Request For People." Wouldn't it be great if all the energy companies in
the world asked me to find their candidates. Well guess what they don't.

The Austin Group Energy establishes long term relationships with both
clients and candidates on a continual basis. We have candidates and
opportunities that aren't being distributed through conventional methods. We
completed over 600 successful seraches last year alone. In today's ever
changing market,can you afford not to know the largest recruiting firm in
the energy industry?

Attached below are positions that are available immediately for the right
candidate.
