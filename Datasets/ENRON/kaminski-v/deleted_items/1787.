"How Feminism Has Changed Everything and Nothing"

University of Southern California law professor Susan Estrich has paved the
way for countless women to attain positions of leadership.  She was the
first woman to serve as president of the Harvard Law Review, and in 1988 she
became the first woman to head a national presidential campaign, for the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.  Estrich has worked on many political campaigns,
including the Kennedy for President Campaign in 1980 and as senior policy
advisor for Mondale-Ferraro campaign in 1984.

Estrich is an established author and contributing editor of the Los Angeles
Times.  Her nationally syndicated column appears weekly in such publications
as the Washington Post, the Boston Herald, the Houston Chronicle.  Her body
of work consists of Getting Away with Murder: How Politics is Destroying the
Criminal Justice System, Making a Case for Yourself: A Diet Book for Smart
Women, Real Rape, and the recently released Sex & Power, which earned a
listing on the Los Angeles Times bestseller list in March.

A renowned orator, Estrich was one of three plenary speakers at the Law
School Admission Council's annual meeting and education conference, where
she discussed women and the legal profession.  She also spoke at the Dallas
Women's Museum, the 92nd Street YMCA in New York City, and at a conference
on economic development in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
