Do we need a more specific letter addressing EXOTICA/Structuring Models than just a blanket reference to the Enron/UBS agreements? I have only briefly scanned the agreement, but it appears to obligate both parties to work toward a transition of all of the identifed software scheduled in the Licence Agreement. If this suffices, I'd assume you would need an executed copy of the final agreement before we formally start the transition. As before, I'm just making sure we are conforming to an approved process, if there is such one at this point.

Your thoughts?

Thx

Berney

Hello,

I talked to Jim Fallon and he told me not to release any software etc. to NETCO without a formal letter from him.

Please, make sure that we get this request ASAP, so that we can guarantee an orderly transition.
