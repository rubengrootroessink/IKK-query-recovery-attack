scussion:   Bismarck, North Dakota was warmer yesterday than Miami, Florida=
! Overall weather pattern still finds bitter cold arctic air lurking... in =
the NW territories.  Bismarck was 38 degrees above normal yesterday at 63 w=
hile Miami was about 12 degrees below normal at 61. Its all a product of th=
e jet stream pattern which has taken modified Canadian air deep into the So=
uth while allowing a downslope wind off the Rockies to really warm up the P=
lains. This warm air is heading East and will attack the Ohio Valley and Ea=
st Coast snow cover with a vengeance the next couple of days. I do see a re=
versal of temperatures gradually occurring in the South the rest of the wee=
k as the deep trough weakens. The current quiet pattern will become a littl=
e more active in the storm department later in the week. There is a benign =
loo! king system on the West Coast today which may redevelop over the Lower=
 Mississippi Valley this weekend. While I would not give this a "major stor=
m" designation, it could provide the East some snow late in the period. In =
addition, another moderate cold front in the Northern branch will end the u=
nseasonable warmth in the Plains this weekend, but I would hardly call it c=
old. The five day numbers will still grade out well above normal. The stagn=
ant pattern in the West looks to continue as high pressure remains anchored=
 over the Great Basin. Storms coming in off the Pacific have a small punch =
as they hit the coast, but rapidly weaken once inland. Overall, temperature=
s there look to remain a bit above normal.    Tomorrow: Thursday, January 1=

Forecast Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  My mid =
range forecast continues to disagree with many who are calling for much col=
der air to invade the Northern U.S. The NWS 6-10 and 8-14 day products seem=
 to be leading this charge with strong probabilities of below normal temper=
atures over much of the country especially in the 8-14 day time frame. I th=
ink a mistake is being made in equating a large area of below normal probab=
ilities with very cold air. Keep in mind that in a probability forecast one=
 degree below normal grades out the same as 30 degrees below normal. There =
are two distinct branches of the jet stream right now, but clearly the Paci=
fic branch is more dominant in the U.S. than the arctic branch. Repeated ef=
forts at reversing that have not yet materialized and I won't forecast that=
 occurrence without more evidence. I am not arguing against cooler tha! n c=
urrent weather or even the return to below normal temperatures in the North=
 next week. I just don't see the whole motherlode of arctic air coming down=
. This outlook will bust big time if I am wrong though if one looks at the =
extreme cold being predicted on the end panels (days 14-16) of the MRF in N=
W Canada. Those readings are as cold as anything I have ever seen. But, the=
y are at the end of the long range and in NW Canada. I think it has been pr=
oven several times already this winter it is very premature to bring that a=
ir down though if you hammer at it often enough it may eventually happen.  =
