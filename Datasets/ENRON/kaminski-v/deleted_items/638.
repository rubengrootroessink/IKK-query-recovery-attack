Hello everyone,

	I too am heading back to Boston to work at Harvard Management Company (it's a hedge fund responsible for managing the Harvard endowment). I'll be working on weather derivatives and supporting the rest of their commodities portfolio. Before you rush off to call your broker and short HMC, I have to tell you, DON'T BOTHER! (I already tried it.) It turns out HMC is not publicly traded. 

	A recent Harvard Business School paper blamed Enron's downfall on loss of core competency due to wacky digressions such as broadband, pulp, and, ahem, weather derivatives. Having thus helped to bring about the largest bankruptcy in US history, it is now time to wreak havoc elsewhere. Be afraid, be very afraid.  My e-mail at Harvard will almost certainly be hrgovcicj@hmc.harvard.edu . Please keep in touch -- when CD #3 finally gets mixed and printed and the HR tour bus roars into Houston again (Enron, Harvard, whatever -- they're just day jobs, after all) I'll need to have your updated contacts for the mailing list.

Wish me luck,


Joe
