Vince,
 
Our summer intern up here (Elena's friend Sarah) has consented to write for today's issue.  I will use Anguel's article as well.  
 
In addition, I have two pieces from Ken Parkhill.  I believe he sent you a copy.  I'd like to use those for the next two weeks if you think they are alright.
 
Best Regards,
 
Sam
