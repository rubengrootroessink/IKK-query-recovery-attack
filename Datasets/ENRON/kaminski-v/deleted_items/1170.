Dear WINCENTY KAMINSKI:

Follow the links below for some great features found on Network World
Fusion:

IS YOUR BUDGET BEING SQUEEZED?
Times are tight and companies are looking to save money wherever they
can. If you look to technology to help you tighten your bottom line,
check out our Technology Primers area on Fusion. The pages offer the
best resources from Network World and around the 'Net on a myriad of
topics, from IP Multicast and Gigabit Ethernet to ASPs and security.
This site can also be helpful when you're preparing an argument for a
new technology or service, say for a budget proposal, and you need
background info and resources. http://nww1.com/go/ad098.html

ARE YOU PREPARED FOR MIDYEAR REVIEWS?
It's midyear, which means it's review time for managers and employees.
If you're looking for advice on management or on your career, head over
to our Management Strategies and Careers newsletters. A recent Careers
newsletter gave advice on how to give performance appraisals
http://nww1.com/go/ad096.html while a Management Strategies newsletter
discussed the importance of another summertime annual rite: vacations
http://nww1.com/go/ad097.html

A SITE FOR SUPPORTING TELEWORKERS
Got end users dying to work from home? Don't know where to start; not
sure how to outfit them or support them? Check out our Net.Worker
minisite http://nww1.com/go/ad095.html which features everything
teleworking  from breaking news to research pages.

Make the most of these and other great features found only on Network
World Fusion!
