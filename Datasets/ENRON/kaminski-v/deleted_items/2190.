Hi Vince

The environment here in London is not too conducive to hiring at present (a bit of English understatement here).  In short John and Michael appear to want to completely kill Research and have quants on desks hired by business teams.  Expect emails from Slava with more context.

Slava,

This is a resume of Mike Curran. He was running his own
consulting/software company which was not very successful.
He is looking for a position.

I think that he is very person, talented though the resume has some red flags (as you will
see immediately).

He is located in London.

Vince

Hi Vince -

Following up on my voice mail, I've attached my resume.  Please let me know
if there is or might soon be an appropriate position at Enron.

Thanks,

Mike
