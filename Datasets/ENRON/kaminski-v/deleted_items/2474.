Hello Mike , Vince
fyi.........

The Asst's on the 32 nd floor really love the cake we have in our monthly
staff meetings , I can never really bring enough for them all.

I am going to order a cake for the Asst's on the 32nd floor , just for them,
from the Research Group /Weather Team.

I have enjoyed my experience working with all of them and I look forward
to working with them in the future...

I will pay for the cake  , I like for others to see the Research Group as
one of Enron's  finest.......


                             Thanks
                         Kevin Moore

p.s the cake will be delivered on Thursday...... 10.a.m.
