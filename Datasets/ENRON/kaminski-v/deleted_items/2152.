Hi Vince

Have you had chance to make any further progress on the Energy Risk book

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sam,

Thanks for your kind words. I am an old prof (or I used to be one in my
previous life)
so I should know how to teach.

I am working on an outline of a book on energy derivatives and I should
send you the
first draft next week..

Vince

   Dear Vince

   Many thanks for both the contact name for weather derivatives and the
   chapters and magazine extracts (unfortunately I am still waiting for the
   Risk book to arrive).  I really enjoyed reading them and think you have
   an
   excellent pedagogical writing style.  From what I have seen I would very
   much like to encourage you to put a book proposal together on Energy
   Risk
   Management.  Saying that, I would still be interested in discussing the
   idea of a book on credit derivatives  for the energy market...but
   perhaps
   this could follow!

   My reading of your chapter on Exotic Options is that it walked a good
   balance between serving the needs of the risk manager, whilst also
   providing some of the more technical material for the 'quants' in an
   appendix.  This sort of level would probably be appropriate for a new
   book
   on the topic.  I thought your 'Concluding Remarks: Practical
   Considerations' really interesting stuff and something that might work
   really well if it were embedded into the main body of the text?  The key
   to
   such a book is that it is written by an energy market expert who can
   bring
   a wealth of experience and insight into how to structure risk management
   products specifically for this market.

   The panel sections (a Risk book house style?) worked well, but one could
   structure to differentiate between case vignettes, 'hints and tips',
   definitions and so on.

   As I say, I would very much welcome the opportunity of receiving a book
   proposal from you.  This could be based around the structure of your
   lecture course?  Do you think you would be able to provide me with a
   table
   of contents, with abstracts under each chapter heading as a starting
   point?

   I very much hope so and very much look forward to hearing from you!

   With kind regards
   Sam
