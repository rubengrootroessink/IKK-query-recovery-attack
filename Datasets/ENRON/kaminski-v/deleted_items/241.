Today's focus: Linux on-the-go

By Phil Hochmuth

Enthusiasts of Linux on PDAs may want to try and finagle a demo
unit from Sharp and Royal, two companies that showed off new
Linux-based devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas earlier this month.

Sharp's Zarus PDA - a long-awaited handheld by Linux and PDA
mavens - is expected to compete with PDAs based on operating
systems from Microsoft and Palm, mostly because it has a large
corporation behind it with a track record in marketing personal
organizers (remember those?) and other types of productivity
gadgets. The product runs on a 206 MHz Intel StrongARM
processor, comes with 64M bytes of memory, 16M bytes of flash
ROM and a slew of Web, entertainment and communications
programs.

While only the development version is available now, the
general release version of the product is expected to cost
around $600.

Also announced was the Royal Lin@x (don't ask for a
pronunciation) from Royal Consumer Information Products. The
handheld is built on the same Intel architecture as the Zarus,
but has less RAM (16M bytes), and also a lower price tag at
around $300. The handheld comes with applications such as an
Internet browser, handwriting recognition software and an MP3
player.

Peripherals such as a modem or wireless LAN card can be added
through a CompactFlash Type II card port on the devices. The
product is scheduled for general availability around March.

What do these doohickeys have to do with enterprise Linux
computing? Not much, but they've got Linux as an operating
system, a good beat (Intel processors), and you can dance to
them.
