GENERATOR/POWER MARKETING  FERC Agenda Memo for October 24, 2001
 
Introduction
RTO Week shedded a new light on the pace and direction that  the Commission may go in with respect to RTO development. During discussions  with the state commission representatives on Thursday, Chairman Wood said with  regards to the hard and fast number of RTOs he desired,  "the  number 4 is officially gone.. if it ever was essentially here."   Chairman Wood  was very receptive to the recommendations and pleas of  the state commissioners and declared that the FERC would take as much time as it  needed and that it was "committed to getting the right outcome."  With that  being said, 5 of the RTO-related proceedings on the agenda for next week's  FERC meeting will probably result in extensive discussions encapsulating this  week's RTO Week developments and a retreat from a prescriptive order or  rulemaking issuing at this time.

A-4  AD02-4  Reliability, Security and  Market Operations
A-2  AD02-2 Legislative  Matters
A-3  AD02-3  Customer  Matters
A-1  AD02-1  Agency Administrative  Matters
 
 
RTO Developments
 
E-1  Discussion of RTO Developments in the  Northeast EX02-1-000; RT01-99 PJM; RT01-98 PJM-West; New York ISO  RT01-95;  Commission discussion on the FERC's ALJ Northeast  RTO Mediation Report and comments filed by industry.  
E-2 Discussion of RTO Developments in the  Southeast  EX02-2; RT01-100 Gridsouth; RT01-34 Southwest Power Pool;  RT01-75 Entergy Services; RT01-77 Southern Company Services -   Commission discussion on the FERC's ALJ Southeast RTO Mediation  Report and comments filed by industry.  
 
E-3  Discussion of RTO Developments In the Midwest EX02-3; RT01-87  Midwest ISO/Alliance; EL01-80 National Grid USA - Commission  discussion on RTO developments in the Midwest region.  At the last  Commission meeting, FERC gave the Midwest ISO a big boost toward the RTO finish  line. The discussions with state commissions at this week's RTO week conference  may slow down FERC's efforts in mandating RTO structure in the Midwest also.  
 
E-4  Discussion of Western Infrastructure  Adequacy Conference  AD01-2 - Commission discussion on  FERC's agenda and scope of the  "Adequacy of Western Infrastructure"  conference announced at the September 26 Commission meeting and to be held  during the Western Governor's Association's meeting on November 2 in Seattle,  WA. 
 
E-5  Electricity Market Design and Structure  RM01-12 -  Commission action in response to RTO Week  developments and comments filed in the "Electricity Market Design Structure"  docket. 
 
 
Market Complaints
E-19  San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v.  Sellers of Energy  EL00-95-034; EL00-98-038 -  Order on  the CA ISO's compliance filing proposing a new generator outage and maintenance  coordination plan.  Dynegy and other protesters allege that the CA ISO  is attempting to circumvent FERC and "seize control of the outage  monitoring" function that is currently FERC' s responsibility and  role.   
 
E-21  Pacificorp Power Marketing ER01-2685-000  - Order on Pacificorp Power Marketing's request to withdraw its  filing of a 10-year power Purchasing Agreement contract with the California  Department of Water Resources. Attempting to comply with a Commission order  in the Southern Case rescinding waiver and requiring that  all  long-tern power contacts be filed with the Commission in  place of submitting quarterly power marketing reports, Pacificorp  filed its long-term contract and later realized that the waiver was still in  effect at the time it made the power contract filing.  As a  result, Pacifcorp filed to withdraw its earlier contract filing. The California  Public Utilities Commission filed protest to the  withdrawal.  
 
E-26  Mirant et al.  v. ISO New England,  Inc.  EL01-93-001 -  Order on NSTAR's request for  rehearing of the Commission's 8/10/01 order upholding the ISO NE's market rules,  which include Market Rule No. 17 affording the ISO NE discretion to negotiate  mitigation agreements and enter into market power mitigation contracts with  generators.  In response to the rehearing request, the ISO  NE filed for clarification of this exemption to file mitigation agreements  with the FERC, under its discretion granted per the approved market  rules.  
 
E-30  Calpine Eastern Corp., Mirant et al. v.  ISO New England  EL01-124-000 - Order on Calpine's complaint  against the ISO NE for excluding external energy contracts from its calculation  of the energy clearing price for the ISO's market.
