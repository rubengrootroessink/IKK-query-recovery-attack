Today's focus: Attaining Itanium

By Phil Hochmuth

TurboLinux, Red Hat and SuSE, three Linux distributors that
have been involved in the development of Linux on Intel's 64-
bit Itanium processors, last week showed off the fruits of
their labor with the release of Itanium-compatible versions of
their respective Linux distributions.

According to Intel, approximately 25 computer manufactures will
release up to 35 new models of Itanium-based PCs this year.
Intel says its new 64-bit architecture will surpass the
performance of the most powerful reduced instruction set chip
processors - found on servers made by IBM, Hewlett-Packard and
Sun - giving users a platform for high-powered tasks such as
data-mining, multiterabit database management and scientific
computing.

While the IT industry in general has been anxiously awaiting
the next-generation Intel processor, the Linux community has
taken an exceptional interest in the development of the new
architecture. Unlike the original development of Linux, which
was done from the outside in, with code being written to
conform to the hardware, the Linux development community has
been working directly with Intel to optimize and fine-tune the
operating system to run on Itanium. This integrated
Linux/Itanium development effort should help shorten the
learning curve of hardware manufactures for supporting Linux on
their products.
