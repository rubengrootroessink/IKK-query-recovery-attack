Dear Vincent,

Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimisation for Oil and Gas, 23rd - 24th
October, London

It was good to chat to you earlier. As I mentioned, Ron Bain from Anadarko
Petroleum strongly recommended that I contact you about the conference that
I'm putting together and I would love to invite you to come along and speak.
I've attached a copy of the draft programme below to give you a better idea
of the topics that we will be covering.

I would imagine that based on Enron's success in applying real options, you
would prefer to speak on this subject. However if you feel that there are
other areas that you would like to present I would be more than happy. I am
also willing to adapt / tailor abstractions for you.

I really do believe that this is a fantastic opportunity for you to
publicise Enron as a world leader. No-one can under-estimate the value of
benchmarking and sharing best practice or indeed the need to stay up to date
and in touch with developments and what their major competitors are doing.
(However I certainly don't expect you to share any top secret or competitive
information.) This conference will provide exactly that kind of arena and
speakers will get all this information and networking for free! More
importantly speakers also find it a very enjoyable experience...certainly
beats sitting in front of a computer!

We will be marketing this conference to over 40,000 targeted individuals,
including a direct mail of at least 25,000 and in addition an online and
press campaign.  We will be looking to work with leading industry press such
as Petroleum Review, Oil and Gas Journal, Offshore Magazine and Harts E&P
and can also undertake mailings for our speakers to their contacts and
clients. The programme will be targeted to senior decision-makers within the
Business & Strategy Development Departments, Planning and Evaluation and
Exploration and Production including; CFOs, Strategy Directors, Commercial
Planners, Business Planners, Heads of Planning and Evaluation, Portfolio
Managers, Risk Managers, Exploration Managers, Heads of Risk Assessment,
Senior Geologists and Geophysicists.

Just to let you know of my deadlines I am hoping to go to print next week
and will need confirmation by Tuesday 19th June. I appreciate that this is
very short notice but isn't as scary as it sounds as all I would need is for
you to choose an abstract and if possible 3-4 sentences by way of a
biography.

Have a great weekend in California and I look forward to speaking to you on
Monday.

Kind Regards,

Alix
