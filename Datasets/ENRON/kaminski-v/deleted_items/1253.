Study Says More Natural Gas Drilling Restricted

    More of the recoverable natural gas in the Rocky Mountains is off-limits
to drilling than previously thought, according to a new DOE study. A review
found that about 68% of the recoverable supplies in the Greater Green River
Basin in southern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado, up to 79 Tcf, is either
closed to drilling or under significant access restrictions. The conclusions
are much higher than a similar 1999  study which said 40% was off limits.
The US consumes about 23 Tcf of natural gas per year. The studied area
covered almost 29 million acres of land with almost 160 Tcf of gas, of which
16 million acres with 117 Tcf was under federal ownership. Slightly over
two-thirds of the recoverable federal natural gas in the study was either
closed to development or available with restrictions.
