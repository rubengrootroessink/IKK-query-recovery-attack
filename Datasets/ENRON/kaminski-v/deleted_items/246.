The "Attack on America" on September 11th and subsequent developments have necessitated a quantum shift in Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry.  The treat and scope of malicious and purposeful sabotage today is much greater than that of natural disasters. The Center for Business Intelligence has developed the "Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry" conference.  Power industry executives will examine the impact of heightened security measures on their companies' day-to-day operations.  Crucial factors that will be discussed include strengthening data security and protecting against cybercrime, planning and creating inherently resilient infrastructures and assisting policymakers in developing adequate legislation to safeguard the nation's energy supply and distribution.
