Kate,

Thanks for your message. With all the turbulence going on in Enron
it's difficult for anybody to leave the office for an extended period of
time.
We shall have to abstain this time and hope to join you in the future.
Vince

   Dear Vince and Vasant :

   Since you both won't be able to come for our Advisory Committee meeting
   on
   Dec 7, can you send someone else to come? Please let me know, it is
   critical for us to have
   someone from your team to come!!   As you can see from the attached RSVP
   list,
   we have a quite good mix of people to come. FYI, I am attaching an
   agenda and
   "possible issues" for your review.

   Look forward to hearing from you.

   Kate
