Hello,
 Research Weather Team

I will meet with Tiko today to discuss our move on Nov. 9th,
                 

Please note : File space is very limited , we must be prepared.

We will also have our last tour before moving on Nov.6th and we
will actually see our new location.

I am also working with Reggie Wilson to see if maybe we 
can have a shelf or any other type furniture built to allow
us storage space for files papers etc.....

Printers, copiers and other equipment is really not
a great concern at the moment because we are working
to be sure this will be operational.

All supplies are packed and ready for moving , we have a very limited
amount  in the supplies closet , if you need something and you
do not see it - please do not hesitate to ask.

                           Thanks
                         Kevin Moore
