Today's focus: Vendors attempt at migration again

By Dave Kearns

Evidently our little dig at BindView and ePresence last fall
didn't sway the thinking at these supposedly "Novell friendly"
firms. They've now joined forces with Microsoft to launch a
free seminar tour called "NetWare and Windows 2000 - Real World
Options for Novell Customers".

The blurb (http://epresence.com/asp/about/event.asp?master_code=MSBSMI)
says:

"Do you rely on Novell NetWare, NetWare Directory Services
and/or GroupWise? Are you are considering your organization's
next strategic move? Are you unsure if it includes integrating
with or migrating to Microsoft Windows 2000, Active Directory
and Exchange 2000?"

Microsoft is sponsoring the tour, for goodness' sake - what do
you think the answer will be?

Here's another hint, the agenda includes:

* Spotlight Migration.

* Getting Secure - The Preparation Phase.

* Migrating - Core Challenges.

* Staying Secure - Adopting & Enforcing Policies.

I'll just bet they aren't talking about migrating from Windows
2000 to NetWare!

When it was still called Banyan, ePresence was one of Novell's
biggest competitors. Now it seems ePresence has thrown in with
the only networking-software company that's attempting to
challenge NetWare. That's understandable, if disingenuous.
Perhaps it needs to publish a disclaimer along the lines of
"We've been trying to get people to migrate away from NetWare
for almost 20 years - we keep failing, but we keep trying!"

Microsoft, of course, is out to crush NetWare entirely.

That leaves BindView. In the same newsletter last fall (see
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/netware/2001/01052557.html)
, I suggested you e-mail BindView and its head, Eric Pulaski
(epulaski@bindview.com might work) and tell them why you are
not about to purchase new BindView products, but also why
you're replacing the ones you currently have. Corporations only
understand you when you speak dollars and cents, evidently.

Now, I'm not suggesting that BindView or ePresence shouldn't be
involved in the migration business - they should be, as long as
someone is interested in buying their products and services.
What I object to is the use of a so-called "objective
presentation" as a thinly veiled advertising medium. You should
object, also.

By the way, at the very bottom of the page describing the
seminar
(http://epresence.com/asp/about/event.asp?master_code=MSBSMI)
there's an e-mail address to learn more about ePresence. When I
tried the link (mailto:info@epresence.com), I got the following
response from the ePresence mail server:

"Your message did not reach the following
recipient(s):(info@epresence.com)  The e-mail address could not
be found.  Perhaps the recipient moved to a different e-mail
organization, or there was a mistake in the address.  Check the
address and try again."

If ePresence can't even configure its own mail server, should
you really trust the company to advise you on the choice
between GroupWise and Exchange?
