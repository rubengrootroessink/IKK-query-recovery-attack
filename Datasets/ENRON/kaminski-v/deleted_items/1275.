Today's focus: More back-up options for Linux users

By Phil Hochmuth

Users looking for more back-up options for their Linux machines may
be interested in Quick Restore for Linux from Workstation Solutions.

The newest version of Workstation Solutions' back-up software was
released last week and offers improved support for controlling tape
back-up devices as well as the ability to back up remote workstations
that sit beyond a network firewall.

The Quick Restore 2.7.4 software resides on a Linux server and allows
administrators to schedule the back-up server data to one of the
following: a DLT tape drive, tape library, or other network-attached
storage devices. The software also can be used to schedule back-up
jobs of clients across a network.

The product is based on the Network Data Management Protocol, an
industry standard protocol for interacting with storage devices.

According to the company, the latest version of Quick Restore
features extended firewall support, which allows the software to
back-up client workstations and PCs that sit beyond a corporate
firewall. This could be useful for scheduling off-hours back-up jobs
of workstations or even servers at remote branch offices with
dedicated network links. It also could be used to back up home office
PCs to a central storage device over a VPN connection.

The new software also features expanded support for different DLT
tapes, including well-known storage devices such as Compaq SSL2000,
HP SureStore DLT libraries and StorageTek L209.
