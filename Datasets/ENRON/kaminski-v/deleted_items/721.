Hello, the following attachment is the agenda for our weather risk
conference to be held here in New York. I know we do have a speaker from
ENRON (Sanjeev Khanna), but to date we have no attendees. In addition to the
keynote speakers, there will be a panel discussion with representatives from
all of the market sectors. Take a look, and I will ring you tomorrow to see
if there are any questions.
I will speak with you soon,

Ronda McHenry
