FERC Gives OK to North BajaPipeline
Jan. 16 -- The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave final approval on Wednesday to the U.S.segment of the North Baja Pipeline project that will bring natural gas from Mexicoto fuel electric generating plants in southern Californiaand northern Mexico. The $230 million pipeline will be operated by an international subsidiary of Sempra Energy , PG&E Corp. and Mexico-based Proxima Gas S.A. de C.V. The 215-mile pipeline (346-km) would carry up to 500 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. FERC gave final approval for the project after determining the pipeline would not harm the environment.

Universityof HoustonStudy Favors Phased Development of Northern Frontier Gas
An energy consultant who grew up in Alaska believes the least risky way to tap the North Slope's huge natural gas reserves is to do so in stages, running multiple pipelines across the Canadian Arctic during the next 16 years. 
Ron Oligney, director of engineering research development at the Universityof Houston, said Tuesday that smaller pipelines built every few years would reduce the huge costs and risks that would come with a single, larger pipeline to the Lower 48. 
He and colleague Jim Longbottom of the Universityof Houstonrecently completed a study on Alaskaand northwest Canadagas development. The university and private clients paid for the study, he said. On Tuesday, Oligney presented the findings to members of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the International Association of Energy Economics at the AtwoodBuildingin downtown Anchorage.
