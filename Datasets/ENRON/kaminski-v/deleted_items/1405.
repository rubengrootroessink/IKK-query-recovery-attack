***********************************************************************

Iraq's cutoff of its UN-sanctioned oil exports on June 4 is a signal of its
opposition to changes under consideration by the Security Council.

*  The Security Council decided unanimously on May 31 to roll over the oil
exports for one month, instead of the usual 180 days, while it debates the
changes.

*   Under consideration is a plan to lift most economic sanctions, strengthen
UN control of Iraq's oil exports, and tighten restrictions on Iraq's access to
new weaponry.

*  By strengthening control over oil exports, the new plan would reduce Saddam
Hussein's access to oil revenues. The approach also implies continued
sanctions, ensuring Iraq's ongoing opposition.
