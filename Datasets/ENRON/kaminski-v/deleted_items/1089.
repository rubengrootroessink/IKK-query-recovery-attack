FERC issued a letter to the Northeast State Commissioners  requesting their views on several questions before the Commission on RTO  formation.  FERC presented 11 questions for the Northeast states to address  and respond back by January 18, 2002.  FERC will also initiate in  mid-January a conference call with the state commissions to  discuss what will be in the written comments. 
 
From the questions posed, it is appears that FERC has not  decided some very critical questions about RTOs in the Northeast, i.e. scope and  configuration, market interface, role of reliability, and market  monitoring.  FERC is honoring the commitment it made in its November order  vowing to work with the state commissions and incorporate their concerns and  views. 
 
Attached is the letter.
