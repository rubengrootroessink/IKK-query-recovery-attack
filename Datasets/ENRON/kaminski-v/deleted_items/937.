n expected as 20's and 30's are widespread this morning even down to the Gu=
lf Coast. The first real Lake Effect snows of the season are underway in th=

not slightly above normal this afternoon. But, it is a part of a stepping d=

 Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  With model consisten=
cy on my side, I am confident that this 6-10 day forecast period will verif=
y colder than normal for much of the East. If it does, it will be the first=
 period in over two months that runs cold. Relative to normal, it may not b=
e as significant as some of the warmer departures have been, but it should =
get some attention. There are some differences on where the heart of the co=
ld sets up. I believe it will tend to be more on the Plains rather than the=
 East Coast. But all models in this time frame have a strong ridge West/tro=
ugh East signature on them. One additional surprise could be a Southern jet=
 stream storm. I don't see anything particularly ominous yet, but the setup=
 suggests something could be in the offing.    Day 6: Tuesday, December 25,=
