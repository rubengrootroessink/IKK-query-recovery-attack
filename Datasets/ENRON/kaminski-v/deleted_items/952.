e  power and natural gas markets is an inordinately complex task. The  chal=

 those which have appeared to be the most stable and capable.  The plights =
of Enron, the California Power Exchange, SDG&E and  PG&E highlight the diff=

have similar needs. The major ratings agencies and the financial  community=
 have begun to focus heavily on the risks and information  requirements of =
the power industry. We, as active market participants,  must also be concer=
ned about these risks, taking steps to identify,  measure and mitigate them=
 as much as possible. In most cases,  the difference between success and fa=
ilure depends on whether  you have access to the right data and are able to=
 use it in the  right way in a timely manner.   Maintaining a competitive a=
