   Karthik,

         Do you know how to resolve the following issues:

        1.	Where is function CheckDomain() defined ? 
            It seems this function is used for privilege check when a program calls the exoctica dll.
      This function is defined (prototyped) in EXOTICA\ExoticaDll\ExoticaDll.c. I could not find where is defined. I also need to find how it works and how to set up the appropriate security privileges in order to call / protect the dll.
       2.    Password(s) for the following Microsoft Doc:
a.	ExoticaDll\EXOTICA_DLL.doc
b.	ExoticaXll\EXOTICA.doc
c.	ExoticaXll\EXOTICA1.doc
When I open these files, I am prompted to give password, otherwise I can only open them as "read only".
However,  tt seems we need "write" privilege to these files.



Vince,
   Do you happened to know the answers?


Thank you very much.


 Sean Yang
