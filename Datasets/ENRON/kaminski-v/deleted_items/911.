Today's focus: Novell 2001: The year of NetWare 6

By Dave Kearns

Last issue, we reviewed the performance of Novell over the past
year. This time, we want to look at the products and services
the company provided during 2001.

Right at the top of the list has to be NetWare 6. We started
talking about, and anticipating, NetWare 6 more than a year and
a half ago, but the real discussion didn't start until last
year's BrainShare conference in March. The full set of features
for NetWare 6 was revealed at the conference, including the
brand new technologies, such as iFolder.

NetWare 6 is a worthy successor to the remarkably well-received
NetWare 5 as well as the other ground-breaking versions of the
product going all the way back to Novell's "ShareNet" product
of the early1980s - pre-dating the IBM PC.

In light of the management turnover churn we mentioned in the
last issue, as well as numerous employee layoffs over the past
18 months, it's remarkable that NetWare 6 is as feature-rich as
it is while also being relatively bug-free. Even more
remarkable, compared to some software vendors, it shipped on
time - exactly according to the roadmap released two years ago!

NetWare continues to be Novell's strength even as the company
struggles to present an image as a "services" rather than a
"product" company (and what's wrong with products, anyway?).
The investor community, in particular, seems to have little
regard for the company - even as it continues to use the
software (maybe the investment bankers' IT departments don't
tell the analysts which NOS they're running).

Maybe Novell is finally learning that you, the network
executive, are the ones who can tell the company's story the best.
Take a look at http://www.novell.com/products/netware/whytheylie/ -
it's designed for you. In particular, read "The Factual Truth"and
then start spreading the word about the benefits of superior
technology.
