Hi Anita,

I need to use some of my vacation days.  I plan to take the week of Thanksgiving off (Nov 19, 20, 21), and also take the week of Christmas off (Dec 26, 27, 28) and also New Year's Eve off (Dec 31).  That would leave me with 4 1/2 days to carry over to 2002.  I may come in for half day on one of the above days just to increase my carry over to 5 days.

Thanks,
Vasant
