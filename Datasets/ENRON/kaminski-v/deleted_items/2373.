Vince:  is the following ok to send to Deborah with EPIS?

**************************************************************

Deborah:

Regretfully, Vince just informed me that he will not be able 
to attend the conference due to emergency circumstances that 
have arisen within Enron.

He will be sending in his place, Yinxi Huang (Alex), Manager,
Research Group, Enron Corp. 

Alex's specialty is the power industry within the Research Group
and he is a very personable young man, proficient in the power 
field.  He will basically give the presentation that Vince has 
prepared, but is currently updating.  I will send a copy as soon 
as possible.  We are also putting together a "bio" for Alex and 
will forward it as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, please let me know and again Vince
sends his regrets, but feels that you will be very pleased with
Alex's presentation.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Research Group
