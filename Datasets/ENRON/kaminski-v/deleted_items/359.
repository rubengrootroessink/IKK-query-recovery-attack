Tax Law Changes Update

Well, it's off - at least for now.  Congressional leaders weren't
able to agree on the contents of an economic stimulus package by
the end of 2001.  Renewed efforts toward a recovery plan have been
introduced by both parties this month -- Senate Majority Leader
Daschle proposes a plan in which businesses would receive a tax
credit for creating new jobs or raising workers' salaries, and
provide a depreciation bonus for equipment investments.  President
Bush continues to support a plan that would accelerate marginal tax
rate cuts enacted last June, provide favorable tax treatment for
businesses investing in new equipment, and provide additional
unemployment benefits.

One important bill did make it through, however: the Victims of
Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 was passed by Congress on December
21, 2001.  This bill extends relief to the survivors of victims of
the September 11 attacks as well as to victims of anthrax attacks
and the Oklahoma City attack.  Among other provisions, the bill
waives income tax liability for all victims of these attacks for
the year of death.  Click here to read more about this important
bill: <a href="http://turbotax.0mm.com/tax027002">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/55881</a>

How Rollovers to IRAs Work

We've received several questions this past month about rollovers to
and from IRA accounts.  The rules covering rollovers can be confusing
- certain rules must be followed to ensure that you're not taxed when
you take money out of a retirement plan and put it into an IRA.
Here's the general rule: you're not taxed when you move the money you
have in a retirement account over to an IRA account or even from one
IRA to another IRA - but as with nearly everything involving taxes,
there are exceptions.  Learn more about the IRA rollover rules - and
how they changed for 2002.

Ask the Expert

Q:  If you have a loss in an IRA account, can you sell out of that
stock and report that loss on your tax return?
A:  No, you can't.  Your IRA is a "tax-deferred" account, meaning
that all transactions, whether resulting in income or losses, aren't
subject to taxes until you actually withdraw the money, presumably
when you retire.  This is a very common question in times of economic
downturn - the obvious upside of IRA accounts is that in an economic
boom, your gains in your IRA aren't taxable either until withdrawal.

Q:  We have recently refinanced our home.  What are the tax
implications and can we deduct the points associated with the
refinancing?
A:  With most refinancings, you can deduct the points you pay for
your new loan, but there's a twist:  you'll have to deduct them
proportionately over the length (number of years) of your new loan.
So, if your new loan has a 30-year term, you'll deduct 1/30th of your
points each year.

A couple of things to consider: if this isn't the first time you've
refinanced your home mortgage, and you have points from the earlier
loan that you hadn't finished deducting, you may write off the rest
of those points in the year you refinance.  Also, if you refinance,
and you used some of the money from the refinance for home
improvements, you can deduct a portion of those points this year.
For more information on the rules for deducting points, see Points
Deduction Rules at <a href="http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/54158</a>

Q: We realized a large capital gain from the sale of real estate in
the year 2000 and had to pay the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Our income for the year 2001 is much less than the prior year.  Is
there any credit that carries over from the AMT?
A:  Yes, there is - it's called the "Credit for Prior Year Minimum
Tax" and it's calculated on Form 8801.  If you prepared your return
using TurboTax for 2000 and you transfer your data into TurboTax for
2001, Form 8801 will be filled out for you automatically.  The credit
applies only if your AMT was caused by something called "timing
differences", which may or may not be the case in your situation. For
a complete explanation of how the AMT works and how this credit is
determined, see the Alternative Minimum Tax article online.

Get Financially Organized

Many folks have set a New Year's resolution to save more money, a
habit that can allow us to build a nest egg, regardless of whether
the economy is up or down.  Astute savers we know have one trait in
common - they're financially organized and proactive.  They know
where their money goes, they stick to a budget, and they pay bills
promptly to avoid wasting money on penalties and interest.  If you'd
like to get organized, but worry that the effort to do so won't fit
into your busy schedule, here's a tip.  The number #1 tool for
getting financially organized is Quicken(R) 2002 Deluxe, personal
financial software that helps you easily track and categorize
expenses, set up a budget step-by-step, and get alerts when you are
close to overspending or when bills are due.  Both Windows(R) and
Macintosh(R) versions are available.  Order now and get the year off
to a good start.

Tax Tips

Tip 1:
Not sure what the due dates are for your returns or your estimated
tax payments?  Check out our Tax Calendar! You'll quickly find all of
the important tax dates coming up this year.
Click here: <a href="http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657">http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/taxes/36657</a>

Tip 2:

Do you have a part-time business or are you fully self-employed?
Take full advantage of section 179 that allows you to expense
equipment you buy for your business!  The general rule is that a
business can't write-off the whole cost of certain assets in one year.
For example, if your business buys a new computer for $4,000, the
law says that you must spread the tax deduction over five years. With
section 179, you can immediately write-off up to $24,000 of qualifying
property in 2001 instead of taking the depreciation deduction over a
longer period of time. What is qualifying property? For most people,
qualifying property is tangible personal property, such as equipment,
office machinery, and furniture.

Tip 3:
Do you find yourself spending your refund check before it arrives
(even if you're spending it in your mind) and wondering when it is
going to finally arrive? According to the Internal Revenue Service,
the fastest way to get your refund is to file your return electronically.
When you file electronically, you can receive your refund in as little as
10 days, compared to 6 to 8 weeks with a paper return. TurboTax
enables you to electronically file one federal tax return at no cost,
after mail-in rebate. The IRS also recommends that you file your return
early in February or March rather then waiting until mid April.

To avoid delays when filing a paper return, remember to:

1. Sign your return.
2. Make sure that any supporting documents are securely stapled to the
   front of the return.
3. Make sure your mailing address is correct.
4. Have your refund deposited directly into your bank account.

Debt Consolidation - new calculator helps tell if its right for you

Debt-consolidation is a powerful, proven way to cure debt woes,
especially after the holiday season.  Homeowners have the option to
consolidate bills by refinancing or using a home equity loan - both
loans can eliminate high interest rates and roll multiple bills into
one manageable payment all while taking advantage of historically
low mortgage rates.  And for most people the interest may be
tax-deductible.

The idea of debt-consolidation refinancing is simple: use your home's
increased equity to get a lump sum of cash to pay off your
high-interest debts.  To see for yourself and get the facts, visit
Quicken Loans new Debt Consolidation calculator to compare borrowing
costs, calculate payments and tax savings, graph out payment options
and other benefits of consolidating debt through a refinance or home
equity loan.  Be sure to consult your tax advisor for more
information on maximizing your mortgage deductions at tax time.

* Why is Internet Explorer installing on my desktop along with
  TurboTax?

Internet Explorer is installed to allow TurboTax to quickly and
reliably identify your Internet Service Provider(s) and allow you to
connect to the Internet through TurboTax. Access to the Internet is
required to update your product, download your state program, and
file electronically.

* How do I resolve the error message:  "Installation not complete /
  Installation not successful"?

In most cases, you'll need to perform a hard drive installation by
installing TurboTax from the hard disk drive rather than the CD-ROM.
Follow these steps:

1.  Insert the TurboTax CD in your CD-ROM drive. Cancel any messages
    that appear and shut down any Terminate and Stay Resident programs
2.  Start Windows Explorer. Click Start, select Programs, and click
    Windows Explorer.
3.  Create a folder to hold the contents of the TurboTax CD. Click
    the letter for the hard disk drive you are working on to
    highlight it. Go to the File menu and point to New. Click Folder.
    A folder called New Folder appears. Type the word TXINSTL to
    replace the name New Folder and press ENTER.
4.  Find your CD-ROM drive (usually drive letter D) and double-click
    it. A list of files and folders appears in the right side of the
    Windows Explorer screen
