TGP's DracutExpansion Receives FERC Approval
  
Tennessee Gas Pipeline has accepted the FERC's certificate 
authorizing construction of the Dracut Expansion project. The $35 
million project will replace 12 miles of existing 16-inch natural gas 
pipeline with a 24-inch pipeline from Dracutto Burlington, 
Massachusetts, primarily using existing rights-of-way.  The project 
will increase takeaway capacity from the Dracutinterconnect by an 
additional 200,000 MMBtu per day.  Once the project is in service, 
the total capacity from Dracutwill increase to more than 600,000 
MMBtu per day.  The project is scheduled to be available for service 
next fall. Tennesseeinitiated the growth by completing the Eastern 
Express 2000 project in January, 2000 and placed the Londonderry
pipeline in service in September, 2001.
