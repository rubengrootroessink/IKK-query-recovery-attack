Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval
  
   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to 
developing almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region 
on the coast of the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy 
process of applying for regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 
years. Led by Imperial Oil, the group consists of Conoco, Shell 
Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a company controlled by 
Northwest Territoriesnative people. The partners, known as the 
Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250 million 
before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The natural 
gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field, the 
1.8 TcfParsonsLakefield, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and 
Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline 
to carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Albertaalong the 
Mackenzie Rivervalley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The 
natural gas would then be transported to Canadaand the US. Last 
year, the group signed an agreement with Northwest Territoriesnative 
leaders that would give the region's people a 33% share in the 
pipeline and provide other economic benefits. Even if the Mackenzie 
Delta project did not start pumping for 5 or 6 years, it likely will 
still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where BP, Exxon Mobil and 
Phillips are planning development of their reserves.
