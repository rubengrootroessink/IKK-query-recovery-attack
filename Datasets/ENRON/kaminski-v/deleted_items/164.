Dear Vince,
    In ever increasing numbers, fund managers are allocating a portion of their funds under management to alternative investments. Mezzanine capital is now attracting new investors looking to diversify into investments that offer a fixed income allocation, and in some deals, equity appreciation as well. To take advantage of opportunities in the market, get up to speed on the nuances of the mezzanine market.
    Join us at IIR's Investing in Mezzanine Finance conference on February 26- 27, 2002, at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, where we will explore this area of the private capital market. Gain knowledge about the opportunities available in mezzanine investing from the sponsors and investors who have firsthand experience in issuing and investing in debt and equity mezzanine deals.
    Investors will:
Hear from experienced mezzanine investors and providers to learn their investment decision for both fund allocation and direct mezzanine programs  
See why the mezzanine market is providing a preferred alternative to the high yield market  
Identify how mezzanine compares - and contrasts-with other private equity investments  
Focus on pricing trends in the mezzanine market  
Learn what capital structures are being used and new hybrid products  
Gain insight into workouts, liquidity alternatives and the secondary market in mezzanine
