Hello Ina ,

Since our meeting this morning I just thought would also let you
see that Delores and Tike are aware of the needs of 
the Weather Team.

Right now Ina , we use several color printers in order that we
process the Morning Weather Report.

1-Rocket man
2-Saphire
3-Clown

Also we have a black and white printer that sits directly
behind us whereby easy access is available.

We arrive in the office first  in the morning however,
it is never guaranteed that a copier this will be available every morning,
that is why several copiers are needed on the floor.

Lastly , we need a color copier on the floor and we need 
to have the authority to use of this machine for our Morning
Meeting first , anything thereafter we can get by.

Thanks so much for taking the time with us.

                           Sincerely,
                          Kevin Moore

Goodmorning ,
How are you ladies today.
I have a question, 
How many copiers will be placed on the floor ?
Where will these copiers be located and where will my group be positioned?
These are a few things that I am concerned about.
There are a lot of reports being done at the same time, here on the 32nd floor
and it is very important that we will continue to operate once we move to the new
building.
Just some concerns..........
Please respond.

                             Thanks
                          Kevin Moore

Hello Delores ,

Just a note to say Hello and see how things are going with the move process.
We are adding another meteorologist to our group as we will be adding another desk space.
The issue concerning the satellite is being worked out ,  I will keep you informed.

Please, keep me updated as much as possible.

                                    Thanks
                                 Kevin Moore
