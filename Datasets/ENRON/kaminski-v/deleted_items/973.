THE YEAR IN REVIEW
http://www.erisk.com/news/weekly/news_weekly2001-12-21_01.asp
In a departure from our usually Weekly Review, ERisk journalists and editors take a look back at 2001, from the California power crisis to the September 11 attacks and Enron&#8217;s fall from grace. Put the year in perspective with our Year in Review, including the challenges of banking risk management in 2001.

REFLECTIONS ON RISK
http://www.erisk.com/news/features/ERisk2001YearInReview.pdf
For this special feature, bank risk managers including the president of a US community bank, the CFO of a savings & loan, chief risk officers of two of the world's largest banks, and specialists in market, credit and operating risks told ERisk's Duncan Wood what had preoccupied them and their institutions in 2001. You can read what they had to say in our Reflections on Risk feature.

VIEWPOINT
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_viewpoint.asp
After Enron's collapse, other energy firms came under scrutiny as investors began worrying about endemic weakness. Calpine &#8211; an ambitious independent power producer &#8211; suffered the most, despite the company's protestations. In our latest CRO profile, ERisk talks to Enrique Mejorada, newly promoted head of Calpine's risk controls function, and profiles Calpine&#8217;s turbulent year.

FEATURE
http://www.erisk.com/news/news_features.asp
It may be years before the problems that brought down Enron are fully understood, but some of the issues that brought down the once-mighty energy giant are already becoming clear. In this exclusive ERisk feature, Rob Jameson recounts the history of Enron from its humble origins as an ambitious natural gas trader to its dark final days of crisis and bankruptcy.
