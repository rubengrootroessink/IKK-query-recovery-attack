            STOCKS ARE DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD
         Where can the sophisticated investor go for returns that beat the market?
        THE BIOTECH SECTOR IS STILL HOT!
    Consider this...

 
January 2 - CBS MarketWatch - "Analyst Mark Augustine at USB Piper Jaffray believes 2002
will be a strong year for the biotechnology sector due to improving industry fundamentals and a
favorable market and economic environment. He also feels merger speculation could hit
development-stage companies."
December 24 - Washington Post - "As investors look for new places to park their money, biotech
firms are grabbing a larger share of a shrinking pool of venture capital... What we're seeing is a
greater interest in the life sciences sector than any other sector" 
Recent progress by genetic researchers worldwide, including the well-known Human
Genome Project's effort to map the human genome, has grabbed the world's attention
with its vast possibilities and made it a very attractive field for speculative investors.

Many experts agree that the future of medicine is in
genomic research.... 

Millions of people die each year from disease and thousands more die from negative
responses to drugs. The science of genomics promises to improve lives by (1)
identifying the genes that cause disease so doctors can attack a disease before
symptoms ever become visible, and (2) determining which drugs should be prescribed
to a person based on their unique genetic make-up. 

The entire pharmaceutical industry has developed drugs against only about 500
genes. If 200 common diseases are each caused by 50 different genes, there
may be 10,000 disease genes out there, so the vast majority of the disease
genes will not have existing drugs to combat them. 
 

Would you be interested in jump-starting your 
portfolio with an aggressive Biotech investment? 

Led by a Harvard-trained Ph.D., a new development-stage company is taking
advantage of the recent advances in genomics and information technology to
solve as many common diseases as possible within the next five years by
identifying as many of the genes as possible which contribute to a specific
disease. 
The Company's goal is nothing short of a medical revolution: they aim to
change the way medicine is practiced. Instead of waiting for symptoms to 
develop, they intend to diagnose disease before any signs are visible
They already own three potentially blockbuster clinical provisional patents that
are ready for immediate licensing. 
It is estimated by Daniel Cohen of Genset that a single disease gene is worth
from 40 to 80 million dollars.  This new company expects to find hundreds of
these.

The company just received an infusion of $2M in venture capital and began
trading less than two months ago.  This is truly a ground floor opportunity..
The company's stated goal is to be bought out for a minimum of $100M or get
listed on the NASDAQ Small Cap or NASDAQ National Market Systems
Exchange. Either of these outcomes should be a boon to the Company's
shareholders.
