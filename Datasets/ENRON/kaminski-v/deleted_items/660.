Today's focus: HP clusters with MSC.Software

By Phil Hochmuth

A recently announced partnership between Hewlett-Packard and
MSC.Software to develop a clustering hardware/software package
could interest businesses or research and educational
institutions looking for a platform for computer-intensive,
parallel processing applications.

MSC.Software has developed its own cluster-specific Linux
distribution, called MSC.Linux, that's intended to run in a
cluster of HP-based Intel servers or workstations. According to
MSC, MSC.Linux has been developed with HP hardware in mind, and
the code has been optimized to run on multiple HP boxes in a
distributed parallel cluster environment.

Included in MSC.Linux is a tool called "Webmin", a Web-based
management program that can be used to set up and install
MSC.Linux clusters on HP hardware. MSC says the software can
help simplify set-up tasks such as RAID (redundant array of
independent disks) disk drive partitioning and file system
selection. The software also can help administrators with
management tasks, such as monitoring the health of a
distributed computing system and taking nodes on and off line
in the cluster.

MSC.Software and HP are targeting their cluster offerings at
heavy-duty, number-crunching applications in the areas of
aerospace, chemical engineering, geological research and
mathematical modeling. The gas and oil exploration industry and
government research labs that study weather patterns are among
a growing number of large outfits using parallel Linux
clustering to solve problems.
