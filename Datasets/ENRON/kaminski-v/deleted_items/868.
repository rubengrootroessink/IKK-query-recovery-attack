Hi,

There is some exciting BP MS 150 news we want to let you know about:

Oops! You may have recieved a blank e-newsletter right before this one.
We identified and fixed the bug that caused the two enewsletters. In the future you will recieve only one.

MS 150 E-Newsletter Topics:
     1. Online Registration and Donations for 2002 BP MS 150
     2. Increased BP MS 150 Pledge Amount in 2002
     3. Training Ride Schedule
     4. New E-Newsletter System
     5. Happy Holidays from the Lone Star Chapter

1. Online Registration and Donations for 2002 BP MS 150

Online registration and donations kicked off earlier than ever this year. With an improved e-commerce engine developed by BP America, we are happy to announce that over 250 people have successfully registered. You can too, just follow this link:
http://www.ms150.org/ms150/ride/register.asp

Register early and save $5! Early Bird Registration is only $25, good until 12/31/01.

2. Increased BP MS 150 Pledge Amount in 2002

For 2002, the minimum pledge is $300, due to the increased costs associated with the BP MS 150 and a commitment to maintain the safety and quality of the Bike Tour. Although this might be an inconvenience or might limit some riders from participating in the BP MS 150, we hope most riders realize the necessity and importance of this increase.  We encourage all riders to raise funds in support of research and programs benefiting people with multiple sclerosis (MS).  $ .83 of every $1.00 you raise directly benefits people with MS.

3. Training Ride Schedule

We're looking forward to a better-and-bigger-than-ever training ride series for 2002! Below is the current training ride schedule. Check with the website for more details, sponsor contact information and the latest updates (http://www.ms150.org/ms150/ride/training_rides.asp).

Since subscriptions were mixed together before, you are currently set to receive e-newsletters for each of these rides.

5. Happy Holidays from the Lone Star Chapter

Thank you for your support. 2001 has been a banner growth year in fundraising and services for people with MS. We are looking forward to a great 2002!
