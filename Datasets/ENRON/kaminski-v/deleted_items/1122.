Today's focus: A NetWare security scare?

By Dave Kearns

With all the fervor of a recent religious convert, an
overzealous network manager has been posting the following
message to every newsgroup and e-mail list that has anything
remotely to do with NetWare:

"Use sbcon on NetWare 5.x to perform a backup (either NDS or
the file system), after submitting the job qman generates a
couple of files. Look in the submitted job directory in
sys:queues. Using any text editor open the file with the .q
extension. What do you see? Surely not your password in plain
text?"

Novell is aware of this ridiculous security flaw but were you
or your container administrators aware of this also? Is what
the message says true? Is there really a problem?

Well, yes and no. It is essentially true. The password of the
user creating the backup is in plain text in the file. But in a
well-regulated network, only the administrative user (or
administrator equivalent) has read rights to that directory. In
a well-regulated network, a separate user is created to run
backups, then limited to logging in from one single PC.

So if only the administrator can get to the file and read it,
if the password can only be used at one PC (which, presumably,
is locked in a room or in the administrator's office) there is
no real security problem. Novell, and most well-read NetWare
managers, have known about this for years. It's a sign of how
low priority it is that no change has been made yet, or perhaps
it's a sign of how few people use SBACKUP.

In any case, there is no cause for alarm.
