Vince,

I have updated the Historical transactions spreadsheet, up to yesterday's data, and it can be found as an attachment. You will notice a drop-off in the number of EOL transactions over the past couple of weeks, but at least the figures are not yet at zero! Most significantly, the volumes of the Power desk have decreased.
