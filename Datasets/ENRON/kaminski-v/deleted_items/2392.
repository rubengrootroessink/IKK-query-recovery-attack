Doug,
Attached is our position paper concerning the topic of TCR derating that will be discussed at the ROS meeting on the 10/30/01.  Typically we need to have material to the WMS one week before the meeting, so if it possible we would like to get your comments by the end of today (please) so that we can get this out to the WMS.

David,
The same timeframe with Legal's comments, please.

 

Thanks,
Martin and Lance
