   Hi Vince,

   How are you?

   I'm doing well at the new job.

   I heard the news from Shirley. It's something we expected but
   confirmation of the expectation seemed like ultimatum, which is sad.
   As I mentioned before, I would like to have a lunch with you and
listen
   some career advice from you sometime this week or any time at your
   convenience.  Is it O.K. with you?

   Sincerely,

   Jaesoo
