Today's focus: Web-based admin for MySQL

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise database administrators using open source software
such as Linux and especially MySQL may want to research a new
tool called PHPMyAdmin, a Web-based administration program for
MySQL databases.

The free, open source software based on the PHP script language
could be used to run multiple management tasks on a MySQL
database, or an entire MySQL server over a Web connection.

PHPMyAdmin runs with either PHP3 or PHP4 and MySQL database
versions 3.21.x - 3.23.x. All administration tasks are done
through a Web browser. The developers of the software recommend
using the latest version of Apache with PHPMyAdmin.

PHPMyAdmin lets users create or delete a database on a MySQL
server from any IP connection, whether on a local intranet, or
remotely over the Web. Users also can alter database tables and
fields on a MySQL database server. The software also lets users
run SQL statements as well as batch queries. Text files can be
loaded into the database with the software.

This free tool could be useful for Web site administrators
running PHP, Apache and MySQL in a Linux environment by
allowing for the remote management of Web or internal
databases, and the creation of Web databases on the fly.
