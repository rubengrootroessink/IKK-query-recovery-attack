  Don't  Just Hire People...  Define  a path for success.      If  you want=
 to hire superior people, first define superior performance!  It's better t=
o focus on what a person needs to DO, rather than  what a person needs to H=
AVE. Most job descriptions are not much  more than lists of skills, duties,=
 responsibilities and required  experience. At best, they define basic comp=
etency. If you want  to hire superior people, you have to define superior p=
erformance.  Once you have done this, you have moved much closer to a succe=
ssful  hire.  If  you want to motivate the best to work with you, you must =
show  them a CLEARLY DEFINED path to success. Would you take a job  without=
 first knowing what the job is and what needs to get  done? Performance Pro=
files accomplish this. With a Performance  Profile, an interviewer can easi=
ly ask the right interview questions,  and discuss the position with the pe=
rson that may soon be in  that position. With a comprehensible picture in y=
our head of  what you want this person to do, and with a clear sense of how=
  the candidate will accomplish these tasks, chances are you will  hire not=
 only someone that can do the job successfully, but  also someone that is m=
otivated to do so.  Our  online course for Performance Profiles can teach y=
ou how to  start hiring top performers and improve your business. You will =
 learn how to:  Define  performance objectives  Prepare  a Performance Prof=
ile Assess  candidates based on performance Write  job ads that get better =
people Overcome  hiring deal-breakers Eliminate  classic hiring mistakes   =
