Today's focus: Learn more about SecureLogin

By Dave Kearns

Mark your calendars now, and head over to the Novell Web
Seminar Conference Center (see the link at the end of this
newsletter) to register for the Novell Access and Security Web
Seminar. The event will take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday next week (January 29, 30 and 31), at 1 and 3 PM EST
each day (6 and 8 PM GMT).

The seminar is to acquaint you with Novell's just released
SecureLogin 3.0, a new password management software package
designed to reduce administrative overhead (and associated
costs) while improving network security.

It's a part of Novell's new Secure Access Suite (SAS)
(http://www.novell.com/products/secureaccess/ ) that was
released last week. SAS is made up mostly of already released
products (with the exception of SecureLogin 3), but it does
include parts you might not have on your network.  The
components are:

* Novell eDirectory - store millions of identities, including
  detailed information about each user's roles and business
  relationships.

* NDS-Authentication Services - integrate platforms (Windows
  servers, Linux, Solaris) within your network so they can be
  managed through the identities in eDirectory.

* IChain - establish policies for each user through eDirectory
  to deliver individualized resources.

* Novell Modular Authentication Services - implement a variety
  of different authentication methods for the highest levels of
  network security.

* Novell BorderManager - regulate access to the Internet while
  accelerating digital-content delivery.

* Novell SecureLogin - allows users to access multiple
  resources without having to authenticate more than once.

SecureLogin, (previously called Single Signon), authenticates
you to any applications and data that you use during your
network session, including:

* Windows 32-bit applications;

* Citrix and Telnet environments;

* E-mail clients, including Novell GroupWise, Lotus Notes and
  Microsoft Outlook;

* IBM and Unix mainframe applications;

* Over 30 terminal emulators, including Attachmate Extra, Eicon
  Aviva and IBM Personal Communications; and

* Web sites accessed via Microsoft Internet Explorer and
  Netscape Navigator.

Today's typical network user has way too many passwords, pass
phrases and other access credentials to juggle, manipulate and
remember. SecureLogin 3 can greatly simplify that mix while
actually increasing the security of the resources on your
network. Plan to attend one of the seminar sessions to learn
more. It's free, it's informative and it could help your
network.
