Los Angelesto be greeted with another commitment to license GPCM before the=
 end of this year.  We are looking forward to working with these new compan=

FERC Seeks Natural Gas Capacity Nomination Reform
=20
Natural gas pipelines and customers have until November 19th to offer comme=
nts on a plan by the FERC that would allow shippers to recall released capa=
city and renominatethe capacity. The FERC has stated in a Federal Register =
notice that it seeks to change the natural gas business rule to synchronize=
 the its regulation of recalled capacity with its standards for intra-day n=
ominations. The changes are related to FERC'sopen access regulation, and wo=
uld also give transporters more flexibility in transactions to release capa=
city. The proposed change would rescind Gas Industry Standards Board provis=
ions which require notice of capacity release recalls by 8 a.m. central tim=
e and which ban partial day recalls of capacity. The board developed its ru=
les based on a consensus of its gas pipeline members. Last February, the GI=
SB asked the FERC to clarify the rules because of confusion over whether pa=
rtial day recalls of capacity were a valid practice. The proposal would all=
ow releasing shippers to coordinate recalls of capacity release transaction=
s and renominationswith the current intra-day nomination cycle and recall r=
ights would operate according to the same timelines that now apply to inter=
ruptible transportation. The proposal also seeks to create more competition=
 for pipeline capacity with parity between scheduling release transactions =
and scheduling of pipeline interruptible service. Allowing shippers to reca=
ll capacity quickly means more capacity would be released.=20
