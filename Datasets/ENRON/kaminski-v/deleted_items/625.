RE:             Revised Agenda and Miscellaneous Logistical Information
Please find attached a revised agenda for our first EMF 20 working group meeting, Fuel Diversity, Natural Gas and North American Energy Markets, on January 22-23, 2002.
An informal reception will be held Monday evening (8-10pm) at the Hilton Houston Plaza Hotel Lounge. Continental breakfast will also be available in the meeting room starting at 8:00 am both days, and a working group dinner is planned for Tuesday at Pappasitos Cantina (6:30pm).
Also, the cut off reservation date at the Hilton Houston Plaza has been extended to Friday January 11.  If you need to reserve a room, please call the hotel directly (713)-313-4606 and mention the HOUMC EMF code. The hotel will also provide shuttle transportation to the conference site at Baker Hall.  If you will be driving to Rice University please let Susan Sweeney know (650-324-1653 email: s.sweeney@forsythe.stanford.edu) and she will have parking information for you either at the informal reception on Monday Jan. 21 or at registration.
I look forward to a productive meeting.
