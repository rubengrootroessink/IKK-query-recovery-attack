Today's focus: Gadgets a go-go

By Dave Kearns

We've talked about helpful tools and utilities lately, and a
number of readers drew my attention to The Gadget Factory. Now,
maybe I'm the last person in the world to have heard of it -
but if it is new to you too, then you need to check it out as
soon as you can.

The Gadget Factory (http://www.gadgetfactory.com) is an
Australian operation that produces shareware network utilities
for both NetWare- and Windows-based networks. All of the
Factory's products are available as evaluation copies, which
can be turned into full versions by registration (and paying a
small fee, typically US$20 or $25 for a single-user version).

As I mentioned in last week's "Useful utilities" newsletter,
I really like tools that do one thing and do it well. Gadget
Factory has a number of tools that fit that description. I
really like tools that do one thing and do it well (see:
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/netware/2001/01047621.html).


One good example is DSpace. DSpace lets network managers find
disk space usage problems quickly and easily. In a NetWare 3.x
environment, DSpace will list all the users in the Bindery,
along with how much space they are using, while in an Novell
Directory Services tree you can select any part of the tree and
DSpace will report all the users from that point down. DSpace
can be used on NetWare 5.x NSS volumes, as well as traditional
volumes.

The Factory's latest utility is NWEXPLORE, a Windows Explorer
style program designed to provide specific NetWare information
quickly and easily. It can display the total size of
directories without having to count each file and subdirectory.
Trustee assignments can be quickly and easily viewed, granted
and adjusted. Directory quotas also can be viewed and modified.

There are a half dozen other utilities that are useful to at
least some of you - such as WhoHasIt, which quickly shows you
which users have a particular file open. Check out the entire
collection. Download the evaluations and try them on your
network - I'll bet there's at least one you'll want to buy.

News flash: In a Novell NetWare newsletter that was sent
earlier this month and headlined "Is NetWare safe from would-
be hackers?" we discussed how NetWare could be open to
attacks. In this week's issue of Network World, senior editor
Deni Connor, delves deeper into this subject and details the
best practices for securing your network. You can read her
