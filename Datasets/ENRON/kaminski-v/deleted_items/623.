Today's focus: Novell picked for massive e-government project

By Dave Kearns

Just in case you missed the announcement, Novell and the
government of France released details just before Christmas of
one of the world's largest e-government projects. The Direction
G?n?rale des Imp?ts (DGI), the French version of the IRS, is
setting up a directory system that will be used by 35 million
French taxpayers.

We knew this was in the works (and tried to announce it six
months ago) but the lawyers kept arguing over which I's should
be dotted and which E's get an acute accent. Finally, though,
the story can be told and it's one that puts Novell at the very
forefront of e-government initiatives.

Previous e-government projects in the U.K. and Canada, along
with some ongoing (but lower profile) initiatives in the U.S.
(and outside of Utah) were exciting and fairly large in size.
One example is the U.K.'s Bracknell Forest e-government
initiative, which empowered over 100,000 citizens to conduct
government business through a Web browser (see "Directory takes
center stage in e-government initiative,"
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/dir/2000/0925dir1.html ).
But 35 million!

The DGI will use Novell's eDirectory, iChain and DirXML -
products that you should be using if you need to have an
extranet Web presence for customers, clients - or citizens.

On a related note, the city of Brompton, Ontario just after
Christmas announced a major buy-in to ZENWorks for Desktops (
http://www.novell.com/news/leadstories/2001/dec27/ ). The
software will be used by the city's 900-1,000 workers that have
computers. While that's not 35 million people, it is more
directly related to what most of you are dealing with on your
networks - PC and software configuration.

If you are involved in the government sector, though, there's a
new Novell "Cool Solutions" Web site just for you, at
http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/gov/index.html It already
contains a lot of interesting information but promises to be
THE place for government IT professionals to hang out. Check
out the site and let the advisory board know what you'd like to
see, or what you'd like to see changed.

My good friend Lindsey Johnstone at Novell (how would you like
to be the Novell guy in Seattle?) has promised to see that the
site responds to the needs of its users as quickly as possible.
If not, head over to the Novell Support Forums (on the Web at
http://support-forums.novell.com/category/twistercat.tpt or
http://support.novell.com/forums/scfindex.html with your
newsreader) and harass him since he's also one of the newest
Novell Support Connection volunteers - try getting that kind of
response from Microsoft!

Now there's probably nothing in these announcements that you
don't already know. There might even be relatively little at
the Cool Solutions site that's new to you. But it's all good
material to use when you're lobbying your boss and/or the bean
counters. No one wants to be the first to do something
(especially in government), but they also don't want to be the
last to adopt new or different technology. Start your own
internal marketing campaign with the fine tools Novell is
providing.
