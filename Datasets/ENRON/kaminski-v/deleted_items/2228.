Dear Vince and Mark
 
I have tried to contact you both, but with no  success. I am still very keen to go forward with the idea of an energy risk  management workshop. 
 
I was wondering whether you have had an opportunity  to discuss this whilst I was away from the office from Friday? I think that the  idea of a workshop on 'Setting up a risk management function within an energy  company', seems a good one. I am open to your ideas and to discussing the finer  points in further detail.
 
I trust that you are both still keen to participate  on this event and that we can write the workshop programme over the next few  days. If you have any questions or queries please do not hesitate to contact me,  otherwise I look forward to your response and to working with you both on GARP  2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
