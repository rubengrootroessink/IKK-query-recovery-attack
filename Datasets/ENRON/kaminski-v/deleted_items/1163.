Today's focus: Boost for enterprise Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

While the high-tech economy may still be depressed, several
large IT vendors are continuing to invest in the development
and fine-tuning of Linux for large-scale enterprise
deployments. This is good news for users.

Last month, IBM made some noise with two announcements in the
Linux development area. Big Blue, along with NEC, Hitachi and
Fujitsu, announced a new joint Linux development effort aimed
at improving the management of Linux servers by developing
tools to better diagnose operating system faults. The four
mainframe and server makers also will add support for Non-
Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) support in the Linux code, which
could lead to highly-scalable, mainframe-like Linux servers.

In a separate announcement, IBM launched its Linux Community
Development System. The program will make IBM mainframes
running virtual Linux server images available to open source
developers for code testing. Developers will be able to access
either a TurboLinux or SuSE distribution image running on an
IBM zSeries mainframe for 30, 60 or 90 days. The program's aim
is to give developers a high-powered hardware platform for
developers to create enterprise-level applications for Linux.

Also in the area of Linux application development, the Open
Source Development Lab plans to expand by opening a second site
in Tokyo, Japan. The Open Source Development Lab was started in
Portland, Ore., in December to provide Linux developers with
enterprise hardware as an application development platform.

Observers have said that since Linux was created on low-end PC
hardware, the operating system has not been scaled up to its
full potential. This is because most Linux application
developers, without access to their own personal mainframes,
use lower-powered PCs for writing and testing their code. With
large companies throwing their weight behind enterprise Linux
development, users might expect to see some interesting new
software products in the near future.
