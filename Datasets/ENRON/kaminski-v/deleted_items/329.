Kinder Morgan Moving Ahead with Advantage Pipeline
 
Gas Daily reports that Kinder Morgan is planning to go ahead with its previously announced Advantage Pipeline, which would connect the Cheyenne Hub with points in Eastern Kansas.  KM would also expand its 8 bcf storage Huntsman storage facility near Cheyenne Hub to about 14 bcf.  Advantage would be built with an initial capacity of 330 mmcfd and could be expanded to 450 per day as coalbed methane production in Wyomingincreased.  The pipe is planned to be operational by late 2004.

Westchester County, NYBattles Millennium Pipeline
  
WestchesterCounty, north of New York City, will petition the 
FERC to reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the 
530-mile Millennium pipeline from Ontarioto Mount Vernon, NY. The 
pipeline would transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York Cityand 
southern parts of the state. The county alleges that the FERC 
prematurely granted Columbia's request to build the pipeline. They 
say that Columbiadoes not have the needed state approvals to proceed 
with construction and that the company did not provide crucial 
information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally 
sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found that the 
pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the 
preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The 
commission has 30 days to respond to the county's petition. If 
denied, Westchestercan then seek a court order to block 
construction. The county has asked several state regulatory 
departments to deny future approvals and cancel existing permits 
already granted. Westchesterwill also refuse to grant Columbia
permits for construction on county land. Additionally, the county is 
questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to protect 
coastal areas from environmental damage. Federal law prohibits a 
federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the 
coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan. In 
addition, county officials have asked the governor to intervene when 
he attends a FERC conference later this month.
 
Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year 
 
The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western 
Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and 
natural gas will continue to dominate exploration activity. It 
predicts 13,386 wells will be drilled in western Canada, down from 
last year's record 18,024. Natural gas will account for 8,189, or 
61%, of its forecast well completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309 
wells to be drilled in Alberta, down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in 
Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in northeastern British Columbia, 
down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas completions last year in the 
WesternCanadaSedimentaryBasin, with another 26 natural gas wells 
drilled in the East Coast offshore.
