Today's focus: Putting a lid on the penguin

By Phil Hochmuth

Since you can't have enough security these days, Linux users
may want to check out LIDS, an open source tool for locking
down their Linux-based file and Web servers.

The LIDS (Linux Intrusion Detection System) Project is an open
source development effort that has spawned some code that could
be useful in protecting Linux file systems from hackers and
keeping critical Linux applications from being compromised.

According to its creators, LIDS can be used to protect a Linux
server from attacks such as "buffer overflow" and "string
format" attacks, which are used to disrupt a Linux system's
software with a barrage of requests and gain access to the
server's system files or applications.

LIDS is a patch for Linux kernel v. 2.4.14 or earlier, and adds
security features such as access control lists, which bolster
existing Linux control mechanisms for authenticating users to a
system. It is also designed to protect files and processes from
being changed or deleted, even by users with "root" or
administrative level access to a Linux system.

LIDS adds a port scanner detector to a Linux kernel, which can
be configured to detect intruders by identifying patterns of
activity on certain server ports, such as port 80 (HTTP), and
notifying an administrator of such events. The system also can
keep a log file of rule violations and other unauthorized
access attempts on server resources. An administration tool
included in the LIDS software is used to set system rules and
to designate what files and processes to protect.
