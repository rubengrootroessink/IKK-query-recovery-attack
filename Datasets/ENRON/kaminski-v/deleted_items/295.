Hi Vince

I didn't know when the Research Group was being disbanded, though it was
clearly going to happen soon.  (I seem to recall it was hard enough
justifying the Group's existence when times were good.)

I'm due to visit Houston to speak at an IQPC conference in April.  Perhaps
we can meet up?

All the best,
Steve

Steve,

As you perhaps know, the Research Group has been disbanded
last Tuesday. My last day is Jan 31.

I shall go through the literature search during the weekend and
will send you a few hints.

Vince
