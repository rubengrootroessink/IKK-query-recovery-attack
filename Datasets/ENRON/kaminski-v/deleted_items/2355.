I need to coordinate our order for SAS and SPSS both renewals and new
orders.  These are on a university license and each one costs about $80 per
license.  The charge will be passed on to your research account.

Those of you with existing SAS installations, your version will keep
working until December.  At that time it will stop working unless renewed.

SPSS is coming out with a version 11 and I have asked Mudd to let me know
when that is available.

If you 1) need either of these packages now for a fresh installation or 2)
plan on renewing the software that you currently have installed, please let
me know.
