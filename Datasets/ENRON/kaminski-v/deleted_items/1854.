Dear Vince
 
I am writing concerning the GARP 2002  Convention, which will be held in New York on 11 - 14 February  2002.
 
I am writing concerning the developments within  Enron. I do hope that there has not been too much of a negative impact on  yourself. I would also like to enquire whether the events at Enron would impact  on your participation at the GARP 2002 Convention?
 
I look forward to your response and wish you a  happy Thanks Giving in the meantime.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
