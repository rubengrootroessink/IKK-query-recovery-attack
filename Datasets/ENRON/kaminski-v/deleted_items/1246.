Vince:  Just wondering if you had any information concerning Giuseppe.   We had sent him an offer letter on 4/26/01, but have not heard back from him at all, nor has he returned the signed offer.   I have sent him several emails at his Stanford email address, but have not received a reply.    Any suggestions or information?

Thanks for your help.

Molly
