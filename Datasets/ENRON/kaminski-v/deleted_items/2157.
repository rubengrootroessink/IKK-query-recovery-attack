Mike,

I sent an inquiry to RISK. The problem is that they lost
16 people in the terrorist attack on WTC and the names
haven't been released. The chances are I sent a message
to a person who is swamped with work or will not respond at all.

We have to wait a few days.

Vince - 

	Joe Hirl mentioned this morning that "the risk book" that Enron wrote will be published in Japanese in the near future.  Can you tell me who would kinow the publication details so that we can try to use it in suport of our publicity efforts for Enron in Japan?

Thanks,

Mike
