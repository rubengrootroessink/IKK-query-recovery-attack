Vince,

Jo's number in Omaha is 402-398-7707.  Per our discussions, I did meet with Vernon Mercaldo and Sean Bolks yesterday to discuss the options needs of Northern Natural Gas (at the request of Jo).  They are interested in developing about 6 different models w/ varying degrees of complexity.  I am currently in the process of expeditiously figuring out C++ and the associated linkage to Excel for final model development.  I did speak with Krishna this morning w/regard to their needs and he seems more than willing to help in this area.

Nelson
