Dear Kent:
	I spoke to Vince about Research support for Pipelines following our conversation on last Thursday. He said that we don't have another group that requires only 50% FTE suppport to split a person between Pipelines and that group. However, we will try to support you folks by reassigning resources within Research, to the extent possible, when there is work on the optimization project for the rest of the year. Also, for the support on the options side, we have one candidate scheduled to come for interviews this Friday. I am hopeful about this guy as he has background in optimization and some knowledge on derivatives.

Thanks,
Krishna.
