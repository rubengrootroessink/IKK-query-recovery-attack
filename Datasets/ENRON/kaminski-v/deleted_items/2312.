privileges. Download the proper fix from:

vulnerability has been withdrawn after users who installed it
complained that it caused their systems to malfunction.

Computerworld, 10/19/01

Microsoft alert:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-052.asp


* IE screen spoofing possible

Georgi Guninski has discovered a flaw in the way Internet
Explorer uses JavaScript that could be used to trick an
unsuspecting user into executing malicious code. Using
JavaScript, it is possible to have IE take over the whole
screen. A user box could be popped up with an innocuous message
that can be redirected to a malicious site. For more on this,
go to:
http://www.guninski.com/popspoof.html


* Conectiva, Engarde update Apache

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache, the open
source Web server software. The flaws could be exploited to
view information that is normally not accessible to general Web
users. Download the appropriate update from:

Engarde:
ftp://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/
http://ftp.engardelinux.org/pub/engarde/stable/updates/

Conectiva:

* DoS vulnerability in Oracle Web Cache

DefCom Labs is reporting a denial-of-service vulnerability in
Oracle9iAS Web Cache Version 2.0.0.1.0. Attackers can exploit a
buffer overflow that occurs when long URL requests are sent to
the affected server. Patches can be downloaded from Oracle's
site at:
http://metalink.oracle.com


* New openssh packages available

A couple of security flaws have been discovered in the openssh
packages for Linux. These flaws could be exploited to bypass
openssh's key-based security system. Download the appropriate

* Red Hat releases new util-linux packages

According to a Red Hat alert, new util-linux packages are
available that fix a problem with /bin/login's
PAM implementation. This could, in some non-default setups,
cause users to receive credentials of other users. It is
recommended that all users update to the fixed packages.
http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2001-132.html


* New Red Hat squid packages available

Today's roundup of virus alerts:


* Red Cross warns of Trojan horse that steals credit card data

The American Red Cross is warning people of a credit card-
stealing Trojan horse program sent via e-mail that looks like
it comes from the disaster-relief organization.
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2001/1019redcross.html
Computerworld, 10/19/01

* W32/Redesi-A - A Windows virus that comes with different
subject lines and one of the following attachments: redo.exe,
si.exe, common.exe, userconf.exe or disk.exe. It spreads via
Outlook and displays an error message when it executes.
(Sophos)

* W32/Redesi-B - Similar to its cousin noted above, this
Outlook-borne message spreads via e-mails with different
subjects but a body that looks like a Microsoft security alert
forwarded by friends. On Nov. 11, the virus adds a line to the
autoexec.bat file that attempts to format the hard drive when
the infected machine is rebooted. (Sophos)

* WM97/Myna-AY - A Word macro virus with no malicious payload.
(Sophos)

* WM97/Myna-BA - Another Word macro virus with no malicious
payload. (Sophos)

* W32/Hai - This network-aware virus spreads to any attached
drive and places itself in the \Windows directory with a random
name. It then sets itself to run in the win.ini file each time
the infected machine is started. (Sophos)

* Worm/Dnet_Winit - A virus that spreads by searching random
TCP/IP addresses looking for a potential host. When it finds
one, it places a file called WININIT.EXE in the Windows\System
directory. (Panda Software)

* Backdoor/SecretService - A type of Trojan horse program that
comes in two pieces, a client and server. The infected machine
can be shutdown or rebooted remotely, used to send messages and
passwords can be stolen. (Panda Software)

* Keyboard_Bug Family - An MS-DOS virus that infects keyboard
buffer, adding junk characters to text. (Panda Software)


>From the interesting reading department:


* Users put early anti-DDoS tools to test

Mazu Networks, one of several young companies with products
designed to combat distributed denial-of-service attacks, this
week will make its new traffic-filtering appliance generally
available. Even more impressive, the company is touting the
first two enterprise network customers to publicly declare
their willingness to spend money on such a product.
