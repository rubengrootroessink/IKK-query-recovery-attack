Hi Vince,

How are you?

I'm doing well at the new job.

I heard the news from Shirley. It's something we expected but
confirmation of the expectation seemed like ultimatum, which is sad.
As I mentioned before, I would like to have a lunch with you and listen
some career advice from you sometime this week or any time at your
convenience.  Is it O.K. with you?

Sincerely,

Jaesoo
