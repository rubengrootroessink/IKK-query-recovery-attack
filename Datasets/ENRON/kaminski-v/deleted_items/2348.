Today's focus: Yellow Dog has new litter

By Phil Hochmuth

PowerPC Linux users will be happy to know that the latest
version of Yellow Dog Linux was released last week, with
support for the latest Linux kernel, plus improved installation
and admin tools.

The biggest news in Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) 2.1 is that it now
supports Linux kernel version 2.4. This gives the system
improvements such as better USB hardware support, Ext3
journaling file system for improved data recovery in the event
of crashes, and support for more processors.

The latest version of YDL includes a new installer program
which allows users to select what application packages they
want to go into their system on installation (more than 900
applications in dozens of packages are available, such as
office productivity, graphics and code development tools).

Another set-up tool, called "Mac-on-Linux" can be used to set
up dual-boot Linux/Mac operating system PCs, by grabbing a ROM
image from a system's Mac operating system. This lets users
sets aside their entire Macintosh system for dual-boot
purposes, instead of having to reconfigure their Mac systems
once a dual-boot Linux/Mac PC is installed.

YDL 2.1 includes new features for Linux/Apple Macintosh laptop
users, such as sound support for Apple Ibook 1 and iBook 2
notebook computers. The software can now handle system
"sleep" support on all Apple PowerBooks and iBooks.

For some users with old Macintosh servers and workstations, YDL
has been a savior, allowing them to put small Linux-based
servers running on Apple hardware. YDL version 2.1 is available
now.
