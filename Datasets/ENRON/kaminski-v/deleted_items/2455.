Vince:

Therese is involved with the "Enron Kids" (where you adopt a child for
Christmas and spend $175.00 on them).  Do you think the group would
be interested in sponsoring a couple of kids?  If we adopt 2 children
(say a boy and a girl) at $175.00 each we would only need approximately
$6.00 from each person.  If we adopted 3 kids (525.00) we would need
approximately 10.00 per person.  What do you think?
