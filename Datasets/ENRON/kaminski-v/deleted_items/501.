I have attached the final agenda for the EMF meeting next week.  All times remain the same.  The new agenda lists for each session a few speakers, who will make some comments to help stimulate the group's discussion.   The first session will focus upon key issues that we would like to learn more about.  The second session focuses more on what we have learned about gas supply and infrastructure, while the third session focuses more on gas markets and ties to electricity.    
I am looking forward to an interesting and productive meeting.
Hill
