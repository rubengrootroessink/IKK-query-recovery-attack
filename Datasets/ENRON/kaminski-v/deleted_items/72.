Financial Times  Rankings 2002   
Jones School: The  Best in Texas! 
The Financial  Times released its 2002 rankings of the world's hundred  best business schools on January 21, 2002. Rice's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School  of Management is the highest ranked business school in Texas and in the region.  The Jones School is steadily climbing in the rankings. Our overall ranking is  24th in the U.S. (56 U.S. schools), compared to a ranking of 35 (of 51 U.S.  schools) in 2001. Our 2002 world ranking is 38, compared to 55 last year.
The Financial  Times uses 22 categories to determine the rankings. The rank of a school  is determined by its performance in three broad areas: the career progression  accrued from the MBA-particularly its purchasing power in the marketplace (55  %); diversity of experience (20%), and the schools research qualities (25%).
