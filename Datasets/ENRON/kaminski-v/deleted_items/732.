ion:   Thaw underway for the short term. Longer range models continue to in=
sist (as I continue to resist) that real arctic air arrives later in the mo=
nth.  There is some potential for yet another winter storm in the East late=
 in the five day period. The point in question is how much cold air is avai=
lable or is it just another cold rain for many folks. That will be answered=
 later in the week. The overall pattern definitely looks warmer for now tho=
ugh some of this energy goes into melting snow cover rather than warming th=
e air. The absence of snow in the Plains is one reason why they are so much=
 warmer relative to normal than areas farther East. But, most of the countr=
y goes warmer than normal before the end of the week. The last to catch on =
to this trend is the Southeast.      Tomorrow: Wednesday, January  9, 2002 =

 Used Within the Volatility Matrix    Day 6-10 Discussion:  I am not as bul=
lish as the charts (and some forecasters) in regards to cold air developing=
 in the medium range period and beyond. I am not saying next week and the w=
eek after will not be colder than this week, they likely will be. But, I co=
ntinue to have questions as to intensity and Southern extent of whatever de=
velops. First, we have yet to see any real polar flow so far this winter. S=
econd, lack of deep snow cover in the Northern U.S. tends to inhibit bitter=
 cold. Third, and perhaps most important to me is the lack of high surface =
pressures developing over Canada. Now, they may develop eventually, but I w=
ant to see it first. Finally, most models have more of a West to East confi=
guration at the jet stream level rather than a NW to SE orientation straigh=
t out of the arctic. Given these conditions and recent history I! am just n=
ot ready yet to pronounce any major cold developing. In fact, I would expec=
t the Gulf Coast and SE to actually run warmer than normal through the 20't=
h of the month. The Plains, Lakes and NE probably go back to below normal l=
evels, but not excessively so. It looks comparable to the past couple of we=
eks. The West is expected to take on a temperature profile that closely res=
embles normal Mid-January levels.     Day 6: Sunday, January 13, 2002  Clic=
