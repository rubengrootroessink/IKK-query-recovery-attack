Dear V ,

As a reader of Reactions, the financial magazine for the global insurance market, we believe that you will find the following event of real interest and of great importance.

Building on the success of last year's inaugural event, Euromoney Seminars has once again brought together an outstanding international panel of highly-acclaimed experts in the weather derivatives
sector to discuss the latest developments in this exciting new market.

In just two days, the 2nd annual conference on Weather Derivatives and Risk Management (22-23 April) will provide you with cutting edge knowledge on how to protect your company from earnings
volatility due to unseasonable weather. It will also provide knowledge on how to minimise commercial exposure and secure financial success, as well as information on what hedging tools exist and which
one is right for you. You will also hear real-life case studies and receive expert advice from key players in weather risk management.
