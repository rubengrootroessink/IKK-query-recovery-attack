		What's New at ERisk.com - 11 January 2002	


		
Weekly Review	In this week's round-up   of economic, banking and insurance industry news from an enterprise risk  management perspective: Argentina devalues, and the banking sector counts  the cost; the Enron plot thickens; Merrill Lynch cuts staff and takes a  $2.2 billion restructuring charge; there's a change of management at American  Re; California refuses to allow terror cover exclusions.	
Analysis 	 The  prospects for the growth of alternative risk transfer (ART) have never  been better, many insurance industry experts believe. And credit  insurance , in turn, has been touted as potentially the fastest-growing  area of ART. But will the rise in defaults and credit downgrades discourage  reinsurers from writing new credit protection, or is credit insurance  still a profitable business to be in? 	
Viewpoint	Can  psychological profiling be used to freeze criminals out of the banking system?  The developers of new product Risk Values believe so, and in our current  Q?   they argue that focusing on the motivation of bank customers is an inherently  better approach than traditional transaction monitoring.  Still available:  Our CRO  Profile  of Enrique Mejorada, head of risk control at energy firm Calpine.  	
Reflections on Risk	As  part of our review of 2001, we invited a group of bank risk managers to  tell us about the major issues that concerned them last year. Read this  special  feature  by ERisk's Duncan Wood, including contributions from risk managers  at CSFB, Lloyds TSB, KeyCorp and CIBC.	
Events Calendar	Our featured event   for January is IIR's Best  Practice in Capital Allocation , a three-day conference that promises  to cover capital from a strategic perspective, and features speakers from  AON, Rabobank, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch. Other events in January  include conferences and seminars on modelling credit risk in emerging markets,  weather risk, collateral management and operational risk. Plus, details  of other risk management events taking place throughout 2002.
