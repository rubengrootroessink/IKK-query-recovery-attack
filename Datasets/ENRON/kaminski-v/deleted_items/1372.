A couple of months ago you agreed to serve on a panel on real options that Rita McGrath at Columbia had assembled.
We have been informed that you have not registered for the conference - in SFO October 21 to 24
Can you please register - they are getting antsy about it.  Go to sms@mgmt.purdue.edu
When are you due at Wharton again?
