Today's focus: Be VigilEnt on Linux

By Phil Hochmuth

Network administrators who have multiple Linux instances
running on IBM's iServer hardware might want to try out
VigilEnt Secure Agent, a new security tool specifically built
for this IBM hardware/software combo.

IBM's xServer iSeries is based on the familiar AS/400 hardware
platform, but has been modified to run up to 31 "instances" of
Linux, or Linux partitions. The VigilEnt security software,
made by Houston-based PentaSafe, works with SuSE Linux
partitions on IBM's eServer iSeries midrange machines.

The software can be used to run system security audits on a
Linux partition to account for potential misconfigurations or
"back doors" that may be present on a Linux partition. Such
lapses could allow data to be seen by users who do not have
access to a particular partition, or leave a Linux partition
open to an external hacker.

The software can lock certain files, such as system
configuration files, on a Linux partition from use. The agent
can also be installed across multiple Linux partitions and used
to synchronize security settings and produce audit reports for
multiple Linux instances on one iServer.

Running multiple Linux instances on a single IBM iSeries could
help businesses consolidate the number of servers deployed in a
network, according to IBM. Such a setup could have separate
Linux partitions running e-mail, application, database and file
storage servers on one machine, which would appear as four
separate servers to clients on a network.
