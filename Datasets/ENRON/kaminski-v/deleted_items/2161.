I have broken both ankles twice in sports accidents but the worst was when =
I tore ligaments. It required a cast and took forever to recover. I will be=
t I have arthritis some day in one of the ankles. Ironically, most of the s=
oft tissue damage, which takes so long to heal, is not caused by the accide=
nt per se but by the swelling afterwards which damages the tissue. That's w=
hy immediate ice is so important. Sorry about the medical lecture, but I ha=
ve been there and when I read your note memories returned. The trick now is=
 to get good circulation in the area of eth injury to remove the fluids et =
al. Ouch! Hope it's a quick recovery.

Thanks for keeping me on the list. I enjoy and use your reports. Have you e=
ver seen anything that tracks US investment in gas infrastructure? When you=
're more mobile, let's have lunch. Thanks again

endons and ligaments.  I feel bad that I was unable to respond to your last=
 request, I will have you added to our distribution list with pleasure.  Pl=
ease keep in touch.
