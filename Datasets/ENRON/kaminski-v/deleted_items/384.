Dear Mr. Kamiski,
I am working on the attendee list
for EMF's working group meeting next
week. We usually distribute to all
participants a listing that includes
everyone's contact information (address/
phone/fax/email) and I don't have that
information from you.  If you would like
to be included in this listing, please
provide the above information as soon
as possible.
Thank you,
Edith Leni
