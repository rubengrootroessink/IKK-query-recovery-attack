Vince:

Thanks for the response back.  I didn't want to bother you at work with my
request.  Like many other ex-Enron employees, I'm aggressively looking for a
job.  I was hoping you would be willing to let me use your name as a business
reference in my job search.  You are one of the few clients I've continuously
supported throughout my tenure at Enron, and hopefully would be willing to
validate my abilities as a senior HR professional.  I've attached my resume
for your reference.  If you don't feel comfortable doing this, please let me
know by return email.  Vince, thanks for your ongoing support throughout the
last four years.  I wish you and your family the best throughout the holiday
season and in the future.

Best regards,

Cindy Skinner
