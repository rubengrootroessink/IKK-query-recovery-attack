Vince:

I can't thank you enough for your help.  I supported your group as an HR
generalist from February 1998 through year end 1999 when I transitioned it to
Sheila Walton and her team.  As you may recall, I also served as Sheila's
backup (until December 2001) for more senior level work in your group, i.e.,
conducting your PRC meeting.

Thanks again.  Hope you are doing well in spite of the turmoil.

Best regards,

Cindy Skinner
