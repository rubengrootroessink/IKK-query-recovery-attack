This notice has just been received from the Houston Post Office.


Due to current operating conditions and government security measures,
Express Mail destined for federal government agencies in Washington, DC
(ZIP Codes 202 through 205), are experiencing significant delays.
Therefore, effective immediately, Express Mail service to Washington, DC,
ZIP Codes 202 through 205, is temporarily suspended.  Until the suspension
is lifted, mailers should use First-Class Mail for mail destined for these
ZIP Codes.

I'll advise you when the suspension is lifted.
