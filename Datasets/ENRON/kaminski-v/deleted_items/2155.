Hello H?lyette, 
I am in Brazil for the next few days. I should be back in the office on Thursday and I shall try to call you in the early afternoon, my time, to discuss the workshop. 
I shall also check with Sandeep on the progress of the purchase. I would like to close the deal in 2001 (for budgetary reasons). 
Vince
