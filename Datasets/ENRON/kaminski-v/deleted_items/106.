As I indicated at the EMF 20 meeting, we have an opportunity to hold our next working group meeting at Stanford on June 24-25 (Mo-Tu) or June 25-26.  Please respond back to me by February 1 with any conflicts.
I know that a few members may be attending the IAEE meetings in Scotland.  
There are flight connections that would leave SF Tuesday evening and allow one to arrive in Aberdeen on Wednesday evening in time for the International Association for Energy Economics meeting, June 27-29 (Th-Sa).  While that may be more traveling than one wants to do, this means that it is technically possible to attend both meetings if we can reserve the first two days.  
On another issue, if you presented at the meeting, please pass along your slides to me.  
In addition, please pass along a brief bio if you have not done so.  I currently have bios from those individuals listed in the attached "rtf" file.  
Thank you.
