Good Morning,
 
Nat. Gas opened about halfway down the bullish  candle of yesterday. This is not the confirmation that would be expected to  confirm the Bullish Engulfing signal. A close today below the close of yesterday  would indicate that if the trend is up, it will be weak. If todays close is near  the opening price or below, watch for further weakness.
 
Steve
