Shane Green will be transferring from Research and joining Gas Structuring.  I have spoken with Krishna and he is fine with a transfer date of 11/ 1, or sooner, contingent on Shane properly transferring his Research related responsibilities to others in Research.  Please do whatever is necessary to get him transferred.  He does not need to move to 14, but can shadow at my desk or others on 14 until we move to ECS.  I want him in desk #442 on the 5th floor after we move.  Please coordinate with the move team to add him to our move on 11/9-10.  He will be under my EES/EWS cost center.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Thanks,
Ed
