Today's focus: Send Novell your support

By Dave Kearns

Gathering information about Novell's changes in the aftermath of its
recently announced poor second quarter financial results, was like
covering a war zone. E-mails and phone messages kept coming in from
'the front' - other journalists, Novell employees, recent
ex-employees, as well as interested bystanders such as company
stockholders, spouses and significant others.

First there were reports that all Novell employees in San Jose were
fired and the buildings sold. But some reflection showed that CEO
Eric Schmidt and CFO Dennis Rainey were a) still with the company and
b) still in San Jose, so that wasn't true.

Then there were reports that "hit men" were spotted flying out of
Salt Lake City to Novell offices worldwide with orders to close them
down. I even heard that the entire NetWare development team was let
go.

As it turned out, none of those reports was completely true, or
completely false. The workforce at San Jose was cut back
dramatically, but the office is still there. NetWare's product team
is still intact, although the Border Manager team was heavily cut.
Some non-U.S. offices, in the Pacific region for example, were hit
hard, while Europe suffered little or no personnel loss. It does
appear, though, that the on-again, off-again, back-on-again DigitalMe
initiative is off for good.

Besides the folks who were shown the door last week, there are others
who have been given notice that they will be laid off in either four
weeks' or six months' time, as projects and contracts are wrapped up.
The dust has yet to settle.

But while it was exhilarating to watch at the time, on reflection
it's rather sad. Some people with whom I should have spoken to more
often to tell them how much I appreciated their work are now gone.

This is a good time for you to talk to the people you rely on at
Novell for information, product and support. Let them know how much
you depend on them. Find out who their manager is and send out
letters or e-mails of commendation. Let Novell's management know
where your priorities lie, name the people who have supported you
best and what you expect from the company you've been loyal to all
these years.
