Dear Vince
 
Forgot to mention in my last e-mail about your  topic session within the body of the Convention on. Please expand on the present  title of 'Measuring energy risk' and send with it 4 or 5 bullet points, along  with how you would like you name, job title and company name to appear on the  programme.
 
I look forward to your response in due  course.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
