Updated GDS and Documentation Now Available
 
You can now download the latest, corrected version of the GDS Graphical Display System in either Access 97 or Access 2000 format plus the updated documentation file from the GPCM website.
 
If you have not licensed GDS yet, but would like to see what its capabilities are, please contact me and I'll send you the documentation file in Word.  It gives you screen shots of each of the different functions plus a full description of how it is used.
