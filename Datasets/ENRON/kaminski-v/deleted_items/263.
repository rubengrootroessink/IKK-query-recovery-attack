Hi Vince,
I hope everything is going well.  There is a position for a heavy quant
that has worked in the power trading group and has experience in
derivatives and structuring. The job is located in NY. I was wondering if
you know anybody that would be interested.  They can contact Matt Crouse at
713-345-9811 or matthew.crouse@newpower.com for more information.

Thanks
Alex
