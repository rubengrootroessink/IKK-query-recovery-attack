Hi Vince,

Just FYI, I'll be at Wharton Monday afternoon to meet with Tom Piazze and Donna Piazze, Monday evening for recruiting reception and then Tuesday to help interview.  I arranged to meet Monday with Tom Piazze at 3pm and Donna Piazze at 4pm.  Do you want to be included by telephone for the 3 and 4 pm meetings??  If you'd like, we can call your office from Tom Piazze's office.

Let me know and travel safely!!

Best regards!

--Christie.
