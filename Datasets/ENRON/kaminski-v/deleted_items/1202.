Hi,

	Attached is a draft of the Enron Credit Strategic Plan.  I meant forward this to you last nite when I sent it to VInce.  But in my haste to make it to a party that I was already 3 hours late for I forgot to do so.

	Your comments and feedback are greatly appreciated.  

Thanks,
Iris

Hi,

	Attached is a more recent draft of the "Enron Credit Strategic Plan".  Your comments and feed back are most welcomed.  Please feel free to rip it apart, etc.  

	In addition to ensuring that this document is technically correct, I would also like to ensure that it is politically correct - especially since the London guys are so anxious to see it.  I am amazed at the level of interest in this document.  

	The passwords for this document are:
		rottenfish1
		rottenfish2.

	Finally, I recall on Friday your stating that you wanted to have a luncheon meeting on Monday.  I was wondering if this meeting could be postponed until Tuesday or later.  I have to go home at lunch to sign for my UPS delivery of my "Click@Home" PC.  I hope this is not a big inconvenience.


Thanks,
Iris
