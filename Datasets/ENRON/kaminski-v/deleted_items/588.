Electric infrastructure is vulnerable to disruption, however, until recently the idea of national infrastructure security was not meaningful to bottom-line focused executives in the power industry. The threat and scope of malicious and purposeful disruption today is much greater than that of natural disasters. Power companies will have to revise their day-to-day business procedures including risk management, operations, security and finance, as after all, there is no substitute for electricity. 
 This conference will give senior executives throughout the electric power industry the chance to educate and inform themselves on these topics of national importance. 
A Faculty of international experts in the field of energy risk management and security will share their on-depth knowledge and experience with conference attendees.
