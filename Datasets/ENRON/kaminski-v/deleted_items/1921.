h.
Born in Monticello, Mississippi, Secretary Paige is the son of public schoo=
l educators.  He earned a bachelor's degree from Jackson State University i=
n Mississippi and a Master's degree and a doctorate from Indiana University=
.  Although Secretary Paige first distinguished himself coaching college-le=
vel athletics, he has always been committed to public education and the pre=
paration of teachers to excel in their profession.  He served for a decade =
as Dean of the College of Education at Texas Southern University.  He also =
established the university's Center for Excellence in Urban Education, a re=
search facility that concentrates on issues related to instruction and mana=
gement in urban school systems.
As a trustee and an officer of the Board of Education of the Houston Indepe=
ndent School District (HISD) from 1989 to 1994, Secretary Paige coauthored =
the board's A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions, a statement of purpose an=
d goals for the school district that called for fundamental reform through =
decentralization, a focus on instruction, accountability at all levels, and=
 development of a core curriculum.  A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions wa=
s the catalyst that launched an ongoing, comprehensive restructuring of HIS=
D.
Secretary Paige became the superintendent of schools of HISD in 1994.  As s=
uperintendent, Secretary Paige created the Peer Examination, Evaluation, an=
d Redesign (PEER) program, which solicits recommendations from business and=
 community professionals for strengthening school support services and prog=
rams.  He launched a system of charter schools that have broad authority in=
 decisions regarding staffing, textbooks, and materials.  He saw to it that=
 HISD paid teachers salaries competitive with those offered by other large =
Texas school districts.  Secretary Paige made HISD the first school distric=
t in the state to institute performance contracts modeled on those in the p=
rivate sector, whereby senior staff members continued employment with HISD =
based on their performance.  He also introduced teacher incentive pay, whic=
h rewards teachers for outstanding performance and creative solutions to ed=
ucational problems.  If Secretary Paige's past is any indication, the best =
is yet to come.  We invite you and your colleagues to hear Dr. Paige, a ded=
icated Houstonian, to The Houston Club on December 13.
