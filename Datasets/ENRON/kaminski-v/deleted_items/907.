Vince:

Al said he thought you had mistakenly called our house a few minutes ago.  I was in with Anne from 2:15 to 3:00.  It is now 3:20 PM and Krishna said I could leave.  If you need to talk with me, please call me at home around 4:00 PM  or call me now on my cell phone - 832-721-2921.  Sorry I missed your call, please let me know if you need me to do something.  Happy Holidays.
