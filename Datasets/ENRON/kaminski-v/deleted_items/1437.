Dear Colleague,
In response to the astounding number of inquiries I have received in the past several weeks, I am pleased to confirm IIR's seminar on Monday, June 25th in Washington, D.C.WNP, Crucial Testing & Implementation Issues  This one-day WNP seminar will begin with a brief breakfast overview of WNP for those who would like to be brought up to speed, followed by four in-depth interactive workshops presenting solutions to your specific NPAC testing, Inter-carrier testing and WNP implementation challenges. To wrap up the seminar, we have organized a special cocktail reception where you will be able to network with your colleagues and pursue issues tackled during the day in a more informal environment.
IIR is aware that, while you have a pressing need for WNP information, you must also keep T&E expenditures at a minimum. To assist you in this regard, IIR is pleased to offer a special discounted rate of $995 if your registration is received by June 08, 2001! Space has already begun to fill up for this seminar, so please book early to ensure that your place is reserved.Program agenda Register
