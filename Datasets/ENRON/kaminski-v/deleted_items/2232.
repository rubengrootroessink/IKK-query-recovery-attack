Vince,

Steve Leppard suggested that I contact you about the possibility of a position in Houston. I worked as an analyst under Steve in London's Metal Analytics group. I was planning on returning to the States before they announced the redundancies in Europe, and the redundancy program made a move back to Houston all the more appealing. I am a first-year analyst with a statistics background, and I would be very interested in working for Enron in Houston. 

Steve has told me that he would be happy to give me a recommendation. If you know of a position which might be suitable, I would be very happy to speak to you at your convenience.

Thank you in advance for your consideration. 

Ted Barlow
