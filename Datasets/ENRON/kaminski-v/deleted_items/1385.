Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? Hope you had a good weekend. I want to say "Thank you" for taking time doing my PRC review, I really appreciate it!

Have Wharton summer interns already started working? Please let me know if you need any help accommodating them. I would be more than happy to help.

I really had a good time working in Research Group, now I kind of miss the time there. Many thanks for your support and valuable guidance!

All the Best!
