Hi Zimin,

This key should be installed on your FEA license server.

Server code: 30784/8254654498510533729072764
Expiration date: Fri Jun 22 23:59:59 2001 (22.32 days from now.)
Key: 7218 2803 2744 2904 4151 1632 9

If you currently do not have any FEA software installed on your PC, install
any FEA product on your PC and select 'product purchase' and 'use license
server from my network'.

The attached zipped file contains a template, the Excel add-in and
documentation.  After the key has been installed, simply open the template
and double click on the energy32_5.xll to activate the program.

Feel free to contact me with any comments or questions.

Best,

Sue
