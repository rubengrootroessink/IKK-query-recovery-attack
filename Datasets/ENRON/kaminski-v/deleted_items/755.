Contract Review Panel,
Tafawa Balewa Square,
Lagos, Nigeria.

SOLICITING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN AN URGENT
BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

We write to solicit your assistance in an urgent
business transaction which we hope to execute undercondition of strict confidentiality.

You were recommended by an official of the Nigeria-American
Chambers of Commerce who assured us in confidence of
your capability and reliability in the execution of a
transaction of this magnitude that required maximum
confidence and trust.We are indeed top government
functionaries and current members of the CONTRACT
REVIEW PANEL which was set up by the present
administration, to among others carry out a
comprehensive review of all contracts that were
awarded
between 1990-1999.

In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we
discovered a mouth watery sum of US$31.8m (Thirty one
million, eight hundred thousand dollars), which is
presently lying idle in a suspense account with our
apex bank and not tied to any project. When we
submitted our final report early this year, we
deliberately refused to reflect this amount in our
report because of our inordinate desire to make a
fortune for ourselves by transfering  the entire sum
to a foreign country so that we can benefit from
it. This sum on application, is ready to be
transferred into the account of any foreign partner of
our choice who is willing and prepared to assist us.
We cannot acheive this objective alone because as
civil servants, we are barred from operating
foreign account.

At the moment, we are interested in the importation of
goods into our country with these funds which are
presently trapped in this suspense account in Nigeria.
In order to commence business, we solicit your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account,
the said trapped funds. The source of this fund has
been traced to an over invoiced contract by the then
military officers when they were in power but could
not effect the transfer of this fund to their cronies
account in Switzerland before they quit the political
arena in 1999. Now that we are face with this rare
opportunity, we have no option than to capitalize on
it and lay claim to this funds together with a
foreign partner.
This is were you come in. Our desire is to transfer
this sum into your account and fly down to meet with
you much later so that we can collect our share. We
Have agreed in principle to share the funds as
follows: 30% will be for you for your assistance, 60%
comes to us as the initiators of this noble dream and
idea, while the balance 10% has been set aside to take
care of unforeseen expenses while this transaction
last. All modality for the smooth transfer of this
fund has been worked out and it met all legal and
administrative requirement in Nigeria as applicable to
foreign contractors payment in the past.If you agree
to assist us, within a period of two weeks or 10
working days, this fund would have been transferred
and confirmed in your account.

Please indicate your willingness if you agreed to our
Proposal by contacting the me on my email address or
call me on my
personal cell phone  for
more information and clarification. If on the other
hand you decline our offer, fine. We would still
appreciate if you could inform us to enable us search
for another personality to assist us.

Thanks
Your sincerely,
John DUKE.[Secretary; Contract Review Panel]
