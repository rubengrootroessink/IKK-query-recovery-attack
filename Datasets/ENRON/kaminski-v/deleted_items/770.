RE:		Hotel Reservation Reminder

This is to remind you that MONDAY JANUARY 7, is the cut off date to reserve a room at the Hilton Houston Plaza Hotel to attend our EMF 20 meeting on fuel diversity, natural gas and North American energy markets.  If you plan on attending our first EMF 20 Working Group Meeting please call the Hilton Houston Plaza Hotel (713-313-4606) or send an e-mail to jennifer_mikail@hilton.com.  Please be sure to identify yourself as a participant of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum and mention the city/group codes: HOUMC-EMF. After Monday, January 7, 2002 all rooms will be on a space available basis.

Also, if you haven't already done so, please return the attached EMF's response form at your earliest convenience.

We appreciate your help.
Thank you.
