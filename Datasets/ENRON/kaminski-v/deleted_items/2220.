Today's Focus: Whitepaper Download

By Christopher Cormier

Welcome to this week's edition of Whitepaper Downloads.  Today
we have two new whitepapers for you to look through.  Leading
off is a whitepaper from Ultra DNS.  In this Aberdeen
executive whitepaper the issues relating to the Domain Name
System (DNS) are analyzed.  This whitepaper walks you through
an overview of the Domain Name System into the benefits of
outsourcing DNS management.  Secondly we have a whitepaper from
Equilibrium.  In this whitepaper Equilibrium focuses on next
generation e-merchandising.  Equilibrium looks at the changing
economy and the projected increase in consumer buying from
physical to virtual.  As the economy evolves Equilibrium
demonstrates how their MediaRich Publishing Platform may give
you the edge in e-merchandising.


Ultra DNS
Outsourced DNS Management: A New Service For Improving Web Site
Reliability

According to Keynote Systems 29% of connection errors are
related to DNS.  Also Keynote systems observes, DNS-related
errors are the second most frequent reason for failed Internet
connections.  Despite the percentage of DSN-related errors and
research supporting significantly improved customer
satisfaction by raising DNS' profile, typically management of
DNS is limited.  By reading this whitepaper you will learn how
many of these problems could be averted by outsourcing DNS
management.  To see how outsorcing DNS management may benefit
you click the link below. http://nww1.com/go/ultra_dns.html


Equilibrium
Equilibrium Delivers Next-Generation e-Merchandising Technology
(Available in both .HTML and .PDF formats)

Effective merchandising is just as competitive in the physical
economy as it is in the E-Business economy.  Although
competition thrives in both, the same rules do not apply.
Equilibrium suggests the Internet economy consists of three
components: reach, affiliation and richness.  In addition to
these three components speed is a key factor and competition is
merely a click away.  To see how Equilibrium's MediaRich
Publishing Platform could push your company to the front of the
e-commerce world click the link below.
