    Vince, 
    You will find attached a revised draft of the paper.  The main
body of the paper now does not contain any equations.  Technical details
are now in the appendices.  The file can be found in:
O:\Research\Internal\Common\From_tan.

    

    <<Rel_VAR_lucid1.doc>> 

    Hope the latest version is more accessible than the last one.
Thank you for your suggestions. 

    Regards, 

    Rabi De
