Vince and Anne,

The FX and Sovereign Risk group within the Research Department has had a steady workflow since the bankruptcy.  Attached below is a list of curves that we provided for various corporate units.  The list also documents the workflow over the last year as well as our client base.  In addition, the "Curves to be done" file is our list of curves due,  this list gets updated on a daily basis as various entities within the corporation need a curve for valuation.

Also Vince had asked me whether or not my employees have found jobs.  Mitra and I have not yet found work, we have all have been busy with our present work load.  Gwyn says she's about three weeks to a month away from getting a new job.  She has some opportunities lined up, but are not solidified as of yet.  

Sincerely,

Maureen
