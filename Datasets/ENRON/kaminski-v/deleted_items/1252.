Improved GPCM Module Ready for Beta Test

If you would like to beta test the latest version of the GPCM Source Matrix
program, now called the Source-Destination Flows program, contact Bob
Brooks at 323-663-4831 or mailto:rebrooks@rbac.com.  In testing at RBAC,
execution time for a 23 year case (1998-2020) was reduced from 5-1/2 hrs to
1-1/2 hr.  The new program also allows you to view the sources of gas for
each destination and destinations of gas for each source by month as well
as by year.  Aggregation levels for sources are Supply Area, State,
Producing Basin, Country, and Miscellaneous.  Aggregation levels for
destinations are Demand Area, State, NERC Region, NERC Sub-region, Census
Region, Country, and Miscellaneous.  The new module, which currently
operates as a standalone program, will be incorporated into GPCM Version
9.0.7 when it is released later this summer.

BP Plans $600 Million Trinidad Natural Gas Project

     BP Trinidad and Tobago is preparing to launch a $600 million offshore
natural gas project next month to supply its giant Atlantic LNG plant. The
Kapok project will comprise a state-of-the-art, unmanned gas production
platform linked to a new central processing unit in an offshore natural gas
field. The central processing unit is capable of processing 1.6 Bcf per day
in addition to considerable quantities of crude and condensate. The Kapok
field has an estimated 3 Tcf which will be brought on stream for trains two
and three at Atlantic LNG.

Calif power use down 11% from 2000

State statistics show that California electric use has been down in every
month so far this year, but May's figures were the best yet.
 In May, peak demand for electricity dropped by 10% and Californians
consumed 11% less electricity than in May 2000.
Electric use was down 5% in January, 7% in February, 9% in March, and 7% in
April.
 "In January I asked Californians to reduce their electricity use by 10%.
We are getting the job done," he said.  Davis heaped praise on consumers
and
business for reducing electric demand during those times when electrons are
most expensive.
 To prove the point, his office told us that demand was down by nearly 3600
mw compared to last year.  According to the state's Energy Commission,
electric use during peak times is being reduced.
