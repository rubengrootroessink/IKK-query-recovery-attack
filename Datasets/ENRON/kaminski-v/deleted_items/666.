                      Generators/ Power Marketers FERC Meeting Agenda Memo for January 16,  2002 
Introduction 
The Commission has set a very  light agenda for its first public meeting of 2002.  At next week's meeting,  the Commission will address only 20 electric items, in comparison to its last  meeting in which it addressed over 70.  Although a very short agenda, FERC  has chosen to address some very long-standing contentious issues, e.g. FERC's  jurisdictional authority to order public power and governmental entities to  provide transmission service to FERC-jurisdictional entities, phantom congestion  in California, remaining issues of contention over the ISO NE's installed  capacity program, issues contributing to the inadequacy of generation and  transmission infrastructure in the Northeast, and tets of FERC's authority  to waive certain limitations of PURPA to re-certify a Qualifying Facility.   
 
Commission Agenda: http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm 
Infrastructure  Issues
E-1 Infrastructure  Discussion in the Northeast AD-02-6 - Commission  discussion on topics to be addressed at FERC's upcoming January 31, 2002  conference in New York City on "Energy Infrastructure Adequacy in the  Northeast". 
 
 
OATT Disputes
E-12  Souhwest Power Pool, Inc.   ER99-4392-001 - Order on several requests for rehearing of the  Commission's 12/17/99 order which directed SPP to make several modifications to  its OATT. In addition, another set of filers seek guidance of how to  recover costs for generator and transmission maintenance costs resulting from  SPP rescheduling planned maintenance outages. 
 
PURPA Challenges
E-5  American Ref-Fuel Company of Delaware  Valley, L.P.  QF87-492-003 - Order on American Ref-Fuel's  request for re-certifcation of its qualifying waste-fired power production  facility . This proceeding has been protested by a group that calls itself,  the PURPA Reform Group. It contends that FERC does not have the authority to  change the Public Utility Regulatory Policy  Act ( PURPA) policies on  a case-by-case basis and,  in this case, grant the petitioner waiver of  PURPA 's 80 MW limitation.  FERC and the applicant did,  however,  receive congressional and industry support for this  petition. 
 
Rehearing Requests
E-20  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.   v.  California Independent System Operator  EL01-89-001 - Order on CA ISO's request for  rehearing of the Commission's Sept. 28, 2001 order, which established settlement  procedures to resolve complaints of the CA ISO's continued problems with  "phantom congestion." 
E-19 ISO New England,  Inc.  EL00-62-037 - Order on several  requests for rehearing of FERC's September 28, 2001 order, which attempted to  resolve outstanding issues with implementation of the ISO-NE's  Installed Capacity program.
 
FERC Authority 
E-11 Public Service Co.  of  Colorado TX98-2-000 - Order on Public Service's dated request that  FERC order Western Area Power Administration and several G&T cooperatives to  provide it transmission service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power  Act.
 
E-9 Pinnacle West Capital  Corporation TX02-1-000 - Order on Pinnacle West's request  that FERC order an Arizona Electrical District to provide it transmission  service, pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act.
