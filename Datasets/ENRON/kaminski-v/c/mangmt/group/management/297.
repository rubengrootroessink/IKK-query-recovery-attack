Shirley:

Vince suggested I send you a list of non-research folks whom I would like to
invite to the going away party.

Ted Murphy
George Hopley
Bernie Aucoin
Edith Cross
Vlady Gorny
Naveen Andrews
Debbie Brackett.

The above are the essentials.  I also like to invite the following, but I
recognize that Vince may want to control costs, so I will leave it up to you
and him to invite or not.

Bill Bradford
Jim Simpson (structuring, works for Bernie)
Rudi Zipter
Greg Woulfe (EBS trader, not a Portland marketer!)
Scott Tholan
Kevin Golden
Rebecca ???  (works with Vlady).

I will also try to invite Terry Lohrenz unless instructed not to.

Give me a call at home if you have questions.

Regards,
Grant.
