Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'
