Molly,

Giuseppe is finishing his Ph.D. at Stanford and worked for us last summer.   
We would like to make him an offer to bring him as a manager.   Vince would 
like to offer $110 k base plus a $20k signing bonus and whatever would be the 
appropriate relocation package (He is single.).     He is leaving on Monday 
for Europe, so it would be preferable if we can get an offer letter in his 
hands by Friday or Saturday.    I have verbally given him this offer already, 
but told him that you would be the expert regarding what is covered in the 
relocation part.    He should be sending me his current address by email 
which I will forward to you a.s.a.p.

thanks,

Stinson

P.S.   Regarding Jinbaek.  We would be happy to pay his air ticket.

Stinso, nice to hear from you. Things are going well here. The only
annoyance comes from the INS. I applied for curricular practical
training, and it will take about three months to have the work permit.
Receiving an H-1 takes understably much longer. Other than this, I would
like to know how are things in the research group and EBS.
I will leave for Italy next Monday and will stay there two weeks. I hope
to hear from you before my departure.

Giuseppe
