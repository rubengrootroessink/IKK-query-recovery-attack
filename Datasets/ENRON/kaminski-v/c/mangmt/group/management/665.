Message One

Dear everyone,=20

We understand the as members of Enron Research group, all of us are working=
=20
on very interesting projects, some of which are ground-breaking, and we all=
=20
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology.  We also find=
=20
out, through our own experience, that at this age of information explosion,=
=20
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep=
=20
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department, le=
t=20
alone in the industry.  It is also our personal experience that many a=20
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of=
=20
this group.=20

As a remedy, we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag=
=20
lunch group meeting, once every two weeks on Friday, for about 50 minutes. =
=20
It is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new=20
technology and development, as well as with each other=01,s work, so that w=
e do=20
not have to reinvent the wheels. =20

We envision the following: In this meeting (or seminar), each one of us wil=
l=20
take turns to make presentations to the group. The topics could range from=
=20
theoretical consideration to practical implementation, be it option pricing=
,=20
process modelling, insurance issue, or Monte Carlo simulation, or anything=
=20
one finds fascinating.  The presentation material could be papers you have=
=20
been reading recently, projects you are working on,  some problem that=20
bothers you, or an idea that is fascinating. You  choose your own=20
presentation style.  It could be =20
everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask, hand waving=20
style, or it can involve nitty-gritty, detailed derivations, anyway a style=
=20
that suits you and the topic.  Or it can simply be a dry-run for your=20
presentation at the next Risk Conference.  Zimin and Alex will take upon th=
e=20
responsibility of organizing the seminar.=20

We hope the seminar will be up and running in two-three weeks. For that=20
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated. Please let either Zimin o=
r=20
Alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and=
=20
provide a tentative schedule. Surely the rest of the group will be happy to=
=20
hear your presentation.=20

We encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting, either to give=
 a=20
talk or just sit in.=20

Message Two

Dear everyone,
It looks like the proposed BBLOP has great support and is to have a great=
=20
start. Vince, Grant,, Amitava,  Kevin, Clayton and Chonawee have promised
to give presentations to us.  Vince will kindly deliver the inaugural=20
presentation next Friday (March 31) on new methodology for option pricing=
=20
(precise title
TBA).  BBLOP will start at 12 noon and last about 45 to 50 minutes.  Let's=
=20
make this a new Enron tradition!

Best regards.
Zimin,
Alex
