Hi Tanya,

in my view it is very good if Stig and Kirstee are involved in your VaR meetings. Therefore, I think it is very useful for them to call Houston.

Could we get a little bit better equipment to allow them to hear everything well?

many thanks,

Slava

Hi Slava,

Kirstee and I find it useful to listen in on the VaR meetings in Houston on Wednesdays. 
However, it is very difficult to follow the discussion due to a practical problem: we hear little or nothing at times. 
A possible solution to this problem might be to ask whether one could install a "spider phone" in the VaR meeting room. 
What I mean is a phone similar to the one in the RAC morning meetings which have several remote speakers going out 
from the main phone (do you understand what I mean?). If this is done, we would  hear everyone around the table, 
not just those seated close to the phone. 

What is you opinion on 
A. us in  London calling in  to these meetings
B. getting some better equipment which would make it easier to follow the conversation ("spider phone" or  bigger speaker ..)

Please let me know what your thoughts are,

Best regards,

Stig
