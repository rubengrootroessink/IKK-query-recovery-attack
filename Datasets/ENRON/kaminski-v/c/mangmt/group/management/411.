Hi, Vince,

How are you? 

Just last week, I got admission from U. of Chicago MBA program, so did Yvan, 
by the way.

Now, I am applying loan from Enron A/A pool.
The person who is in charge of this told me that it needs three 
recommendations from current boss and previous boss for the application, and 
that the requirement includes all PRC rankings in either 'excellent' or 
'superior', that I didn't achieve in the first rotation in Research.

Getting loan is cricial at the stage. I wonder if you can be one of my 
recommenders.
This will be a big help.

Thank you.
