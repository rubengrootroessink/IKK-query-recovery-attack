Dear Ron,

My boss, Enron's chief international economist, is interested in talking with SAIS grads who might want to come to Houston and do economics work.  Same drill as last time, looking for someone whose done the quant track but with excellent writing skills.  I think I sent you a job description a few months back.

Can you help identify some candidates, and send their resumes our way?  Molly Magee is our recruiting expert and she can help setup the interviews with Maureen.  Maureen is still in London on secondment but is available to interview people of the phone.  

Thanks for your help.

Gwyn
