Hi Reggie,
We spoke regarding the chairs on Monday.
Please,  we need these chairs as soon as possible ,without being charged.
We paid for all new chairs each time we moved and it's not fair we pay again.

                                                                              
   Thanks
                                                                              
 Kevin Moore

P.S. These chairs were taken .........

Reggie,

There may already be a request floating around for a standard black office 
chair for EB1972d.  It was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago.  In 
addition to that one, my own chair at EB3132A was stolen this past weekend.  
Could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us?

If you need to charge them to us, our numbers are 0011 and 100038.  As 
always, call me if you need to at x58322.

Thanks!

Sam Smith
