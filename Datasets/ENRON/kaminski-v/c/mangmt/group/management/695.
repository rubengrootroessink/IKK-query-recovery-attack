In case you have not already heard through the extensive grapevine, I am 
indeed leaving the company to take a challenging position in product 
development for Panamsat, the satellite communications company.  I would like 
to thank all of you - many friends that I'm leaving behind at Enron.  
Please stop by and visit when you're in the Northeast (I'll be working in 
Greenwich CT), and my permanent email address is
dinos@oskar.uchicago.edu

All the best,
Dinos
