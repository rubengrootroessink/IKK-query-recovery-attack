Good morning Louis:

Please cancel the "Secom" parking badge that was issued to Van Ngo 
for parking in the 777 Clay garage while she was working part time with 
the Research Group during the holidays.  The number on the card is 4280.  
I will return the badge to you this morning.

The Co. # is 0011 and the RC# is 100038.

Thanks Louis and have a great day!

Shirley
3-5290
