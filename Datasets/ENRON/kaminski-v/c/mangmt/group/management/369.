Thanks for the e-mail.  Please let me know if Clayton does not honor his 
commitment to complete his current project.  I am giving Clayton an 
opportunity (next 6 months) to prove he can add value to our operation 
creating state of the art decision support tools.  If he fails, I will take 
the necessary steps.

Thank you.
