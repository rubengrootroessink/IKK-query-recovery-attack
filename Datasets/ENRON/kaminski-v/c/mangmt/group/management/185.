With the new year,  we would like to institute some rules within the Research 
Group.  This applies to everybody in Research and is at the express request 
of Vince, but I am just sending it to my reports (and their reports) as of 
now.

People are expected to report to work in the morning around 8:00 am to 8:30 
am but NO LATER than 8:30 am.  This is primarily because our clients from 
other groups typically start calling around 8:00 am and we need to be 
responsive.  Of course, once in a while if something urgent comes up then 
this may be relaxed but you are responsible for letting both your supervisor 
and your assistant (Anita and/or Shirley) know in advance.

I am trying to come up with a schedule that will allow me to get updated on 
all the work that you guys are doing, and I will probably set this up next 
week after Vince finishes drawing up the overall directions for the group for 
2001.

Thanks,
Vasant
