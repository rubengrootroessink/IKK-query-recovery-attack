Hi Norma,

	Sevil's primary project has been the Generation Bidding Analysis for the East Power Desk.  She worked closely with the Power Fundamentals group and the IT group in collecting and organizing the data, and then developing the analysis.  Sha has focused on the PJM area and plans to expand the analysis to other regions in the East.
	Sevil has also investigated the issue of Risk Premia in Power Prices compared to Marginal Cost.
