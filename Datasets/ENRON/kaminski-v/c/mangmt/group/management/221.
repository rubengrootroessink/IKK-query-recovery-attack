Subject: Christmas Basket List

Hello Everyone ,

We are nearing the time to get the baskets and other  Christmas tokens sent 
out.
As in every year , we do take the time to send tokens of appreciation
for services rendered ,  or share the Christmas sprit with those we feel 
worthty.
Here is the list that I have already , Approved by Vince.

If there are any additions please inform me A.S.A.P.

The Deadline is December 12th , as I will be meeting with the 
owner of Floral Events to confirm the order and treat him to 
lunch for all the great work he has provided for me.


                                     Thanks
                                 Kevin Moore

Please note : I will be out on Vacation and all orders will already have been 
placed 
with the delivery date on December 19th. the day of my return, 
therefore if any problems occur I will have enough time to solve them.
