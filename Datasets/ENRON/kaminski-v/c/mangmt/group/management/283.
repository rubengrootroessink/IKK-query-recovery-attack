Vince,

Norma called and said that Rakish had requested stock options instead of a 
signing bonus.    She suggested giving $30K worth of options which would vest 
over a 3 year period, and I told her that I am sure this would be fine with 
you.   It should cost us less than the offered cash bonus of $20k.
