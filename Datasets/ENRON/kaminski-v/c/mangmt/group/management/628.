Vince:

Here are several items that you need to know about.

1.  Paul Johnson said that Monday night would be fine for the dinner with 
Spyros.

2.  Lucy Deathridge from Risk called and needed your presentation for the
     Boston conference by this evening in order to have copies made.  I told 
her
     you were in meetings and had been very busy, I did not know whether your
     presentation was ready or not.  We can have 500 copies made from the
     copy center and overnight them to her next week, but you won't be here on
     the 9th to do this.  Do you have any suggestions?

3.  I have been trying to schedule a meeting that Mike Roberts called about
     regarding e-online.  He said to schedule it for Friday at 11:30 am.  I 
called
     Mark Palmer and he knew nothing about the meeting, but said he would
     be here at 11:30 am.  However, I have been unable to reach Dan Diamond.
     Mike said that you might have his cell phone?

Thanks!

Shirley
