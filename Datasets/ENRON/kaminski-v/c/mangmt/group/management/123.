Pat:  Out co # is 0413, RC # is 107043.  Please deliver them to EB 19C2.  
Also, please let me know when they are going to be delivered as we have to 
unload the lateral file cabinets that are currently in that room.  Will the 
men who deliver the Times 2 Units remove the lateral files?  Thanks.  Anita
