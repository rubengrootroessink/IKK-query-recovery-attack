Goodmorning everyone ,

Last year we did quite a bit of Christmas baskets, during the time we were in 
the process of
another major move.
We are currently settled on all floors now , therefore our Christmas Basket 
List will be cut more than half.

Here are a list of the names that received baskets last year.

There are several names boldly printed that probably will not receive the 
baskets this year.
The Christmas season is approaching therefore we must start preparing
.
Please note that I will be out on vacation Dec 13th -18th , if possible I 
would like your list of names
before my vacation begins whereby all baskets can arrive at their 
destinations on time.

                                                     
                                                                              
     Thanks
