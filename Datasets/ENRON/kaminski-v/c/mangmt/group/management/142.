How many do we need to enroll in order to bring the class to Enron?

Thanks!

OK. 

The discounted rate applies regardless of numbers enrolled per class.

Marty:

Vince wants to wait and see how many actually need this training before
we enroll anymore from his group.  Right now Tanya and Rabi are all
that have approval.

I will let you know if we decide to do more.

Thanks for all of your assistance.

Shirley
