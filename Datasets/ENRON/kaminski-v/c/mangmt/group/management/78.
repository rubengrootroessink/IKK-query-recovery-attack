Vince:  I'm sure that you are already aware of this, but I wanted to forward 
it to you since this didn't come up in our meeting the other morning....

Dear Ron,

My boss, Enron's chief international economist, is interested in talking with 
SAIS grads who might want to come to Houston and do economics work.  Same 
drill as last time, looking for someone whose done the quant track but with 
excellent writing skills.  I think I sent you a job description a few months 
back.

Can you help identify some candidates, and send their resumes our way?  Molly 
Magee is our recruiting expert and she can help setup the interviews with 
Maureen.  Maureen is still in London on secondment but is available to 
interview people of the phone.  

Thanks for your help.

Gwyn
