Hi Vince,
I have been working on and/or planning to work on the following projects:
1.  Finished a gas daily swing option model for commodity structuring 
group (Sanjeev Khanna).  The model uses American Monte Carlo 
Simulation and dynamic programming techniques. 

2. Continue working on PSIM model. This includes reading power generation
and operation books as well as thinking about ways to model power plant and
its operation. The standard approach (i.e. turn the plant on if power 
price>total
generation cost, else turn the plant off) is not particularly good if the 
regional
demand is very high and the plant still has some un-utilized generation 
capacity.
That is, the generation criteria is quite different depending on we model 
power 
plant from regional point view or from plant point of view.  Plan to have 
meetings
with Tom and Lance. 

3.  Started working on stochastic process parameter estimation.  I will 
concentrate
on four processes: GBM, mean reverting, jump diffusion, and jump diffusion 
with
mean reverting.  I have looked at Tanya's earlier  work and decided to 
discretize
the processes slightly differently.  It is hoped that this will give a more 
stable
estimation. 

Best,
Alex
