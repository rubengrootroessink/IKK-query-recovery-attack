Hi Lyn:

Hope things are going better for you!

The Research group is getting one new employee beginning February
21,  2000, that needs a computer.  We also have an employee that needs 
a  new computer because the one she has does not have enough memory. 
We need at least 64meg memory with a large screen (17").

Yana Kristal  EB1947 (replace computer she now has)

Shalesh Ganjoo EB1951 (new Analyst rotating - 2/21/00)

Co. #:   0011
