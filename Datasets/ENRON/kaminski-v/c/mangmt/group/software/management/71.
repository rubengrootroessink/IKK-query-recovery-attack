Connie:

In response to your email to Vince Kaminski of 3/19/01, the subject invoice
was sent to our Accounting Dept. for payment on February 25, 2001.  We
did not need the SPAV maintenance, so we deducted $1,600.00.  Did you
receive a payment in the amount of $4100.00 that could possibly have been
payment for this invoice?

I have left a message for our accounting dept. to see exactly when the invoice
was paid and the check number.  As soon as I hear from them I will left you
know.

Best regards,
