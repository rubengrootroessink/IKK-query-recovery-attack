Stinson,
Enclosed are the details of the CPLEX purchase. If everyone agrees, I will
assume that EBS is responsible for 1/3 of the cost (with Taxes etc. must be
close to $15,000).
Krishna and Grant, what do you think?

Subject:  Revised ILOG quote 5-25-00


Hi Chonawee,

You are right, I did make a mistake on the calculation, though it isn't
exactly 2/3 of the previous 3 pak quote. Sorry about that and so glad you
caught it. I multiplied by 1.5 and I meant to use 1.3.  We have discounted
deployment paks which we discount by quantity.  Our chart starts with a 3
pak so I took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1.3 to get
14,560.00.  For 2 deployments, I take $4,500 for one, plus 10% off for the
second license 4,050, then times 1.3 = 11,115.00.  Here is the revised
quote.  I checked the other numbers again and they are correct. Again, I am
sorry for the mistake.

Regards,
