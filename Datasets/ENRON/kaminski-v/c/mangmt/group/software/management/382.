Good morning all:

This past weekend you moved two computers from EB1972B and 1972G
and were supposed to install them in EB1941 and EB 1952.  What
happened?  There is no computer in EB 1941 and only the monitor in
EB 1952.  We need this equipment back.  Please install as soon as
possible.

Thanks and have a great day!

Shirley
