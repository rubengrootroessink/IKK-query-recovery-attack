Vince:

I was confused also - but I think this is the computer we ordered for
the new employee that is coming next week (Rakesh Bharati).  Phillip our 
IT floor tech said that the computer in the back room at EB1972G was very 
old and did not have much memory so I ordered a new one with an 
upgrade to bring it up to 196M (this is what Phillip said we need).  Also 
there 
is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we
ordered an upgrade for it (Jason's).  I went ahead an did it so that they 
would
be ready when the new employees come in.

Maureen already has her upgrade.

Shirley,

Is this an upgrade for Maureen?

Vince, I have your new PC.  I will get with you when I'm done to schedule a 
delivery time.  I will need your network and notes password to test your apps.

Thanks,

Felix
