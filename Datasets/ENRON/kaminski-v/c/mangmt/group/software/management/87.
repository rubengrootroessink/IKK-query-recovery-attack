Moyez,

We are very anxious to get set up and start using Livelink for tracking and 
documenting our projects, so thanks for the reminder.   I have put together 
an initial list of attributes for our Research projects.   The list in in the 
attached spreadsheet.   It would be great if you can set up these attributes 
for us in the test environment.   This would allow us to make any obvious 
changes before moving to production.   Let me know what your schedule would 
be in rolling this out.

My brief comments in the spreadsheet may not be clear, so feel free to give 
me a call at x34748 to clarify anything.

Again, thanks for your help.

Stinson
