Thanks,  I will try and collect the information today.   Vasant and I were=
=20
thinking that it would make sense to let people try the application under t=
he=20
test environment for a few weeks.   Then we can incorporate any additional=
=20
suggestions and move to production around the first week in April.

Our meeting room does have a screen and network connection, and we can=20
profide an LCD projector as well.   How about Thursday of next week?

Thanks,

Stinson

Sorry to have to do this to you but I need some additional information in=
=20
order to add these users to the Research Projects Group.  Please use the=20
attached template to capture the information needed and forward to me at yo=
ur=20
convenience.  Also, the group has only been set up in the test environment.=
 =20
Do you want to add the users to the test environment or are you ready to=20
migrate to production?

As far as the demo is concerned, I=01,ll be happy to accommodate your group=
. =20
How many people do you expect at the demo and does the room have a display=
=20
screen and network connection?  Let me know which Thursday you would like m=
e=20
to conduct the demo and I=01,ll be there.

Moyez,

Can you add access to the following users for the Livelink research project=
s=20
database?    Also,  would you be available to give a short demonstration an=
d=20
tutorial on how to use Livelink for our group?    We hold a lunch meeting=
=20
each Thursday from 11:30 - 1:00  in 30C1 at which there is usually a short=
=20
presentation on a topic of interest.  I think it would be very useful for t=
he=20
group to have an overview of how to use the tool before everyone jumps into=
=20
it.   The presentation can be quite informal. Let me know if you would be=
=20
available in the next couple of weeks.
