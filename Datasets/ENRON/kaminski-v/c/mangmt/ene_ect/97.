As you all know the deadline for 2000 invoices to AP was on Friday, December 
15, 2000.  In order to get all 2000 expenses accounted for in 2000, I need an 
e-mail from you with name of the vendor, amount, cost center to be billed to, 
contact person (if any).  Some of the costs to consider:  services provided 
to Enron in 2000 but we have not receive the invoices, employee expense 
reports, and/or any purchases we made in 2000, but have not submit the 
invoices to AP by the cutoff date.  I need this information by noon Friday, 
December 29, 2000.  If you have any questions, call me at 5-7094.  Thanx

Irma, Kristi and Ramona,

Will you make sure everyone in HR department know the deadline.  Thanx.
