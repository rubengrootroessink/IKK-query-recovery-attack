Goodmorning Liz ,

Hopefully your morning is going well.

Liz, we are currently moving up to the 32nd floor
as you are already aware of.
I had been speaking with Brenda concerning
the move however , things has changed since then.

Liz , I need for you to understand the importance 
of me knowing exactly when and where we will move.

First of all - the space , we have several machines
that must move with us.

Secondly - We must make arrangements for our satellite ,
the cable may need adjusting.

Thirdly - I need to know where every copy machine is located
on the floor and hopefully we are closest to the largest one.

Please Liz, these are most important.
We prepare for morning meetings daily and we are the first to get 
here to work,  so if any problems occur we try and tackle them beforehand.

Please I know that you are very busy however , this will really be helpful
in making our move a success.

Maybe we can meet and discuss?

                                                                    Thank You
                                                                   Kevin Moore
