In order to improve the video conferencing services offered to the Enron 
community, the Video Conference Group will be implementing the following 
procedural changes.  These changes will be effective immediately.

Conference Scheduling:
Please route all video conference requests via email to 'VideoConference' 
(one word) or by phone to 713-345-8500 (x5-8500).  Once room reservations are 
complete, conferences will be scheduled and confirmation notices sent to the 
requestor via email.  Each requestor will receive a confirmation notice the 
business day preceding scheduled conferences.
The following information will be required for all conference requests:
Requestor name and contact number
Sites to be included in the conference 
Site contact names along with associated phone numbers
Date, time and duration of conference
Company Number/RC or Cost Center of requestor
Preferred conference rooms (near-end and far-end)

Technical Problems:
Should problems arise during a video conference, call 713-345-8555 and a 
technician will be immediately dispatched

Thanks In advance for your cooperation,

Video Conferencing Support
