Ladies, I'm trying to finalize this schedule prior to my vacation 4/13-14.  
Please confirm that the time proposed below will work for your executive.  
Additionally, would you please e-mail me a bio for your executive; the 
professors have requested it.

Thanks for your help.  SRS

Subject: Proposed Darden Interview Schedule - April 18

Below is proposed schedule for the Darden case video-taped interviews; an 
hour has been scheduled for each of you (except Vince, for whom 1-1/2 hours 
has been requested), however, you may be finished in less time.  The location 
is yet to be determined, but will most likely take place in a vacant office 
of 50M.  

Please let me know of any conflicts with this proposed schedule.  I'll send 
along additional information as it becomes available.  Thank you and have a 
nice weekend.  SRS
