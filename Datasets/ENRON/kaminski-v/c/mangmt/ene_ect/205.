Subject: ENA Fileplan  

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we've 
taken to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each ENA 
department's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a 
vice president or director) within each group to first explain this project 
and seek permission to perform the inventory, and then to ask that executive 
to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The 
contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's 
record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured. Many departments are keeping 
records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable 
and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what 
is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be 
maintained.

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area(s) use. 
The inventory itself is non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into 
file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the 
contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
