i've asked vince to get involved with you about getting li into vince's 
group.  this issue needs to  be resolved by week's end--we look like we don't 
have our act together, and that bothers me.  especially since we are about to 
make a significant monetary investment at wharton, and we could have a new 
wharton recruit disgruntled.

vince, can you set up a meeting with you, me and mark palmer to follow up 
with our meeting with skilling?  thanks very much...

jeff
