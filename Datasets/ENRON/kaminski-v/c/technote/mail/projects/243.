Vince,

Sorry, I was not able to take your call this morning, to avoid distractions I 
was editing a technical coner article on PPP out of my office.  Last Friday, 
I called Robert Johnston immediately after you told me to contact him to 
brief him on nonferrous metals.  I let him know that I was scheduled to speak 
about Metals in our research meeting on October 12th.  I also talked with him 
a few weeks ago that I would like to meet with him and Scott Tholan to brief 
them on metals.   Robert did not arrange the meeting.  I arranged a meeting 
for 10:30 tomorrow to take them both through the metals fundametals speech.  

The London Metals Confererence sounds great, since I have five years 
experience in metals fundamental analysis and pricing, I would also like to 
attend.  Many of my new research group customers are asking for my expertise 
in this new business for Enron.  I could certainly help our customers better 
by getting the latest information on metals.  Please let me know if this is 
OK with you.


Regards, 


Maureen
