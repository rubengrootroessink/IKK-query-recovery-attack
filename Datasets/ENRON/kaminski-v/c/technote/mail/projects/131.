Lance and I spoke with Tim Heizenrader regarding modeling work and needs for 
the West Desk.  The differences in the markets between East and West are, in 
Tim's opinion, sufficient that he does not need an approach as sophisticated 
as the one we are pursuing for ERCOT.  In particular, the termal limits for 
which load flows are so useful are not generally binding in the West.  Loop 
flows are also not considered a major issue at present.

In summary, it seems that the West is an unlikely customer of any extension 
to an ERCOT/East transmission model for the time being.  They have also done 
little in this area that would directly relate to our efforts here.
