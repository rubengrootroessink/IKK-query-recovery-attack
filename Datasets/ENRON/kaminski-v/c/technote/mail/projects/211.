Maureen,

I just wanted to thank you for all your time and your great advice and 
support. I enjoyed talking to you and learning from your experience and also 
meeting all these people involved in F/X trading activities. 

I just want to ask you if you could send me over the mail the latest forward 
curves so that we use them to update our long-term plan. For the short term I 
will contact Pushkar going forward.

Thanks again and I look forward to talk to you again.

Regards,

Pedro Fernando
