Harry:
 I am Krishna, just visiting our Bombay office. Can you send the Rupee/US$ 
forward curve (upto atleast 2005) to this address ASAP? We are working on a 
deal for which we need this urgently. I will be back in Houston next week and 
can talk to you in more detail then. If you need to call here the # is 
91-022-8239856 (ask for Rajesh Sivaraman).
Thanks,
krishna.
