Subject: Margin Collar

I wanted to give you the status on the BP margin collar deal.  We submitted a 
bid to BP yesterday where BP would pay Enron just under $5 MM to assume the 
contract.  We have yet to have further discussions, so there's not much more 
to report than that.  We greatly appreciate your help on this project.  I 
feel like we put together a very good bid, and measured the risks 
appropriately with limited time.  I will keep you informed of how the 
negotiations proceed.

Thanks again,

Lee Jackson
