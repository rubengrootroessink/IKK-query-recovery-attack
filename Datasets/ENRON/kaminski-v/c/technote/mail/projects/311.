FYI,
Attached document is a specification of the network design optimization 
program. Just in case you want to see how it looks like.

Phil, 
The optimization engine is ready and the graphical user interface is almost 
done. Attached please find the updated network design optimization 
specification. It contains some additions and modifications to the old 
specification I sent you a while ago. The major changes are:
  1. The program now also supports Ring design. and it can solve to optimality
  2. The graphical user interface is handled by Visual Basic on a PC. (Not on 
the web browser as in the previous spec.). 
Please take a look at the specification document and let me know if there is 
anything you want to add/change/remove...etc.
Moreover, please do not forget to send us a test example. 
We are buying CPLEX and will install it on our network. Hopefully our IT 
teams can configure your machine to run it in a few weeks.
