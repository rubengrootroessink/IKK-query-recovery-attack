HI Iris:

May 17th is fine.  He will probably need to come in the night before (the 16th)
and he can make a hotel reservation at the Doubletree or the Hyatt and tell
them he is a guest of Enron and he will get a corporate rate.  We will reimburse 
him for room expense only.  He will need to pick up any miscellaneous room 
charges.   We will also reimburse him for his flight expense and cab fare.
The Doubletree Telephone # is:  713-759-0202 and the Hyatt Telephone is:
713-654-1234.

He can either leave his receipts with me when he is here or mail them
to me and I will have a check cut.  I will need his SS#.

If you have any more questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

	Vince has requested that we invite Professor Nalin Kulatilaka of Boston University to speak at one of our Thursday group luncheons/seminars.

	Nalin says he is available to speak on May 17th.  

	Can you let me know if this is okay, and what the procedure is for invited speakers.

Thanks and have a good weekend,
Iris
