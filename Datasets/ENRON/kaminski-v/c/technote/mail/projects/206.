Bill,

Alex and I are working on the credit exposure model.  We finished the initial 
design issues regarding
input and output. We would like to have a meeting with you to seek feedback.  
We also preceeded
to write the underlying model.  So feedback at early stage can be important 
for the later development.

Paulo Issler is working on the short term enhancement to the credit loss 
model: adding asian option to
the model built by Vasant and Amitava.  

Let me know when is a good time for us to meet.

Zimin
