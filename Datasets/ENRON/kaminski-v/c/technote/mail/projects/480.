I think I will coordinate with Zimin, and have Guadalupe do some research on 
equities linked to corn price.  Initially, there will be some scenario 
analysis done, and we can explore the possible use of options theory.

Carl,

Depends if it is more like financial or insurance type hedging.

I shall leave it to Vasant to decide.

Vince, thank you for the response.  In the interim, we met with Vasant 
Shanbhogue yesterday and explained the deal and what we needed.  Should 
Vasant continue to work on it, or would you still like us to loop in Zimin 
Lu?
