Hi Vince:

Number one below is fine...the more accurate the EBITDA model the better.  
Your "tweaking" of the model at this point won't create any Chinese Wall 
problems.

Michelle and Gary will talk about the programmer issue on Monday, and get 
back to you.  I apologize if there was any confusion.  We're certainly 
grateful for Alex's involvement.

Today is my last day of Associate rotation within the Financial Trading 
group, and I start at EES on Monday.  I handed off the project as best I 
could, and of course will be available if you need me.  My e-mail and phone 
number will be the same.

Have a nice weekend.

Jeff

Jeff,

A few comments on the model:

1. We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like 
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of 
our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the 
details and in the inputs and
calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results 
depending
on the quality of inputs. 

2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We 
were told that you
would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.


Vince
