Margaret, 

Please find attached Texas and Louisiana wellhead prices (daily, monthly and 
quarterly). We had data available starting 1983 and the information source is 
Natural Gas Intelligence. Information on UK "beach" prices will be available 
for the following locations: Teesside, Bacton and St. Fergus. Would you like 
to have data on a specific one? 

Sincerely, 
Elena

Subject: Re: Vince Does your group have a Monthly or a Quarterly price 
history in nominal terms
for a US onshore Louisiana natural gas price (or a Texas wellhead price ) and 
a UK landed beach price for the past 15 years? I am gathering historical data 
for Jim O Hara for our Colombia pipeline in South America and these are among 
the series of data they are seeking. They would like the data
from a published source in an electronic file if possible.. Their timetable 
is by COB Weds this week. Thank you for your help. Margaret  

Mike do you agree with me? Please, ask Elena to  check what price info is 
available at XMIM.

Vince


Margaret,

The prices going back 15 years are not  too informative (for the first 5 
years) , as he industry was still regulated. 
We shall try to get  you the US series as soon as possible.

Vince
