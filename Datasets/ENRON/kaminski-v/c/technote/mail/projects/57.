Vince,

Here are four graphs I came up with yesterday afternoon that may be of 
interest:

The first one shows what percentage of our trades are done with different 
counterparties -



(Note the large part that Aquila plays!)

The other three graphs look at how trading volume varies during the week 
between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:00 PM for different categories of product. 
Natural gas and power have their own graphs, as they have the largest traded 
volumes. "Products" is for the remaining categories.



There are still some things I would like to take a look at. The databeacon 
software is now available, and can be reached at the following URL:

Do you have any specific questions that you would like me to try answering 
regarding EOL?

I have also started doing some research on automated trading platforms. Are 
there any websites and/or papers you would recommend I read?

Thanks,

Tom
