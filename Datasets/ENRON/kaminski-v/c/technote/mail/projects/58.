Hi,

     Thanks for the document on your practice.  I forwarded it to the 
relevant parties.

     They will take a look at it and get back to me when they wish to take 
the next steps with you and your colleagues at McKinsey.

Regards,
Iris

Hi,

     Thanks for your prompt response.  My colleagues would indeed like to
chat with you about the Agriculture industry some time in the future.

     Can we touch bases in a few weeks.

     In the mean time, do you have any materials you can forward to us
about McKinsey's Agriculture Group?

Thanks,
Iris

      Hi again,


           I had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
      agriculture-related deals and on weather derivatives.

           I mentioned to them about Bernard's working at McKinsey and
      specializing in the agriculture area.

           We thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and/or
   met
      to discuss possible collaborative efforts.

           Will you please forward this email on to Bernard to see if this
      might be of interest to him?


      Thanks,
      Iris
