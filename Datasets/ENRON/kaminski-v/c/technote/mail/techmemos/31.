Gwyn,
Paddy and I spoke to you earlier today regarding EEL's Turkish investment.  
You mentioned that you could send us a brief report on what has been going on 
in Turkey in the last couple of weeks.  As we are having a meeting tomorrow 
AM could you still send us this report before business closing Houston to 
myself, Paddy and Jolyon Manning.
Thank you
Suryan Wirya Simunovic
