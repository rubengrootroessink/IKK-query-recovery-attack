Go to http://www.winedt.com/, select downloads, and download  WinEdt5 to your 
C drive. 
On bottom of  the same page (download),  click on MiKTeX's Home Page,
click on MiKTeX 2.0, and download all the highlighted zip files.  You may also
want to download miktex-2.0-manual.pdf.
You can then unzip all the files and follow the steps outlined in 
miktex-2.0-manual.pdf to 
install WinEdt and MiKTex.  However, the procedure to "Add MikTex bin 
directory to PATH"
may not work. It's best to manually add the following to your path:
C:\texmf\miktex\bin;

This software is quite easy to use and very versatile. You can even include
colored picture in your tex document. 

Best,
Alex
