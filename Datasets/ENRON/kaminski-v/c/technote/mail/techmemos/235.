I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday 
unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing 
to you) and will not come into the office.

Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a 
few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling 
flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is 
a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.

Please let me know if this accomodates your needs,

Yannis

Yannis,

 Shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled. Let her know 
what audio-visual materials you'll need. Keep in mind that the research group 
is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on 
video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a 
PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching 
remotely, can see your computer's monitor on a big screen.

 The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade 
news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest, 
we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed 
yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way. 
From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance 
warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in 
getting you and Jenny the things you need. 

Joe

Yannis,

It makes a lot of sense to get this info.

Also, You are welcome to make a presentation to the group this Thursday at 
lunch.

Please, call Shirley Crenshaw (X3-5290) to coordinate and order sandwich
you would like to have.

Vince


Joe, Can you, please, babysit this presentation (make sure we have all the 
audiovisual
equipment we need, etc.).

Vince

FYI:

The following file describes the contents of the Monthly Energy Review 
(Application, Current, and Historical).
The data is available through a DoE site and we can get it for free and 
incorporate it in the LIM database, if there is interest.

Review the attached file (look for keywords of interest) and let us know 
whether need dictates loading these datasets.
