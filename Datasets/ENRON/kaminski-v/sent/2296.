Hi - I have run the model for the 26th and have the following results :



I have also updated the correlations to include silver and the gold.
The TC delta (treatment charges) are positions only for copper conentrate and 
do not 
contain any positions due to zinc or lead.
Could you take a look at the figues as this is the first time I have done a 
full run and 
would like to make sure that I have done things correctly.
I will definitely call to discuss the prices for gold and cocoa beans - the 
TC price curve is 
another issue however, at the moment we do not have anything other than a 
spot price and 
a 1 year price so I think we will probably have to set it as a constant.
I have to talk to Andreas soon as he is awaiting my comments on point (2) of 
his email that 
I forwarded in my last mail. 
Also, you will can see that I have subtracted any positions that are from R 
Wolf in the Mercur download - 
this was point (1) of his note.
As a quick question?
Do you think it is worth including Zinc concentrate (18400 dmt) and lead 
concentrate (920 dmt) ?
I think we may need to check the TC price for these and the conversion for 
the one given in the model for copper as 
I think that the original historical price file (TChistory) is quoted in c/lb 
- I guess this is cents/pound? rather 
than $/dmt which is the units that position is quoted in .
 
Speak to you soon
Kirstee
