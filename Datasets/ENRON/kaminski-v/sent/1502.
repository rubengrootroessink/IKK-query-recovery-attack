Stuart Seeligson was the lead on this but I do not know if it was ever

Hi John,

Do you remember working on a Harvard case study related to Sutton Bridge?  If 
so, do you have a copy?  Vince is looking for it, but can't find it on any of 
Harvard's sites.

I'm not aware of a Sutton Bridge case study.  I'm checking with some other 
folks and I'll let you all know what I find.
