Vince:

Thanks for your help in this matter.  I dont want to be a bother to you.  I
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil
and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
available.

I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

Dale

Dale,

I have passed on the information you gave me but you have to realize that
I acted just as a go-between. I shall be glad to remind our new business
unit
about your proposal. I have already asked a few times.

I shall be traveling this week, Wed - Fri. I shall be back in the office on
Monday.

Vince

Just wanted to make sure you know we are still vitally interested in
getting
together with you and the key Enron people.  Thanks so much for all your
help.  I understand how busy you and the new person are, but I hope you are
interested enough to find a slot for us.  I think it will benefit you as
well as us.

Dale
