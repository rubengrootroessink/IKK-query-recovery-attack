"Exotic Options for Interruptible Electricity Supply Contracts" (February
2000)
 PWP-071 by Rajnish Kamat and Shmuel S. Oren.

This paper presents the design and pricing of financial contracts for the
supply and procurement of interruptible electricity service. The proposed
contracts consist of bundling simple forwards with exotic call options that
have two exercise points with different strike prices. Such options allow
hedging and valuation of supply curtailment risk while explicitly
accounting for the notification lead time before curtailment.
The proposed instruments are priced under the traditional GBM price process
assumption and under the more realistic assumption of a mean reverting
price process with jump diffusion. The latter results employ state of the
art Fourier transforms techniques.
