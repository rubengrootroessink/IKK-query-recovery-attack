John,

The outline of a message to Nesbitt.


Dale,

Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
mentioned 
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
employees on a case-study.

The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
internally.

Please, let me know more about this option.

Vince
