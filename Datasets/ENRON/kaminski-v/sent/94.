Jason,

I've send a total of 4 files to you.  If you find any problem with the
files, please let me know.

Thanks.

Tracy,
Break it down into 8000 files of 1 kB, and send each one in a separate
mail.

Just kidding!
Try to send the whole thing.
If one of the servers refuses to accept it, then break it down into several
pieces.
I know for sure that I can take files as large as 2MB.

Jason
