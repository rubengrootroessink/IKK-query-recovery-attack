Hi Vince,

Winston is telling me that he has started a serious of presentations to 
certain members of your group to help everyone better understand the various 
components that have been documented.

How is that going from your perspective?......are your people getting 
anything out of it?

Also, the VaR documentation was completed last week, and I've just asked for 
a full printed copy of it to be created mand given to your department.

I've just engaged a small team to document the Credit Reserve model as a 
final piece and then we are done with the core documentation.

regards

Steve
