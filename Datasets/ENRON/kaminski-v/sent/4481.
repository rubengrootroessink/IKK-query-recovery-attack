Shirley,

It will take a lot of effort to compile this list.

Please, remind me about it.

Subject: Document Identification

In an effort to identify intellectual capital for Enron's Knowledge 
Management effort, we are establishing an inventory of documents (e.g. papers 
published, speeches, magazine/journal subscriptions, professional 
associations, etc.).  Please forward the types of documentation you have 
which may be inventoried for other Enron employees' use.  If there are other 
individuals like yourself with access to this type of information, please 
forward their names to me.  I am available to discuss this effort at your 
convenience.  My extension is 3 9698.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Marie Hejka
