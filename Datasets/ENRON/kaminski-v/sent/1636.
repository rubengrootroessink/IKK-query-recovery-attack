Vince,
?
Oh.? I sent an invoice to Habiba for AUS 5K a while back, and she  informed 
me that she passed it along to the people who are handling the  agreement now 
(I take that as Fiona Grant in London?).? I will then send  out another 
invoice of AUS 5K in the next week or so for the remaining  balance.? Should 
I have sent the invoice to you?
?
Thanks,
Julie

Julie,

A clarification. We had an agreement with  Chris and Les to contribute? AUS
10,000
as a part of the  cost.

Vince,

Thank you for your email.

We  will send you a copy of the book as soon as it is available, which we
are  now estimating to be around 21 November (no need to send us a cheque;
you  deserve it).

Just let us know if we should use a different address than  your office? in
Houston.

Thanks again for all of your  help.

Julie
