Dear Vince,

It was pleasure talking with you the other day.

The following list consists of some of the items that we spoke about the
other day.

-  Please let us know how you and Grant would like to be mentioned in the
book, ie, position and title
-  We would appreciate it if someone at Enron would write the preface for
the book.  Please let us know if this is OK with you, who it will be, and
what you need from us.
-  Chris Strickland and I are planning to be in Houston on Feb 15th and
16th, and we would love to meet up with you and others from Enron who you
feel are most appropriate, ie, John Ambler (I will write to him as well),
derivatives traders, your team etc.
-  Chris Strickland and Les Clewlow will be conducting the following two
energy courses in Houston and in London (details below).  Please let us
know if we should reserve any places.

Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management
Houston: 29-30 March 2000
London:  3-4 April 2000

VaR for Energy Markets
Houston: 31 March 2000
London:  5 April 2000

FYI, John Ambler and I have been playing tag, and have not yet settled on
the details of the sponsorship.  However, I anticipate that when he returns
from his travels, we should be able to knock through it quickly.

I look forward to meeting you in February, and please contact me, either
via email or my mobile (+447940166177), if I can provide assistance with
anything.

Thanks,
Julie Brennan

PS - I look forward to receiving your chapter shortly :-).

Title: Energy Derivatives Courses

COURSE 1:   Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------

Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland

Houston: 29-30 March 2000
London:  3-4 April 2000

Fee : STG 1950 / USD 2950

This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is
familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical
foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and
risk management of energy derivatives.

This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic
option pricing theory (the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation,
and the use of binomial trees for option pricing).

The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and
successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer
workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited
to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.

The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as
electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and
risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a
diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code
for pricing and simulation.

Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of
relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to
computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee
will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Strickland's forthcoming book
"Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management".

Upon registration, participants will be sent a pack containing relevant
pre-course reading.

COURSE 2:  VaR for Energy Markets
-----------------------------------------------------

Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland

Houston: 31 March 2000
London:  5 April 2000

Fee : STG 950 / USD 1950

This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is
familiar with energy derivative products but who requires an understanding
of the theory and calculation of Value at Risk for energy derivative
portfolios.

The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and
successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer
workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction the course will be limited
to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.

The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as
electricity derivatives. At the end of the course participants leave with a
diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code
for pricing and VaR calculations.

Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of
relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to
computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee
will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Strickland's forthcoming book

Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions
at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology,
Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick,
UK.  Together they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial
and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic
and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book "Implementing
Derivatives Models" (Wiley, 1998) and editors of "Exotic Options: The State
of the Art" (ITP, 1998). Their forthcoming book, "Energy Derivatives:
Pricing and Risk Management," is due to be published during the second
quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy
derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools
for electricity options and other energy derivatives.
