Vince,

I'm glad you liked it.  My next "Enron" task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?

See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).

Your friend,

John
