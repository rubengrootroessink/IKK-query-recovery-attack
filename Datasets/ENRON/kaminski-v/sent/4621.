Jim,

I can send you copies of the  reprints of some papers I wrote
or co-authored. Please, let me know how many copies do you need.

I shall prepare power point presentations for the student meeting
and for the faculty meeting.

For the students: review of my group (things we work on) with an intention
of generating some interest among the students and soliciting resumes.

For the faculty meeting: challenges that energy markets pose to financial 
modeling.
I shall be able to E-mail the Power Point presentations later this month.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Would you mind emailing to me a short biography/vita sometime when you get
a chance?  Also, if you have a paper to circulate or any PowerPoint slides
that you'll want to use either in your presentations to my students
Thursday afternoon, 2/3, or to the faculty seminar on Friday morning, 2/4,
please email these to me.  This would be greatly appreciated.

My colleagues and I are looking forward to your visit on Feb. 3-4 to LSU.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
