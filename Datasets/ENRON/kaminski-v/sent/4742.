Hi.

I hope you got my message. Rob (if you don't know) has been "swiped" by Risk
to edit one of the new newsletters - Risk Management Operations - and so no
longer works with Books. We were very sad to see him go, but it is a great
opportunity for him and nice to see some intelligent internal promotion for
a change! Was there anything in particular you needed, Vince? Just to say
also that the energy titles (especially MEPR2) have received some excellent
reviews at contingencyanalysis.com which may interest you. Rob may have
mentionned the Utility Risk title we'd like to publish next year; any views
on that from you would be welcome, obviously. Let me know if and when you're
around and we can catch a coffee.

In the meantime, I hope you and your family have some good quality holiday
time. Best regards, as always. Sh?n
Sh?n Millie
