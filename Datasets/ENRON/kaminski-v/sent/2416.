Subject: Interview Request

I am trying to schedule an interview with a gentleman who is currently a 
professor at Rice.  We are interested in possibly hiring him in a research 
capacity in the Coal and Emissions group.  Would you have time to interview 
him tom'w?  Let me know if you can.

Thank you

Kevin McGowan x-3-7499
