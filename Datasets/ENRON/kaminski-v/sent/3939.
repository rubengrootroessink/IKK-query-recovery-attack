 Vince
Thanks again for agreeing to speak at our conference.
It is attracting considerable interest. .

Is it possible for you to send us copies of your slides by May 18 to meet our
deadline for
preparing the material.? If you have? a related paper available that covers
some of the same material that would do instead but
naturally we would prefer the slides.

I would like to mention again the?? the pre-conference dinner at
7 pm on Sunday May 30 for the speakers
We hope very much you can be present

I was also hoping you would be available for the last? session of the day to 
be
panel member
The provisional title? is
Managing Risk in Illiquid Markets
The chair is Pat Concessi of Deloitte and Touche
The panel last from 3.30 until 4.30 and we would like panel members should
speaker for
a few minutes and take questions from the floor.

In the meantime if you have any questions please let Amy or myself know

Sincerely
Phelim P Boyle
