Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
