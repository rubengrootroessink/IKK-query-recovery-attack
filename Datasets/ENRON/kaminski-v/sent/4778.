Dear Vince Kaminski

Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.

I have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets
My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured
your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states
(in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron
is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.

I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field;
However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at
least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old
mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that
Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly
hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now.

Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands
 both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average, please contact
me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Yours sincerely,
