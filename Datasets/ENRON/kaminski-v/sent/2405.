Free Seminar: "Optimization Model for Capital Investment Decisions
Using Option Pricing", by INFORMS President John Birge

You are invited to attend a free, 45-minute online seminar on
"Optimization model for capital investment decisions using option
pricing".

When: Wednesday, July 19, at 2:00 PM EDT

Where: Right from your desktop! You can participate using your office
computer and telephone.

How: <http://www.e-optimization.com/resources/web_realoptions.cfm>

Real-option valuation incorporates the opportunities a company may enjoy
using either new knowledge or changes in the marketplace for making
capital investments. The talk focuses on optimization models for
determining best investment levels and demonstrates how stochastic
(involving random variables) programs consider risk without creating
unwieldy formulations. Hear how Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and General
Motors are using this process successfully.

INFORMS President John Birge, Dean of the McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science at the Northwestern University in
Illinois, will give the seminar. John is a popular author and speaker
and during the past five years has been in demand for his talks on
stochastic programming and optimization.

Who should attend: OR analysts, strategic planners, financial analysts,
consultants and financial decision makers or anyone interested in
hearing about innovative, exciting, practical decision-making tools.
