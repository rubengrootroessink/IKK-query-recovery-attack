Vince,
Here is the newest Enron Presentation.  Please take a look at the new one
and make any changes you want.  Please e-mail me the final version and I
will save it to my laptop and we can run it from my laptop at the
presentation.  I will also be forwarding the logistics for Cal Berkeley.
Regards,
Ed
