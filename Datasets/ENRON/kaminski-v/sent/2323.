Hi Jana,

The trip was very interesting and I am still recovering.

On Friday we can meet at the restaurant. It's on the edge of
the Woodlands. We can then go to our home and have drinks
and chat.

The restaurant is:

 Amerigo's Grill 
25250 Grogans Park Dr
Spring, TX 77380-2175
Phone: 281-362-0808

I have sent you an URL of the map of the part of the Woodlands
where Amerigo's is located. It's a red dot on the map.

What about 7:00 p.m.?

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

I hope you had a good trip to Australia.

Are we still on for Friday evening?  Let me know what time, what dress, and
how to get to your home.

We are looking forward to meeting your family.

Let me know if I can bring something.

Jana
