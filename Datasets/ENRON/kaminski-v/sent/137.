Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the 
stay.
I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and 
Amitava, based
on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Vince

Vince:

I am making reservations for Iris to leave for London on Monday, April 30, 
2001.  Iris said you want her to stay 2 weeks and Vasant wants her to stay 1 
week.  I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 
2001.   Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when 
Professor Kulatilaka from Boston University is here.    When do you want her 
to return?  

Thanks.  Anita
