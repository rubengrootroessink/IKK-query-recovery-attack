Dear Vince,

I hope you're doing weel.  Have you heard any feedback about our research

you from forwarding our reports to them daily.  I look forward to your
reply.

As usual, attached are today's issues of our daily morning faxes:
1. Financial Markets Today - FX majors and key bond markets' analyses.
2. Fixed Income Today - US treasuries, agencies, and corporates' analyses.

Best regards,
