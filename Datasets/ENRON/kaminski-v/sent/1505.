Tanya, Naveen,

Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes 
of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas 
portfolio. A big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price 
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big.

If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there 
should be 
no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes. 

Vince

Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic 
process to model the behavior
of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the 
behavior of log-returns. 
Any help is appreciated.

Tanya.

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya
