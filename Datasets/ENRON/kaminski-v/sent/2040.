John,

This is the list of the business teams within ENA I received Tuesday from 
accounting.
As you can see it is hopelessly behind our org chart. I shall bring it up with
accounting.

Attached file consists of a list of Commercial teams within ENA.  According 
to your allocation, 39.61% goes to ENA.  12.5% of the 39.61% goes to Global 
Risk Management and the rest, which is 27.11% needs to allocate to the rest 
of ENA Commercial Teams.  Will you look at the attached file and let me know 
who I should allocate the 27.11% to?  If you have any questions, call me.  
Thanx.
