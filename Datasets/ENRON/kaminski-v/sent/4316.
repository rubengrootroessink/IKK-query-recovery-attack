Today's Focus: The case for network-attached storage
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Amy Larsen DeCarlo

Hyper-efficiency is a prime objective in e-business.  Companies want to
gain a competitive advantage by defining new sales opportunities faster
than their rivals, fulfilling customers information queries quickly,
and cutting their time to market with new products and services.

That often means finding a high-speed mechanism for filing and
retrieving business data.

Network-attached storage (NAS) is one way around the slowdowns and
service interruptions that occur in a conventional file server model.
The shortcomings with the file server model were discussed in last
week=01,s newsletter, but essentially they center on the file server=01,s
role as a gatekeeper.  In this setup, the file server sits in front of
storage systems typically connected to disk arrays by a SCSI bus in a
parallel cabling scheme. File servers read and write all storage
requests from users and other servers, and only one file server has
access to the disks that hold stored files.  The file server can become
a single point of failure or a bottleneck.

NAS effectively moves storage out from behind the server and puts it
directly on the transport network. Unlike file servers that have SCSI
and LAN adapters, a NAS appliance uses a network interface card to
transmit LAN and storage communications.

These specialized storage devices bring with them some major benefits
over file server systems. Because they don=01,t require a file server, any
user with access rights, anywhere on the network, can directly access
stored data.  This removes any delay posed by slow file server hardware
or operating systems.   NAS devices are also optimized to process
storage I/O transactions much faster than conventional parallel SCSI
schemes.

NAS appliances use a common file server access protocol, so they can
process requests from systems around a network, running multiple types
of operating systems. Any system, whether it is a Windows NT server or
a Unix box, can access the NAS device.  This solves cross-platform
issues that arise frequently in today=01,s heterogeneous enterprises.

NAS also mitigates the physical complexity associated with file servers
that use parallel SCSI buses to connect servers to storage disks.  NAS
alleviates the awkward setups of parallel cabling, host bus adapters,
and termination that are part and parcel of a file server
implementation.  Companies simply plug the system into the network and
it is ready to go.  Many NAS appliance vendors claim an installation
takes less than an hour.

Yet for all its advantages over a file server model, one drawback of
NAS is that it shifts storage transactions from parallel SCSI
connections to the production network.   This means the LAN has to
handle both normal end-user traffic and storage disk requests,
including backup operations.

Thus, NAS doesn=01,t resolve one of the core issues associated with file
servers  bandwidth consumption during backups.  Unlike storage-area
networks, which remove back-up traffic from the LAN, NAS still uses the
production network for backup and recovery.

That said, NAS technology still supplies companies with an easy-to-
deploy solution for resolving cross-platform issues while speeding
access to stored files.
