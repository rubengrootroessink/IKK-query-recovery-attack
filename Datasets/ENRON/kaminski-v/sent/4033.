Dear Vince,

Thanks for attending the energy derivatives course, and I hope you found it 
valuable.

There's been some interest from other course attendees to put together a 
contact list and distribute it to one another.  I'm contacting you to see if 
you or Zimin Lu have any objection to being included on the list.  We will 
include only details that you approve, such as name, company name, address 
and email if you wish.

We would like to send out the list early next week, so please let us know.

Thanks,
Julie

PS - how's the chapter?
