Sam,

Do we have a new person to cover?

Good morning, Vince!

Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  If you'd rather not, I 
can probably get a "new person" piece by then.  Also, will Maureen have Part 
2 ready for this coming week?  I hesitate to ask her myself, because I think 
it is a sore subject now.  

Sincerely,

Sam
