Ehud,

November 15 is a bad day for me. I shall be in San Antonio for our
annual management conference.
Practically everybody who  counts in Enron will be there.

Still no response from Louise. I shall catch her tomorrow
in person.

Vince

Vince,

Good morning.

Further to our conversation thereon during your Austin visit 10/11, I am
writing at this time to inquire whether we might schedule a circa 7 p.m.
dinner next Wed. 11/15, to include the participation of your Enron Training
arm colleague.  We could then discuss UT partcipation in Enron training
activities, as well as the forthcoming Spring 2001 Conference.

Best,
Ehud
