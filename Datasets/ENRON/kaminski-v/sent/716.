TradeSpark says online energy trades top $16 bln 

 ? 
NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Online energy exchange Tradespark said Thursday  
it has handled energy trades with a notional value of more than $16 billion  
since trading began on Oct 2, 2000.  

TradeSpark (www.tradespark.com) said natural gas instruments accounted for  
over $9 billion of the trades logged to date, and electricity instruments 
for  
about $6 billion.  

More than 125 companies and roughly 550 traders are registered to use  
TradeSpark to execute their energy trades, the company said in a statement.  

In January, traders who did not work for one of TradeSpark's founding  
partners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent in  
December.  

TradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc. < 
ESPD.O>, brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. <WMB.N> and  
TXU Corp. <TXU.N> and Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS> <SHEL.L> affiliate Coral.  

Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> has announced plans to become a partner at a later date.
