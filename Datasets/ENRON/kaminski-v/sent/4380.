FYI:  

Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very 
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where 
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.  It  appears that Sycamore 
finally got him.  One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical 
equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!  As 
soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to 
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development 
is concerned.  I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly 
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits 
based trading and streaming media applications, etc.  Having such an industry 
expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the 
traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.  Keep in 
mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to 
play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed 
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of 
magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load 
(which we are planning to do!).  

Ravi.


... Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

Hi Ravi.  Fair enough, we will make sure we keep you guys in the loop.  Let
Barb/me know which items we can offload to you guys.

First thing to be done is Barb will schedule a call between us and you all
to gain a better understanding of a number we are trying to back into with
the metro solutions (there are alot of options on our side and we need some
guidelines).  I already talked to John about this this morning so we need to
make some headway on that number.  Also, we are scheduled for a conference
call Wednesday morning with Griebling to discuss where we are at with
initial solutions for metro.  Would you like to join us?

Thursday night, we have a dinner tentatively planned (talk with Griebling
about who, where, etc.).  Friday we will be meeting all day at the Omni in
Interlocken.

Ravi and Jim, per my conversations with John, he is going to run point on
the metro solutions.  Dorn is swamped with other activities.  As for the
switching piece, we discussed our routing software on Monday and I think
that is all we are going to do until Ahi is done then we will set up a
meeting between our guys and the Ahi folks.  The expectation is that this
meeting will occur in the next 30 days.

Also, Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

The best ways to reach me are my cell phone or text pager.  Cell is
303-619-2485 and pager is 888-467-6167 -- you can send me a text message
from either your pager (if you have a 2 way) or press 3 to get an operator.

thanks, Kristin

Jim

Thanks for the info.  We will walk through this information and I am sure we
(Brett and Barb) will have some questions as we are modeling with our
potential metro solutions.  When would you and Ravi be available for a
conference call on Tuesday to discuss?

Also, as far as a meeting, I am trying to recall what you are referencing.
Is it in regards to this or the switching piece?  Will you two be in Denver
all week?  We have a call with Griebling tomorrow regarding our routing
software, so I can talk with him about how he wants to handle this piece.

Talk to you soon, Kristin

Kristin
Attached is the sanitized file promised.
What is the status on next weeks meeting and more specifically, what is the
location?
