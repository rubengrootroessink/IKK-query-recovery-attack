Kristin,

The problem with this guy is that we maxed out on the number of interns we
can gainfully employ and provide adequate supervision. So, we have to pass on 
him.

I hear that you have been in contact with this student.  Do you have any 
interest in hiring him for a summer position?  If not please just let me know 
and I will call him to let him know.

Regards,
Kristin

Dear Ms. Gandy:

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit the Owen
Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt on January 23-24 for on-campus
interviews for the Summer Associate positions at Enron. It was a pleasure
talking with you, and I hope I conveyed to you how excited I am about the
prospect of applying my skills at Enron.

I realize that Enron offers a limited number of positions and greatly
respect your choice of Summer Associates. I would like to ask you if there
is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in
Enron Research Group. (I had a phone interview with Mr. Gibner on January
31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for
free during this summer).

I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail
(Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu). Also, I am always ready to fly
to Houston for additional interviews.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dmitri Villevald
