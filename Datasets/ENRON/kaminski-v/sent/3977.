Julia,

I am sending you a copy of the nondisclosure agreement I received from a  
professor at UT
Austin. Three UT academics developed a model that may be useful in our pricing
applications. They envisage the possibility of either selling this model to 
Enron or of joint research 
effort in this area.

Can you, please, take a look at the attached legal document.

Vince

Dear Vince:

I spoke with Ms Crenshaw yesterday afternoon about a conference call about
developing internet course material.   If you have already discussed this
with your colleagues, it might be helpful if you could very briefly outline
the questions and issues they might raise in the conference call so that I
can be a bit better prepared.

Ms Crenshaw also mentioned that you never received my earlier email
regarding the credit spread model I developed with Stathis and Sergey.  My
earlier email follows, and the nondisclosure agreement is attached.

I look forward to talking with you next week.

regards,

Sheridan
