Title: OPEC: Arguing over Output

Saudi Arabia's announcement earlier this month that it would increase oil 
production by an additional 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) if prices 
remained high ignited a firestorm within OPEC.* The announcement was 
upsetting to fellow OPEC members because

* it was a unilateral statement with no advance consultation

* most observers perceived Saudi Arabia to be acceding to US pressure

* it came on the heels of the June 21 OPEC meeting where a 0.7 mbd production 
increase was adopted with some difficulty

* it seemed to contradict an expressed Saudi view that the oil market was 
fundamentally balanced and that only structural and psychological factors 
were distorting prices

Subsequent to the furor it raised, Saudi Arabia backed away from promptly 
implementing a production increase and sought instead to develop an OPEC 
consensus in favor of higher output.

Saudi Arabia's thwarted initiative has now become enmeshed in the production 
adjustment mechanism advocated over the past year by Venezuelan Oil Minister 
and current OPEC President Ali Rodriguez. Having refrained at the March OPEC 
meeting from accepting the Rodriguez adjustment formula to add or withhold 
0.5 mbd of oil whenever the price of the OPEC crude basket is above or below 
$22-28 per barrel for 20 consecutive working days, Saudi Arabia has sought to 
justify an increase now on the basis of a sustained OPEC basket price above 
$28 per barrel. The market, however, has moved in opposition to the various 
OPEC signals, causing the basket price to fall below $28 on July 17, short of 
the 20-day period. Iran--which adamantly opposes a production increase since 
it is operating at capacity and would see its oil revenue decline--has led 
the opposition to the Saudi initiative and is insisting that the conditions 
specified by the Rodriguez formula have not been met.

The oil market continues to react to contradictory statements by OPEC member 
spokesmen, and on July 18 prices for WTI settled up $1.11 at $31.90 per 
barrel and prices for Brent increased $0.76 to $29.72. This increase was in 
reaction to an OPEC signal that it intends to restart the 20-day price period 
which could delay OPEC action on a production increase by at least four weeks.

Uncertainty about an OPEC production increase is the key factor supporting 
prices. This, in turn, leads to continued pressure on OPEC to implement a 0.5 
mbd production increase. The "20 consecutive day" mechanism is not, however, 
a final arbiter of OPEC production policy. For OPEC members who are amenable 
to the Saudi view on production, the mechanism is more likely to be used as a 
rough gauge of the global market and not as an automatic trigger to implement 
or--as the case may be--to delay a supply increase. In addition, the Saudis 
are capable of acting on their own in the old-fashioned way--quietly further 
increasing output above their quota. More OPEC gyrations are 
coming--including the Secretary General's impending visit to Caracas--but, 
unless the market settles beneath OPEC's upper limit soon, we expect that 
some additional OPEC oil will be produced, however the increase may be 
justified.
