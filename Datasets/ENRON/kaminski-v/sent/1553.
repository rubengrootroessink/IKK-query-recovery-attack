David,

(I was sick) and would like a day or two to review the product.

Specifically it requires the following to get it over the line:

Vince, your concurrence with a simplistic VAR calculation the start - up 
period

Everybody else, your signatures, or agreement to sign via email

In addition, here is the commercial presentation which wil be attached to the
