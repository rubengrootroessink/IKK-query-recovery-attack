Subject: Recommendation letter


Dear Vince,

How are you?

I am just wondering whether you have received the
email I sent to you a couple of weeks back.  In that
email, I asked whether you would have time to write me
a recommendation letter to support my application for
a Master Program (Mathematical Finance) in Columbia
University this coming fall.  If you will be able to
write the letter, would you please let me know?
Thanks a lot.


Best Regards,

Vincent Tang
