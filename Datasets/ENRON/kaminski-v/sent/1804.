Sherri,

Any resolution of the scheduling conflict Jeff Skilling had for February the 
22nd?
Our friends at UT are ready to make the reservations and send out invitations
to this conference

Vince

Rick / Vince:

Good morning.

Further to my discussions with Vince during his visit to the Energy Finance
Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether Mr. Skilling's
assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote
speaker at our Conference.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn
