Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Hi,
I am a Ph.D student at IEOR department at U.C.Berkeley.
Thanks for your presentation today.
It gave me knowledge and interest in electricity markets,
and your company.
As you mentioned in the presentation,
I send a resume to give me opportunity to learn more
about your company.
I hope I can join the super saturday event.

Jinbaek
