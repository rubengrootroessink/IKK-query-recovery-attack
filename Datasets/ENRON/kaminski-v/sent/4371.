Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: Thinking outside the=20
(server) box with Linux
---------------------------------------------
By Phil Hochmuth

Welcome to the first Network World Fusion Focus newsletter on Linux in
the enterprise. With the mountains of information available about Linux,
it can be hard for network professionals to keep up with Linux news that
is fresh and relevant to their jobs. Here each week, you will find Linux
industry news, tips and examples of how Linux is being used in
enterprise networks.  Jumping right in, this week=01,s topic will focus on
how Linux can be used to turn an old PC into a network router.

When people talk about a Linux box, what generally comes to mind is
either a server or client machine running some distribution of Linux.
One way for users to use Linux outside =01&the box=018 is with the Linux
Router Project=01,s distribution of the operating system.

The Linux Router Project (LRP) is a microdistribution of Linux (it fits
on a 1.44M byte floppy) that can be used along with some extra hardware
to turn a variety of low-end PCs into practical, useable network gear.
Additionally, as with most Linux distributions, the software is free.

A variety of different network devices can be put together using LRP.
For instance, using just an Intel 486 PC with a floppy drive, 12M bytes
of RAM and at least two network interface cards, LRP can be used to
assemble a 10M bit/sec Ethernet router. For higher speeds, a Fast
Ethernet router can be assembled with a simple Pentium 100 or higher,
along with 16M bytes of RAM and 10/100M bit/sec network interface cards.
LRP can also be configured as a secondary Domain Name System firewall, a
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service and a WAN router with DSU
functionality. LRP routers support standard routing protocols, such as
Routing Information Protocol and Open Shortest Path First. Advanced
routing protocols are also supported, such as IPX for NetWare networks
and Token Ring.

Building a Linux router out of spare parts can be useful when setting up
a testing environment that requires the simulation of live router
traffic. It=01,s also more practical than disconnecting your live
commercial routing equipment for use in testing purposes. LRP can also
be put into a live production environment as a way to add extra routers
to a network for a minimal cost.

Because Linux routers can be built with standard PC components, the
materials to build one are likely sitting in a storage room or back
closet somewhere in your office. LRP is a completely free, open source
operating system  so if you can program, you can add functions such as
Multi-protocol Label Switching and load balancing to the router by
writing customized code.

If you are not a Linux hacker, odds are someone else has already written
the code for these types of functions. Start at
http://www.linuxsupportline.com
to find these kinds of modules. As with many free software products,
your best source of support for LRP will be the Web. An extensive list
of FAQs and tips on using LRP can be found at
http://www.linuxrouter.org/faq.

Since LRP is developed and distributed mostly by volunteers, download
access to the software is not always very fast. The easiest way to get
it is to log on to http://www.linux-howto.com, which has a search engine
for Linux documentation and free distributions. Type in =01&Linux Router=01=
8
in the search field, and it will let you choose what geographical region
to download the LRP software and source code from for optimal speed. You
can also try several of these mirror sites to download LRP:
