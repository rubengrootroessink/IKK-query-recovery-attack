Erik,

I regret to inform you I had to cancel my presentation. 
I am working on another presentation on the same topic for
a different audience, and I shall send you the slides.

Dear Sir,

Unfortunately I could not attent the INFORMS 2000
meeting in San Antonio. Since I am very interested in
the topic you presented there, I would really like to
read the paper you presented or have a look at the
slides you showed.
Could you please be so kind as to send me a copy of
the paper? Or could you tell me where I might find
your paper (already published)?
Thank you so much.

Yours sincerely,

Erik Pruyt
Free University of Brussels
