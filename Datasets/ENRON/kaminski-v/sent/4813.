I haven't received yet the final Performance Evaluation Results.
The usual practice is to defer the reviews till   the final summary rankings 
are available.

Please, let me know when I can expect it form the HR.

Thanks.

Subject: Mid-Year 2000 Performance Evaluation Due



Sep 01, 2000

THE ABOVE DATE IS WHEN THE MID-YEAR 2000 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION FORMS FOR 
DIRECTORS AND BELOW ARE DUE IN HUMAN RESOURCES.

If you have not already done so, supervisors should begin the process of 
giving feedback to their employees.  The evaluation forms used to provide 
feedback to the employee can be obtained via the Performance Management 
System (PEP).

To download the evaluation forms from PEP, please follow the steps below:

1. Log into PEP at http://pep.enron.com .
2. Under Supervisor Services, click Supervisor Evaluation Forms.
3. Right-click on each employee and choose 'Save Target As...' or 'Save Link 
As...'
4. Select your own personal directory, choose a file name to save to and 
click 'Save'.
5. Repeat for each employee.
6. Now you can complete your evaluation forms from your personal directory 
and will not have to access PEP to finalize the form.

Upon completion, please forward the signed evaluation forms to your HR 
Representative NO LATER THAN Friday, September 1st 2000.

If you have any questions, please contact the PEP Help Desk at the following 
numbers:

In Europe:  44-207-783-4040, Option 4
