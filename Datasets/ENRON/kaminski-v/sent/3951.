Subject: Resignation

This is to let you know that I have resigned from Enron effective June 8.  I 
will be on vacation 5/26 - 6/2 and then return to work 6/5-6/8.  You will be 
notified shortly who your new recruiting partner will be.  In the meantime, I 
will continue to be your liason.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
