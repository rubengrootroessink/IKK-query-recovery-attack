Vince,

I am in Houston (rrived Satruday), and will be in office on Monday (though 
officially, I am on vacation).  Would like to catch up with you if possible.

It looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the DPC 
side.  I have already made a recommendation to Wade.

I am attaching a small memo that I have addressed to Wade on the DPC position 
and possible workout.  This is still a draft and will likely get shared later 
with others.  I would love to get your comments on the same.  At the same 
time, this also will give you some idea of the problem, in conjunction with 
the other Plan presentation I had sent you.

Look forward to touching base with you.

Regards,
Sandeep.
