Happy New Year, GPCM Licensees and Evaluators!

Today I've returned to my office to find our computers working just fine,
thank you.  I hope yours are likewise operational.

In today's e-mail, I received a note from Skipping Stone about a new
service that would be possibly of interest to your traders.

The service seems to involve consolidation of the various pipeline EBBs
continuous updates of capacity release information into a comprehensive
report of available, biddable capacity deals.

Though this information might not be particularly crucial for GPCM users,
it very well might be of interest to your trading organizations.

Here's the website info:  http://www.capacitycenter.com/.

By the way, we are working on a new website dedicated to GPCM.  We would
like to get some feedback on what we have currently and what you would like
to see there to help you improve your GPCM operation.

It's not been "prettified" yet, but you can see a pre-release version at
http://gpcm.rbac.com.

Bob Brooks
