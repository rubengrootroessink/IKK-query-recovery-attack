Dear Dr. Kaminski:

Pierre Ste-Marie tells me he has invited you to visit Carnegie Mellon.  I
would just like to emphasize how much we hope you can arrange a visit.  We
have had the good fortune of attracting outstanding students into our
Master's program in Computational Finance, and I think you will enjoy
meeting them.  Last year Alexander Eydeland visited, and at the conclusion
of the year hired one of the students.  I look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely yours,
Steve Shreve
