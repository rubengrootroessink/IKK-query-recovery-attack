Subject: Message from Anjam S Ahmad

Dear All,

On 25th October I announced my resignation from Enron Europe to pursue other 
opportunities.  I just wanted to say that the past 3 1/2 years has been a 
very interesting and positive experience for me, having been a key part of 
such a dynamic and fast-moving organisation.  Enron is by far the best 
organisation I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have had the 
opportunity to work here and become a shareholder.  I have found it a real 
pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as 
exist within Enron Europe and Enron Corp in Houston & Portland and I 
genuinely wish you the best of success going forward.  I would also like to 
take this opportunity to thank Vince Kaminski, John Sherriff and Richard 
Lewis for hiring me in April 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and 
challenging projects to work on.

I have made some excellent friends at Enron and hope to keep them - I have a 
base in London and will probably be visiting Houston soon, so please feel 
free to stay in touch!

CONTACT:
E-mail:   citywhizkid@hotmail.com (easy to remember!)
Mobile:   0961 111 192
Home:    020 8877 9741
Address: Apt 213, Compass House, Riverside West, Smugglers Way, Wandsworth, 
London SW18

I will be at the Talbot pub tomorrow Friday 27th October from 6pm where I 
hope to catch up with you as a final farewell!

Best wishes for the future!

Anjam
