Vince:

Li Sun called you today.  She is interested in the Research Dept. and wanted 
to set an appt. to visit with you.  I checked your calendar and it is pretty 
tight for the next week or so.  Do you want to visit with her and if so do 
you want me to make the appt. for 2 weeks from now?  She is going to call 
back after 4:00 PM today.  Thanks.  Anita
