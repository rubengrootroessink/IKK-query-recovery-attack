Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to receiving a
copy of your article.

I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether Enron provides
research grants to individuals who are working in the area of Energy Risk
Management.  Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to estimate
electricity spot price.

In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down the
line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because Enron is my
dream job.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,
