As a followup, John Gillespie has expressed interest in participating on the 
panel mentioned below.  To whom should I refer John or should somebody 
contact him?  I just wanted to know what to tell John.

Thanks,
Martin

I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.

John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
a response.

Martin,

Please, take a look at Question 3.
Who is the right person at EBS?

Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek
