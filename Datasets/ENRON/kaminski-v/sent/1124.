Subject: Option hedging.

Hi, Vince:

My name is Eugene Zeitz, and I work for EES Gas Desk. We have some questions 
concerning hedging of options. Usually, we address such questions to Krishna, 
but he is out until Jan 21, and we need some help. 

Would it be possible for you to give us 1 hour of your time, or, perhaps, you 
could recommend someone?


           Thanks.



             Eugene.
