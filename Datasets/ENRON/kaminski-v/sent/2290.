Very well!  Here is the text of Brad's bio piece.

-----------------

I began working for the Research Group here at Enron in mid-May as a summer=
=20
intern.  I started work back-testing storage models immediately after the=
=20
Spring semester, and I have enjoyed every minute since then. =20

I am pursuing a B.S. and a professional Masters degree in Chemical=20
Engineering at Rice University, and plan to graduate with both degrees next=
=20
May.  I went to a small high school in Fort Worth, and Rice was the perfect=
=20
place to go from there because of its size and location.  I have taken=20
primarily chemistry, biochemistry, and engineering courses while at Rice, a=
nd=20
during the past summers I have worked in chemistry research labs in Fort=20
Worth. =20

Outside of work and school, I am an avid baseball fan and appreciate good=
=20
music and cooking (though my cooking can at times be unpredictable.)  I hav=
e=20
grown to love Houston as a city, and though I=01,ll never concede that it i=
s=20
better than my hometown of Fort Worth, it has been a great place in which t=
o=20
go to school and work.

Since my education thus far has been somewhat limited to Chemical=20
Engineering, I have valued this opportunity to work in the Research Group,=
=20
both as a chance to use engineering techniques that I have learned, and to=
=20
learn more about the business world than I would have by simply taking=20
economics classes.  I am not certain what I will do upon graduating from=20
Rice, but my experience here has taught me that my opportunities are much=
=20
greater and better than I had previously thought. =20
