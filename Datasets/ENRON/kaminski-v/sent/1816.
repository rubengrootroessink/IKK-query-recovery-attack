Stinson,

I think it's a mistake. It  should be February.

Celeste, 

I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:

"My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
start date 
of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
Looking forward to working at Enron.

Thanks a million,
Datren W."

Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
have
a specific date for him, or may he choose?

Thanks, Celeste,
Carol
