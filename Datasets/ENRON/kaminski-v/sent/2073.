Mark:

F.Y.I. - I have been informed by Ketra that she plans to be in the Houston 
office on Monday September 18th through Wednesday September 20th to meet with 
Vince and Stinston.  

Hopefully we will be ready to continue Phase I of the Forecasting Project.  
Can you make arrangements with Vince and Stinson (hopefully they will be 
available to meet!).

Thanks!
