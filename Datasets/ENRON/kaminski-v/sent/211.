FYI,

I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  
Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  
I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for 
$145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross 
Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove 
both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.
