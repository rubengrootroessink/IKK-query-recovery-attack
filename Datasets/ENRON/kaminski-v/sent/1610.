Frank,

Dec 14   would be  better for us. We have already scheduled
an internal presentation on December 7.  Please, go ahead and make a 
reservation.
The best place to stay is Hyatt Regency Downtown or Doubletree Downtown
(within a walking distance to Enron). It is important to specify the downtown 
location for both hotels.

Vince

Sounds good, Vince.  How about Dec 7?  The roundtrip coach fare, regardless of
airline, is about $1900.  I hope that won't break the bank.  Once I have your
approval, I'll go ahead and book it.  Best, Frank
