Subject: Lunch for Staff Meeting July 20th

 July 20th we will celebrate Shirley's birthday therefore I asked her
if she would mind if I ordered lunch for the staff meeting whereby she
can relax during that  time period. (without pressure to get the lunch ready)

On July 20th I would like too  have a different caterer for our lunch ,they 
will basically
serve the same menu with a different style hopefully the group will enjoy
the meal.

The menu will include : assorted sandwiches
                                                         chips
                                                        soup
                                                     Iced Tea
                                                                              
                       (vegetarian sandwiches included)

Please Vince, inform me if this is okay !



                      Thanks

F.Y.I.       the price range is very close to what Marriott charges per person
