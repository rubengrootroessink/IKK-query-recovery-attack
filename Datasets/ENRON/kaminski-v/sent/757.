Subject: Experience Enron Feedback

I would like any feedback you have concerning your guests that toured Enron 
this past week.  I have attached two feedback forms, one for Professor 
Lasden's visit and and another for the Rice Students, or you may just jot 
down whatever feedback you have for us.

Thank you.

Jennifer
