Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.


Vince

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is 
not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him 
with no trouble at all.

Thanks,
Anne
