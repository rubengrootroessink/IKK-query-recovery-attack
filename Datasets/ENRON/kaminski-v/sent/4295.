Good morning Vince,

Sorry to have missed you at your office this morning.  Attached are today's
issues of our daily morning faxes:
1. Fixed Income Today - US treasuries, agencies, and corporates' analyses,
2. Financial Markets Today - FX majors and key bond markets' analyses.

How useful do you find our research?  Also, do you mind if contact your
colleagues directly to get their feedback?  That will save you time  from
forwarding this info to them daily.  Please let me know whom I may contact.

Best regards,
Vadim Pokhlebkin
