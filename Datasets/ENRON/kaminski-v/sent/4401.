Steve,

No problem.

Grant will speak in place, but RISK may not be aware of it yet.
You can just register as my guest.

Vince

Hi Vince

Do you get your regular freebie "ticket" for the Risk conference in 
Amsterdam?  (You know what I'm going to ask next...)  It looks like there's 
some interesting stuff, and attending would certainly broaden my horizons.

Would you kindly consider bringing me along?

Cheers,
Steve
