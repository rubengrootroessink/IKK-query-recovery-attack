Tiger Team Hosts:

Happy New Year!  It is almost time for the students to return to school (Jan
16) and begin spring semester classes (FAP).
Before we know it, it will be time for the Mid-Project Review and I would
like to schedule times with you now for planning purposes.  As part of your
Host Responsibilities, there are several ways to accomplish the Mid-Project
Reviews (see options). Generally, you should allow 2 hours, with each of the
three teams presenting (20-30 min each) and Q & A's. The dates are below.
Times will be listed, as well.  Times are dictated by the students class
schedules and availability of space. I will schedule the Reviews on a
first-come, first basis, so please contact me no later then Friday, Jan 26,
2001.

Options:

1. You may come to campus.  If this is the case, please let me know as soon
as possible.

2. You may videoconference in for the presentation, should you have that
capability.  Let me know the phone-in number.


Please specify date and preferred time slot:
