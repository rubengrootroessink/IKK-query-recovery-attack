Subject: PRC Feedback forms

Mr. Kaminski:

I would like to try to get on your schedule for a few moments this week to 
discuss the draft  PRC 360 evaluation forms (provided below for your info) to 
ensure that the criteria and skills and behaviors we have used are adequate 
for your employee population.  The generic forms that were presented at the 
PRC Committee meeting a week ago may best reflect commercial employees, and 
to some extent commercial support employees, and may not be entirely 
appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical 
areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time 
permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the 
organization.  

One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting  
evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, 
another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to 
the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would 
welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about 
this. 

   




Many Thanks, 
Gina Corteselli
