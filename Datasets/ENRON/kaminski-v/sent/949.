Khairuddin,

Yes, it's correct. We have experienced problems replying to a number of 
messages
sent by your organization (not just your E-mail address). I shall send you 
the list of people 
who will attend the meeting at a later day. We shall have representatives 
from the crude and LNG trading
desks, research and risk control.

Could you, please, resend me the list of your delegates.

Vince 

I have invited a number

Vince,

It was brought to my attention that something was wrong with my 'reply to:'
      function of my email resulting in difficulties to reply to my email.
      Below is the e-mail that I've sent to you earlier and I believe this
      time, I will receive your reply.

Thanks,

Regards,

Khairuddin

Vince,

Thank you for your prompt reply. We have received your fax earlier this
morning. FYI, we shall be sending you the questionaires by next week as we
are going through the final draft this week. Could you please tell me who
will be joining the discussion during our visit? Thanks.

Regards,

Khairuddin
