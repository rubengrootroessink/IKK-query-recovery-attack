Dear Vince,

As the above event is drawing closer, I thought I would write a quick email 
to finalise a few things with you.  I understand that you would like a guest 
to attend, please can you let me know their name and job title.  Also, if you 
could send me your conference checklist I would appreciate it, so that I can 
finalise details with my audio visual company.

In the meantime, if there is anything I can do for you, please do not 
hesitate to let me know on 0171-915-5116.

Kind Regards
Crystal
