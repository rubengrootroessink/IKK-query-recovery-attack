Subject: Leaving Enron

The time I have spent at Enron has been the most fulfilling of my 
professional career.  I have enjoyed great success with Enron; made many 
friends and feel I have helped contribute to the company being recognized as 
a leader of innovation.  Having said that, it was with enormous sadness that 
I must tell you I have tenured my resignation to Beth Perlman earlier today.
I want to thank each of you for all that you have done for me and with me in 
my employment here at Enron.  It's been a pleasure working with you and an 
honor representing this company. 
If you would like to reach me please feel free to call or e-mail:
