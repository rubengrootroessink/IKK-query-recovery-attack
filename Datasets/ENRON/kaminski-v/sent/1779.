Steve,

Elena Chilkina can give you historical data.
Historical fwd curves can be obtained from Paulo
or Alex, among others. Of course, our internal forward curves
represent a very sensitive information.

Subject: Power question

Hi Vince

Who should I contact for power queries now Grant has gone?  A colleague here 
in London (Didier Magne) is giving a talk on power/gas arbitrage, and the 
consequent convergence of these markets.  

Do you have any presentations on this area, or illustrative figures on the 
increase in power/gas correlation?

Many thanks,
Steve
