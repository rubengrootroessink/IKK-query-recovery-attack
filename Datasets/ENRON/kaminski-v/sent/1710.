Managing Director and Head of Research
Enron Corp.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,
It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.
I am a graduate student in Industrial Engg. and Operations
Research working with Prof. Shmuel Oren
on topics in financial instrument pricing and design of
contracts in deregulated electricity markets. I am also
doing research in auction models and computable equilibrium
models with applications in electricity market design.

I am planning to graduate with a Ph.D. in May 2001 and would
appreciate hearing about any opportunities in your group at Enron.
I am attaching at copy of my resume (file: cvrkamat.doc) for your perusal.

Thanking you,
Sincerely,

Rajnish Kamat
