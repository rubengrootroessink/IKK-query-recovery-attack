Goodmorning ,

It's almost that time again.

We have Christmas Cards available for you to send out
to whomever you feel you would like to extend a Enron
Christmas Cheer.

For the newcomers this is one way we share the Christmas
spirit and stay in touch with those we work with daily or
occasional.

Please inform as too how many cards you think well be 
needed and if by chance you need assistance getting
them out in time , please contact me and I will take care 
of this for you.

Remember , Christmas is right around the corner.


                                 Thanks
                            Kevin Moore
