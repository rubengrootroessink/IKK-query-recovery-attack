CONFERENCE THEMES & OBJECTIVES

E-Commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry.  This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
E-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a "winner" when the shakeout
hits, full-force.

Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emerging
markets.  An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.  As competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.

Few eCommerce markets--whether e-tailing online exchanges or others---will
be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts.  This conference will
combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with the
latest thinking about the unique features of E-commerce, to identify
successful strategies for surviving a shakeout.

Questions to be addressed include:

- Are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
applicable to eCommerce?  What are the early warning signs of an impending
shakeout?

- Which eCommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout?  Will there
be single or multiple winners?

- Which companies are likely to survive?  What strategies will the winners 
use?

There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
contribute to prospects for survival.  How important are first mover
advantages and building brand equity?  What do incumbents have to do to
prevail?  Which business models are most robust?  How important is the
ability to manage strategic partnerships?

These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia and
Wall Street.

The conference will be held in Steinberg-Dietrich Hall which is located on
Locust Walk on the Wharton campus in Philadelphia.  From the airport or
train station take a taxi to the intersection of 37th Street and Walnut,
walk LEFT onto the campus (there is a broad paved walkway leading into the
campus from that intersection).  At the first intersection you will see a
life sized bronze status of Ben Franklin sitting on a park bench reading a
newspaper.  Turn LEFT at this intersection and Steinberg-Dietrich Hall is
the first building on the Right.  There is a broad entrance with several
doors.  Also, any student can direct you to this building.  Go inside and
take the staircase DOWN to the right -- ROOM 350 is on the LOWER (basement)
level.

Overnight accommodations are available at the Inn At Penn which is across
the street from the campus (tel  215-222-0200 - mention you are here for
the Emerging Tech conference on E-Commerce Shakeouts, to receive the

the Inn is often fully booked.    We have reserved a set of rooms for this
event.

If you stay at another hotel in Center City, most hotels (Rittenhouse,
Latham, Ritz Carlton) are approximately 15 minutes by taxi from the campus.
There is also a Sheraton approximately 3 blocks from the campus, on
