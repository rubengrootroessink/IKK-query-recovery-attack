This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.
