Ken

A tour would be great (after 10:30, if they can make it).

Please, let Shirley know about the meeting.

Vince,

19C is available and reserved for 9 am to 10:30, Wednesday.  

Would you like me to try and arrange a tour for the students or should we 
wait until we know more about their interests?  

Are their some other Enron folks you would like to invite for Wednesday?
