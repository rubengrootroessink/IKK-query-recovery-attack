I trust things are well in Houston.

The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the 
week
commencing Monday 18th September.   I and several of my colleagues would very
much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference
between Tuesday through to Friday of that week.

Is there any chance in meeting with you on Monday 18th?  If so, I will brief 
you
more fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.

Regards, ALLAN
