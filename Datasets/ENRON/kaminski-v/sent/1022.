Zimin,

Can you interview this guy? Maybe Tanya, a math Ph.D. can help as well.

Subject: Interview Candidate

Zimin, 
Happy new year! 
The financial trading group is looking at a potential candidate for a general 
financial trading position in Japan and was wondering if someone from your 
area wouldn't mind testing this candidates mathematical skills. She has a 
Masters in Stochastic Mathematics  and both a math/liberal arts undergrad. I 
feel it is important to test her grasp of the subjects she would have studied 
and know that someone from your area would be best suited in providing some 
feedback on this. 
The candidate's name is Yumi Imokawa. If you don't mind, could I please 
schedule a telephone interview for 20 minutes or so? The ideal time is Tokyo 
mornings (so for example, at 5:00 in the evening Houston time any day that 
you are available..I will just have the candidate call your point person 
directly.


Sincerely,
Darren
