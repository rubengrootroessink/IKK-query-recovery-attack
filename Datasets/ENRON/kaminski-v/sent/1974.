Vince,

After looking at the article in question, I have a couple of questions:

1.  Normally I would want to split this into two parts, but the way it's 
structured (several references to the charts at the end), this does not look 
immediately practical.  We would certainly need Maureen's input on this.  
Without any further changes, I would want to publish the whole thing together.

2.  I assume that Maureen will send the changes back to you, and that you 
will send me the final version for publication.  Am I correct?

I'll do everything else and hold release until Technical Corner is ready.

Sam

Maureen,

The article for Technical Corner requires some editorial work.
Please, make sure you make the changes ASAP.

My comments are in magenta. You will see them when you open the attachment.
