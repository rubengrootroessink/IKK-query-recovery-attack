NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM
on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Today's focus: What=01,s holding back ASP adoption?

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: What=01,s holding back ASP=20
adoption?
---------------------------------------------
By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim

The application service provider (ASP) market has been growing by leaps
and bounds.  What used to be a nascent market has expanded from
addressing niche enterprise needs to providing significant IT support
for many Fortune 500 companies.

However, there are still significant impediments to wide acceptance of
applications outsourcing.  Two major deterrents have to do with older
business concerns.

One significant problem that has been addressed only tangentially by
ASPs is the fact that corporate IT departments are, more often that not,
dependent on less than cutting edge technologies.  Many established
companies have, over the years, made significant investments in legacy
technologies.  The fury over Y2K attests to the high number of mainframe
computers still using first-generation code.  Such organizations may
have added a great deal of newer technology, but concerns over the older
applications may be preventing them from taking advantage of application
hosting.  Even if there were an ASP willing to address the entire
solution, including legacy systems, doubt about the viability of handing
off archaic yet mission-essential systems may prevent an enterprise from
handing over support of these applications.  While the ASP may offer a
more cost-effective solution, the fear is that it may not be able to
offer the depth of experience necessary to work with older technology.

Security is the second dynamic that tends to retard ASP acceptance.
Although most ASPs are able to maintain the proper level of security
necessary for critical information, many IT departments find the idea of
putting that information in the hands of a third party too daunting.
There are some businesses with huge IT investments that absolutely
cannot take chances with information leakage.  Local telephone service
providers, because of their Federal Communication Commission regulators,
come to mind.

A simple pitch of cost avoidance or cost reduction is rarely sufficient
to sway IT mangers in such organizations.  They are thinking about the
care and feeding of cranky old mainframes that run a million lines of
COBOL and manage highly proprietary customer information.  Only when
ASPs are willing to spend the time to understand the needs of such a
complex IT environment will they truly be able to introduce services
fully capable of addressing all the security and legacy issues involved.

Until such an enlightened ASP comes along, there are still several ways
to start moving to outsourcing for IT managers coping with a legacy or
highly sensitive environment.  First, consider whether a full
outsourcing solution is the only option.  It may be that there=01,s a
subset of the IT architecture that is appropriate for an ASP to take on.
It may also be possible to find an ASP to partner with and gradually
migrate support of legacy systems as the ASP learns the systems and
their requirements.

One thing is certain: legacy systems are not going away anytime soon.
It=01,s also just as certain that application service provision is the way
of the future.  ASPs let enterprises offload an expensive and time-
consuming technical function.

As the ASP market matures, this column will examine issues such as these
from both the user and the vendor perspectives.  To ensure we address
the topics you are interested in, we invite your comments and questions.
