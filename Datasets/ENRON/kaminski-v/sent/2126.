Stinson,

No problem. I shall forward the letter to HR
to enter this information into the company's records.

I hope you will have good time and come back with fresh dose
of energy.

Vince

Vince,

After eight years of working for Enron, I would like to take some additional 
time off.   If possible, I would like to take three weeks of leave without 
pay, beginning September 25 and continuing through October 13th, 2000.

Thank you,

Stinson Gibner
