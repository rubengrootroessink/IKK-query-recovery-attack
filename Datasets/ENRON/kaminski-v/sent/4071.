Today's focus: Getting Linux-certified
---------------------------------------------
By Phil Hochmuth

Most networking professionals are probably familiar with certification
programs for various operating systems and technologies. With more
enterprises using Linux, several companies have started to offer Linux
certification and training.

One of the most popular programs is run by - not surprisingly - the top
Linux company, Red Hat. The leading Linux distributor offers training
and certification of its product for network professionals in a program
similar to system-specific certifications such as Certified Novell
Engineer and Microsoft Certified Software Engineer.

Red Hat=01,s Certified Engineer (RHCE) program is a five-day course that
consists of four one-day labs followed by a certification test taken on
the fifth day. Prerequisites for the course include knowledge of basic
Intel- and Intel clone-based hardware architecture, familiarity with
basic Unix file structure and shell programming, TCP/IP networking
skills and network administration experience. The test can also be
taken on its own, without the four days of labs.

Unlike the widely accessible Microsoft or Novell certification programs,
RHCE courses and tests are only available at Red Hat training
facilities in Durham, N.C., Portland, Ore., San Francisco and Santa
Clara. The course costs $2,498; the test can be taken alone for $749.

Red Hat certification can be valuable for companies investing heavily
in Red Hat Linux as an alternative network operating system, or for IT
professionals looking for a certification feather in their caps.
However, the program has been criticized by some for its poor
accessibility and high cost. The single-distribution focus of the
training has also been at issue with some Linux users looking for
certification options.

For Linux certification and training that isn=01,t tied to any specific
distribution, the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) has less expensive
certification test offerings.

LPI offers basic, advanced and expert levels of Linux certification.
The beginning level certifies users beyond a basic help desk or
power-user level of knowledge. Prerequisites for this course are equal
to the Red Hat program. The second level requires more in-depth study
for people looking for a system administrator=01,s level of certification.
The third level is for certification in more advanced and specialized
areas, such as database server administration or kernel and device
driver development. Each level involves two tests, which cost $100 each
to take. Currently, only the requirements for the first level of the
LPI program have been finalized; requirements for the second and third
levels could change in the near future. LPI=01,s tests are administered
through Virtual University Enterprises=01, 1,700 test centers worldwide.
Among LPI=01,s backers are Caldera, SuSE, Linuxcare, IBM and TurboLinux.

Another option for distribution-neutral Linux certification is the Sair
GNU and Linux Certification program. Similar to the LPI model, the
program offers three levels of certification: Linux Certified
Administrator (LCA) for basic administrative-level certification; Linux
Certified Engineer (LCE) for advanced system managers; and Master Linux
Certified Engineer (MLCE) for senior systems managers. Four tests are
required for each level of certification, with LCA, LCE and MLCE
programs currently available. Certification tests cost $99 each and can
be taken at 2,000 Sylvan Prometric testing centers worldwide.
