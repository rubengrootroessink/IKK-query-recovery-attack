Vince:

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between
Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about
this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Cantekin Dincerler
