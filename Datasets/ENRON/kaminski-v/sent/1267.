Jim,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I was traveling 
extensively  
and was overwhelmed with many different projects.

I shall be glad to speak at the Gamma Iota Sigma dinner. Unfortunately, I 
cannot make
a presentation to your class (it would require leaving the office for two 
days in a row).

I can, however, promise to come on another day and speak to your students.

I hope everything is going well for you. By the way, your former student, 
Shane Green, has joined us
for 12 month and is doing exceptionally well.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX.? My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing.?? I am curious whether your 
schedule might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as 
our dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a 
national risk management fraternity.? For that matter, would you also 
possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate 
students on the previous day (Thursday, February 22)?? What I have in mind is 
a presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes.? 

Thank you for your consideration of this request.? I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
