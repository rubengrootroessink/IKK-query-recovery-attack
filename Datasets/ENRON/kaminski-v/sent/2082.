                            Hello  Mr. Kaminski,

                               Can we  meet for a quick lunch again at your 
convenience? Just to bring you up to date about my search for the right 
opportunity. Also I noticed in the Risk magazine that Enron Investment 
Partners and AIG have joined TreasuryConnect as strategic partners to 
capitalize on internet-based transaction execution of financial derivatives. 
I would like to explore if I can be any help to Hank Finkenstaedt, the 
Director of Enron Investment Partners.

                            Please let me know what day and time might be 
convenient for you.


Thank you.

Sincerely,

                            Dear Mr. Kaminski:

                            I would  like to explore the opportunity to join 
Enron Investment Partners. I understand that Enron has $20 million fund set 
up to finance start-ups, and Gene Humphreys and his assistant John Godbold 
are trying to attract minority -owned start-up firms. I also learned that 
Enron has plans to increase the size of this fund to $200 million. I can find 
these opportunities for Enron around the Globe. Given my background as a 
Chartered Financial Analyst, with hands-on experience in investment 
management covering financial derivatives, fixed income, and equity, I can be 
a valuable resource to do the due diligence, origination, valuation, and 
monitoring of these start-ups. Would you please help me arrange a meeting 
with either Gene Humphreys, Ted Murphy, or may be Ken Lay?

I am pasting below the job opportunities open at Enron. I am also interested 
in these positions and would like to meet with the hiring manager.

I will give you a call to follow up.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
