Stinson,

We can  offer him a job. The problem is, he has about 2 more years to go.

Shelley,

One question.   For the summer associates who we would be interested in as 
permanent hires, how do we proceed?    Is there a way of communicating to 
them that we have an intention of extending an offer?   Cantekin Dincerler 
would be one person who would be an excellent addition to our group.   He is 
debating about going to industry or trying to find an academic position after 
he finishes his Ph.D.      Giving him some incentive to seriously consider 
Enron now might have an effect on his plans for next year.

Regards,

Stinson
