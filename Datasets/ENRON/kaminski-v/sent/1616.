Frank,

Yes, I would be very interested in meeting with you in Houston in December.
The best day for visit would be Thursday when my group has a lunch meeting
and you could meet the rest of the research unit.

Please, let me know what day would work for you. We shall be very glad to
cover the cost of your trip.

Vince

Hi Vince,
Are you still interested in my visiting for a day, perhaps in Dec or
Jan?  I have begun a project on unobserved-components modeling of
weather patterns, so it would be productive and fun to compare notes.
Best,
Frank
