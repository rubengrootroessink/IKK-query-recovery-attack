Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

George
