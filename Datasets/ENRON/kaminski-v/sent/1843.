John,

Congratulations on a career move.

Yes, we were contacted regarding geophysical data gathering/transmission 
project.
We asked our geophysicists for help and are shooting for
a meeting on  Thursday to run our ideas by them.

Vince

Good Morning Vince:

1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  

I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
Have they contacted you yet?

2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
for you or your team to help out.
