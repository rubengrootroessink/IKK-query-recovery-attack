Julie,

A clarification. We had an agreement with Chris and Les to contribute  AUS 
10,000
as a part of the cost.

Julie,

As the book is about to be released to the  market, I would like to start
the
process to issue the check to Lacima.  Who will be the payee (Lacima) and
what
is the  address?


Vince
