Chris,

My part has not changed for some time (since early July).

I sent  the last vintage of corrections  to you when I was in Sydney.
You can send the version you consider final to us just to double check.

I took the liberty of sending our chapter to Darrell Duffie and he liked it.
What is more important he did not find any error.


I shell send you my comments on the article for Robin in a day or so.

Vince

Hi Vince,
?
How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have  the latest version of your 
part of chapter 3? (I think GRant has sent thru a  seperate, updated version 
to you, which has been typeset). Everything else has  been tied up and we 
will go with the version we have, unless we hear  otherwise.
?
Many thanks and best regards.
?
Chris.
