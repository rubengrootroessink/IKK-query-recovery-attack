Dear Vince,

Once again, sorry to have missed you at your office this morning.  Have you
heard any feedback about our research from your colleagues?  I really hate
to bother you with this.  Please let me know whom I may contact: that will
save you from forwarding our reports to them daily.

As usual, attached are today's issues of our daily morning faxes:
1. Financial Markets Today - FX majors and key bond markets' analyses.
2. Fixed Income Today - US treasuries, agencies, and corporates' analyses,

Best regards,
Vadim Pokhlebkin
