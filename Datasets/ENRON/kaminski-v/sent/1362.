Gentlemen,

 Spoke to Vince K today and asked if he would send Stinson Gibner to Sidney 
to be available on Monday to review the X system.
Paul, make sure our X friends are available and the Confidentially Agreement 
is signed.  Further, I spoke to Phillip B. about a technical going too.

G'day mates,

Gary
