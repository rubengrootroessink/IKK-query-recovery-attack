Vince:

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to organize 
the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael Crew of 
Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th anniversary 
conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate 
what we have learned and what we haven't about the economics of network 
industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other 
distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for 
the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the 
Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 
24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of 
the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL:

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be 
pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing 
your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a 
problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a 
short Q&A period.

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron 
in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your 
schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael 
and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the 
nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if this is a go.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Paul
