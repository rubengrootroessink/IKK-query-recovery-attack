Attached are the Guidelines and the Budget Template for the 2001 - 2003 
Operating & Strategic Plan. 



 A Budget Template should be completed for each Cost Center in your 
area/group that will be utilized for 2001.  All budgets are due to Corp. 
Financial Planning no later than close of business August 14, 2000.

While Corporate Financial Planning has attempted to make the process as easy 
as possible, we know questions will arise.  Please feel free to contact me at 
X37775 with any questions or problems.

Thanks in advance.

Dawn
