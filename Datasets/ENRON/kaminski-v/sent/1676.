Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I would like to know at what time you are arriving so I can plan a
"welcoming party" . Depending on your arrival time I will plan a tour of the
school and a short meeting with the staff and the recruiting center. I have
reserved a table for ten at 7.00pm at the Georges Town Hill on Friday the
3rd.

Please inform me of the details of your trip, and let me know If I can be of
further assistance.

Sincerely,

Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie
