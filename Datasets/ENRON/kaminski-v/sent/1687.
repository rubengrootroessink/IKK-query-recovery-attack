Steve,

All these provisions make a lot of sense. Anjam showed very poor judgment one 
more time.
He got a very generous offer to move to Houston.

I recommend keeping him on the payroll, and at home, as long as possible.

Vince

I will sit Anjam down before he leaves and explain the confidentiality 
provisions in his contract and that we will pursue them vigorously.  Melanie 
- can you give me a copy, Steve, let me know when he is leaving - I'll do it 
closer to the time.

Subject: Actions on Anjam's resignation

All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

Steve
