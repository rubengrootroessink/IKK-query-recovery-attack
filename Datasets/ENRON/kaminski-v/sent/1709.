Ashley,

This is one resume I got today. I think that it makes sense to invite him
for an interview directly with my group. He does not qualify as an analyst 
candidate.
What do you think?

Vince

Dear Dr. Kaminski,
It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.
I am a graduate student in Industrial Engg. and Operations
Research working with Prof. Shmuel Oren
on topics in financial instrument pricing and design of
contracts in deregulated electricity markets. I am also
doing research in auction models and computable equilibrium
models with applications in electricity market design.

I am planning to graduate with a Ph.D. in May 2001 and would
appreciate hearing about any opportunities in your group at Enron.
I am attaching at copy of my resume (file: cvrkamat.doc) for your perusal.

Thanking you,
Sincerely,

Rajnish Kamat
