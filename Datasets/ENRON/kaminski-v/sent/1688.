Subject: Boss 's Day

This message is pertaining to the celebration the Weather Team
had with Mike Roberts.

We celebrated with Mike on Boss's Day Oct. 16th.

We the  Weather Team felt that time spent with our Boss was 
just as valuable as any token of appreciation.

We did Happy Hour @ Ninfa's

Mike you will not have a token in the staff meeting today 
however, please know that you are a great Boss too.

We still would like for you to join the others in celebrating
and we would like to have lunch with you.


                                         Thanks
                                     Kevin Moore

Hope to see you there !
