Michael and Steve -

Thanks for coming to the Risk Forum luncheon today, we enjoyed hearing about 
the new business opportunity.

Attached is a first draft of the approval form we'll want to circulate to the 
various functional signers for approval prior to sending to Rick Buy and 
Skilling for approval and granting of the limits - after we've completed.  I 
cut and pasted from information you provided, and have highlighted the areas 
that are missing information.  Please review and coordinate with the various 
functions and get back to David Port or to me with the missing information or 
any comments you have.

As for the Risk Assessment, we might want to take a look at that - I just cut 
and pasted the SWOT analysis in from the business plan so far.  I'll talk to 
David.  If any of the functional areas have specific issues we should 
document that will need to be addressed later at some point, let's make a 
note of them in this interim policy document so we don't lose track of them.

I'm also enclosing the Authorized Trader List  and Authorized Products List 
that will need to be completed once we figure out who will be designated the 
official head trader for this commodity group (will that be you?  Wade 
Dosier?), and the presentation prepared by you for those who did not receive.




As far as Market Risk Management, we work as a team here, so feel free to 
contact either David at x39823 or me at x30429 - I handle the risk policy and 
procedures side, whereas David  is taking the lead on this new initiative 
from a market risk perspective and will be addressing specific business and 
technical issues.  Christian LeBroc at x58062 will also be working for David 
reviewing the quantitative risk parameters.  

Regards,
Cassandra.
