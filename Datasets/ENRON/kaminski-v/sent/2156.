I read the chapter. Generally,
I like it, and find it non-controversial
and well written. Of course, this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven't discussed.

I thought the amount of attention
paid to OLS and MLE estimation
was a bit overboard, given that you
didn't really exploit it in your
results. If you were to state
the likelihood function for
the GARCH model, it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes, which could then
be thought of as a simple lead-in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use.

By the way, in your discussion of
smiles, you discuss fat tails
extensively. At least for equity markets,
while fat tails contribute, they don't do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia, which you allude to briefly,
using supply-demand language, at the
end of that section.

For the impact of risk premia, see
Jun Pan's paper, which is available
from her web page. But she covers
only SP500, (as do most studies),
and your markets are obviously much different.

The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

Best, Darrell
