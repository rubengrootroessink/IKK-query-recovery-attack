Dear Dr. Kaminski,
Thanks for your email address. Would like to invite you or others from Enron
to our one-day planning meeting in Houston, Sept. 7, to review state of the
art assessment of ancillary services markets, hear preliminary research on
related topics, and help define a course of research that EPRI could
undertake.

Here is one of our announcements. Pls feel free to call with any questions.
