THE GOVERNMENT of Maharashtra wants New Delhi to convince the Power Trading=
=20
Corporation, a central utility, to buy power from Dabhol and sell it across=
=20
the country.It would be far simpler if Dabhol  and all independent power=20
producers  were allowed to sell power to whoever was willing to pay for=20
it.That, unfortunately, is not allowed by law, which forces private sector=
=20
generators to sell power only to state utilities, which in turn, are not=20
permitted to sell power across states on their own.=20

Most state electricity boards are bankrupt . MSEB reportedly owes central=
=20
utilities Rs 5,000 crore. They cannot bring themselves to charge many types=
=20
of users for the power consumed, nor can they prevent large-scale theft of=
=20
electricity. Few, including wealthy Maharashtra, have the will to reform=20
state electricity boards and privatise transmission and distribution. Given=
=20
this profile of buyers, private generators demand sovereign guarantees to=
=20
help them tide over default risks. But the guarantees merely insulate IPPs=
=20
against risk. They cannot make SEBs solvent. Yet, India needs power=20
desperately. Maharashtra, India=01,s richest state, experiences power short=
ages=20
of around 2,000 MW, about a sixth of its peak needs.=20

Over time, the hunger for power will only grow. India cannot afford to wait=
=20
for the painful politics of SEB reform to work themselves out. The governme=
nt=20
should bring in legislation that allows IPPs to sell power directly to payi=
ng=20
customers.This will free IPPs from the clutches of bankrupt monopsony buyer=
s.=20
The power trading legislation will have unexpectedly happy consequences for=
=20
the government too.Once IPPs are freed from their onerous obligations to se=
ll=20
power to single, mostly bankrupt buyers, their default risks will come down=
=20
substantially. New Delhi and state governments should then scrap the=20
guarantees that they gave IPPs in the past.=20
The combination of power trading, private investments in generation,=20
transmission and distribution, and gradual SEB reform  will create a=20
commercial, workable and competitive power market in India. Anything less=
=20
will be a recipe for disaster.=20

The Maharshtra government's finance department, which is striving to reduce=

fiscal deficit from Rs 9,484 crore to Rs 3,484 crore by the beginning of=20
April this year, has expressed its inability to provide a sales tax waiver =

naphtha from the state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).=20

Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express on Wednesday that DPC would=
=20
have to pay 4 per cent sales tax. "The government, way back in 1995, has=20
modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of napht=
ha=20
from Gujarat by electrical companies operating in Maharashtra. The decision=
=20
was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphth=
a=20
at reduced rates within the state," government sources added. Sources said=
=20
that these companies had to pay nearly 15.3 per cent sales tax on naphtha=
=20
that was procured from Gujarat. However, following their representation, th=
e=20
government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent.
=20
The state finance department's opinion, which would be presented before the=

state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision, deserves special=

significance especially when the state energy department and the loss-makin=

Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have wholeheartedly supported th=

to its consumers. DPC had also told the state government that it had not pa=

for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burde=

They have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales t=
