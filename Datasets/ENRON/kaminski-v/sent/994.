Vince:  As you requested, I have obtained some information from Norma 
relating to the salary parameters of the Sr. Director position.   The minimum 
salary is $83,800, and the maximum is $168,000 (huge range, isn't it?).   
However, Norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention:  the 
lowest salary of a VP in your group is currently $140,000, and the average 
director's salary in your group is $120,000.    Those numbers narrow the 
range considerably.   Of course, there is no equity issue since there is no 
other senior director in your group.

Hope this information helps,
Molly
