Helen,

I forwarded your message to my associate Stinson Gibner
whom I can wholeheartedly recommend.

Subject: New EPRM Speakers



Vince,

I'm currently looking to broaden EPRM's speaker base and would like to find a 
speaker for a training course I am producing on the Monte Carlo technique. I 
was wondering if you might be able to recommend somebody new from Enron who 
might like to speak on this subject. I'd really appreciate any help you could 
give me.

Many Thanks
