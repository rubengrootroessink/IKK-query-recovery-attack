Subject: Candidate Interview

Hello.

Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to bring Ms. Nurit Krausz
to Houston for an exploratory interview.  She presently holds a post doctorate
position in the Mathematics Department at the University of Texas.

They have done a telephone interview with her and she is only available on
Tuesdays and Thursdays,  Looking at everyone's schedule the first available
date would be Tuesday, March 28.

Would you please set this up with her.  I do not know whether she would want
to drive or fly into Houston.  The interviewers would be:

Vince Kaminski
Stinson Gibner
Zimin Lu
Krishna Krishnarao
Grant Masson
Paulo Issler
Vasant Shanbhogue

Her resume is attached.

Thanks!

Shirley
