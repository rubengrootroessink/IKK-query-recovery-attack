Jana,

Thanks for your message. I have recovered from my trip over
the weekend. I was waiting for my flight till early morning hours on Saturday.
I wasn't dressed for a chilly night at  La Guardia and came back with a 
slight cold.

Houston Intercontinental got a lot of rain as well. The place was full of
stranded passengers sleeping on the floors. The roof was leaking at a few 
places
and there were pools of water everywhere.

Sat, June the 3rd will work for me. Hope to see you then.

Vince

Vince,
I am sorry you had such a terrible return trip.  I hope you are feeling
better.  We got your message and understood completely.

Unfortunately, we are not available this Saturday.  We have company coming in
town.

Maybe, Saturday, June 3?  Let me know.

Jana
