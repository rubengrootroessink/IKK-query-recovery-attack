Beth,

Thanks. 

Dhabol is one. There should be 2 more case studies we used.
One about old EGS, the 2nd about TVA options.

2-3 copies will be sufficient.

Vince

Vince - 
I just found some copies!  How many do you need and I will have them 
delivered to you.

They are the case about the Dabhol project in India.  Is that the one you 
were thinking of?
Beth

Beth,

I have a favor to ask. Do we have copies of Harvard Business School
case studies about Enron? We use these case studies during Super Saturdays.
I need a few copies. This is for Prof. John Martin.
