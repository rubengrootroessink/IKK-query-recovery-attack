Dear Vince and Grant,

Please find attached our butchering of your work (only joking...). We've
tied the chapter in with what has gone before and changed some of your
notation so that it is consistent with ours.

Vince; could you please send thru the footnotes referred to in the chapter
at your convenience. Could you also please supply a full reference for
Routledge, Seppi, Spatt (1999).

Grant; I hope you don't mind we've called PDJD just JD (to fit in more with
our work). Please also can you supply the last figure before you disappear!

Do you want us to write the summary?

Many thanks again for all your efforts. It's all looking good.

Best regards.

Chris.
