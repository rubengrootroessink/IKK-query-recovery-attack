Hello Vince
Happy Holidays.
I wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of Enron Joining
PSERC. As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through a
transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry
members within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are not
well developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between the
electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested
in market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat we
have more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value of
market related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people at
Electrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members like
Electrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projects
such as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Please
let me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I am
going to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing and
could come through Huston for a visit. Attached are some items that I shared
with our PSERC members and thought that you might be interested in them as
well.
Regards, Shmuel.
