Vince,

I gave you both their academic reports from here and Mexico and Panama. This
information I believe also contain some personal info. Would you need more?
One of them was a bit nervous about the formality of turning in an actual
resume...

Please let me know whether the academic info is not enough.

Cheers,

Carlos
