Vince,

I am trying to price a crack spread option utilizing either of the following 
models in the Exotica Library:

1. Spread Options by 1-D integration - SPRDOPT

2. Spread Options on Asian Spreads - ASNSPRD

How do I get access to these options models?  Who can I visit with in the 
Houston group if I have any questions regarding the models.  Your help would 
be greatly appreciated.  I am located in Singapore, so I would probably be 
visiting with the Houston personnel via e-mail.

Thanks,

Pat Markey

P.S. - I have access to the O:\research\exotica\xll\xll_templates\ directory; 
however, there are no macros associated with the programs that I can find.  
Also, I don't have access to the M: drive.  Please let me know where to find 
these options models.
