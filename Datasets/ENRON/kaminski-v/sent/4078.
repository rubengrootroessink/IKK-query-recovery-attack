Gordon,

It was a  pleasure talking to you.
I shall ask my assistant to send you the reprint.

Vince Kaminski

Shirley, Can you, please, send a copy of the paper on credit risk management 
(reprint from the  RISK book).

Vince:

Thank you very much for the useful information you provided me today.

As you suggested, I wish to request a copy of the reprint that was
published last year in Risk.
