Good Afternoon!

Attached, please find the combined interview notes for the first draft of the 
article for the ENSIDE Newsletter. Read and review your sections - they are 
divided by color. Vince, please check 'everything' for content and accuracy.  
Feel free to make corrections and delete anything as you see fit.

Please make changes and then send back to me.  I need it by Wednesday, April 
4,  if possible.

Call me if you have any questions!

I will meet you all in front of the building at the big E !
