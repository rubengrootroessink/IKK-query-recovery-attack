Subject: Reaching the PJM Manuals


Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at 
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:



PJM is currently experiencing difficulty with the on-line presentation of the
PJM Manuals.

While we are resolving the problem, an alternate method of reaching the 
Manuals
has been created. This alternate has been arranged so that requests from the 
PJM
Web Page will automatically use this method. Resultantly, the Adobe Acrobat
version of the PJM Manuals can still be accessed from the PJM Web Page.

Other methods of reaching the Manuals will not function properly. Please use
either the PJM Web Page or the following link:
http://www.pjm.com/manuals2/docs/index.htm.



Please DO NOT REPLY to this message. If you have a question for PJM Customer
Relations and Training, please send an e-mail to custsvc@pjm.com.
