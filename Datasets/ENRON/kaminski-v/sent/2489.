Dear Mr. Gardner,

It is very kind you to spare your very busy time to
help me try to publish a Japanese version of RISK book
"Managing Energy Price Risk, 2nd Edition."

I would like to report you that a Japanese financial
publication company "KINZAI" last week agreed to try to
make direct contact with you about the specification of
Japanese edition of the book. So they will offer more
precise condition than my last email below.  Please
take trouble to let me know if any unclear point exist
on the process.

Thanks again for your kindness.

Best regards,



                              Masayuki Fujita
