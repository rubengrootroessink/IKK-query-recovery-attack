Van,

I have contacted Mike Roberts. He may have a need for help during the  summer.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for your prompt response.  I do realize
that the A&A Program has finished accepting
candidates for this summer; I was inquiring about
the possibility of hiring on an individual basis.

Again, I greatly appreciate your time.  I look
forward to seeing you soon!

Regards,
Van
