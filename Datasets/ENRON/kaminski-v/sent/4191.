Enron has been given a two week free trail [until 4/25/00] for FT Online.   
The free trial has unlimited users so please feel free to pass this along to 
anyone who may be interested.

Various persons within Enron currently purchase selected hard copies of FT's 
newsletters for 18,331 British pounds.  It would be much more efficient  and 
cheaper if all eleven newsletters [13,617 British pounds for 2 users plus 
incremental costs for each additional user] were purchased on-line and the 
cost shared amoung the users.
