Vince,
I'll send him one of the manuals, and perhaps a paper on SDDP.

Vincent,

You kindly suggested that I email you with regard to some information you
have on the SDDP system (I'm not sure if I've got the abbreviation correct,
but it's something that is currently used in South America).

Your presentation was very interesting and informative.


Kind regards,
