Subject: What shall we tell our children.

This is good!


 Vice  Presidential  candidate  Sen. Joseph Lieberman recently
 asked  the question, "What will we tell our children if every
 vote is not counted?"

 Here is the response of one citizen:

 "As  a  former  teacher,  I  have  been  concerned  about Joe
 Lieberman's  question,  "What  will  we  tell  our children?"
 What  we  should, and must, tell our children is that if they
 fail  to  mark the right answer on an exam, or do not fill in
 the  entire test, they will not get credit for their answers.
 If they do it often enough and if they do not ask for help or
 read the directions properly, they will fail.

 We  should  tell  them  that  when they are older and move to
 Florida,  they  must  fully read their ballot and remove the
 entire chad and not keep an entire nation waiting because of
 their mistakes.

 We  must also tell them to read and read well, to play by the
 rules and expect a favorable outcome.

 Teaching them to make excuses for their mistakes has led to a
 society of victims unable to take responsibility.



Amen and Amen!
