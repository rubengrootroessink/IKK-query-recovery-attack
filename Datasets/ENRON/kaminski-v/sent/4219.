Hi Vince:

     I haven't talked to you in a while and wanted to touch base with you on a
couple of issues.

1. Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to our
MBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group is
interested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring.
Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall on
valuation issues.

2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal of
Applied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by the
Bank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics and
major corporations.  They are doing a special issue on Energy and are
interested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for risk
management.  Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such an
article?

3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility of
giving lectures to Enron employees on valuation.  Ehud and I sent you a
proposal but didn't get a response.  Is there still an interest in this.

4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that we
think is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well as
real investments.  If you think this approach might be potentially useful
for Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your research
group.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Sheridan
