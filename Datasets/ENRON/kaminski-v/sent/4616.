Louise,

It would be a good commercial for Enron. What can we do to help him and 
get free publicity?

Vince

Dear Vince,

Greetings from Boston, where we're doing all we can to help keep the price
of gas high.

As I may have told you earlier, I'm writing a "Guide to Electricity Hedging"
for Risk Publications similar to the report on Oil. I had planned to write a
significant section on Enrononline, and in the midst of my research on the
topic was denied access by Enron's gatekeeper. Can you help get me in?

As always, the best from here.

Ed Krapels
