Joe, 

Thanks for your message. It would be difficult to rearrange  the meeting at 
this point, given that it was 
timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for 
any other date at this point. We can still adjust
the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work 
on this with John and Ravi.

Vince

I could probably make Friday but would have to leave that night.  Any chance 
it could be moved to the first of the next week.

Also, I think it is important that as we examine the technical issue of our 
network and network functionality that we balance the meeting with the 
Content Services issues and requirements.  I talked to John about this 
already.

Joe,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Vince Kaminski
