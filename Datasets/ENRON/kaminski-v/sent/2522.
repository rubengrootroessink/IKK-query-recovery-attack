The Summer Associate Program is a critical component of our recruiting 
efforts.  We appreciate you acting as a Mentor  for the following Summer 
Associate.  

Vince,

A reception to introduce you to the Summer Associates is scheduled for June 
22nd.  The reception will be held from 6:00 PM until 7:30 PM at Sierra's 
Grill located at 4704 Montrose (713-942-7757).  We have also provided the 
Summer Associate with your name and phone number; however, we encourage you 
to contact Guiseppe prior to the reception if possible. 

Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x39804 or by email.  

Thank you

Charlene Jackson
