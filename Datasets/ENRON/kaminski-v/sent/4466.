Dear Mr Kamins

I am delighted that you would like to speak at the forthcoming "Real Options" 
conference.  Would your company be covering travel and hotel expenses?  If 
not I would need to get internal sign off to cover any expenses you would 
have.  Please can you tell me either way so that I can make the requisite 
inquiries if required.

The speakers at the conference have provided me with between 5-8 bullet 
points for their talks.  Could you email me a few ideas with regard to the 
content of the talk and I will email back my ideas.  I have attached one of 
the talks at the conference to give you an idea of the style of the talks 
which have already been included.

I look forward to speaking with you later this afternoon.

Kind regards

Julia Shaw
Conference Producer

Dear Ms. Shaw,


I have just returned from London. One of the points on my
agenda was an internal seminar  on the topic of real options
my group offered to the Enron unit in London. Real options is
a valuation technology I have been promoting internally
for quite a long time.

I shall be glad to speak at your conference. Proposed topic:
"Real Options and Valuation of Fixed Assets in the Energy Industry".

Please, let me know if this of interest to you.

Vince Kaminski

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I was given your name by Ann Wagoner and I believe that you area speaking at 
her
conference on Real Options.  I work in the London office of IIR and am putting
on a similar conference.  Your company has been mentioned by a wide variety of
people who I have spoken with about real options.  A number of people have
mentioned that your company is regarded very much as a market leader.

I would like to discover if a representative from ENRON might be interested in
speaking at the conference.  I have attached the draft programme with agreed
speakers to date.  The conference is by no means set in stone and if a speaker
from ENRON decided to become involved I would ensure that you were given a 
good
speaking slot in the conference and would have editorial control over the 
talk.

I very much hope that ENRON will become involved with the conference and I 
look
forward to speaking with you today or next week about the prospect.

Kind regards

Julia Shaw
