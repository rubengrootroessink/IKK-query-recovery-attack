Stinson,

This is the person from UT I mentioned. He is not interested in the summer 
internship.

Vince:
It was very nice talking to you at  the Texas Finance Festival and I think 
the telecom market that Enron is entering  is very interesting and very 
lucrative.? I would be very interested in  working in that segment for Enron.
?
However, I talked to Sheridan about  this oppurtunity and he said that it is 
probably going to be another six months  before I finish my dissertation.? So 
while I am definitely interested, the  start date will probably have to be 
around that time.? 
?
At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again  and hopefully once I have 
defended my dissertation? we can discuss  employment oppurtunities in greater 
detail.
