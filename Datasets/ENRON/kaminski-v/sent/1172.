Kate asked me to forward this to you - thought you would enjoy it.  

However, I must tell you that as a group we beat all the odds.  We have
three sets of people that have the same birthday - of course not the same
year - just the same day!

Amitava and Jaesoo March 2
Shirley and Stephen July 20
Stinson and Gwyn September 23

Cheers!

Shirley

Shirley,

Would you please pass this on to the rest of the group? It refers to our 
lunchtime conversation about birthdays falling on the same day for two people 
in a group.

Thanks,
Kate
