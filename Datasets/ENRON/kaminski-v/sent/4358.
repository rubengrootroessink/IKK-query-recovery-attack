Subject: Last reminder for slides/bio



This is a last-minute reminder send us all of the following (to be included
in the conference package for the participants):

a. Copy of the transparencies/slides for your talk
b. A one paragraph (10-15 line) bio description
c. A one paragraph (10 line) abstract and 4 one-liner bullet points

There are still missing items in your case. As tomorrow is our last day
before travelling over the Atlantic, and the material still needs to be
organized and sent to a copier to make 100 copies in time, we ask that you
send us the missing items by tomorrow latest.

We appreciate your collaboration in preparing a professional conference for
our corporate colleagues.

Lenos

PS If for any reason you have to send us something after Friday, please cc to
