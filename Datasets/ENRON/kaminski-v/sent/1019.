Hi Vince,
?
I promise to contact you next time just for a chat  instead of askig you to 
do someting again! Robin e-mailed me today about the  next EPRM article, whih 
was timely as I have just completed this draft. Please  could you cast you 
eye over the article and let me have any comments as soon as  possible?
?
Are you happy to continue with these articles? We  are very happy at our 
continued association with yourself.
?
Best regards for 2001.
?
Chris.
