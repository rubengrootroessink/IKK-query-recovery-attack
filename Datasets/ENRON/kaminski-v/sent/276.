Stinson,

I am the new HR generalist for the research group because Norma Villarreal is 
moving to Business Analysis and Reporting.  Earlier this week, Norma and I 
met with Vince, and he said that he was going to talk to you about writing up 
a list of Sevil's projects/ accomplishments for last year and this year, so 
that we can give her a project bonus since she did not receive a bonus during 
the normal PRC time.  At your earliest convenience, will you please email me 
this list so that I can get started putting together all of the paperwork so 
that she can receive a check on April 16th.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 5-7809. I look 
forward to meeting you, and the rest of the group next week at Vince's staff 
meeting.

Thanks,
Anne Labbe'
