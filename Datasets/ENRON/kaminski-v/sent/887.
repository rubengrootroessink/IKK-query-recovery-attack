Gentlemen,

Thank you for your time and consideration yesterday.  I am excited about
working for Enron and gladly accept your offer.

To reiterate our consensus today, I will be working an average of 10 hours a
week, mostly early mornings from around 5 to 7.  Another option for me might
be to work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from around 5 to 8 or 9.

Toni Graham was my contact in HR six months ago.  She is probably more
familiar with my previous file than anyone else.  If you have any questions
or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,
Chris Pernoud
