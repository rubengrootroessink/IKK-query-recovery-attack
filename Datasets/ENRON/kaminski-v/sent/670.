Vince,

I must apologize.  I have not had time to look over the proposal in any 
detail.  When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was 
still pre-business plan stage.  He has since sent me some ideas and 
information.  I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political 
issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability. 

Give me the weekend to look over the information.

Thanks,
Mark
