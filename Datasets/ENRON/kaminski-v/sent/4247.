Karla,

We may use 1 workstation in London, 1 in Houston.

Yes, please call Ms. Geman and ask for more detailed price information.

Vince

Hello Vince,

I didn't know if that was your correct e-mail address listed below on 
receiving from outside the company, so I thought I would forward this with a 
couple of comments.

She states below that she has enclosed a proposal, however, the only pricing 
I really see is in the Software License Agreement, Article 2, which states 
that the license fee is $100,000 and lists out when you must pay for it.  It 
then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1, but there 
are no prices in Appendix 1.  

I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going 
to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review.  In the 
meantime, do you want me to go back to Ms. Geman and ask her for more 
detailed pricing information or do you have what you need?  Also, in Appendix 
2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to 
have.  

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Karla

Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please find enclosed a proposal for the D-G Energy
Software license agreement in which Enron may be
interested.We deliberately left blank the Appendix 2
related to the number of sites and workstations it
would cover ,in order to let Dr.Kaminski decide what
 is best for Enron.
Sincerely
