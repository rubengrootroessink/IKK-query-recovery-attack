I quite understand, and will appreciate the ability to use the system while
the permission is applicable.

>Would you like to meet with me, Alex, Helyette for dinner Tuesday?
I would be delighted to join you, Alex and Helyette for dinner Tue.  When
that info is available, please advise when and where.

Look forward to seeing you Tue.  Best,
Ehud
