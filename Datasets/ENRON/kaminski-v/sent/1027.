Vince,

Before leaving for India I just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk 
to Jeff Shankman on Monday.

Aside from myself, I wanted to remind you to talk about Anshuman Shrivastava, 
who is currently Assistant Manager in India, and has my recommendation for 
promotion to Manager.  He is our point person on many DPC matters, and is 
also the person I have used on most fuel related issues.  He will be a real 
asset to Jeff when located in HOuston.  Sinc he is single, and quite young, 
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice.

I will call you from India as soon as I get in.  It will be Monday evening in 
Houston at that time, so could you please jot me a note telling me what would 
be a good number to call you on.  

I look forward to working with the team in Research.

Thanks again,

Regards,
Sandeep.
