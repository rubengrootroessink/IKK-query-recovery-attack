This  has good information - note the phone nos. at the bottom.

We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using
your name, address, SSN#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (author of this
piece) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last month and

within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell phone package,

applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line
approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change

my driving record information online, and more.
> > > > >
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case
this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers
and your card numbers handy so you know who to call. Keep
those where you can find them easily (having to hunt for them is additional
stress you WON'T need at that point!).
> > >
File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was
stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a
first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
> > > > >
But here's what is perhaps most important: I never ever thought to
do this. Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SSN#. I had never heard
of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen
and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.
> > > > >
By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the
theft all the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit
checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about
before placing the alert). Since then, no additional damage has been done,
and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It

seems to have stopped them in their tracks.
> > > > >
The numbers are:
Equifax 1-800 525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW) 1-800-301-7195
Trans Union 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration also has a fraud line 1-800-269-0271

We pass along jokes, we pass along just about everything... do think
about passing this information along... it could help someone else
