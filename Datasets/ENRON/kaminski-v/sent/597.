Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

An innovative Argentine bond issue that gained an above-sovereign rating,
Enron=01,s moves to create a European bandwidth boom, further clever
catastrophe protection from Swiss Re and awareness of a potential increase
in institutional trading costs through the decimalisation of US equity
markets represented some of the key headlines this week.

The political risk insurance deal was put together by Sovereign Risk
Insurance, a Bermuda-based joint venture between ACE and XL Insurance,
which raised Argentina=01,s Salta Hydrocarbon Royalty Trust=01,s note issue=
 to
investment grade debt. Notably, the ranking was higher than Argentina=01,s
sovereign rating. Given the Basel Committee=01,s endorsement, similar deals
are likely to emerge elsewhere.

Enron, meanwhile, believes a liquid European bandwidth market will emerge
within a year. The US firm is significantly ramping up its European energy
operations.

Swiss Re, which first put together earthquake protection deals in
California in 1997, has developed yet another innovative reinsurance and
investment capital deal to give $100 million protection to policyholders
of the California Earthquake Authority.

Meanwhile, the move to decimalisation and minimum price increments of one
penny in the US equity markets could result in an overall decline in
market liquidity and higher costs for institutional client trades
according to research by US investment bank Goldman Sachs (see top story).
