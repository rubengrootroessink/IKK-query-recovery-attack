controversies of Basle II.

problems with the proposals, from market discipline and operational risk to 
credit derivatives and maturity factors. More Basle coverage and analysis to 
come next week on ERisk.

SEARCH ENGINE
It was broken, but now we've fixed it. ERisk&#8217;s new, more powerful and 
efficient search engine will let you conduct more meaningful searches of the 
ERisk site, with relevancy scores for each result and clear identification of 
where each document can be found. Coming soon: a brief summary of each 
document found.

ERisk and strategic partner Risk Management Solutions (RMS) last week 
released the results of our jointly sponsored Property & Casualty industry

and risk-adjusted profitability of various segments within the P&C insurance 
marketplace.
