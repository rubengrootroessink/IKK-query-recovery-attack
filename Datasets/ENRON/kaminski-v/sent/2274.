This correspondence is sent to you in response to the below question=20
pertaining to the type of research  that should be introduced to Enron .

On Tuesday , April 4th, 2000, a local newspaper in my area , "The Bakersfie=
ld=20
California" ran an article pertaining to the 50 million dollars of funding=
=20
from the U.S. congress  set aside to study deep sea floor extraction of=20
methane hydrate. This study will focus on methane hydrates as an energy=20
source and the technologies needed for safe, efficient development. =20

According to this article, the ice-like deposits of frozen methane have an=
=20
energy potential equal to more than twice that of all other fossil fuels=20
combined.

I can fax you a copy of this newspaper article if you would like to read it=

Send me you FAX number or call me at Enron Wind Corp. 661-823-6433.=20

Also when I was in engineering  student back in 1985,  I did an independent=
=20
senior level study on a proposed method which possibly could be used to=20
extract hydrate from the sea floor. If you are interested, I could e-mail y=
