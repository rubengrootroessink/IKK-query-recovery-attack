Vince,

We had spoken a few weeks back, but were unable to meet due to our 
schedules.  I will be back in Houston next week (August 21st), and would 
appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and take your advice. 

As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in exploring opportunities 
that are more US focused.  I think Paula Corey has already forwarded my 
resume to you.  However, I have attached it to this note just in case.  



I would really appreciate the opportunity to meet with you next week, and 
would be grateful if you could let me know what time fits best with your 
schedule.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,



Rahul
