Scott,

Not at all. I left to make a quick call and it required a number
of follow-up calls. 

The presentation was very interesting and professional.

One of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software 
packages.
Otherwise, everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose 
economies of scale.

I shall talk to my associates about your product  and get back to you.

Vince

Hello Vince,

I'm writing to follow up with you regarding our meeting last week.  Did we
do something wrong in our presentation or in the set up of this presentation?

For a group of 50 researchers we were expecting a larger crowd and also
some peole perhaps from your IT department.  Also when you left I was
wondering if we had offended you.

The ability to use our products to create open models, integrate databases,
C, VB, etc. and then quickly deploy them to others has been embraced by
the risk management world.  We met the following day with a large group
from EES and they seemed quite enthusiastic about the innovation possible
with our tools.

I realize you are quite busy, but could you please let me know what
happened and how we can prevent this in the future?

Thanks
Scott Wakefield
