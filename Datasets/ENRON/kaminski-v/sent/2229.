Vince,

Pierre has informed me that (if you can so co-ordinate with Alison Bailey)
you would like to move the recruiting event on campus for Comp Finance to
Nov 3 in order to co-ordinate with Pierre's invitation to speak in the MSCF
Speaker Series the same day.  I contacted our recruiting center about
availability on that date and have forwarded below his response.  Let me
know how else I can help and, again, thanks for your kind words about the
program and you obvious interest in meeting with us.

Rick

Enron currently has 8 interview rooms scheduled on December 11, 2000... As
we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11/3 we currently have
nine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11/3, we
probably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currently
holding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this is
like a game of dominos).  However, Enron could interview off campus, but
that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the
employer.  If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11/3 for just
Comp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.  Our Recruiting
Coordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work for
Enron.  Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know what
their preferences are.  Alison knows how to reach her.
