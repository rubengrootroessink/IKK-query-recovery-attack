Hi Vince,

As requested, I sent you an invitation (3pm Houston time Monday) for the 
summary review of the half-hourly forward vol curve method plus review of 
recent projects (e.g. inflation book, EnergyDesk.com, Weather desk update, 
emerging market in Continental power market options and Global Products 
exotics).  Look forward to catching up with you then.  I also sent you a 
tentative list of meetings that I will be having in Oslo.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. The telephone number is 47 2321 2000 Grand Hotel, Oslo and my mobile 
number is 07747 868131
