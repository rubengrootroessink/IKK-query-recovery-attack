Subject: Scheduling a Meeting - Important - Please read

Scott Yeager has requested I set up a meeting for Mark Keeter to present to 
the group his findings for the 6 month study of Managing Global 
Network/Application Service Platform and include managing QoS end to end.  

How does Tuesday May 23 in the morning look for everyone?  
Mark, how long do you need I will schedule the conference room for.
Also please let me know if anyone else should be invited.
