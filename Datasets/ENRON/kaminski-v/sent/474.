Vince,

I am delighted that you accept our invitation.  We hope it works out that you 
can attend the whole conference as we are confident that you will find the 
program stimulating and will enjoy getting to know our participants.  The 
pleasure will certainly be mutual.  You will bring a new and different 
perspective from which we can all benefit.


Michael

Vince: 

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to 
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael 
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th 
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining 
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the 
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a 
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and 
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a 
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from 
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check 
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the 
following website URL: 

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm 

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would 
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but 
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would 
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, 
followed by a short Q&A period. 

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of 
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event. 

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether 
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event. 
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in 
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if 
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you. 

Regards, 

Paul
