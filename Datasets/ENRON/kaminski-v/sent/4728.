 Exit on Buffalo Speedway and go south.  (Greenway plaza is on the north side 
of the freeway.)
 Pass through stoplights on Bissonette, Sunset, Rice, and University.
 Turn right on Cason  (the last small street before the next stoplight, which 
is at Holcomb Blvd.)
 House is on your left in 2.5 blocks.


From  West Loop 610 :
 Exit on Bellaire Blvd. and go east  (inside the loop).
 After you pass the stoplights at Auden and at Edloe street,  start watching 
for JiffyLube on your right.

 At first intersection, turn Right onto Cason
 House is on your right.

 If you miss the turn at JiffyLube, just turn LEFT at the stoplight at 
Buffalo and turn left again onto Cason.
