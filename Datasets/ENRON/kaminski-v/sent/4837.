Stinson,

I have accepted an amended offer from Southern Company Energy
Marketing.  My decision was based on the higher compensation, and the
opportunity to rotate through structuring, trading and research.  I am
very confident that I would have been very engaged and happy working in
your group; I did not take the decision lightly.

I'll be moving to Atlanta in March, but I will keep the email and URL
given below.  I'd like to stay in touch, and I expect to see you at
conferences.  Also, please pass my regards on to Vince and Mike.
