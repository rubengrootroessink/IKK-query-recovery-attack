Jason,

No problem. I am glad I could help. They finally called a few
days ago when they had to make the decision.

Subject: Say hello to a new summer associate

Vince,
I received the letter from A&A program last night.
They offered me a position of a summer associate, and I have to accept it by 
March 13.
This is a tremendous news for me, and I am looking forward to this summer.

Thanks for all your help,

Jason Sokolov
