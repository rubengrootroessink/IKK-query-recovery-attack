Vince --

Thanks for participating in the INFOCAST volatility conference in Houston 10
days ago. Your penetrating analysis of the current state of electricity
markets, and what the trends may be, was a very useful contribution to the
conference.

Happy holidays, and wishing you a healthy and prosperous new year / century
/ millenium.
