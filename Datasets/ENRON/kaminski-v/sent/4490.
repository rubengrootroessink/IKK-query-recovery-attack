Margaret,

I have an economist in my group and asked her if she feels qualified to make a
presentation on this topic. I shall keep you posted. I think It would help
Enron to oblige.

Vince

Subject: Speakers for a CEO Meeting with Governor Johanns

Hello Margaret.  We are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being 
arranged with Nebraska Governor Johanns during the first week in April.

The potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures/trends on 
natural gas, electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production 
costs, as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset 
the price fluctuations.

Do you know of anyone, either within the Corporation or outside, who would be 
available to travel to Omaha to make this presentation?  

I would appreciate any assistance that you could provide, Margaret.

Thanks, 

beth jensen
