Gary, Peter,

This is a copy of my London presentation. I expect to
make some minor changes to this presentation for March 13.

 <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.

Gary

> virtually all of next Wednesday 2/23, perhaps we could talk at 10 am (EST)
> or 2 pm (EST)?   I am happy to arrange the call, if you send me your phone
