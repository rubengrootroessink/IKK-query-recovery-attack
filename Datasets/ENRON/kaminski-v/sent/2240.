Amy,

I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a 
reasonable decision.

We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain 
clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a 
rather
vague concept of what they want to accomplish.

Vince: Can you shed any light on this? I'm confused (really confused).... 
Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only 
by Kean, Buy and Koening? And
Do you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs?
Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and 
start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the 
Lab. 
From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole 
thing, Rick's issue of "where AA is going with this" is really a mute point, 
isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort. 
Would appreciate your insight and advice.
Thanks.
Amy

I have discussed with AA and they are following up.  If I am the agenda, I 
would cancel the meeting and when I hear from AA, I will e mail everyone.  I 
would suggest we not hold a meeting until Kean, Buy , Koenig and I can all 
come so that we can truly move forward (or decide not to).  Let me know what 
you decide.  Thanks.  Rick
