Neither the Republican presidential candidate, nor
the Democratic presidential candidate had enough
votes to win the election. Therefore, it was decided
that there should be an ice-fishing contest between 
the two candidates to determine the final winner.

There was much talk about ballot recounting, court
challenges, etc., but a weeklong ice-fishing competition 
seemed the fairest way to settle things.  The candidate 
that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. 
After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided 
that the contest would take place on a remote and cold 
lake in Minnesota.  There were to be no observers present 
since both men were to be sent out on this remote lake and
return daily with their catch for counting and verification.

At the end of the first day, George W. Bush returns to the 
starting line and he has 10 fish. Soon, Al Gore returns and 
has zero fish. Well, everyone assumes Al is just having 
another bad hair day or something and hopefully he will 
catch up the next day.

At the end of the 2nd day, George W. comes in with 20 fish 
and Al Gore comes in again with none. That evening, Bill 
Clinton gets together secretly with Al Gore and says; "Al, 
I think George W. is cheatin'.  I'ma gonna dress this good 
ole' Southern Boy, James Carville, up in a costume and send 
him out on the lake to act as a spy".  

The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish and 
Al Gore with none), Bill gets Carville and Al Gore together 
and says to Carville: "Well, what about it boy, is George W. 
cheatin'?" "  He sure is, Bill, he's cuttin' holes in the ice!"
