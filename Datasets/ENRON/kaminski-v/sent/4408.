Subject: Job application




Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Yours,
Nurit Krausz
