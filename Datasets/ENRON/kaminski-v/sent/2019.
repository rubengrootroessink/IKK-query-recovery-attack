Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you very much for meeting with me again today over lunch. I appreciated 
the opportunity to catch up with you.

Please find attached my current resume (both a short and a long version). I 
have worked as a trader, portfolio risk manager, and a stock analyst. I have 
traded derivatives, bonds, and stocks,  and managed insurance and pension 
investment portfolios to maximize risk-adjusted returns.  Let me highlight 
some of my work experiences.

Trading and Risk Management
    a.. Structured, negotiated, and traded OTC interests rate swaps, 
cross-currency swaps, swaptions, and exchange-traded equity index futures and 
options. Made PowerPoint presentations to GARP and the UOH on credit 
derivatives.
    b.. Developed investment hedging program utilizing exchanged-traded bond 
futures and interest rate swaps.
    c.. Traded and managed pension and insurance fixed income portfolios to 
maximize total return and funding ratios. Bonds traded: Treasuries, Agencies, 
MBS/CMOs, ABS, Corporate, Yankees, and Foreign.
    d.. Traded and managed stock mutual portfolios for total return.
    e.. Created a computer program to quantify the attribution of total 
return for fixed income portfolios relative to market returns.
    f.. Programmed investment compliance rules to monitor the management of 
domestic and global stock, bond and money market mutual funds.
    g.. Supervised market risks, credit risks, legal risks, and operations 
risks of derivatives, bonds, money market securities, and equities.
Policy , Reporting and Projects
    a.. Developed investment policy guidelines to manage fixed income 
portfolios.
    b.. Rewrote derivatives policy manual.
    c.. Prepared a 20-page PowerPoint slide presentation on India for the 
senior management.
    d.. Prepared and presented investment reports to CIOs, Investment 
Committees, and Boards of Trustees
I shall, therefore, appreciate your help in connecting me with the right 
individual within Enron for a job interview to work as a financial 
trader/risk manager. I can provide excellent references upon request.

Thank you for the lunch.

Sincerely,

Maruti D. More, CFA

        Dear Mr. Kaminski:

        How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick
    lunch.

        You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief 
Minister
        (CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are 
from the
    same
        town, Latur.

        I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.

        I will call you tomorrow to follow up.

        Thank you.

        Sincerely,

        Maruti More
