Margaret,

I don't have it. Maybe we can get a copy directly from  the CBOT.
Info  Central could help.

Margaret,

First of all I apologize for not sending you the information to complete the 
chart that you gave me.  I have been travelling because of work and then 
vacation, maybe I spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4 
weeks.  Now that I am going through my to do list I cannot find that page 
that you gave me .  Could you  please send it to me again?

On the other hand I was wondering if maybe within Enron possibly at Info 
Central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a 
copy of a book titled:                   Chicago Board of Trade Commodity 
Trading Manual 
                      ISBN: 1579580025
                      Publisher: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Incorporated
                      Pub. Date: December  1997
 It si not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long 
time to deliver.   I need this bbok in order to produce a document that Steve 
Kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago.

Thank you very much for your help.

Best,

Ricardo
