Vince:

We are having some scheduling conflicts for Andrew visit this coming
Monday.  As the schedule currently, his seminar will be at 1:00 pm in the
Dean's Conference Room.  I realize that this is not the best time for you
and I apologize for any inconvenience.  We may also need to use the same
time slot for Philippe's visit on the 19th.

We plan to meet somewhere in the Village for an informal reception at 5:30
Monday afternoon.  I will let you know the specifics on that once I have
figured them out!  From there you, George, Dave, and Jeff are scheduled to
go to dinner with Andrew around 7:00 pm.  You may join in for cocktails or
meet up with the other group for dinner - your choice.  Dave or Jeff will
let you know the dinner plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I have attached PDF files with the papers for both Andrew and Philippe's
seminars.

You can get to Andrew's vitae through this link
http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/faculty/karolyi/resume.htm and Philippe's vitae
through this link http://www.gsm.uci.edu/~jorion/resume.pdf .

Thank you.
