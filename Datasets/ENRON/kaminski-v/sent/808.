Steve,

Thanks. I printed the fundamental info
last night and will wait for the open.

I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book
(Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.

You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.

Vince

Good morning,

First, a reminder that you want to see follow through strength on the picks 
before going into them Secondly do you know anybody that has published a 
book? I need some help in how to negotiate points in the contract.

Thanks,   Steve
