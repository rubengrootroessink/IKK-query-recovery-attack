Emma,

Mergers and acquisitions are not my cup of tea.

Chairing stream 1 on day 1 seems to be a better match.

Hi Vince

Thanks for getting back to me quickly! As it happens, all of the sessions
you suggested are already taken!

So, would you be interested in chairing EITHER stream 1 on day 1 of the
conference - "Pricing and Trading in the US Power Market"  OR stream 3 on
day 2 of the conference - "Latest Developments in the US Energy Industry".
For your information, the people presenting on day 1 in stream 1 include:

- Spyros Maragos, Dynegy on volatility
- Sanjeev Khanna, PG & E on correlation
- Gary Morsches, Southern on optimising information to accurately price and
trade electricity
- Blake Johnson, Stanford University on modelling power prices
- Craig Pirrong, Olin School of Business, Washington University on building
the optimal forward curve

On day 2, stream 3, there are only 3 talks in that stream, as after lunch we
will be breaking for plenary sessions and the Industry Briefing sessions
too. But the people who will be speaking in that stream are:

- Venu Nagali, Stanford University on real options
- Ram Challa, Sithe Energies (he was formerly at Bankers Trust) on
generation assets

I have the slot on Mergers and Acquisitions in stream 3 on day 2 as still
available but I'm not sure if that session is your area of speciality? Let
me know.

Thanks Vince and very much looking forward to working with you again.

Emma
