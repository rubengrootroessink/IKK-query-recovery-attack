Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski 
Managing Director 
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 

Dear Mr. Kaminski: 

On June 8 last, we held a special web-based conference call pertaining to a 
new CERA multiclient study, "The Future of European Power: Electricity 
without Borders".? Participants in this complimentary call learned first-hand 
some of the initial results of the study, and how the study provides a 
framework for evaluating current and future company strategies.

We are pleased to announce the availability of the recorded presentation on 
our website.? To view the presentation, please visit our website at:? 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=662&c=2804? 

The presentation focused on the study scope and approach, and its underlying 
analysis.? In addition, the link above will also provide access to the 
prospectus for the study, including the deliverables and enrollment 
information.? If your organization has not yet enrolled in the study, we urge 
you to consider doing so at this time.

Should you have any questions either about this study, or about any aspect of 
CERA's European Power services then please contact me by reply email or 
directly by phone in Paris at + 33 1 42 44 10 18.

Sincerely,
