Philip,

Please schedule some time with Kevin Moore (34710) to go up to 3240D and 
train Vince Kaminski on the Avistar system. Please show Vince and Kevin the 
basics, and take them the documentation as well.

Kevin has left for the afternoon. Please call him in the morning (Tuesday) to 
schedule a time

Thanks

Paige
