Margaret,

I shall invite Hunter Shiveley. I think it will cover ENA.

Subject: Dale Nesbitt meeting

Margaret Carson is going to join us in the meeting next week with Nesbitt.  
Vince will check with ENA to see if they also want to attend.  I would also 
like to determine if ETS and/or NBP would want to send a representative(s), 
although Margaret said she would take copious notes for distribution to other 
key players as necessary.  We should ask Nesbitt how he would structure a 
deal for multiple clients (eg. ETS, NBP, ENA, and maybe El Paso).  

[We need to remain aware of any "affiliate" issues that may result, and make 
certain that we are in complete compliance with the regs.]

I will wait until after our meeting with Nesbitt before deciding if/how to 
approach El Paso.  Presumably, if asked to particpate, they would share the 
cost and have independent access to any working model that is developed. 

JNG

Subject: Dale Nesbitt

John,

I talked to Dale Nesbitt. He suggested that the best way to evaluate his 
model is to
go through a one week intensive project with assistance of somebody from his 
company.
Our cost  is a flat fee of $12,500 that would be deducted from the purchase 
price of $55,000,
in case we buy the software package.

The price of 55K is indicative and will be adjusted based on the required 
level of support.

Dale will be in Houston next week. I have tentatively invited him to visit 
with us on Tuesday,
November 7, at 3:00 p.m. He will adjust if you are busy at this time.


Please, let me know what you think.

Vince
