Rick,

I asked Greg Whalley and he declined (he has a speaking
engagement in London  a day before).

I have sent an invitation to Louise Kitchen and she has not 
replied yet. I  shall catch her at the management conference in San Antonio 
and
ask for a commitment. It would help if you could mention this to her as well.

Vince

Where do we stand on this?  Is someone else going to do it?
