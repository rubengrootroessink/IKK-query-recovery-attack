Hi Vince,

I am on the technical program committee of the Infocom 2001 conference,
and we are meeting in New York City on Saturday, October 14th, to select
papers for the conference program. I'm leaving Stanford on Friday and
getting back on Sunday.

It might be a possibility to have dinner together on Sunday, if that would
work for you. In that case I would have to reschedule my flight to land
in SFO earlier than I'm currently scheduled to land.

Would dinner on Sunday work for you? Any chance we can meet Monday for
lunch?

I look forward to seeing you.

Best Regards,

Nick
