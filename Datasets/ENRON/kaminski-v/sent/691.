Announcement
-----------------------

Forbes magazine is beginning work on its second survey of business school
graduates and business school deans for a future issue of Forbes. Forbes is
looking at the return on investment that business schools offer. They will
survey the full-time graduating class of 1996.  Your names and addresses
will not be used for any other purpose beyond this one -page questionnaire
and your responses will remain confidential.  We urge you to complete and
return the surveys since rankings are influenced by the percentage of the
class which returns the survey. This is true for all rankings. We greatly
appreciate your taking your time to do this and thank you for supporting the
Jones School.
