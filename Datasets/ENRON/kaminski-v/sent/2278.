Stinson (and Vince--don't think your e-mail address is correct)

This is just a reminder about the "care package" of Enron cases and
materials that you guys were going to send to me.

Stinson, please convey this request on to Vince because I think the e-mail
address I have is an old one.

Thanks and have a great weekend.
