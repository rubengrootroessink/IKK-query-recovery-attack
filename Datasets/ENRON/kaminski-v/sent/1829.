Hi guys,
?
Hope you are both enjoying Paris. We've past the  end of September which was 
the deadline for the ext EPR article. Seeing as we  were going to use the 
same data set for articles 2 and 3 I've done drafts of  them both. Please 
have a look and get comments back to me asap before Robin  stars jumping on 
us.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
