Great Vince!

Thanks for replying.  This idea is really snowballing and we're getting a lot 
of support - I can't wait to talk to you about it.  Are you available somtime 
early in the morning on Friday?  Maybe around 8:00 or 8:30?

I'm attaching a one-page executive summary for you to look at if you get a 
chance.

Looking forward to your reply,

Andrew

Hi Vince!

Maybe you remember me, my name is Andrew Miles and we worked together on a 
speech for Jeff Skilling this past July.  I am hoping that I can get on your 
calendar for 30 minutes next week.  I have been working with 3 other Enron 
employees for the past 6 months, developing a comprehensive innovation 
acceleration process for use by potentially all Enron employees - and we 
would really appreciate your input.  We have presented the idea to quite a 
few people in the company, and some outside of the company (Strategos 
Institute), all of which have really liked the idea and provided key input.  
Many people have suggested that we run the idea by you.

If you have some time next week, would you mind allowing me to explain our 
ideas to you?  I will follow up with a telephone call.

All the best,

Andrew
