Good Morning Vince!

I re-wrote three of the worst sentences from the standpoint of good grammar.  
If you don't have time to review what I sent you, that's okay.  We can go 
with it for today, but as I said in my earlier e-mail, I'll be soliciting 
articles from people who have not yet contributed.  May I use your name? 

ThankYou!

Sam
