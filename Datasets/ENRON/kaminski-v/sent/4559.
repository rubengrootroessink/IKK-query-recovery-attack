Barbara,

Yes, ECT does not exist any longer. It's safer to say
the seminar is sponsored buy Enron Corp. WE have a reorganization every
three months.

Vince:

I just realized that I am still saying that the seminar series is sponsored
by Enron Capital and Trade Resources.  Should I change that to Enron North
America?

Thanks.
