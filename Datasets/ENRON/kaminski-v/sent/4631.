Bonnie,

Thanks both for your message and for all the help in this difficult
matter. I shall try to stop by one day to formally introduce myself.

I received a notice from the court that the order of dismissal of the 
plaintiff's case was signed on 1/06/00.  We are requesting a copy of the 
signed order and will send a copy to each of you when it is received.  

Gary and Vince,  Congratulations on your recent promotions.

Bonnie
