Subject: Enterprise Risk Management


Good afternoon Vince.   You and I corresponded over a year ago on the
subject of Enterprise Risk Management.   I would like to bounce a couple of
thoughts off of you about this subject from my perspective as the Audit
Manager, but also at an enterprise level as well.   I don't have a phone
number for you, just an email address.   If you could send me a phone number
I would like to give you a cal sometime next week.   If you would like to
give me a call, that would be fine also.

If you are not involved in the ERM process at this time and there is someone
else I could visit with, I would appreciate their name and phone number.

Thanks Vince.
