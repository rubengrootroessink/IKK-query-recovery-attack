Subject: Candidates for Research Interviews

Hi Caroline,

We would like to set up an afternoon/evening of first round screening 
interviews with the 5 candidates (whose CVs are attached below) for Monday 
21st February, starting from 3pm and going on until 6pm or so.  Right now we 
have five candidates, and I would imagine that a half an hour interview per 
person is fine.  The interviewers will be Vince Kaminski , Ben Parsons, 
myself and Steve Leppard.  My suggestion is that each candidate has three 
interviews as follows:

Vince Kaminski and Anjam Ahmad
Ben Parsons
Steven Leppard

Depending on the number of candidates we would then interview from 3pm 
through to 6.00pm or 7pm.  I will be receiving the CVs of at least two more 
candidates from Huxley associates later.  One constraint is that Kirstee 
Hewitt can only START interviews at 5.30pm.

CVs:
ZIA AKBAR KIRSTEE HEWITT RAMA GATIGANTI RENE LEDIS AMIT BARTARYA
  

Regards & Thanks,

Anjam

P.S. The candidates are already aware that they are being considered; the two 
positions are a junior value-at-risk and credit risk model quantitative 
analyst, the other position is a generalist quantitative analyst position.
