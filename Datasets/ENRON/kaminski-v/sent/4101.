Rick,

Aram is coming to Houston, in my view, to explore the possibility of coming 
back to Enron
(given uncertain situation under the Scottish rule at the old Pacificorp). 

I shall suggest that he meet  with you and/or Ted Murphy as well.

I can wait for Karen to come back. It's not urgent. We are still working on
the volumetric  risk module and the team is making a very good progress.
They gave a  presentation today to Rick Carson and me.

We have to decide what comes next  (Asset/Liability Model or
Operational Risk Model).


Vince
