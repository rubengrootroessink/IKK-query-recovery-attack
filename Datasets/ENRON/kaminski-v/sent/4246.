Dear Vince,
1.I also think US lawyers are too careful,including
mine.I will send you a very nice paper I have with
Dilip Madan & Peter Carr about pricing in incomplete
markets with acceptable risk.For the time being,it is
still private but should go public soon!
2.Good news for Oct 4 & 5
3.For Bachelier,which is an amazing success(you
should look at the list of "contributed papers" on
our website,I would like you to chair one of the 4
sessions with the BIG guys.You are very high on
my list among practitioners (no flattery here)
Helyette
