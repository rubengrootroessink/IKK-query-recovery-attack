Subject: Agenda Items for Osman Sezgen for the Research Group Offsite

Future directions, concerning the outsourcing business, that I think are 
important are:

(1) development of methodologies to speed up the pricing/project development 
process,

(2) adaptation of processes developed for the US to Europe and other markets, 
and

(3) development of pricing methodologies for the mid-market segment of 
facilities.
