Jeff,

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip).
I think the organization is very interested in him.

I don't know what  "illicts your attention" means.

Subject: Howard Confirmation


Hi Vince, I'm on vacation from Friday (today) until Tuesday. Rachel/London 
sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention- Did 
they get it right to meet you satisfaction? I hope your interview goes well 
with Howard too. It's all set.

Any feedback on the guys from Ford Credit and Citigroup/Oxford University? I 
own them outright- no other firms involved! FYI: My fees are always much less 
on these candidates (exclusive ownership by myself) as there are no middlemen 
involved from these "other firms". I luckily have been attracting very 
talented candidates with just doing business "as myself" rather than MRI. I 
am very encouraged. Please check them out, Vince... as you know- I always 
send you them first then on to my other clients -if you reject them.
Bye Vince, Thank you for the business!
Jeff
PS- Use my cellphone if you want me (the next 4 days) for anything; I'm here 
for you- 949 813 2241
