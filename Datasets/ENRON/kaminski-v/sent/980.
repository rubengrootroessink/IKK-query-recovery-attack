Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Pertaining to our visit to your kind company in February, we are required
to obtain Visas for the trip. To apply for the Visas, the Embassy requires
a letter from the US Company confirming our meeting or visit. We would
really be grateful if you can fax us a confirmation letter so that we can
proceed with our Visa application. Please fax the letter to:

Mr. Nur Azmin Abu Bakar
Head, Risk Assessment and Control
Corporate Risk Management Unit,
Corporate Planning and Development Division
Level 71, Tower 1, Petronas Twin Towers,
Kuala Lumpur City Centre,

Your speedy reply is greatly appreciated.

Thank you and regards,

Khairuddin .
