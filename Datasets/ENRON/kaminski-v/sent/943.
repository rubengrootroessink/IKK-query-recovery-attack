Subject: Relief for Earthquake Victims in El Salvador

On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's 
central coast.  The death toll is currently at 700, and the damage has been 
estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of 
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To 
print a Matching Gift form, please click here and then click on gifts, grants 
and giving.  Please fill out the form and send it with your check to 
3AC-1409.  We will send the money collected, along with a check from Enron 
for the same amount, to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write 
"El Salvador" on your check.  

If you have any questions, please contact Misha Siegel via email.  
Thank you, in advance, for your support!
