Sanjeev and John,

Thanks for your continuing interest for the storage model.   The storage 
model is
the extension to the swing model we sent you earlier, in the case of swing, 
you are only allowed to
withdraw or hold. 

 I will add some heading to the "log" files from the 
model.  These files includes

Curve.txt  which records the price trajectories of the  first 10 simulations,

Op???.txt, where ??? are the numbers represent the day,  these files record
decisions for each gas level, each price node for the given day.

All these files are C:\temp.

I did a presentation about the storage valuation, which explains the basic 
ideas.  
Take a look, I am open for more discussions.

Zimin
