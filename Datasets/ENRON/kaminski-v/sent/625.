Andy,

I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top 
finance practitioners and
academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who
has already received a commitment from a number
of most distinguished CFOs. 

Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this 
forum.
I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.

Vince
