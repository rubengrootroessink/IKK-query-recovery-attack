I understand this has been cancelled - no problem - life is kind of hectic

Kind regards

Thanks for your message. I am in process of

September. I delayed  responding to you message till
I had more specific information.

in London on Monday morning (September 18) and  leave on
Thursday in the evening.

Please, let me know what would be convenient time
to meet. You can send me an E-mail message and my secretary
will contact to confirm the date and place of the meeting.
My assistant's name is Shirley Crenshaw and her phone

I look forward to meeting you, Tom and Julian.

I understand that you will be in London around 20 September.  Tom Lewthwaite 
has
asked me to arrange a meeting between you, Tom and Julian Leake.  I understand
that you have met Tom and Julian before.   I would also like to attend - I am 
a
manager in our UK Financial Services practice with responsibilty for Enron 
from
a UK financial services perspective.  We would like to discuss any risk
management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which 
we
could assist.

If you are happy to meet on this basis, I would be grateful if you could let 
me
know how you to proceed (whether I should arrange timings with you, your
secretary, someone in London etc).  You can contact me on +44 20 7783 7446 (at
Enron's London offices) or on this e-mail address.

Kind Regards

Paul Day
