Hi,

?

My name is Larry Roberts.? I'm one of the millions of Internet users with a 
sight problem.? The University of Maryland says seven percent of all Users 
have visual disabilities.? Please take a moment to consider the importance of 
making WebPages accessible for all people.

?

There are hundreds of disabilities involving those with sight problems and 
other 'virtual' disabilities.? The good news is disabled Users can easily 
access sites that comply with universal standards.? Unfortunately, the vast 
majority of sites don't bother to make these simple changes to their 
WebPages.?

?

If you are a disabled user we would be honored to help you set up your Web 
Site absolutely free.? If you already have a Web Site and would like some 
help making it accessible to all Internet users, we offer a complete package 
on W3C Compliancy, including a Real Player Video for a small donation.? Once 
your site is accessible we will gladly add your link to our page.? If you 
can't afford to make a donation then write us and we will help you no 
questions asked.??

?

And more good news, Accessible Sites display virtually the same when viewed 
with any Internet browser.? If you have a Web site for your business on the 
web you'll be happy to know that you are compliant with Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, as it applies to all Federal contractors. This law 
requires the government can only procure through accessible mediums that are 
inclusive.

?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this e-mail.? If you 
currently don't have a Web site, but know a friend who does could you a take 
a moment and forward them this information.?

?

It's quite simple to make a Universally Accessible Web site, for further 
information on Web Site Compliancy and all the information I listed above 
just click the link below: http://www.web-accessibilty.bigstep.com/

?

Sincerely,

?

Larry Roberts

Founder, Kindred-Souls.org

?

This is not SPAM and I'm not trying to sell you anything.? My goal is to 
provide every Internet user with information on how to make their Web sites 
accessible to people suffering with disabilities.? I'm the founder of a 
non-profit charity dedicated to universal Web accessibility.? I also provide 
a free Internet community with thousands of resources for Users suffering 
from disabilities at: http://www.kindred-souls.org
