Subject: Load Forecasting Project Schedule



Based on the discussions we had on Monday, August 14th, the preliminary
project timeline shown below, and your request that some Gas Supply Planning
Personnel be available to review and assist with the work:
Data Collection:  August 15 to September 14
Model Design and Building: September 15 to October 14
Interface Design and Building: October 15 to November 15

Gas Supply Planning proposes the following schedule for visits to Houston:
Ketra Schmitt:  September 18, 19, 20  (Model structure)
John Wirick: October 23, 24, 25   (Model test and interface basics)
Jake Norment: November 6, 7, 8   (Interface refinement)

We understand that we should fly into Houston International and stay at
either the Hyatt Downtown or the Doubletree to be near the Enron office at
1400 Smith Street.

Looking forward to an interesting and successful project.
