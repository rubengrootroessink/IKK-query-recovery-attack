Hi Vince

That's great - delighted you'll be participating. I've put you down as the
chairman for stream 1, day 1 on 9 May 2000.

By the way, is your job title still VP, Head of Research at Enron North
America? I need to know for the brochure.

If I don't speak to you before the new year, I wish you a very Merry Xmas
and a Happy New Millennium!

Emma
