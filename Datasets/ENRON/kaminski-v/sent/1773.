Brad,

I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.

Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I=
=20
think the system is doing:


Curve shift =3D today's price - yesterady's price

P/L due to curve shift =3D today's market value using today's price curve (=
with=20
everything esle the same as yesterday's) - yesterday's market value using=
=20
yesterday's price curve.

So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order=20
terms.
We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri=
ce=20
change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore=
tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the =
delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde=
r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?=
