Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

The following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special=20
announcement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting=20
Standards Board (FASB).

FASB 133
FASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting=20
Standards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the=20
requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote again=
st=20
the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility=
,=20
and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a=
=20
summary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during=
=20
May 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If=
=20
you, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please=
=20
contact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy=20
Suppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.

FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***Bill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee***
The Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the=
=20
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  The bill would repeal PUHCA an=
d=20
transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities=
=20
and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and=20
appropriate state agencies.
S.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY),=
=20
the first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition=
=20
Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for=20
electric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of=20
representatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade=20
Commission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of=20
Agriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also=
=20
contained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that woul=
d=20
preserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and d=
o=20
not include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to=

energy.
Another amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by=

in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies=
=20
and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets.

 ***Institute=02=07s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hi=
ll***

The tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association=20
(APPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced =
in=20
the House.  The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a=20
measure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th=
=20
Congress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine=20
original co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.

HR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-fre=
e=20
sale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear=
=20
decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing=20
deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking,=

3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections =
to=20
transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use=
=20
tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distributio=
n=20
facilities.

The measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has=
=20
urged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will=
=20
help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute=
=20
noted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energ=

Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and=20
stand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to=
=20
be held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees,=20
probably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal.

 ADMINISTRATION/FERC

***White House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***

President Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget=
=20
request to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal=20
*moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percen=
t=20
in 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The=
=20
budget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5=
.6=20
trillion surplus over the next ten years.

In the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government=02=07s=
=20
*longstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most=20
federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.=
 =20
It proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy program=
s,=20
and about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of=
=20
traditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE=02=07s budget request was=
 $19.2=20
billion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later=
=20
figure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal=
=20
year 2001.

In the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in=
=20
discretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program=
=20
focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws.

 ***Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC=02=07s Massey As=
serts***

Electric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands=
=20
of regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has=20
asserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum=
=20
in Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to th=
e=20
key elements of a national energy strategy.

First, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy=
=20
commodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum=20
attendees that *all the supply in the world won=02=07t help unless it can b=
e=20
delivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.* =20
Commissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential=20
element of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty:=
=20
that *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail=
=20
jurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work togeth=
er=20
on market structure.

The final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner=20
specified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail t=
o=20
do their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulat=
or=20
to ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely=
=20
think twice before heading down the restructuring path.*
