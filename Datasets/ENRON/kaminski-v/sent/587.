Jinbaek,

This is fine though you are welcome to spend more
time with us this summer.

Dr. Kaminski,

Thanks for your answer.
Before I tell you the time frame,
I'll need to talk with my advisor, first.
Because here is an on-going-project.
I need to coordinate the schedule.

I'll appreciate it if you understand my situation,
and give me some time (less than a week, of course).

For your reference,
probably
the dates I'd like to ask you will be
from mid-May to mid-July (2 months)

Warm regards,
Jinbaek
