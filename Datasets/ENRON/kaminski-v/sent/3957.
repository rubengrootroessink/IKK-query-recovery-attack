Hello Vince,

How are you?

Not much around except that I am seriously studying for Gmat. I am going to
take this test between June 12 to 15 and during the week following it I hope
to be ready to take TOEFL.
So far I am most concerned about writing and reading parts that require of
knowledge and using good vocabulary and for me is a time consuming because I
feel lost for words very often.
Ok, I be positive ...

I am writing to ask you for your support - recommendations.
I thought it might be more respected when I show recommendations "from here"
than from some people from different country.

Would you like to do it?

I am not quite sure what type of rec would you be able to provide me with.
I think it could be somehow based on our Aiesec relationship?
Do you have any other ideas?

I would like to bring this letter to the university next week along with my
request of application transfer from MBA dep to MS.
As for today I have enough recommendations - in numbers - but may be some
more recent one would add more value into it.
Do you need more details on: to whom it may concern or any others?

Please let me know if you can help?

Best regards


Patrycja
