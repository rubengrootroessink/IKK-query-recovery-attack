Hi,

Details of our session info. at the INFORMS conference can be found at the
following link.  It'll be in the afternoon of 11/6 (Monday).

http://www.informs.org/Conf/SanAntonio2000//TALKS/MD29.html

Since we have 5 speakers, I expect each of us will have no more than 20
minutes to present.  Please keep that in mind and e-mail me if you have
any questions.  Please also inform me if there will be any changes.  Look
forward to seeing you all in San Antonio.

Best regards,

Shijie
