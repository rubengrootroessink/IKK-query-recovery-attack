Subject: Electricity price volatility


Dear Dr. Kaminski,
I'm an economist (M.Sc., Caltech, Ph.D., Iowa) who has been working for the
Alberta government for the last seven years on electricity deregulation in
Alberta, Canada. I have been looking for research papers on the measurement
and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.

As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy
decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in
designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the
design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price
volatility.

I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at
Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called "Volatility of Electricity Prices -
Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes." (I've also found a
multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed
closest to what I'm looking for.)

Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any
help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sid Carlson
