Dear Mr Kaminski, 
?
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in 
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning 
the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - 
brilliant!
?
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. 
The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I 
would me more than happy if you could join us again.

something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility 
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would 
be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has 
not been covered  yet.
