Jana,

Thanks again for the invitation to join you at the Rodeo. It was a great 
pleasure
to meet you and your husband.

What   about getting together next week for a movie and/or dinner? I shall 
call you
later this week to find out when you are free. I have a trip to NYC on 
Tuesday and 
Wednesday, but Thursday or Friday should be fine.

I have  a speaking engagement on April 6 in Florida (a conference organized by
Florida Power and Light). This means I shall miss the meeting of
the Symphony Partners on that day. Please, keep me in mind for the following
meetings and I shall be very glad to join you.

Vince

Vince,
It was a pleasure to meet you last week at our Rodeo night.  I am glad you
could join us.

I am going to fax you the invitation to the Houston Symphony Partners party
that we discussed.  I hope you can attend.

Keep in touch and let's get together for lunch and/or seeing "American
Beauty."
