Vince,
Thanks for the information. You predicted this would happen. Where is he 
headed?
I have been ill since the new year. I did not work yesterday and  I am here 
today till only about 1:30 p.m. Some have said it is not a good way to start 
the millennium but I think I was only getting rid of the bad stuff from the 
past!

I wanted to let you know myself (I am sure however, that you know already 
from "BBC") that I have been promoted as vice president of  Knowledge 
Management at Azurix. I really need to see you sometime soon and  I shall 
call your assistant and for time on your calendar. 
See you soon.
Tony.
