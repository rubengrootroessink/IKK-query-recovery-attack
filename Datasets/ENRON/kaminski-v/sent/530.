Greg:

Just an update on the Stanford Summer Associate and Full-time Associate 
recruiting efforts:

We have pre-selected 19 Summer Associate candidates and 7 Full-time Associate 
candidates.  The schedule of interviewers for Round 1 and Round 2 is listed 
below.  I was able to get Elliot Mainzer and Steve Swain on the Round 1 
interview schedule.  They were Tim Belden's picks for interviewers from his 
group.  I have left a message for Chris Calger to see if he might be 
available for Round 2 interviews and am waiting to hear back from him.

Listed below are logistics.  Let me know if you are available for Friday 
interviews.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts
