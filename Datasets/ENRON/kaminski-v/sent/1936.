Hello Vince :

Myself, Eugene McGoldrick, and Rick Baker are looking forward to meet with
you and your group on 10/18 at 2:00pm.  Eugene is the Financial Products
Program Manager and Rick is a financial engineer and author of several of
toolboxes.

We want to understand the needs of your group to better demonstrate the
proper tools.  Do you or members of your group have specific applications
that we can address?  Please email me those items and I will coordinate the
presentation with our group.

We would like to demonstrate how our tools can be used to rapidly develop
applications, be integrated with databases and other applications ( OLF,
ODBC databases, Excel, VB, etc.) and then deploy those applications at no
cost to your traders and analysts.

I look forward to meeting you, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks
Scott
