Huge Growth in Natural Gas Storage Tracked

     As the natural gas market approaches 30 Tcf per year, demand for natural
gas storage capacity will rise exponentially.  Although the snowball has just
started rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boost
working capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability
11.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press.
Intelligence Press' new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive
look at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key
information on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas
storage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the
largest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six,
and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new
fields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in
deliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of
about 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability.
But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes,
shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the
economy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected
to cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade. For more
