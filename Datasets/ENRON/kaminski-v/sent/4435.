Dear RealPlayer Customer,

We're excited to tell you about an easy-to-use software tool which
will dramatically speed up your Internet connection -- guaranteed.

TweakDUN boosts your connection without adding any additional
hardware to your system. And it is just $14.95 -- a fraction
of the cost of new equipment.

With TweakDUN you automatically experience faster Internet
downloads and smoother streaming with less need for rebuffering,
all without upgrading any hardware or changing your Internet
Service Provider. TweakDUN works with Windows 95/98/NT4 to
change "hidden" default settings and tweak most Network adapters,
including the Windows Dial-Up Adapter. With TweakDUN, data
no longer fragments, so your online experience is as fast as
possible.

You can download TweakDUN risk-free for only $14.95.  If your
Internet connection isn't faster after using TweakDUN, we'll
refund your money, guaranteed. Just contact us within 30 days
for a full refund.

customers.   Thanks for your continued support.
