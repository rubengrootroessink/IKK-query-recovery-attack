Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.
