Norma,

I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed
merit and equity increases.

I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
The equity increases address two issues: retention and
and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).

Please, let me know if there are any questions.
I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address
so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.

Vince
