Hi Jana,

The dress is casual.

In this restaurant we can sit outside (quite casual)
or inside (more formal dress, but still casual).

I shall  also send you the directions to my home,
just in case.

Vince

Vince
I hope you had a good trip to Australia.

Are we still on for Friday evening?  Let me know what time, what dress, and
how to get to your home.

We are looking forward to meeting your family.

Let me know if I can bring something.

Jana
