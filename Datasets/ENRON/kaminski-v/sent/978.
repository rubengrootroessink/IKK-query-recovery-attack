Richard,

Thanks for the invitation. I have already made another commitment
but it's conditional on a few  related events (friends of friends
coming to town). If the other event is canceled, I shall be glad to
join you. I shall let you know in a few days.


Vince

You only thought the festive days were over

What a better way to start off the new year than to celebrate our good frie=
nd=20
Paula Corey=01,s birthday

We will have a little soiree at my house on Saturday January 27th, dinner=
=20
will be served at 7:00, please feel free to come out as early as you wish;=
=20
however if you arrive too early you may be requested to perform some ranch=
=20
chores.

Please feel free to bring a spouse or friend if you choose.  If you could=

RSVP by Jan 23rd that would be great.

Directions to my house are as follows:

Take I45 north past The Woodlands towards Conroe

Take exit 83 Crighton road exit

Stay on feeder road through stop sign until you get to traffic light=20
(Crighton Road)

Turn right onto Crighton road cross railroad tracks

Go to 3rd street, about 1=20
 miles, and turn right, which is the only way you=20
can turn.  This is Kidd road; however most of the time the street sign is=

knocked down.

Stay on Kidd road until it dead ends at Stidham and turn left.

Go to first street (Finnley) and turn left.

Go about 1 mile and Finnley will dead end.
