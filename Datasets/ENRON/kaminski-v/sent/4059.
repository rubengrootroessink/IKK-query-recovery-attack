 Dear Vincent,

 With respect to you wanting to know more about our company here is
some background.

 Rochester was formed in 1982 to focus on the executive search for
senior individuals within Investment Banking and Commodity markets. The
operation is based in London with a global network of associates. Business
is primarily generated in Europe with an ever increasing demand from both
Asia and the United States.

 More specifically with respect to Enron, Rochester has been involved
in the Energy markets since the opening of the International Petroleum
Exchange in London. In the early 1990's, with the advent of UK deregulation,
Rochester was placing electricity traders. As always, with politicians
changing their minds, deregulation did not happen and market interest in
Energy and Power declined.

 Now that Europe is to deregulate a number of trading houses,
investment banks and the utilities have expressed a strong interest in
building their market presence. Subsequently we are working on a number of
projects that not only require traders but also complete staffing solutions.

 This includes:

 1.) Board level directors
 2.) Asset management
 3.) Corporate finance
 4.) Trading:
   - Vanilla ( financial and physical ) instruments
   - OTC derivatives ( Credit / Equity )
   - Options
   - Structured products

 5.) Relationship management
 6.) Management consulting
 7.) Corporate lawyers


 Whilst power and energy are growth areas in themselves emissions and
weather derivatives are rapidly becoming a great source of interest. For
your guide a former employee of Rochester is now heading up the emissions
marketing group at OM here in London.

 Rochester has a strong track record, and through repeat and referral
business, is rapidly establishing itself as a leader in this new and
exciting global market.

 Should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate to
contact us here in London. I look forward to speaking with you again and
promoting an understanding of mutuality between our two organisations.


 With kind regards


 Damian Goodburn
