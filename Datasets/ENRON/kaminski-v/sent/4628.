Darlene,

Thanks. Congratulations and best wishes. Please, let me know if I can
help you in any way (driving you home, delivering things from the office, 
etc.).
Hope to talk to you soon.

Vince:  Congratulations on your promotion.  I know it is well deserved!  I 
have not seen you in a while since I am not riding the Woodlands bus much 
these days.  I am expecting a baby for the end of February 2000 and it is 
much easier to drive than to ride the bus!  

Take care and Congratulations again,

Darlene Norris
