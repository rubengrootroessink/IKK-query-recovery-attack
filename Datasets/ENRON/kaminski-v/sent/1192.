Are you sure  you cannot make it just for a few minutes?

Hello, Vince!

I was planning to stop by Damian's this evening, but I think I'll go home 
instead.  I've contracted a sneezy cold, and I don't want to spread it around 
anymore than I already have.  

Thank you for putting this together.  I'll have to make the one in January 
for sure!


Sam
