Subject: Plants for offices on 19th Floor

On yesterday I spoke with our plant caretaker for the
19th floor.
She made mention to me that she was going to bring 
more plants for our department therefore , requesting
from facilities will not be necessary.

She will replace the old plants with new fresh plants.

                                                Thanks
                                             Kevin Moore

Let's see what happens......
