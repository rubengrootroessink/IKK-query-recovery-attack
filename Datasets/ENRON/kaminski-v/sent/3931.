Subject: Dangers of DSL


Hi,
I'm sending this to all the people I know because I think it is important
to you.
Everyone wants faster internet access, primarily for the world wide web.  I
know we did.
So, we got DSL from Pacific Bell.  It was wonderful!  But, quickly we
learned that we were now exposed to hackers or others with evil intentions
because they could reach our computers directly through the net.  So, we
hired a local consultant to build us a firewall computer.  For $250 we got
a secure computer running Linux attached to our DSL on one side and our
local area network on the other and were no longer easy prey for the
cyber-hackers.
Everyone and his mother-in-law is now selling DSL or cable modem services.
 But, they don't tell you about the risks.
Read this article and remember to acquire security when you acquire faster
access.
