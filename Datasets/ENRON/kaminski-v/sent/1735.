Fiona,
?
Please find attached a brochure for the advertisement of the  book.? It's 
similar to the other material we sent, so I'm assuming it will  need the same 
modifications.? Please pass along all the modifications as  soon as 
possible.? Receiving the changes from Enron is the?only thing  holding up the 
printing of the book.? Please let us know if there is  anything that you need 
from us.
?
Sincerely,
?
Julie
