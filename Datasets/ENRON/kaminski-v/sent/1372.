Alison,

My group needs generally people with advanced skills in mathematics and 
programming.
I shall try to help you by forwarding your resume (with your permission) to 
other
units of Enron. Please, let me know if it's OK with you.

Dear Vince,

When we talked last, you mentioned you were considering making additions to 
your office staff.  If you are still considering these additions, I would 
like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me.  It would be 
wonderful to work with a group such as yours.

It has been great working in recruiting, but the time has come for me to try 
something else.  I am beginning to look around, but wanted to talk to you 
first.  If my skill sets match a position you might be adding, please 
consider me.  I have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what 
I have done.

Thank you for your consideration.  Have a great Thanksgiving!
