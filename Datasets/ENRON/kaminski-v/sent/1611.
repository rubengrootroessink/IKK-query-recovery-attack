Dear Vince

I hope you are well and prospering at Enron.  I'm still suffering from
culture shock here.  I know that you have an interest and expertise in value
at risk and so I hope that you will be able to complete the review on the
manuscript that we sent to you very soon.  Please advise.

Sincerely
Richard
