Subject: Simulated Trading


Dear Friends and Colleagues:

NYMEX    is hosting a cocktail reception and a simulated open outcry trading
"class":

Thursday, Sept. 28, 2000
5:00 - 7:00 pm
Houston Center Club
(downtown-across from the 4 Seasons)

This is being held in conjuction with the Crude Oil Association.  They charge
$25 at the door.

However, as a host I can have as many of my colleagues there for FREE!

But,  I must know if you are coming by September 24, 2000 c.o.b., to give a
count to the Houston Center Club.

I hope you can all attend.  Please feel free to invite someone to come with
you. The simulated trading will be held three times during the evening, and
is very interesting.

I look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you on 9/28!

Jana

ps-call me if you have any questions
