Kevin,

Let's meet for lunch next week (Monday of Friday would be best). We can talk 
about the 
project and decide who has the right skills to help you.

The person who supports EBS is Stinson Gibner and his lead person is Martin 
Lin.
My secretary's number is 3-5290 (Shirley Crenshaw).

Vince

Vince,

I would like to meet with you or someone in your group to discuss some of the 
investment ideas and structures we are exploring.  How is your group 
structured these days?  Who would be best for me to meet?  Might you be 
available for lunch next week?  I will have my assistant contact you.

Thank,

Kevin Garland
