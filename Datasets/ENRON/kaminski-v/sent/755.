Vince:

Please include Ram Vittal to the summer internship list, if you have not
already done so.
According to my count, that make a total of 8 students from the Enron Tiger
Team who have a desire to work with Enron.

Thanks,
Donna

Donna:

I had submitted my resume directly to their recruiting office and haven't
heard from them.  I would be very willing to reforward my resume, if
required.

Thanks,
Ram
