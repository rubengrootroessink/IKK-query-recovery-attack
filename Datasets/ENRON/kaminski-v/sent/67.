Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Vince
