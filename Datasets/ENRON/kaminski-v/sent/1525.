george,

here is the presentation. I wasn't able to add a table showing the 
distribution of bids by fuel type for April 2000 since the database is not 
updated. Also, in the map I didn't make those minor changes. Because when I 
try to erase those names, the map looks ugly. when i get back from california 
let's get together and discuss the feedbacks from traders.

sevil,
