Subject: Leonard Hilton Reception-DIRECTIONS-PARKING

Dear Friends,

Attached please find the EASIEST directions to   the University of Houston 
Athletic/Alumni Center (from downtown). 

I've also indicated the preferred parking areas.  The page looks large on 
your screen, but prints normally.

Just to make sure everyone's set, I'm also attaching the invitation.

The PROGRAM will take place from 5:50 - 6:20, though the reception and track 
meet will start before and continue thereafter.

I am very honored you will be able to join me.



Sincere thanks!

--Christie.
