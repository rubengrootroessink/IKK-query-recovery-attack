Hi there Mr. Caminski! It was a pleasure to speak with you today. I look

forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.

Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
always amazed.
He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
Thank you, Vince.
Lee Wells
