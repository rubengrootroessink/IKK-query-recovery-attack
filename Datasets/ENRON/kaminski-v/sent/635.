Gary,

I got your message.  The best way to proceed is to establish direct 
communication
between you and Julie and negotiate a deal.

Vince

Julie,

I? forwarded? your message to the  weather desk.
I think you can cancel Hyatt and save some  money.

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we  have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).

Good discount (I have a feeling that  my idea of a good discount and the
weather desk's idea is probably  different?): for the one day, $1100 per
person. If you think that there  will be around 10 people or more,? then we
can offer a day rate,  regardless of the number of people.

Thanks Vince

Julie

PS  - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people  started
responding that they wished to attend. Ugh!

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason  to? pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more  sense.

I? contacted the weather desk about including other people  at the? training
course. I think that they would be interested if they  got a good? discount.

Vince,

Great. Just to let you  know,? we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones, and postponed  the open? course. It's yours, whatever you want: 1
day (specific to  what you? feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt
or Enron,  or not at? all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.
Special  deal, for sure. I? owe my godfather.

Julie

Julie,

That's definitely an option.

We?  can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal?  for
Enron
and increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding?  your message to
our weather?  desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about ?  it?

Vince,

We just wanted to let you?  know that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather?  derivatives course (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple
more
that  have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their?  final
decision. If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that?  you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily, and?  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day?  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an ?  option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would ?  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both  days? as well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I  just? wanted to give you some time to think about it. We will know  where
we? stand on final numbers by next ?  Wednesday.

Julie
