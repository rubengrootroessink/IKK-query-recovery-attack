I would like to invite you to join us for a paintball game next Saturday,
Feb 5th. The purpose of this event is to develop team building among our
student members, Board of Advisors, and corporate clients.

In addition, I would like to invite you to participate in our Mock
Sales day on Saturday, Feb. 12th.  During this day, the new members will
first receive training on AIESEC sales/knowledge and then role play with our
Board of Advisors and alumni acting as company
representatives. Sharing your AIESEC and work experience would be a
valuable contribution to our training program.

I will get in touch with you regarding these events in the beginning of
next week, as soon as I have the time and place finalized.

I appreciate your interest in working with us.

Best regards,

Biliana Pehlivanova
Vice President of Incoming Exchange
AIESEC Houston
