Dear Vince,

I hope you are well and that things round at Enron aren't too hectic. It is
my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management
Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the
second Industry Briefing - "Learning from US experience: Lessons to be
learned from the restructuring North American markets". I appreciate that
you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course
grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly
as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you
might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can
provide you with another reason to cross the globe.

Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this
year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference
before breaking into their streams.

Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems
facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one
dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk
management and the latest business issues.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation
from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the
leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.

I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.

Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know
if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we
can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would
like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it
would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our
three major annual events on three different continents!

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley
Producer, EPRM Conferences & Courses
