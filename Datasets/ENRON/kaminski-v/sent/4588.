Thank you for your response. I was very happy to hear from you.

I am also taking next week off and will be back to work on December 27th.

Please do call me when you get back. Would very much appreciate the 
opportunity to have a quick lunch with you, if possible. Hope everything is 
going well.

Have wonderful Christmas holidays.

Regards

    Dear Mr. Kaminski:

    How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick 
lunch.

    You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief 
Minister
    (CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are from 
the same
    town, Latur.

    I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.

    I will call you tomorrow to follow up.

    Thank you.

    Sincerely,

    Maruti More
