Vince,
James Valverde is confirmed for a Face-to-Face interview with you on Thursday 
February 1st at 1.00 PM to 5.00 PM.? When you have an interview itinerary, 
please share it with me so James know who he is interviewing with.? Please 
also tell me where you want him to show up, what floor, suite etc.? I am 
assuming you are in the building on 1400 Smith St., right?

We have not discussed yet the details regarding what key skills and 
qualifications you are looking for in a candidate, other than that they are 
bright and talented. Could you please share, via email or over the phone, 
what you are looking for in candidate for your organization.? If you want me 
to put a search together, I can only do it by knowing what you want.? Thank 
you.

If there is anything else I can do for you before the interview on Thursday, 
please let me know.

Respectfully,

Johan
