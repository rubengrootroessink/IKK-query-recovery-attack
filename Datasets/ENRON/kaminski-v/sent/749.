Ian,

I shall ask our lawyer to prepare a standard
non-disclosure agreement. 

As soo as it is executed,
I shall send you a copy of the binder.

Please, don't distribute it: It's an internal document.

By the way, when is your trip?

Vince

Hi!
When we last spoke you mentioned that you have workshops on real options at 
Enron.
Is there any chance that I could see the materials that you use?  I would 
like to prepare for a visit to your HQ, which would probably be more 
effective if I knew more about what approaches your people are using.
This material would be treated with strict confidentiality and I would be 
happy to sign any confidentiality agreements
