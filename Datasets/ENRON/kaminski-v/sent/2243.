Sheila,

No, we have to go through the posting phase first.
I shall ask Shirley to provide the job description.

Vince, Alice has strong qualities for a Sr Admin Asst.  Vince, have we posted 
this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this, 
I will have the recruiter contact Shirley so Shirley can give us a job 
description.  Then we can post and interview Anita simultaneously.  Please 
let me know ASAP if this has been posted.  Thanks.

Sheila Walton
