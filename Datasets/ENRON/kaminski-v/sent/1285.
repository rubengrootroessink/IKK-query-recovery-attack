Hi Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for opportunities at Enron. I
enjoyed talking you and learning more about Enron and its dynamic business
environment. I appreciate your consideration for a challenging and rewarding
position in this industry. Please find the attached copy of my dissertation.
If you have any problem in compiling this file, please let me know.

I respected your insights and perspective on the issues addressed in my
Ph.D. dissertation; including the issues on creative model building, factors
affecting natural gas and elctricity demand and supply, and implementation
of these models to simulate the future and help traders in the decision
making of their day to day business.

I appreciated talking with you. Thank you for considering me. I am
enthusiastic about opportunities at Enron and look forward to hearing from
you.

Sincerely

Dipak Agarwalla
