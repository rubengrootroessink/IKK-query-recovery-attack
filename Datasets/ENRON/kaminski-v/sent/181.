Vince,

Greetings.

Just wanted to drop a line expressing regret for my missing your Texas
Finance Festival (TFF) keynote address.  I would have enjoyed hearing your
views and catching up on things.

Regrettably, however, it appears I will be unable to attend this year's
TFF.  I look forward to seeing you again at next month's EPRM 2001.

Best,
Ehud
