Ehud,

I am flying back in the evening and dinner would be difficult.
I shall be glad to join you for lunch,

Shirley, as I understand gave you my requirements for the AV.

My flight arrives at 8:30 a.m. I can meet you at your office in the morning 
and 
we can talk about the conference and other issues.


Vince

Vince,

Good morning.

Further to your forthcoming visit this Wed., I write to clarify last-minute
details:

1.  Your ETA/ETD.  Will you be available to join us for lunch and/or dinner?

2.  Your AV requirements, if any.  Should you need either, we have an
overhead projector as well as laptop capability (either YOUR laptop, or we
can with advance notice reserve a laptop if you bring floppies).

BTW, any developments re Jeff Skilling's 2/22 conference keynote?

Best,
Ehud
