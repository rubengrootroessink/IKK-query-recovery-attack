Special sessions will give delegates an insight into the progress of GARP's

sponsored by the association.


***Take the GARP Member Survey!***


GARP, in association with CWB, has developed the "Risk Management and
Technology
in the 21st Century-Member Survey".  Over the next few weeks, we will be
collecting
your opinions on a variety of issues about the challenges risk managers will
face
in the coming years.  The survey is comprehensive, and covers many aspects
of the
risk management industry including:

*the current state of the industry
*the technological and business issues institutions have faced in order to
get
 where they are today and how those problems were overcome
*how risk management will change and grow in stature due to technology
*lessons learned

The results of the survey will be presented at GARP 2000 and posted on the
GARP
web site shortly thereafter.

The survey contains 27 questions and will take approximately 15 to 20
minutes
to complete.

To participate in the survey, please click on the following link:
