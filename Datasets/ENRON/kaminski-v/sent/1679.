Norma,

I have attached an updated org chart for my team.    




I think the following changes need to be made
1.  Paulo Issler is reporting to Zimin Lu
2.  Shalesh Ganjoo is reporting to me (who does the system show as his 
supervisor, Zimin?)

Also, I just found out that Chonawee did not get his mid-year review.     I 
didn't realize that Samer Takriti never gave him a review.   I have found all 
of the mid-year feedback for Chonawee, but I don't have an official "form" to 
fill out for him to sign.   Can you send one to me, or what should I do?

Thanks,

Stinson

Please confrim that you are the supervisor for Shalesh Ganjoo.  Also, please 
send an updated organizational chart of your group so that I can verify the 
correct information.  

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Shalesh, 
 SAP is showing Ms. Norma Villarreal as your HR rep.  We don't have the 
authority to change supervisor names.  
Please work with your HR rep to correct this information. 

Regards, 
Curtis Fincher
