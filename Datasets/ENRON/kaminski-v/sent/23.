Subject: Kaminsky Column

Vince,

I hope your day is going well.  We seem to have temporarily run out of new 
people to feature.  Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  I 
think that in the future, I would like to feature Tanya's daughter Sofya, and 
also perhaps see if we can cover some people in our offices overseas.  If 
they can produce the photographs over there, it should be workable. 

Until then, would you like to contribute?

Thank You!

Sam
