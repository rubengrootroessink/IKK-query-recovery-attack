Subject: Requirements for Clayton

Hi Vince,

 I have communicated the following requirements to Clayton.  Please give me 
your thoughts on  additions/modifications.

For EOL Model,

1.  Working program, with easily usable interface

2.  User docs, for new user to easily start using system
      plus includes details about program structure and modules

3.  Reports for tabulation of data by commodity, counterparty, period, etc.  
Should be easy to run daily.

4.  Time series description, including graphs, plus some time series analysis 
(say, relationship of volume to time of day, day of week)

5.  Cross commodity trading relationships (identify potential arbitrage)

For Gas Model,

1.  Calibrate model

2.  User docs, with complete description of data
