I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr)
from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago. They specialize, among 
other
things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our 
discussions with
the government and regulatory agencies.

One of the partners, Christopher Culp, is a well known commodity markets
expert.

Please, let me know if you are interested.

Vince Kaminski
