John,

It does not sound silly to me.  I don't get that many opportunities to sit 
down
with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat.

I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from
 Philadelphia and have to catch up  with a few things.

Vince

Vince,

i know that you are in Philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my "first
pass notes" before I leave town in the morning.  Please edit/add to or
delete anything you think is appropriate.  My objective in the notes is
just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed.  When I
place something in  quotes this indicates a direct quote.

I'll give you a call next week when I get back to town.  Thanks again for a
truly memorable experience.  I plan to frame Jeff's Enron model.  It may
sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
like the one I got on Monday.  What a truly spectacular day.

Take care,

John

p.s. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
but I wasn't able to get him to sign it.  I hope I did not offend him by
asking for his signature on that silly graph.  After I left his office it
occured to me that he might think I was making light of him.  Please
explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as
capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset.
