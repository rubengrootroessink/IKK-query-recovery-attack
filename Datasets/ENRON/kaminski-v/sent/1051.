Spradling, MBA Program Coordinator, at 713-348-3313 or e-mail her at
spradlin@rice.edu by Monday, January 8 to let her know if you plan to
attend the session.  Please provide your company name and the names of
representatives attending the session so nametags can be prepared.  Dress
is business casual.  Below is the schedule of events:

8:30  9:00 a.m.
?       Continental Breakfast and setup of your company table
?       Farnsworth Pavilion (located in Rice Student Center)

The ALP Program Introduction and Student Networking Session will be held in
the Rice Student Center (numbers 10 and 11 on the campus map sent with your

area and take the shuttle bus to the Rice Memorial Center.  Make sure to
let the bus driver know your destination.


The MBA Program Office has reserved the Grand Hall for the Student
Networking Session.  Each company represented will have a table set up with
signage for your company.  You may bring additional materials you feel
might be of interest to students such as company brochures, articles and
packets. Due to the limited space, we are discouraging the use of display
boards in the networking session.  Unfortunately, no internet connections
will be available for use during the session.

Again, thank you for your interest in Rice.  We look forward to working
with you, and hope to see you on Wednesday, January 10.
