Steve,

I sold EFS. I think insurance stocks are going up
on the hopes of further interest rates cuts.

We bought 100 books.

Yes, please, send me the copy of an article.

Vince

Good Morning, 

Welcome back. Will get some picks to you tonight. Are you still in EFS?  Hope 
so, it is breaking out to new levels today.

Question, the new book on Deriatives, how many copies did the company 
purchase on the initial run?

Also, there was an article about the 90%  non-recourse loan programs in 
E-COMPANY magazine this month, do you want a copy of the article?

Steve
