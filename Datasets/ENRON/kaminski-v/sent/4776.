Summary:
When the energy industry completes the chapter on 1999, two footnotes will 
certainly have been made to record the two dominant weather events of the 
year in the West: the abundant precipitation and the mild summer. Significant 
year-over-year weather changes have always affected western energy markets, 
with swings in hydroelectric generation and summer weather determining the 
outputs of gas-fired, coal-fired, and even nuclear generation. The shift from 
a dry year to a wet year can change annual gas use for power generation by as 
much as 1 billion cubic feet per day or 36 percent of total generation 
demand. Consequently, a return to normal summer weather in 2000 would 
significantly boost gas flows for power generation, while also adding to coal 
generation and increasing both power prices and volatility. Gas markets in 
the West and across the continent in November have experienced unseasonably 
low demand and--as in recent days--sudden drops in prices. CERA sees the 
current weathe!
!
r effects as temporary and expects prices to rebound with the arrival of more 
seasonally normal weather.

Title: Russian Gas to Turkey: Is Blue Stream in Trouble?

Summary:
The momentum behind Russia's Blue Stream gas export pipeline to Turkey has 
suddenly dissipated; because of delays on the key "protocol" on tax 
concessions for contractors, project financing has hit a snag. Both sides 
insist the delay is only "technical," but recent events suggest more serious 
problems. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's decision not to sign the tax 
protocol in Moscow last week could be a reflection of Turkish concern not to 
embarrass the United States at the upcoming OSCE summit, or to endanger the 
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, which the Turks strongly favor. After the summit the 
Turks could return to their own game plan--to nail down their future gas 
supplies, whatever their source. But that may be too simple a reading. The 
Turkish ruling coalition recently has shown signs of strain, and Blue Stream 
has come under attack from several directions inside Turkey. Although once 
the summit ends, the Turks and Russians could continue negotiations on Blue 
Stream--but in the char!
!
ged political atmosphere in both Ankara and Moscow, nothing is certain.

Summary:
Russia's 1999-2000 election cycle is being closely watched to see who wins 
and, more importantly, if the elections are held freely and fairly. Despite 
allegations that Yeltsin's "Family" clique will find a way to subvert 
elections, Russia looks more likely to stay on track, at least in next 
month's parliamentary elections. Broader public discussion of the danger of 
electoral corruption and fraud has taken place, a more balanced Central 
Election Commission has been established, and the interaction of regional 
players in the electoral process has occurred--all positive developments on 
the eve of elections. Yet, despite the implementation of positive changes, 
electoral abuses are likely to occur. Only time will tell how significant 
such abuses will be and what they will mean for the future composition of the 
Russian government.

Summary:
Russia's nascent party system brings with it a complicated web of old and new 
players and coalitions of players all hoping to cross the 5 percent threshold 
in the December 19 parliamentary elections. The formation of a multitude of 
parties and quasi-parties poses a challenge to constituents struggling to 
develop an understanding of who makes up these parties, where they sit on the 
political spectrum, and how they will best represent their interests if 
elected to office. Yet some parties in the upcoming elections do enjoy the 
benefit of some level of experience, with almost a third of this year's 
candidates having run in the last election. Furthermore, the consolidation of 
political factions since 1995 has helped establish more lucid political 
categories with which to classify parties. Although immature, Russia's party 
system has made headway since the 1993 and 1995 elections and will certainly 
prove to be an interesting race to watch.

Summary:
Lukoil's acquisition of a controlling stake in Bulgaria's largest oil 
refinery, Neftokhim, marked a new step in Lukoil's expansion into the East 
European downstream. But Lukoil is not the only contender. Yukos has proved 
to be a serious competitor, expanding into the markets that have 
traditionally belonged to Lukoil. Despite availability of alternative sources 
of supply, East European refineries continue to rely heavily on Russian 
crude, putting Russian producers in a strong negotiating position vis-.-vis 
the refineries and Western competitors.

Summary:
Two months into the 1999/2000 heating season in Europe it is already clear 
that a new basis for pricing and trading gas in the Continental business--the 
march to market--has begun. Principal-to-principal gas trade at Zeebrugge is 
taking place, with an increasing number of participants. A new "standard 
contract" and a so-called Hub Services Agreement were launched last week, 
under the auspices of Belgium's Distrigaz. Together these agreements provide 
mechanisms for day-ahead and within-the-day trading.

Summary:
Technology and geopolitics feature prominently in CERA's November 1999 Global 
Energy Watch. E-commerce is growing exponentially, with the energy industry 
contributing to this new revolution in information technology. A major 
geopolitical shift is under way, with OPEC and participating non-OPEC 
countries committed to limiting production by an additional 2.1 million 
barrels per day to reduce excess oil inventories. The result--a near doubling 
of oil prices in less than a year--assures that companies and oil-producing 
governments will end 1999 with stronger balance sheets and budgets more in 
line with societal and corporate needs. The Asia Pacific region's 
recoveries--while not assured--look stronger than six months ago. China, 
Japan, and Indonesia remain question marks, but Thailand, Malaysia, and India 
look promising, and Korea is rebounding well. In the United States and Europe 
restructuring continues in the electric power and natural gas sectors. As 
corporate mergers continue!
!
 to increase in number, with new announcements almost weekly, these companies 
as well as smaller, independent competitors increasingly turn to 
technological innovation to stay ahead of the competition.

http://eprofile.cera.com/client/ge/pr/110599_16/ge_pr_110599_16_ab.html

Summary:
Substantial sections of Africa are now open for business within the global 
power community, and early entrants have found rewarding opportunities up and 
down the power value chain. But incomplete reform processes and 
often-difficult operating conditions mean that investment in Africa comes 
with substantial risks. CERA argues that successful investors will draw not 
just on favorable skill sets and fuel supply positions, but also on localized 
understanding of emerging regional markets, augmented crucially by 
on-the-ground experience.

Product Line: Latin American Energy
URL:
http://EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/111999_15/la_alt_111999_15_ab.html

Summary:
The successful privatization of the northwest region of the Comg?s concession 
area indicates that private investors are responding to the government's 
desire to create a competitive energy market. Agip, a part of ENI of Italy, 
made a winning bid of US$143 million, or US$86 million above the base price. 
Agip already tried to purchase Comg?s but lost to the consortium of British 
Gas and Shell by US$231 million. Agip's purchase of the concession is central 
to the creation of a competitive gas distribution network in S?o Paulo. This 
greenfield concession is outside the congested metropolitan area, meaning 
that it will have a lower cost per mile of construction to develop its 
infrastructure-potentially resulting in lower tariffs than BG/Shell's 
existing Comg?s concession.

Summary:
Monthly power prices in October continued down September's lower price path. 
Although demand levels were similar to September's, hydro output continued to 
increase its share of output, but counteracting this increase was higher 
unavailability of thermal generators. This low price path appears to be the 
forecast for the months to come, with fluctuations around $15 per MWh being 
the result of changes in demand, thermal unavailability, and hydro output. 
Dramatic price spikes have not occurred and are not expected in the near term 
without some unexpected loss of low-cost capacity. The price spikes that do 
occur will likely be infrequent and around $30 per MWh. Looking ahead, the 
concern of the market continues to be that if new low-cost capacity is added 
to the already oversupplied market, power prices have only one way to 
go--flatter and down.

Summary:
Brazilian oil product demand continues to be affected by the economic slump 
in addition to higher product prices. Nevertheless, CERA expects that fourth 
quarter demand will improve, with a significant recovery in the first quarter 
of 2000. Regional product demand highlights include the south and southeast 
regions, which account for approximately 70 percent of total product demand 
in Brazil.

Summary:
The natural gas industry faces the challenge of developing adequate supply 
resources and infrastructure for what could become a 30 trillion cubic foot 
(Tcf) market in the United States over the next decade. CERA assesses the 
long-term impact of this challenge on the North American gas market through a 
series of three distinct and internally consistent scenarios.

Although all three scenarios are highly plausible, market indicators as of 
the winter of 1999 point to a longer-term path more consistent with the 
Gas-Favored scenario, with a near- to midterm risk that the market could be 
driven up to a balance more similar to the Supply Realignment scenario. Key 
uncertainties to watch over the next year as signposts to the future path of 
price include the extent of the supply response, the stability of the US 
economy, and penetration of gas into the power generation market.

http://eprofile.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111599_16/nag_alt_111599_16_ab.html

Summary:
A late start to the heating season temporarily releases pressure in the gas 
market, but it does not change market fundamentals. The warm weather during 
the first half of November has delayed storage withdrawals. However, it has 
not endured long enough to allow storage inventories to offset the supply 
decline of 1.0-1.5 Bcf per day, despite added imports. In the event that warm 
weather persists for a few more weeks, natural gas storage inventory levels 
will be adequate for the winter season. However, it is more likely that the 
return of seasonal weather will bring with it a sharp rebound in prices and a 
market scenario of tight supply.

Title: A New Set of Demons? Threats to US Industrial Gas Demand
Author: Hoffman
E-Mail Category: Decision Brief
Product Line: North American Gas
URL:
http://EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/nag/db/112699_10/nag_db_112699_10_ab.html

Summary:
Amid the enthusiasm for growing gas use in power generation, there is a 
downside risk to the future of industrial gas use that has gone largely 
unnoticed. Indeed, the industrial sector's use of natural gas, the largest 
source of demand for natural gas in North America, is in danger of not 
growing at all or even declining over the next several years. A variety of 
threats is set to act on North American industrial gas demand, not the least 
of which is the potential for continued high gas prices throughout North 
America over the next several years.

These threats have not received wide attention because they have been 
obscured by the Asian financial crisis, which forced North American 
industrial demand growth to a standstill beginning in 1998. While the worst 
of the global commodities surplus may have passed, there is as yet no rebound 
occurring in industrial gas consumption in North America. Instead, gas 
consumption in several key gas-intensive industries is now being suppressed 
by a different set of threats: global industrial competition, high domestic 
gas prices, ample supplies of low-cost gas outside of North America, 
continuous energy efficiency improvements, and structural change.

http://eprofile.cera.com/client/nag/pr/112999_14/nag_pr_112999_14_ab.html

Summary:
The rush to develop new sources of gas supply in North America is on-and the 
Rocky Mountains could be at the forefront of new supply development. Overall 
US natural gas productive capacity has declined recently through low prices 
and depressed drilling activity. However, demand pressure in North America is 
intensifying-driven by a wave of new gas-fired power plants currently under 
construction. The resulting higher gas prices further spotlight the need for 
additional supply capability from a number of regions-especially the Gulf of 
Mexico, western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, and the Rockies, the focus 
of renewed interest as an area of huge resource potential capable of meeting 
a substantial portion of the demand growth. The Rockies (even without the San 
Juan Basin) could be capable of sustaining a production level of up to 10 Bcf 
per day by 2015, with sustained high gas prices and integration of the 
pipeline infrastructure. This CERA report evaluates the resource base, ex!
!
amines the region's limited growth over the past decade, and identifies the 
challenges facing Rockies' producers.

http://eprofile.cera.com/client/nap/pr/110399_15/nap_pr_110399_15_ab.html

Summary:
Knocking more NOx out of power generation is nothing new, but the move from 
regulation to the marketplace means that the competitive impacts of 
additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions are as complex and significant 
now as the environmental impacts. The potential tilt to the competitive 
playing field has moved both old and new NOx regulations into the courts. 
Industry restructuring also means that the market will determine who pays the 
billions of dollars in NOx emission control costs. Pending court decisions 
will determine how much NOx emissions are allowed in power production and 
will also define one of the key attributes of the future competitive power 
business landscape.

Summary:
Fuel cells have achieved some successes, but more in niche applications 
rather than as a mass technology at this stage. Several divergent issues such 
as power restructuring, technological developments, environmental issues, 
power quality, and reliability are converging to give a boost to fuel cells 
in commercial and possible residential applications. The technology still 
suffers under economic constraints, however, and developments in the fuel 
processing component of the fuel cell system will be critical to rapid 
commercialization.

Summary:
Differentials versus WTI for major refined products on the US Gulf Coast 
increased during October3/4except for unleaded gasoline margins, which fell 
for the second month in a row to reach $2.16 per barrel during October. 
Responding to sharp increases in demand and declines in primary inventories, 
high sulfur No. 2 fuel oil and jet kerosene margins versus WTI climbed to 
$1.29 per barrel and $2.45 per barrel, respectively, during October. 
Distillate apparent demand skyrocketed by 0.4 mbd to 3.88 mbd and jet fuel 
apparent demand rose to 1.75 mbd during October, with the arrival of cooler 
weather and the start of the home heating oil season adding strength to both 
markets.

ministers are considering proposing that the agreement be extended to June 
are helping to support prices this week. WTI and Brent have climbed nearly 
$1.50 per barrel so far this week.

Summary:
As 1999 closes, OPEC and non-OPEC Mexico face the tricky task of determining 
the next step after their success in reversing the price collapse of 1998. A 
decision must be made on when and how to allow unused capacity back in the 
market. The stakes are high: if they fail to bring on capacity in time, then 
prices could soar upward even further and undermine much of the demand growth 
that is helping the price recovery. CERA's new Autumn World Oil Watch 
provides an updated price outlook for late 1999 and 2000 based on our 
assessment of OPEC's possible choices. Adding upward price pressure this 
quarter, we have revised our estimate of OPEC adherence to the March 
production agreements to roughly 80 percent for the fourth quarter.
