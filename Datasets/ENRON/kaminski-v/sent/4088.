Vince,

The letter was perfect.  Thanks for the trouble. 
My name however is spelt with a double "R". ==> Larrissa Sharma.

Larrissa,

Please, take a look at the letter.
My assistant is on vacation, she will be back tomorrow.

Please, check the spelling of your first name. It was inconsistent in the 
original letter from the lawyer.

Vince
