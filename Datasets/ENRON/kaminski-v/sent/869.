Hello,

I have been asked by Melanie Doyle to arrange for Nigel Price, Steve Leppard 
and herself to meet with Howard Haughton who you referred.  She has also 
asked that you meet with him when you are in London.

Could you please advise me when you will be in London and what the best day 
or time would be for you to meet him.

If you have any queries please contact me by return e-mail or phone 0044 207 
783 5677.

Thanks for your assistance.

Regards Rachel Quirke
Human Resources
