Thanks Vince.  I'll make the reservation, then send Shirley the details to 
issue an invite to us all.

Steve,

I shall talk to John Sherriff about such issues. My intention
is to vest you with maximum decision making powers. It makes most sense to
me to make decisions where the information resides.

Please, invite Anjam or alternatively make reservations for dinner and
let Shirley know. Shirley can send an invitation to everybody  in the group
on my behalf. It would be really bad to exclude Anjam from the dinner.

It 

Vince

Thanks Vince.

Dinner on Sunday OK all round.  Do you want Anjam along too? I can't really 
ask him, given our current relationship.

One other thing, have you had thoughts on reporting lines, who signs 
expenses, etc. etc., or are these issues to be resolved when you come over?

Cheers,
Steve

Steve,

Steve, this is the spreadsheet.

Also, please, let Shirley know if the dinner on Sun is OK.
