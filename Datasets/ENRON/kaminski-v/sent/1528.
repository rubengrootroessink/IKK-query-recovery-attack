Eric,

I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge.
I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS
site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. 

When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was 
ready
 and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.

I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.

I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

Vince

Vince-

Where might I find copies of the case studies Enron has published?  I'm 
particularly interested in the Sutton Bridge publication for Havard but would 
like to know if there is a library of case studies.
