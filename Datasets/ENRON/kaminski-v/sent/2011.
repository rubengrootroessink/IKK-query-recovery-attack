Thanx for visiting my web site!

Let me know if there is any progress on your front.

Also, I know we talked about several dates around early november, up to now
it seems like the 9th would be a candidate... If you could choose one (a
friday if you can) I would make all the necessary arrangement. A lot of
people here are very anxious to meet you... your reputation precedes you! If
you could be free for a diner on the evening preceeding the presentations,
or on the day of the presentation I could set up a time table.

Sincerely,


Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie
