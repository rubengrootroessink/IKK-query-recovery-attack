Vince:

Thanks for your help in this matter.  I dont want to be a bother to you.  I
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed--U.S. and world oil
and gas and North American electricity.  We have just signed up our first
web provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American
electric generation data base over their website.  I believe we are an
integral part of their offering.  It wont be long before MarketPoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models.  I a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need.  Also, I am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly
available.

I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.
I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

Dale
