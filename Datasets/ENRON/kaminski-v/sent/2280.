STAR Information Technology brings has the tools needed to help energy

The events that change prices such as weather and more are always just one
click away with STAR Information Technologys' powerful portal tools. Our
Portal products are the difference between seeing and doing. Hosting dynamic
applications such as on-line reports, calendars, e-mail, and commerce
services create a one-stop shop for users to go about almost all of their
daily tasks: analyzing customer trends, checking schedules, viewing revenue-
or project-related performance metrics, and buying or selling products.
Combining all the information relevant to users' work with the ability to
act on that information enables organizations to get more done.
Five Government Agencies Deploy Plumtree Corporate Portal at Hundreds of
Facilities-
The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Department of Energy (DOE),
Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health and Army Public Affairs
Center are deploying a Corporate Portal at facilities across the country as
part of ongoing governmental initiatives to maximize efficiency, develop
more online content and provide private sector levels of customer service.
The Plumtree Corporate Portal integrates regulatory, enforcement and
incident database reports, enterprise applications and Internet services
into the agencies' portals as Portal Gadgets(tm), plug-in modules that embed
components of applications and interactive Internet services in a
personalized portal page. The Portal growth in the public sector is driven
by its success applying business technology to the specific challenges of
government, empowering federal agencies to simplify access to their data,
reduce paperwork, benefit from the resources on the Internet and share
information securely with their employees, contractors and constituencies.
