Today's Focus: New Love Letter variant
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jason Meserve

Here we go yet again.

The antivirus vendors are all sending out alerts warning their
customers of a new strain of the infamous Love Letter virus that struck
last May. This version comes with the subject line of "resume" and
contains an attachment called "resume.txt.vbs".

The file contains a fake resume, though reports vary on whether it is a
German or a Swiss engineer that is profiled. Makes no difference - the
file infects the host computer and then attempts to send itself to
everyone in the local Outlook address book.

It seems as if the virus is targeted at customers of the United Bank of
Switzerland. The new strain attempts to steal UBS account information
off the infected computer. UBS claims that the virus threatens few
people and that most customer data is secure.

For U.S. users, the problem could be more clogged e-mail pipes. But
hopefully, the general user population is now trained to be wary of any
attachment, especially those ending in .vbs. Most of the antivirus
vendors are updating their virus definition files, and protection
should be available shortly, if not already. For more:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0817swissbug.html


Before we get on to today's alerts and patches, I'd like to mention
some upcoming coverage in Network World. A few weeks back I mentioned a
company in London offering "hacker insurance."  A couple of you wrote
in looking for more information. Unfortunately, I do not have the space
to cover such issues here.

Not to fret. Mich Kabay, author of Network World's Security newsletter,
plans to take up the topic in an upcoming edition. Mich has some great
tips for keeping your company network equipment secure, so check out his
newsletter at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/newsletters/sec/


Also, the features department here at Network World is working on a
feature on the subject of hacker insurance, and they are looking for
help. If you've got something to share, check out our forum:
http://www.nwfusion.com/cgi-bin/WebX.cgi?230@@.ee6f1b5


If you're looking for more information, stay tuned to Network World and
Mich's newsletter.
