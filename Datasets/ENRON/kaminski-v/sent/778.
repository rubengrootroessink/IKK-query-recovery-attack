Hi Vince,

After we hung up the phone yesterday, I sent you an email as we
agreed.  However today I looked in my "outbox" and see that nothing was
sent to you.  Thus, I'm trying again.  If this is redundant, sorry.

Attached is a copy of the Corporate Finance Forum I am trying to
organize.  Any comments or suggestions you might have would be
appreciated.  I look forward to Enron getting involved in this project if
at all possible.

Secondly, I am confirming the dates for the two visitors for the Risk
Management chair.

Philippe Jorion,  Seminar on 2/15 and dinner on 2/14
Andrew Karolyi, Seminar on 2/23 and dinner on 2/23.

Lets try to go flying sometime soon

Thanks for your help and support,

Dave
