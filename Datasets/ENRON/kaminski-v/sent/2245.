Dear Vince,
?
Thanks for your call the other day regarding  EPRM's upcoming enterprise risk 
management conference. We seem to be making  progress and are pulling 
together some interesting subjects for inclusion this  year. I am currently 
at a stage where there are plenty of possible sessions and  over the next 
week I will be able to decide of which will stay and which will  go. 
?
I have attached a file that gives an indication  of the topics that have been 
identified so far. Although I have bullet points  for the sessions I would 
first like to identify interested parties and then work  with them to develop 
a session that reflects their particular expertise and  experience. I also 
think that by continuously developing the points we can make  greater 
allowances for continuity between each participant.
?
Based on our discussion I would be extremely  interested in inviting you to 
lead a session on the main conference. You seemed  to have an interesting 
view on operational risk and the particular challenges  that are presented 
within the energy industry. This session will run on  Thursday, November 
16th. The title is reasonably broad at this stage and any  suggestions are 
welcome.
?
Your overall views on the current conference content is also  welcome and if 
you feel that another session is more suited to your work do not  hesitate to 
contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
?
Yours sincerely,
?
