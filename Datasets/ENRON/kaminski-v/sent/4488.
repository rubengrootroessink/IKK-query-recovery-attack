Vince,

I had sent this candidate to Mike Roberts with our weather group, but thought 
I'd send him your way as well.  Koch in Wichita is laying off quite a few of 
their employees, and this candidate has been given a lay-off notice.  He is 
open to moving to Houston.  His stats are below.  If you want to speak with 
him, feel free to give him a call!

Thanks!

Jennifer Richard

Mike,

A few months ago, you came and spoke to our HR group about what your group 
does.  Thank you VERY much!  We all loved the information, and your talk gave 
us a better picture of what you guys do!

I spoke to an analyst who is currently working for Koch in Wichita, and is 
about to be laid off.  He is going to stay until he gets his severance, and 
thinks that may be in about 4-6 weeks.  His current salary is $80k.  His last 
raise was 2 years ago, and at that time he was making $74k.  His last bonus 
was also two years ago, which was $30k.  He is considering Enron as one of 
his options.  If you are interested, feel free to give him a call at work.  

Thanks!
