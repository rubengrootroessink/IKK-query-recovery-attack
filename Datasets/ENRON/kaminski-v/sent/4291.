Steve,

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Vince

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the Research group in 
London?  One of our Analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume 
attached).  I'm sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me 
know what you think.

Many thanks,
Steve
