Giuseppe,

Thanks a lot. I would appreciate if you could set up a meeting with Prof. 
Bambos.
We talked to him during our last visit and we would like to follow up with 
some 
specific proposals regarding research projects Enron could sponsor.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and 
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing 
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the 
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Giuseppe
