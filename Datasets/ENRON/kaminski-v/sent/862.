Stinson,

Makes perfect sense. Per head cost is much lower.
We shall have enough candidates.

Vince,

Since a number of individuals in the group are interested in Java training,   
I checked to see what an internal course would cost.   We can have an 
internal class for up to 15 people for a fee of $15k.    Clayton Vernon also 
indicated that we might be able to share some of the cost with his group.   
It seems that anyone dealing with VAR or EOL is likely to need some Java 
skills, so I think it would be a good investment.
