Vince:

Michael Crew would like you to be a speaker on Wednesday, May 23rd
instead of the 24th at the Rutgers Conference.  Is this ok?

He is preparing the agenda and needs to know as soon as possible.

Shirley

Shirley,

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

 

Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director - Research

ENRON



Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be 
appreciated.
