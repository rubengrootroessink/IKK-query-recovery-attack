Dr. Kaminski,

On Wednesday, June 14th I attended your presentation entitled "THE CHALLENGE
OF VALUATION OF ENERGY RELATED DERIVATIVES" at the Risk 2000 conference in
Boston.  Can you please e-mail me the slides you presented.

Also, you mentioned that the method you used to calculate volatility for
energy prices was not the "normal" method.  Can you please tell me, or give
me a reference to the method that you did use.

Thank you,
