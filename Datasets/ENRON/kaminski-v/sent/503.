Hi Vince,
?
As always, it was good to see you again in Houston  - we all enjoyed the meal 
very much, the restaurant was a good  choice.
?
It's that time again I'm afraid. Can you pls cast  your eye over the 
attached?and, if at all possible, get back to me in the  next few days - I 
have to deliver something to London by Friday.
?
How's the course going at Rice? Not too much work I  hope.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
