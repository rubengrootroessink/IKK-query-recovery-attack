Becky,

I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
already.
I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
Overdyke),
oil trading and coal.

For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

Vince

Shirley,

GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.
