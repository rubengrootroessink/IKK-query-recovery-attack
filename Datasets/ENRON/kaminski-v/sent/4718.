Dear Mr Kaminski,

I do hope that you had a pleasant Christmas and New Year, like ourselves at 
Risk.

I am currently producing the Author Cards which you discussed with my 
Manager, Paula Soutinho, and would like to know where you would like them 
delivered to.   I have ordered a quantity of 200 which I hope is to your 
satisfaction.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate in contacting either myself or 
Paula,


Kind Regards

Janette Jagernauth
