FYI: 
You can now retrieve most all the speaker presentations of the 2001 Energy 
Finance Conference (Feb 22-23) from our website at 
http://cefer.bus.utexas.edu, with the exception of presentations made by John 
McCormack, Peter Nance, Sailesh Ramamurtie, and Ehud Ronn / Anoop Kapoor, 
which I hope to still receive.

Sincerely, 
Angela
