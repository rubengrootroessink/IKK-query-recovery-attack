Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy
