Subject: SIAM Conference



Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last 
week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the 
session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already 
gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your 
talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
?
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be 
graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling 
of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and 
who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your 
research group.
?
Thank you for your time.
?
Sincerely
?
