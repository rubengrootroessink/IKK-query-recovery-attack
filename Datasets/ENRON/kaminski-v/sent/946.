Steve, 

No problem. It was a very short meeting (most people were out).
Yes, I will be in Houston during the week of the conference.
See you in Austin and in Houston.

Vince

Hi Vince

I see you're speaking at the Austin conference.  Will you be in the Houston 
office during the earlier part of the week?  If so, I may look into arranging 
a trip out to meet you guys, and take in the conference too.

Sorry I didn't dial in to the updat emeeting on Tuesday - I was delivering 
PRC feedback to my team.

Steve
