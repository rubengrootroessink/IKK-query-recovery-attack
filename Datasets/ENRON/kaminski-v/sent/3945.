Iris,

I shall go through my Rolodex and try to find some good leads for you. I left
investment banking 8 years ago and this field changes very fast.

Alternatively, would you be interested in a company like Enron
or another energy company in Houston?

Please, let me know.

Vince

Hi,

     How are you?  Thank you kindly for your email.  Sorry I have not 
responded
sooner.

     Currently I am working in Derivatives Structured Products and Risk
Management at BNP Paribas in London.  Although I currently enjoy living and
working in London, I may need to return to the states - because of my mother's
failing health.

     Do you know of any good contacts at investment banks that I may forward 
my
details to?

     For your information, I have attached my CV.  (Please see attached file:
Iris Marie Mack.doc).

     Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.


Kind regards,
Iris Mack

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference
in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This
is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack
