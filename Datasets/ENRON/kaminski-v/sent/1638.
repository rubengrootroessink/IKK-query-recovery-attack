A Measurement  Framework for Bank Liquidity Risk 
September 15,  2000
Raymond Cote
Vice President, FinRad Inc.

Raymond  Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc., a 
Montreal-based  consulting firm offering financial management solutions that 
combine advisory  and systems development services to &corporations and 
financial  institutions.

Abstract:

Liquidity risk, as opposed to credit and  market risks, has received little 
attention in professional or academic  journals. We argue that analyzing bank 
liquidity risk can be viewed as a  variation of credit risk analysis. After 
introducing some concepts and  definitions, the presentation defines a 
framework allowing to measure a bank's  structural liquidity risk. It then 
shows that combining the framework with  modern credit risk measurement tools 
leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure.  The presentation then offers 
concluding comments on the integration of the  liquidity risk measurement 
framework within enterprise-wide risk  management.
