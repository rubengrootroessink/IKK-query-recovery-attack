Dear Dr. Osezgen,

 My name is Wenjiang Jiang. I just successfully
defended my Ph.D. thesis last month at University of
Aarhus, Denmark.  My thesis  advisor is Prof. Ole E.
Barndorff-Nielsen. My main area is mathematical
finance. My other backgrounds are mathematics,
statistics and computational stochastics.
 During my visit at Georgia Tech, Prof. Shi-Jie Deng
strongly suggested me to try to contact you. He
forwarded me the info. of 'Sr.
Specialist/Manager-Research' position at your company.
I am extremely interested in these positions. I attach
my CV.  I will be more than happy to provide further
information if so requested.
   I hope that my application will be taken into
consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

   Kind regards

   Sincerely yours

   Wenjiang Jiang
