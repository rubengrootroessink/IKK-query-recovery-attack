Shijie,

I would be interested in attending and giving a presentation.

This would be also a good opportunity for both of us to meet 
and discuss the plans for closer cooperation.

Vince

Hi Vince,

I'll be organizing a session at the INFORMS national meeting in San
Antonio (Nov 5-8, 2000, http://www.informs.org/Conf/SanAntonio2000) on
modeling price volatility in electricity markets or financial engineering
approaches.  I'm just wondering if you or some member of your research
group would be interested in giving a presentation there.  Please let me
know.  Thanks.

Best wishes,

Shijie
