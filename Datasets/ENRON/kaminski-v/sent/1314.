Vince,

Following your eSpeak session, Erin Rice suggested I contact you about 
joining your group.  I have been with EES for almost three years, and during 
that time I have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on 
a larger scale.  Specifically, I excel at analytical/quantitative problem 
solving and the development of models and user requirements for application 
development.  My educational background is energy management, and I have 
recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions.  I have 
attached my resume for your review, and I hope you will call me so we can 
talk in person.

Thank you.
