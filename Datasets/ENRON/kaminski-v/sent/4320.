Gary,

Any interest in this service?
Do you want me to give this guy your name so that he can talk to you directly?

Vince

Morning Vince,

Attached, there are two today's issues of our daily market research:
1. FMT, Financial Markets Today - overview/forecast of the Major FX and
bonds markets,
2. Fixed Income Today - overview/forecasts of US treasuries, agencies, and
corporates.

Once again, I would like to suggest that I can contact your colleagues
directly and arrange free 30-day trials for them in order to save you from
being a middle-man.  Please let me know whom I may contact.

Best regards,
Vadim Pokhlebkin
