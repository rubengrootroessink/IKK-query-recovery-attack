Dear Dr. Kaminsky:

Thank you very much for arranging the follow-up interview with your internal 
clients. I visited Mr. Ted Murphy and his staff at RAC and Mr. Dennis 
Benevides at EES yesterday. I was impressed with level of risk technology 
employed by Enron to achieve its business objectives. I want to reiterate my 
strong interest in joining your group, which is held in very high esteem both 
inside and outside of Enron.? I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Rabi S. De
