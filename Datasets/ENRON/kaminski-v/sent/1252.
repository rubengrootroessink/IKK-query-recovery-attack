Grant,


I shall be in the office for a few hours today (looks like food poisoning).
I shall try to call you from home. 

I don't see any major problem. I shall call David Oxley and ask how we could 
structure  the rehire so that you are not hosed this year.

Vince

Vince:
?
Having now the benefit of some experience with El  Paso, I conclude that 
Enron would offer more for me in the long term.? If  you have an interest in 
discussing the matter further, please give me a call. I  would appreciate 
your comments.? 
?
Best Regards,
Grant.
