Subject: Rice University ALP program -- December 1st deadline


On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to 
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning 
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing 
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our 
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your project. 
We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance. 

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and 
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far, 
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase the 
diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give our 
students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal 
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the Jones 
School ALP program.
