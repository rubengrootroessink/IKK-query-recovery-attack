Today's Focus: Palm virus reported
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jason Meserve (write me at jmeserve@nww.com)


Before I get into the more serious topics of the day, I thought
I'd share a funny "virus alert" that one of my friends
forwarded to me. The e-mail, entitled "Virus Alert!!!!!!"
contained the following message:

Alert

I'm too lazy to program a real virus, so this virus works
on the honor system-

Please delete all the files on your hard drive...

Now, please forward this message to everyone you know...

Thank you for your cooperation......


Okay, now on with the serious stuff.

A number of the antivirus vendors have issued alerts about the
Liberty virus that allegedly infects PalmOS machines. The
Trojan is said to come disguised as an update to a legitimate
Palm application, Gambit Studios LLC's Liberty GameBoy
emulation software.

However, when executed, the program attempts to delete all
applications on the Palm. Computer Associates, Symantec and
Trend Micro all say they're the first to release protection for
the virus.

For more information on the Palm Liberty virus, see:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0829palmvirus.html

One last thing on the PGP issue we wrote about last week before
we get to the alerts. Phil Zimmerman, the man behind PGP, has
issued a response to the problem. Some are claiming the issue
is the result of a backdoor. Zimmerman explains that this is
not the case. Read his response at:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0904pgpzimm.html


Today's alerts and patches:


Allaire issues two security bulletins:

Workaround available for administrative interface security
issue

The Allaire Spectra 1.01 product comes with a utility for
configuring the Spectra applications and was accidentally
included in some commercial releases of the product. The tool
could be used by a malicious user to view sensitive data files
used for configuring and administering the Spectra system. For
a workaround:
http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=17372&Method=Full


Patch available for Spectra Container Editor preview-object
security issue

The Spectra Contain Editor runs objects with no security under
preview mode. This means an object can invoke any method
without proper permissions. For more information and to
download a patch:
http://www.allaire.com/handlers/index.cfm?ID=15411&Method=Full

Caldera warns of /tmp file race in faxrunq

According to a Caldera alert, the mgetty package contains a
number of tools for sending and receiving facsimiles. One of
the tools, faxrunq, uses a marker file in a world-writable
directory in an unsecured fashion. This bug allows malicious
users to clobber files on the system owned by the user invoking
faxrunq. For new packages:

TurboLinux upgrades Netscape/Java packages

New Netscape packages are available to TurboLinux users.
Netscape 7.47 and prior were susceptible to attack from Brown
Orifice, a data-stealing Java applet. TurboLinux has also added
a fix for Netscape's handling of certain JPEG files, which
could cause a buffer overflow. To download the new package:

Linux-Mandrake releases patch for xpdf, Xchat and glibc

According to the Linux-Mandrake alert, there is a potential
race condition when using tmpnam() and fopen() in xpdf versions
prior to 0.91. This exploit can be only used as root to
overwrite arbitrary files if a symlink is created between the
calls to tmpname() and fopen(). For updates:
ftp://ftp.linux.tucows.com/pub/distributions/Mandrake/Mandrake/updates


The Xchat patch fixes a problem with the way the IRC program
handles URLs. A malicious URL could be used to run arbitrary
commands on the affected system. For more information:
ftp://ftp.linux.tucows.com/pub/distributions/Mandrake/Mandrake/updates


The glibc program contains a vulnerability in the ld.so module
that could allow a local user to obtain root access. For
patches:
ftp://ftp.linux.tucows.com/pub/distributions/Mandrake/Mandrake/updates
**********


Red Hat updates usermode packages

Usermode allows the local user to execute reboot and other
system commands without root privileges. One of those commands
was to shut the system down. This patch removes that
functionality.
Sources for 6.0 and 6.1:
ftp://updates.redhat.com/6.2/SRPMS/usermode-1.35-1.src.rpm
