Steve,

Yes. I shall try to call you later this morning. I had a schedule from hell
the last few days.

Subject: Research meeting

All

John Sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss 
the demands being placed on the Research Group.  I will be making a request 
for additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most 
appropriate size for the team.

Assistants:  Can we aim for week commencing 6th November?
Vince: Would you like to teleconference in?

Many thanks
Steve
