NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Databases galore
03/21/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Databases galore
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

Longtime NetWare managers lament the greater amount of resources needed
for newer versions of the network operating system, with many sticking
to their NetWare 3.11/3.12/3.2 servers simply because the earlier
version is leaner and meaner.

<aside> My first NetWare server was nondedicated and ran with 512
kilobytes of RAM. </aside>

Some blame the Java console introduced in NetWare 4.11, while others
feel it=01,s just the larger amounts of disk real estate used in servers
which consumes so much memory (for caching, tables, etc.).

One area not often mentioned, though, is the proliferation of databases
and database systems.

NetWare has shipped with Btrieve for 15 years, and NetWare 5.1 still
has Btrieve on the installation disk, but also installs Pervasive's
(the Btrieve vendor) SQL 2000 database system (Btrieve/SQL 2000 is used
by NetWare to track installed products). Then there's Novell Directory
Services, which uses its own proprietary database. For the adventurous,
NetWare 4.2 and 5.x ship with a five-user version of Oracle. Sites
using any of the ZENWorks products get yet another database system,
since ZEN installs and uses Sybase to store information. Add GroupWise
(used for e-mail at many NetWare sites), and there's another database
system using the FLAIM database. That's six, and you may have more.

Each one of these has minimum RAM and disk space requirements, no
matter how lightly populated any single database is. Each has its own
maintenance requirements. Few sites have the expertise to optimize all
of these different systems.

If Novell would only choose a single database system for all of these
applications, total cost of ownership could be significantly reduced.
