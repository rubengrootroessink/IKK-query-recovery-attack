Hi Vince

It is my great pleasure to invite you to speak at POWER 2000 which will be
in Houston on 9 & 10 May 2000.

Would you be interested in chairing one of the streams on day 2 of the
conference? Or making a full presentation on one of the days? Please let me
know which talks interest you. Obviously, some of the talks are no longer
available but I would like to give you a choice as much as possible. Please
could you get back to me asap on 212 925 1864 Ext 151 or by return email.

I very much hope you can make the dates as I'm very keen to have you
participate at POWER. Not to flatter you unnecessarily, but I know that a
lot of people come to our conferences to hear what you have to say.

Best regards

Emma
