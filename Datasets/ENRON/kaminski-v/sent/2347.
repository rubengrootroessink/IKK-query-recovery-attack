Vince,
?
Hello.? I hope you are well.
?
Through the course of our work in developing an energy  product, I have 
learned?the publication Derivatives Week is  preparing a special report on 
weather and energy derivatives.? They have  asked us if we know of anyone who 
could contribute to the  editorial.
?
I thought of you.? Would you be amenable to my presenting  your name?
?
Look forward to hearing from you.
?
Regards,
?
