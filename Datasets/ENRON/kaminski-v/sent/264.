Tom,

We play as a group from time at the West U location.

Would you like to take lead and organize another outing.
Family members are invited and we order a BBQ lunch
following the game.


Vince

Subject: Spring Fever Volleyball Tournament - More Info

The message below relates to a volleyball tournament that will be held at the 
end of the month. If you are interested in being part of a Research Group 
team, please let me know ASAP, so that we could form a team and even practice 
(!?) a time or two. I am told that most of the teams entered are in the 
"social" category - we would be going to have fun, not a serious competition! 
Please note also that the teams entered must be coed, so we need Ladies as 
well as Gents.

Thanks,

Tom
