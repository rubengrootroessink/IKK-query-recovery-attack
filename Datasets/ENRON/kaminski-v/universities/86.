Mark!

Please review the attached article and forward your comments/authorization 
for its use to John Martin at Baylor, copying me and Vince.

John and Vince,

I have a few simple comments:

1. Please use "Enron Corp." [rather than "Enron Corporation"]

2.  page 3: as of yesterday, Fortune Magazine named Enron "most innovative" 
for the SIXTH year in a row

3.  page 5:  2nd paragraph:  regarding the "gas bank" concept--I believe when 
Jeff first introduced it, it fell flat. I think John pick's that up (and 
Enron's subsequent recovery of a version of the concept on p.6), but it's 
probably accurate to mention that at first, it didn't go over.

4.  page 13: re: Cindy Olson's comment on a possible 5 X difference between  
a "satisfactory" and "superior" VP--the difference referred to is probably 
the "bonus" rather than "compensation" (which , to me, is generally means 
base salary); also, it varies for each review period, as comparative 
performance might vary;   further, we might want to run that quote by Cindy 
just to make sure she's OK with it's publication (she might have no problem 
with it whatsoever, but I know for other articles, she's been more reluctant 
to provide that kind of  statistic).

5.  page 17 (after Annual report quote): I suggest changing "Enron's 
wholesale business... provides" to "...businesses..provide";  also, rather 
than "Enron Wholesale" we might want to define this by the term Enron uses: 
"Enron Wholesale Services"

6.  page 18: 2nd paragraph: the tense switching from past to present is 
technically correct if read carefully , but seems awkward when reading it

7.  page 19: effective February, Jeff Skilling is "CEO".

...that's my 2-cents worth!!   I think the article is great...even 
interesting (ha!)...even to non-MBA's like me!!

Thanks!

--Christie.

Mark,

I am sending you the final (?) draft of the paper by John Martin
on Enron's transformation. John Martin is a prof from Baylor who visited us 
a few weeks ago.

Can you take a look at the paper and bless it. I haven't read this last 
version
of the paper yet and I will go through it on weekend.

Vince

Vince,

Attached is my latest attempt to wrap everything together.  Our timetable
is very short as we need an "approved by Enron" version of the paper to Don
by next Wednesday.  Don has already made editorial changes for us and may
make some additional "writing style" changes but he doesn't change the
content.

I'll give you a call later today to alert you to the e-mail.

take care,

john

p.s. i had a nice conversation with steve.  sounds like he's landed a
pretty good contract with Wiley.
