Subject: Re: Recruiting  

 Good afternoon.  Packing emails--its just my style :)

 Currently, it is my understanding that we would like to interview the Comp. 
Fin. students during the same period that we interview the MBA's.   
Tentatively speaking, one schedule should be sufficient.  I will attempt to 
produce an official job description shortly.
 Kristen is out of town for the remainder of the week, so her response to any 
inquiries may be delayed.  Her contact info:  kristin.gandy@enron.com  713 
345 3214
 Regarding the satellite program, Vince is interested in the ECommerce 
program.  We think that it would be easier to keep the program full as 
compared to the Comp. Fin. program.  

 It was a pleasure to be back in Pittsburgh and I enjoyed meeting all the 
students from this year's Comp. Fin. class.  I look forward to seeing you in 
a few weeks.

-Kevin Kindall

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

All you need to do is let me know some ideal dates...and you send a job

We will try to be as accomodating as possible.

asap.

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?
