Vince,

Attached you will find a draft "thought document" based on our
conversations yesterday.  I think that it captures much of my
recollections.  Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me.  In
the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a
successful conclusion and a draft by Christmas.

Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
this right).

Have a great day.

Your friend,

John
