Folks:

It is my pleasure to announce the visit of professor Rene Carmona from 
Princeton on February 13, 2001. 
(This web site may provide a little information on professor Carmona:  
http://www.princeton.edu/~rcarmona/)

Professor Carmona is going to talk to us about his research endeavors in 
weather and financial engineering.
Similarly, we will make a short presentation of our activities and research 
interests.

The aim of the meeting is to explore areas of common interest and investigate 
the possibility of collaborating in certain research areas.

The time is 2:00-3:30 pm.  Room EB30C1 is reserved for 2:00-4:30pm.

Please plan on attending.  Also, do let me know, if you would like to include 
someone else to this distribution list.

Yannis Tzamouranis
