I'd be interested to see who else is sponsoring the conference and who the 
other panelists would be.  Since it is a first year conference, the success 
of it is highly dependent on the people who are pulling it together.  Since 
the deadline on the sponsorship form is Sept. 8, they should be able to give 
us an indication of other participants.  Do you want me to call Suresh to 
find out - he's been emailing me every other day about how interested he is 
in working for EBS anyway.  The timing of it is good - the week after 
everyone comes for Super Saturday.  I'd also be interested in what Tom says. 
I'd only do a Gold sponsorship - I don't think we need or want to be on more 
than 1 panel - either the corporate finance or sales and trading.

It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a 
good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what 
he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

Here is another conference we can participate in.  Would you rather do this 
conference or the entrepreneurship conference?

Hi Kristin

I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron
participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening
reception known as Bullish on Finance.

I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach
the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform
to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial
community.

Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.
It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to
talk about Enrons acitivities.

I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts
and feedback on these proposals.

Looking forward to a great conference participation.

Kind Regards
Suresh
