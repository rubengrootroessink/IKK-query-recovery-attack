Jim,

I shall contact Althea and make sure Rusty meets with the Research Group
members.

Vince


Vince, I am quite grateful. Thanks for arranging this.

By the way, is there any chance that I might be able to attract you to campus 
this spring before school lets out?? If not, let's definitely plan on 
scheduling a time during the coming fall 2001 semester when you can visit 
campus and present a lecture to my risk management students.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven
