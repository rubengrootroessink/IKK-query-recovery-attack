Professor Kothari: 
Thank you for the communique. Your recollection regarding a "next step" for 
Enron is correct - we are currently working 
to define Enron's key issues and research questions. The group will reconvene 
this week. Following that meeting, I 
will provide an update to you regarding our progress.
With regards,
 Amy Oberg

Dear Amy:

Thank you and your colleagues for taking the time to video-conference with
us at MIT and AA professionals associated with NEVRL.  I  enjoyed the
exchange and was left impressed by the technical savvy and keen interest in
research on part of Enron.  I look forward to hearing from you sometime
soon.

As I recall, we agreed that Enron would forward a few issues/questions that
NEVRL could potentially address.  Once we have a meeting of minds on the
set of issues, we can discuss further how best to collaborate and
accomplish our goals.  I believe both sides would benefit immensely.  MIT
faculty can research questions relevant to industry and you might receive
some answers you are looking for!

With best regards,

S.P.
