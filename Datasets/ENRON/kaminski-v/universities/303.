Pierre-Philippe,

Thanks for your message. I shall be traveling for the next 3 days. In case
you want to reach me, you can always use my AOL E-mail address. I shall send
you the outline of my presentation in a week. I shall make my trip
arrangements later this week and I can book the hotel myself. What hotel
would you recommend?

Vince
