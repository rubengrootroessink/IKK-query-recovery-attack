Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I hope I got your title right. I looked everywhere  for it and I could not 
find it. In one of the numerous discussions I had with  professor Shreve 
about you I remember having heard "head of research"...  probably energy, but 
that I could not recall. Is this ok? Also I would like to have the title of 
the conference, it is useful!  
?
Finnally, there is a request for your e-mail by a  PHD student, Do you allow 
me to provide this info?
?
?
Sincerely,
?
Pierre-Philippe  Ste-Marie
