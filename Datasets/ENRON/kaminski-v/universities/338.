Vince,

Thank you so much for forwarding this information to me as well as making 
some initial contacts on campus!  I was wondering if you could provide a two 
hour time slot in the next two weeks for the Cal Berkeley Planning Session 
with the entire campus team here in the office?  I would like to get the 
entire team together prior to the Career Fair on the 8th so that we can go 
over the strategy, dates on campus, and roles/responsibilities.  

Also, I know that you mentioned that the first couple of weeks in October 
would be the best to target for the General Information Session.  How does 
the week of October 9th look for you?  Is there a certain day that works the 
best?  I would like to work with your schedule to see if we can come up with 
a date in that timeframe.

Thanks again for your help!
Ashley
