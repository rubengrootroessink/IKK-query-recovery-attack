I received this email some time ago, and may not have forward it to you.  I 
apologize for any oversight on my part.  I'll also forward the email that I 
sent as a response.

This, coupled with the information from Sally Gould, should get the Comp. 
Fin. interview process started.

We are excited that you want to interview the Comp finance students.

Do you want to do it in Dec. or before?  Let me know what best suits you.
Since there are only 16 individuals in the Pittsburgh area... we should be
able to accomodate you...Would you want one or two schedules..?

  What is the formal protocol in such matters?

All you need to do is let me know some ideal dates...and you send a job

We will try to be as accomodating as possible.

asap.

What program is Vince interested in having a satellite program?  When he was
here he seemed less intererted in Comp finance and more interested in
E-commerce.

I sent a note to Michael Shamos and Tridas discussing this.

Let me know which program and I will see if we can work anything out?
