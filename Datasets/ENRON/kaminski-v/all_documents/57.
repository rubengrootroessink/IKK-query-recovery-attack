Vince/Stinson,

Some news articles on India.  It appears that DPC will attend the May 11=20
meeting, but will not be presenting any proposals.

They will be taking representatives from the Lender side, GE and Bechtel, a=
s=20
well as from the LNG Supplier side.

Also, a name has been thrown up as the likely person to represent the Cente=
r.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Godbole panel suggestions unacceptable: Enron, Girish Kuber=20

HOPES that the Godbole committee would be able to renegotiate the Dabhol=20
power project promoted by the US energy major Enron may turn out to be=20
misplaced. The US energy major says that the Godbole committee=01,s suggest=
ions=20
were unacceptable. In response to a query from ET, the company said in a=20
statement that the  =01&published terms of the Godbole report do not repres=
ent=20
an acceptable basis for further discussions.=018  The statement said that i=
t=20
would be meeting the committee next week as =01&a matter of courtesy=018. =
=01&Since=20
the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand thei=
r=20
thoughts, we will not present any proposals,=018 the statement said. Accord=
ing=20
to highly-placed sources in the government, the company has informed the=20
Madhav Godbole panel that it would be meeting on May 11. Earlier reports ha=
d=20
indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on May 5.=20

According to sources, Enron would be meeting the panel with representatives=
=20
of its lenders and shareholders. The Godbole committee, that studied the=20
current power purchase agreement, has called for cancellation of the presen=
t=20
tariff structure, renegotiation of the LNG and shipping contract, removal o=
f=20
dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned, deb=
t=20
restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power=20
purchase agreement. These suggestions, it seems, may not be acceptable to=
=20
Enron. The Maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the Godbole=
=20
committee to renegotiate. The committee has been given a month=01,s time to=
=20
renegotiate on behalf of the state government with DPC for a new PPA.

The committee has opined that since the LNG facility of 5 mmpta is far in=
=20
excess of what is required by the plant (only 2.1 mmpta of which 1.8 mmpta =
is=20
on take or pay), it should be separated into a distinct facility whose=20
capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge, not as take or pa=
y.=20
It should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow=
er=20
generation. Using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high PLF.=
=20
Instead, the surplus gas can be sold to other players like Petronet or Enro=
n=01,
s own Metgas. =01&It is important to distribute the cost over the entire=20
capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant,=018 says the=20
committee. Similarly, it has been suggested that Enron could lease out the=
=20
harbour facilities as a common facility to other LNG importers. On the LNG=
=20
contract negotiated by Enron for long-term supplies, it has said that since=
=20
the LNG market has witnessed great changes, particularly as far as prices a=
re=20
concerned, the power company should take advantage of spot buys and=20
renegotiate the contract accordingly.

Enron ready to take part in PPA talk ,  Nitin Yeshwantrao

The Enron management has finally agreed to  participate in a 'discussion'=
=20
with the Madhav Godbole-led re-negotiation committee set-up to facilitate=
=20
the  restructuring of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the=
=20
US power major and the state government.Officials of Dabhol Power Company=
=20
(DPC), a subsidiary of Enron, alongwith their team of shareholders and =20
lenders will arrive here on May 11 for talks with the  nine-member Godbole=
=20
panel.Though the DPC spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation, a k=
ey=20
Mantralaya official told The times of  India that the team had expressed=20
willingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end the=20
imbroglio.

Enron's response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve the=
=20
controversy which had been raging for the last few weeks, with the board of=
=20
directors of Enron authorising its India MD K Wade Cline to serve a=20
termination notice to MSEB. The state government, on its part, too adopted =
a=20
confrontational position by slapping a Rs 401 crore rebate charge on DPC fo=
r=20
defaulting on power supply.However, the sudden change of heart by the Enron=
=20
management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le=
d=20
by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) which had recently opposed t=
he=20
move to pull out of the project. This was in contradiction to the stand tak=
en=20
by the foreign lenders of the DPC who were in favour of slamming the brakes=
=20
on disbursement of funds to DPC. The Congress-led Democratic Front governme=
nt=20
had publicly declared that it would impress upon the Enron management to=20
renegotiate the PPA as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o=
f=20
both the parties.

Last week, the state government constituted a nine-member panel of experts=
=20
under former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole. Godbole had written to the DPC=20
management inviting it for talks to re-negotiate the PPA on May 5. For the=
=20
delayed response from Enron, the meeting has been rescheduled to May 11.The=
=20
issues which would be debated at the meeting include the separation of the=
=20
LNG facility from the power plant, renegotiating LNG supply and shipping=20
agreements, redefining the DPC tariff and to convert it into a two-part=20
tariff. The Godbole panel will bargain hard for removal of dollar=20
denomination in the fixed charge component and to allow the Maharashtra=20
government to sell power to third parties.

Enron's rates too high: MSEB

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is planning to convey  to th=
e=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC), a subisidiary of US energy giant  Enron, its=20
inability to pay increased fixed charges at the rate of Rs 500  crore a mon=
th=20
from next year. MSEB officials said that DPC would be  informed about this=
=20
during re-negotiation of the power purchase  agreement (PPA).  As per PPA,=
=20
the increased rate will come into effect from January,  2002 following=20
completion of DPC's 1,444 MW second phase of the  project in October this=
=20
year. The PPA also says that the fixed rate will  have to be paid to the=20
company irrespective of the consumption of  electricity.=20

 At present MSEB is paying fixed chages of Rs 95 crore a month to  DPC for=
=20
its first phase of the project, generating 740 MW power.  ''We have been=20
raising this issue with DPC for last couple of months,  highlighting that=
=20
this (fixed charges from next year) is not viable for  us. Even state Chief=
=20
Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh raised the issue in  New Delhi at a meeting=20

during the re-negotiation  process with DPC. However, DPC officals are=20
