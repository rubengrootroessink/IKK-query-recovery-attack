Jennifer, 

Thanks for your note!  As these trip details get more formalized, I'll keep 
yopu copied.  For now, know that there are approximately 18 Wharton students 
participating in 3  research projects-- Enron proposed topics-- called the 
"Tiger Program".  They'll be visiting Enron, arriving Houston Thursday the 
18th, Dinner at Churrasco's (their choice) on the 18th, Enron meetings on the 
19th.

As the details unfold, I'll keep you and Jeff copied.

Thanks!

--Christie.
