Vince:  I will send to you later today the information you requested in 
electronic form; in the meantime, please discuss with Jeff Shankman.  He just 
alerted me that he has procured the required funding and that Jeff Skilling 
has agreed to Enron joining the WeBI at the Corporate Partner level. I am to 
call Jeff Shankman later today to discuss.

This is great news for the School and Enron!!  Would not have been possible 
without your persistance and assistance and I thank you for it.

We will discuss more later.

TOM

Vince:  I will be happy to do so.  Do you wish to have it in hard copy or
electronically?  If in hard copy, how many copies?

TOM

Tom,

Can you send me additional copies of the information about the WeBI
program? I want to distribute it internally.

Vince
