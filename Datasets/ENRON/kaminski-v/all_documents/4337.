Bullet points:

1. The challenge of modeling price dynamics in the energy markets.
- seasonality
- fat tails
- jumps
- mean (or floor) reversion

2. Price volatility in the energy markets: definition and estimation
3. Adapting value-at-risk for the energy markets:
- combination of physical and financial contracts
- correct representation of price dynamics and inter-market price
relationships
- capturing complexity of energy contracts
4. Historical vs. Monte Carlo simulation vs. scenario analysis. Pros and cons
of different approaches.
5. Regulatory uncertainty and value-at-risk


Feel free to edit the bullet points if you see a typo (no spell checker on my
laptop for AOL).
