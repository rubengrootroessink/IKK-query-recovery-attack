Dr. Kaminski,

I appreciate you for giving me a good
opportunity to have the interview.
The visit to ENRON was very impressive.
Thanks for arranging interviews with people
at research department and extra interview
at the ENRON net work.
It was good to have chance to meet such nice people,
and have a talk with them.

It was a good experience for me and
I hope we have chance to see each other.

Jinbaek
