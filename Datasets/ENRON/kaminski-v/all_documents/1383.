Good Afternoon, Mr. Kaminski!

Thank you for agreeing to an interview for a business unit article for the 
next ENSIDE.  Molly Magee spoke very enthusiastically about you and your 
group.

I am on your calendar for Thursday, March 1 at 10 AM.  I will bring a tape 
recorder and plan to finish in 30-45 minutes.  Attached, please find some 
possible questions/topics for us to discuss.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks again.
