Vince,

Barbara and I agreed on a tentative date of Friday, June 16th, for visiting 
Chicago.    Your schedule shows you already in Boston for Monday through 
Thursday of this week at the Risk Energy Congress.   I told Barbara that this 
date is subject to your approval, so please let us know if it works for you.

Thanks,

Stinson

P.S. I can go any time on June 12th or later.
