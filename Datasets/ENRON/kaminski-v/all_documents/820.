Kevin

Tani Nath who heads up the Structuring and Research teams rang this morning 
to get more information on Tony.

Can you tell me who he reports to in Houston and whether that person will 
continue to manage him remotely?

What cost centre he should be charged to ? whose headcount he appears on, and 
for what group he will be providing services for, Tani was unsure on all of 
the above and wants clarification.

Also can you confirm his start date in London

thanks

Hi

Tony is a UK employee who starts next Monday 12th March 2001, we have done a 
quick start in Nest today for him.

Tony will be working his first month in the Houston office, however we still 
need to set up a log on and notes account here. 

Can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to Kevin as he 
will be meeting with Tony on Monday morning in the Houston office.

Tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in 
approximately a month so no actual PC is necessary until then. 

One question - with a UK log on and notes account, will Tony be able to 
access these from Houston? if it's complicated can you please let Kevin know 
how to do this. 

any problems let me know

thanks

Desleigh
