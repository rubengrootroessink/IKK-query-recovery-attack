The fellow (Jack Linville) that I wanted to introduce you to has currently 
has a conflict on Monday, but could join us for lunch on Tuesday or Thursday 
of next week.  Would either of these work for you?

FYI,  Jack is managing partner with Pierce, Goodwin, Alexander & Linville, a 
design-engineering firm here in Houston.  He is a good friend of mine and you 
two bear a striking resemblance, at least in my mind.  Obviously this would 
primarily be a "social" lunch.

JNG
