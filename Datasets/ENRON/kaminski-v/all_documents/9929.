Vince, 

We responded to Kellie and Osman on March 21.  Don Reid decided that he did 
not need a curve for Turkey at this time.  


Regards, 

Maureen

Kellie,

I was on vacation last week. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
I am forwarding this request to Maureen Raymond who is handling such requests.

Vince,
Your name was given as a contact to get information on some exchange rates.  
Don Reid is needing some information on forecast rates and inflation rates 
for Turkish ponds for the years 2000-2006.  If you can help me we really 
would appreciate it, we need it as soon as possible.  Thank you in advance 
for your help.
