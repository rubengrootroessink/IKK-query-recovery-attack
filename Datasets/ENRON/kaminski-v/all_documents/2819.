Vince:  Update on Charles Shen: He called me this morning to verify that we 
had received his faxed paystub.   I told him that we had, and that I had 
relayed the information to you, but hadn't heard back from you yet.   He is 
definitely interested in working for Enron, and ended up saying that he 
didn't mean to be demanding and really only wanted a package a little better 
than the one he has at Williams.

I told him that I would follow up with you to see where you wanted to go from 
here, and that I would get back to him as soon as I received some 
instructions from you.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything else or find out any 
more information from him.

Molly
