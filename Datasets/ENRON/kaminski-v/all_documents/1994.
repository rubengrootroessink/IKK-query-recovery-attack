Sandeep,

Bonnie Nelson, who has drafted the attached contract for the Henwood 
engagement, feels that we should make every attempt to put a written 
agreement in place immediately.  Otherwise, we may be in violation of Enron 
policy regarding contract work.   Can you review the document prior to coming 
back to Houston, so that it can be sent to Henwood?

Stinson,

Please find attached a revised version of the draft Consulting Agreement with 
Henwood.  FYI, I am attaching both a clean version and one marked toshow 
changes from the last draft I sent you.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions or comments on the agreement or the most recent changes.  

 

WHat is the status of Henwood?  Do you still want to engage them and what is 
the timeframe for their work (the dates in the draft may need to be 
corrected). 

Bruce and Lauren:  please advise on which Enron entity should be the party to 
this Consulting Agreement.

Thanks, Bonnie
