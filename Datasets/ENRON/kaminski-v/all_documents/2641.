Great news. Lets get this moving along. Sheila, can you work out offer letter?

Vince, I am in London Monday/Tuesday, back Weds late. I'll ask Sheila to fix 
this for you and if you need me call me on my cell phone.

David,

A follow-up on my voice-mail message regarding
Grant.

Dave Delainey is on board regarding Grant.
We can bring him back at the same level and comp,
assuming that resignation was handled
in a professional manner.

DD asked me to work out the details with you. Can we meet to talk
about it on Monday?


Vince
