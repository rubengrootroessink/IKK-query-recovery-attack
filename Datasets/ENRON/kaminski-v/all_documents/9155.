Mr. Roberts, 

I am glad we were able to reach a practical solution for you without going 
too much against the grain of Enron Corp.'s  IT Policy  and Standards.  
Thanks to David Wile and Mark Hall in formulating a solution that addresses 
everyone's needs. 

In summary, 
Your Contingency and Recovery machine (laptop) will be imaged for Win2000
Applications will be evaluated for compatibility

This will allow you to use the machine as a back-up to gather weather data 
off the Internet (via independent dial-out line) in case the normal Enron 
network architecture is unavailable. 

I will follow-up to make sure we capture the one exception to the Policy and 
Standard that surfaced (Local Admin Rights on the laptop for development 
activity). IRM/Roberto Deleon will facilitate with a Risk Acceptance Request 
form. 

Thanks again, 
Henry Moreno 
Information Risk Management (IRM)

What I have:
A. I have an IBM Thinkpad and a cd for Windows 98
B. I got the IBM from Richard Weeks. I bought the Windows 98.
C. I have a valid business need to get Windows 98 on the IBM
  a. My job requires a totally independent backup to access data off the 
internet and process same for trader's report
  b. This must be done 7 days per week in the early am.
  c. I have new equipment that doesn't run on NT
   i. audio file generator (nomad)
   ii. video file generator (intel)
   d. I will also be loading Office 2000 (which I have)

The problem:
A. When I travel, terminal server doesn't work (last time I spent several 
$hundred trying)
B. On the weekends, Terminal server unacceptably slow (requiring someone to 
come in Sat & Sun)
C. When we move internally, things go wrong (this monday we got switched from 
100megabytes to 10 mega bytes) - trader's report not ready on time
D. I currently have no stand-alone backup for contingency purposes
 
What I need:

 I need help putting Windows 98 put on my Thinkpad

 (When I reformatted and loaded, it did not recognize the modem)

There should be no security risk because this system will be totally 
independent of Enorn system (just usinf the phone)


CAN YOU APPROVE SOMEONE TO HELP ME LOAD IT UP???  Thank you.
