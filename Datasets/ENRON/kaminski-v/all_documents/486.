Here's information of Credit Dimensions.  They are a PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
company scheduled to be spun off in June.  They are attempting to offer a 
full suite of credit risk management related information and analytical 
tools.  Their counterparty data base is on line as of March 01.  The 
analytical tools are due in June 01.  They say the counterparty database 
contains info. on 100K US and European names, both public and private, as 
well as "parent-child" hierarchy.  They have agreed to let us have a look at 
the data for no charge.  Mike Mumford is coordinating the test, and is due to 
contact them Thursday or Friday of this week.  Take a look at the PowerPoint 
file attached to this message for more information on their capabilities.

Regards,

Kim Detiveaux

Kim,

Attached are the Business Development agreement and the expanded Powerpoint
presentation which provides more details on the data.

I have us scheduled to meet here in New York on May 1st from  9 to 10:30am.

We'll look to hear from Mike Mumford next Friday, 4/20 for the data sample.
The attached Powerpoint shows the data elements from CreditDimensions.

I understand the Confidentialty Agreement should be back late next week.
With that we can also get to the Provider Agreement and Subscription
Agreement during our May 1st meeting.

Very best,
Craig
