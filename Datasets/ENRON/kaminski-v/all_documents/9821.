Sounds good.  I am looking forward to seeing you again.  Where would you like 
to meet?  I am in 3AC so the best meeting spot depends on where we're going.  
Any preferences?

Michael

Hi Vince,

Hope everything is going well.  I am now back in Houston permanently and 
would like to get together for lunch one of these days.    Are you free early 
next week or sometime during the first week of April?  If not, please feel 
free to suggest another time.

Look forward to seeing you,

Michael
