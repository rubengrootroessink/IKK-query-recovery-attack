Our London group's web page:

 http://www.weather-risk.com/
 (especially check out the press presentations section; it has a lot of good 
general info)

PDO's

 http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bro/PDO.htm


More general info:
 
 
 (has a bit more on precip derivatives than usual, given the audience)



Finally, according to our traders, CME trading activity is down to a couple 
of deals a month. 
I'll try to dig up some specific articles, but I suspect most of them are in 
one way or another CME 
press releases so that they will gloss over the low liquidity.
