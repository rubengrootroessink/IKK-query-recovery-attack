Vince,

I have left a message w/Bruce requesting the password for the neural network 
site, and am waiting for his reply.

Trish,

I could not access his neural network site.
It requires access password.

Vince

Good Morning,

I enjoyed visiting you yesterday afternoon to discuss the opportunity at
Enron.  Sounds exciting, challenging and a good use of a lot of my skills and
experience.  I look forward to further talks, hopefully this coming week.

I mentioned a couple web sites and don't know if they came through clearly on
the phone with my sore throat.

The neural network approach to timing can be found at
http://www.pfr.com/ptonline/

The introductory piece on technical analysis I wrote for Forbes.com and the
glossary can be found at htttp://www.forbes.com/tool/html/00/Jun/0603/feat.htm

I am also working with long time friend and neighbor Steve Nison with his
site and you can see the first on line lesson for free at
http://www.candlecharts.com/


Have a nice weekend.  Hope to hear from you next week.
