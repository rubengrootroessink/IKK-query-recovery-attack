We are presently planning our training engagements for the
year 2001.  If your organization is considering on-site training
in energy derivatives or electric power trading during the coming
twelve months, please ask the appropriate individual to contact
me in the next few weeks.  This will help us better plan our schedule
and will increase the chances of your organization receiving its
preferred training dates .   www.pgsenergy.com

Thank you for your time and have a great holiday season!

John Adamiak
President, PGS Energy Training
