Stinson,

I'm not sure who was going to handle this project - Tom Moore or Laine 
Borgman.  So, by this e-mail, I will ask the appropriate person to respond to 
you.  I have also given Tom's name and e-mail address to Ms. Geman. 

They will just need to change in Article 17 of the Software License Agreement 
the response time from 2 to 3 days and the Software License part should be 
done.  The only thing that would leave then is Ms. Geman's response regarding 
the Escrow Agreement as to whether it was agreeable to her and her law firm 
(who would be holding the source code in escrow).  I'm not sure whether Ms. 
Geman has responded to Tom about that or not.  I have sent electronic copies 
of all of the documents to both Tom and Laine to finalize once Ms. Geman 
responded.

Tom can be reached at:  x55552
Laine can be reached at:  x56470


Thanks,
Karla

Karla,

Sorry for the delay.    I have been out for the last three weeks.    Vince 
tells me that he has talked to Ms. Geman and they agreed on a time of 3 
business days for a response time.    

Is there someone else now handling this project?

thanks,

Stinson

Ms. Geman,

I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.

I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
left off?

I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
on this issue.  

I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within 
the next 2 weeks if possible.

Thank you,
