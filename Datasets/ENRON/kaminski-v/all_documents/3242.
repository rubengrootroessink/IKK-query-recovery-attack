Ken,

Either is really fine with me.   I'm glad to have you coming.   I will be out 
of the office on Nov. 21 and the 22nd is likely to be a short day for most 
people, so starting on Nov. 27 would probably work the best for us.

Stinson,

I have talked with folks here at FN, and I am happy to say that may be able
to start at Enron as soon as Monday November 20, the week of Thanksgiving.
I am in the process of wrapping up my existing projects, but it appears that
things are coming together well, and I may be able to leave a little earlier
than I had thought.  Would you prefer that I start the week after
Thanksgiving?
