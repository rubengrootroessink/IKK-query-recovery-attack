Vince,

It never hurts ( or rarely, anyway) to follow up on things.  i met with him 
on Saturday.  It will be interesting to see what he does.  I didn't empower 
him to do anything on our behalf and basically just stated what I wouldn't 
mind him repeating.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Rebecca,

I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose
to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I 
did not meet him and could not
form my judgment based on personal observations.

However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey
to you and not to act upon.
