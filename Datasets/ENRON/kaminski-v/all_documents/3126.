This file cabinet will also be located on the
32nd floor.
What I will try and attempt is keeping all Weather Data nearby therefore , 
once
we move into the new building the information will not be lost.

                                                 Thanks

Vince:

Since we have to clear Kevin's office for the new employee Jaesoo Lew,
can Kevin order a tall file cabinet to put the material in?

Thanks!
