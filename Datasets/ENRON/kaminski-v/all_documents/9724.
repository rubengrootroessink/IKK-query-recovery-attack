Dear Mr. Kaminski:

As explained over the phone, I have been doing political, economic, and 
strategic analysis for Terry Thorn, formerly head of government affairs for 
EI. Most of my work has been focussed on Asia, a region in which I have deep 
experience and speak major languages. Wtih the restructuring of the 
Asia-Pacific group, Terry is moving to a new function and I am seeking a new 
role. Since I have been based in Washington, DC, with more frequent trips to 
Asia than to Houston, I still feel as though I don't know my way around the 
company, a disadvantage in my current situation. Several people have 
recommended that I talk to you about your shop, but more generally if you 
have any ideas about where I might fit in, I would appreciate them.

I am attaching my resume, cv and a biographical sketch as you requested,

Edith Terry
Enron/DC
