Attached are the latest available Daily Position Report files for the 4 
Raptor vehicles which include spreadsheets detailing what is hedged within 
each vehicle.  One thing that I forgot to mention in our meeting yesterday is 
that there is considerable indecision as to whether or not Raptor 4 will be 
included in the cross-guarantees, so we will need to have a value with or 
without Raptor 4.  I will send a follow-up e-mail with the latest drafts 
available for the cross guarantees.  Let me know as questions arise.  Thanks 
again.
Ron
