New GPCM Pipeline Schematics Available on the Web

You can now view GPCM pipeline schematics on the web by going to the GPCM
website, clicking "GPCM Pipelines" and then clicking the code for the
pipeline you want.  You can also go to that pipeline's website by clicking
it's URL.  Finally, by "right-clicking" the code you can copy the pipeline
schematic (a Powerpoint file) down to your local computer and use it there.
 Once you copy it down, if you put it into your gpcm8\maps sub-folder, you
can view it directly from your user interface in the Data / Pipelines form
(click the Has Map box On).  If you are a GPCM licensee and would like a
zip file of the current set of maps, you can pick it up from the Customer
Support area of the GPCM website (http://gpcm.rbac.com).

  Natural Gas Markets in Mexico

  Natural gas demand in Mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8%
annually. Such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 Bcf
per day, according to government forecasts. In response, Pemex proposes two
actions: The first consists of measures to increase cross-border pipeline
infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by Coral
Energy into Pemex's supply hub at Reynosa. The possibility of a new
pipeline to Monterrey is still an option. A second measure is to implement
a gas-centric exploration and production program focused on five areas, two
of which are dry natural gas basins, Burgos and Macuspana. This second
measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80%. At present,
Pemex's 10-year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance.
