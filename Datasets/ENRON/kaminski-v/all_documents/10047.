Jana,

Friday evening  would work for me. We can do dinner in the Angelika center 
and then see the movie.
I shall check the schedule and call you in the morning to confirm.

Look forward to the evening tomorrow.


Vince

Vince,
How about next weekend?  We are available all weekend.  Would you want to
stay downtown on Friday evening and do dinner and the Angelika?  Or is
Saturday better?
Just let me know.

I am glad you will be able to come to the Crawfish Boil on 4/3.  I am sure
your assistant has sent it in, I was unsure as whether or not I had sent it
to you!  The RSVPs go to NY, so I don't have the response list.

Have a good rest of the week, and we can touch base next week.

take care

Jana
