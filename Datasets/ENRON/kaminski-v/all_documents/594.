Zhendong,

Dr. Kaminski called me back telling me that he would like to have you as
an intern student in his research department during the summer.  Please
write him an email as soon as possible to introduce yourself and letting
him know of your expected starting date and ending date.  Dr. Kaminski's
email address is Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com
