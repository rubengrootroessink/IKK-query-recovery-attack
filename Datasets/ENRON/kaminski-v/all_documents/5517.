Celeste,

I have talked to you last evening about Elena Chilkina,
an MBA Rice student who works for us part-time during the academic year,
and full time this summer. 

She asked if she could participate in the program for summer associates.
(presentations, social meetings),

I would appreciate if you could help her.

Vince
