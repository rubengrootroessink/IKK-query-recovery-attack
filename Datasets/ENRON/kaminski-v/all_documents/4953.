Mike do you agree with me? Please, ask Elena to  check what price info is 
available at XMIM.

Margaret,

The prices going back 15 years are not  too informative (for the first 5 
years) , as he industry was still regulated. 
We shall try to get  you the US series as soon as possible.

Subject: Vince Does your group have a Monthly or a Quarterly price history in 
nominal terms
for a US onshore Louisiana natural gas price (or a Texas wellhead price ) and 
a UK landed beach price for the past 15 years? I am gathering historical data 
for Jim O Hara for our Colombia pipeline in South America and these are among 
the series of data they are seeking. They would like the data
from a published source in an electronic file if possible.. Their timetable 
is by COB Weds this week. Thank you for your help. Margaret
