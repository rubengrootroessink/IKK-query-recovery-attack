Subject: My resume per our discussion


Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for returning my call. As I mentioned I
completed my MBA in December 1999 and will formally
graduate in March 2000 from The University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business.  I am interested in
applying for a position as an MBA recruit at Enron.

My interest in research has grown out of the 18 months
of intense experience working with the Chief Financial
Officer of INOVA Health System, my former employer. My
experience in finance led me to apply for the MBA
course at the University of Chicago, an
internationally reputed institution in finance and
economics.

I can contribute to this position previous finance
experience and strong analytical and quantitative
skills. I have used statistical and other quantitative
analysis extensively in both my course work and my
work at INOVA Health System, where I worked with a
team of financial analysts to develop a corporate
investment model.

I enjoyed speaking with you about an opportunity in
your division. I believe if given the opportunity to
interview with your firm, you will be pleased with our
discussion on how I can be a productive member of the
your team. I have attached my resume and will call you
next week to follow up on this letter. Thank you for
your consideration.


Sincerely,

Natasha Marwaha
