Vince,
I had a lunch meeting with Rudi and Vladi from RAC, and I also met with Ted 
Murphy.
They are supposed to get back with me by Friday to confirm the proposed 
summer rotation.

So far I have a very positive impression of the group, and the projects that 
they are involved in.
They also told me that RAC and Research people are often working on projects 
together, so I am sure that my ties with Research are not going to go away 
with me rotating to RAC.

I will keep you posted on further developments.

Coordially,

Jason Sokolov
