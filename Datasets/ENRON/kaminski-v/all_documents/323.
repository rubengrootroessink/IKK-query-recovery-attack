of  complications from MS.? British  Petroleum had 580 riders edging out=20

point three, 39 miles into the ride, and 1 hour and 45 minutes  later.? The=

After  a quick lunch I headed up to Industry, TX, population 475, which doe=

all intersections along the route of  country roads.? I made my third stop =

of the day in Industry at breakpoint five, where I had to stretch.?? The=20

day.? The next 7.6 miles were fine, but it was  an additional 3 miles to th=

finish with hills and a strong head  wind

checking in, I gulped two large  bottles of ice water, and signed-in for a=

massage.? Enron had 30 massage therapists working  to sooth the tired and=

weary riders.?  After my massage I felt totally relaxed.? Ilene found me in=

the Enron tent having  a beer.? It took Ilene about an hour  to find me sin=
ce=20
our cell phones did not work well in La Grange due to limited  cell=20
capacity.? Every year Enron has  a large barbeque in the Enron tent and thi=
s=20

other Enron riders and I learned that some came in as early as  10:45AM!

20-minute conversation  with Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron.?  Then came the=
=20
downhill where you can reach speeds over 40 mph without  trying, the park i=
s=20
now only 3 miles away.?  The park has a very hilly, curvy, and dangerous=20
route lasting 10  miles.? I stopped right inside the  park to refill water=
