Richard:

I am Vince Kaminski's assistant, and Vince received an email from you 
yesterday concerning employment for Mark Giancola.  He forwarded the
email to Maureen Raymond, Sr. Economist with the Research Group.

She is currently looking for an associate Economist and would very much
like to interview Mark.

Can you let us know the best way to approach this?  Can you contact him 
or should I send him an email asking him to give us some dates he might 
be available for an interview.

Your quick response will be appreciated.

Thanks Richard!
