Vince,

I reviewed all information available on the web site. There is a template 
that shows what kind of data SwapsMonitor provides on commodities, but 
unfortunately this template is a blank one and no example of the table given. 
To receive any actual data we have to subscribe to their service ($200 - 
single delivery, $300 - annual subscription).

Below is the template that given for commodity derivatives:


The data in this database is derived from audited financial statements, 
regulatory filings, reports to shareholders. 

I will be glad to write a summary report.

Sincerely, 
Elena

Elena,

Please, review the energy related info in this database (if any) and talk to 
me 
about it.

I would like to do some research in this area and ask you to write a summary 
report.
Nothing urgent.

Vince
