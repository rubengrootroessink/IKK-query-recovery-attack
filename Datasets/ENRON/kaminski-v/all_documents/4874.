Steve Kromer is requesting that Osman spend 1 day/week in San Francisco. 
Steve heads the Risk Analytics group for Enery Asset Management under Steve 
Meyers. I will find from Marty why they are setting up shop in SF.

Krishna,

Osman has informed me that he has been requested to provide research services 
to a larger number of clients in EES, leaving him less time to contribute to 
our work here at the EAM desk. While I am happy for him and believe that the 
company will benefit from his services, I am concerned that he may not be 
available at a crucial time in the development of the EAM option strategy.

The EAM desk is continuing to develop standard models for the bulk of our ECM 
projects. We have hired 4 people in the past month and all of them will be 
working by early September. Osman provides an important link for our new 
staff to several core areas of our business. First, his experience with 
modeling and energy analysis are invaluable. Second, as we move to treating 
our projects as options, and pricing them as such, Osman will be needed to 
assist us in creating auditable methods to assess savings volatility.

I am expecting two of the team members to start in San Francisco in the near 
future. My request is for Osman to be available to this team for one day a 
week for the next several months, preferably until Christmas.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

Steve Kromer
