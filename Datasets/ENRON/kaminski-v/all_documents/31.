Narottam,

I have in fact not received a copy of the report.  Was this something you 
sent by e-mail?  If so, please resend it to me so that I could make the 
appropriate comments.  Please do this asap, since I have been waiting for 
this report to give my comments for some time now.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Trust you have had the opportunity to review the  draft of the Dabhol Report 
that was sent on 24 April 2001. I assume that the  circulation of the report 
to the relevant people within Dabhol and Enron has  been done at your end. It 
will be helpful if all comments are collated and send  through you. The 
report can then be amended to incorporate your comments and a  final version 
sent for your records. We would very much to close the assignment  with the 
completion of the report. 

Please do let me know, if we can do  any further analysis and sensitivities 
to assist Enron and Dabhol in the  existing phase of discussions with MSEB 
and the State Government. 

Best  regards
Narottam
