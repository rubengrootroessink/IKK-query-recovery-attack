Mr. Kaminski,

It was a pleasure and honor to have lunch with you. I also enjoyed your
presentation in our graduate class.  I hope you enjoyed your visit to
Baton Rouge. Come back to visit us sometime!!

Attached is my resume as you suggested.  Thank you for your interest in
LSU and me.

Sincerely,
Datren L. Williams
