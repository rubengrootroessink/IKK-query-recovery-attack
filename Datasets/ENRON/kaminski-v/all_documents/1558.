Johnny,

Greg Spaniolo seems to be better suited for work in liquid markets--certainly 
not the situation with coal and emissions. Brad Romiane suggested that Vince 
Kaminski might be interested in this resume.

As far as my search goes, keep an eye out for the BS and MS-level folks.

thanks.

Jeff
