Hi Vince:  Sorry I have not been in touch with you lately, but we got side
tracked on some other issues towards year-end.  We have not given up on the
idea of Enterprise Risk Management and would like to see if your offer is
still open to make a visit to discuss your approach to ERM.  If so, I
thought we could start some planning.  I was thinking we could look to visit
somewhere in the mid-February to early March time frame if that works for
you.  At a minimum it would be myself and Barry Campbell from NPPD.

I hope the offer still stands as I would really be interested in how the
process works for you.  Thanks Vince.  I hope we can make arrangements to
see you in the near future.

Lonny,

I talked to Ted Murphy, our Risk Controls Officer, and
he will be glad to arrange for you a number of meetings with
the members of the RAC (Risk Analytics and Control Group) as well as
Research.

We shall contact you shortly regarding the tinning of your trip to Houston.

Vince Kaminski

Good afternoon Vince.

I thought I would check back with you to see if you have been able to
evaluate and give consideration of our request to visit about your
Enterprise Risk Management process.   If you are able to provide some
feedback on your process I will proceed with trying to find a time that will
work best for you and us (myself and Barry Cambell) to get together via
phone.

Thanks for your consideration Vince and I look forward to hearing from you.
