Larry, 

I have your fax and the message.  Unfortunately the corporate policy is very 
clear and standard on these matters and we cannot make exceptions.  It would 
appear impossible for us to proceed with the non-disclosure agreement if it 
is not consistent with the version suggested by our legal department.  Please 
let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Rakesh
