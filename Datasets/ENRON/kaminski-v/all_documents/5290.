On Wednesday, July 12 Dr. John Martin, Chair of Finance Department, and Dr. 
Bill Petty, Chair of Entrepreneurship Department, of Baylor University will 
be at the Enron building to discuss future sponsorship of The Texas Finance 
Festival and to talk about recruiting.  

They have asked me to invite all of you to lunch with us on that day so that 
they might have a chance to visit with you all as well.  Please let me know 
if you are available for lunch on July 12 at noon.
