Dear Elizabeth:
 We interviewed Allen last week for my group. The consensus is that there is 
not a sufficiently good match between his skills and our requirements, so we 
will not extend an offer to him. I would appreciate if you can send him a 
thank you note conveying our decision.

Thanks,
Krishna
