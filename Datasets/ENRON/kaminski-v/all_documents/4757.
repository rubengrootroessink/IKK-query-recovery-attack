Good morning Quentin:

Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to conduct a telephone
interview with you sometime next week.  Considering the time difference 
between
Houston and Australia, it probably makes sense to try and schedule it very
early in the morning your time, say 7:00 AM?  It would be 5:00 pm here in
Houston.

How does next Wednesday or Thursday, (8/16 or 8/17) at 7:00 AM your time
sound?

Also, please let me know if you want to be reached at home or work.

Thanks Quentin and have a great day!
