Thank you for meeting with the students from Rice University's Jesse H. Jones 
Graduate School of Management in April.  The students greatly appreciated the 
opportunity to talk with you.  Your perspective and insights into EOL and its 
competitors helped the students gain much more useful information in their 
interviews with eNymex, HoustonStreet.com, ICE, DynegyDirect, and other 
energy e-commerce platforms.

The students will present the results of their research next Monday (May 7) 
at 4:00 p.m. in room 49C1.  We would be delighted if you can attend their 
presentation.  If you cannot attend but would like a copy of their final 
report, please feel free to let me know and I will make sure you get it.

Thanks again for your help.
