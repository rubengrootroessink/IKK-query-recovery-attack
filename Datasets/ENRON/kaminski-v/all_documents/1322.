Bhala,

I double checked with HR, and the offer you received is in line with what we 
are offering to other graduate level summer interns.   If you have better 
offers, I certainly wouldn't hold it against you for taking them over what we 
are offering, but we can't really justify raising the offer at this time.

We can re-imburse you for shipping expenses up to a reasonable amount, say 
$500, if you need to ship things down.   You can just save the receipts for 
these expenses and Shirley can fill out the necessary expense forms.

Best regards,

Stinson
