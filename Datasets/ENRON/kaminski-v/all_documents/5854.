Dear Mr. Kaminski,

This e-mail is in reference to our telephone conversation on December 2, 
regarding possible opening at Enron Research (I was referred to you by 
Stinson Gibner).  Briefly, I am a geoscientist with Enron Global Exploration 
and Production (EGEP).  Enron Corp. recently decided to divest all of the 
EGEP's oil and gas assets and exit the upstream industry.  As a result, I am 
searching for a new position within Enron.  Having done some research on the 
activities of various groups at Enron, I think that my science background, 
experience and skills may be best suitable for the Enron Research Group.

I would appreciate your review of my resume (attached) and your comments 
about any job opportunity within Enron Research.  Please feel free to call me 
at ext. 67604 if you have any questions.  

Sincerely,

Freyd Rad
