Hey Vince!
Here is a picture of Howard Lin and picture of Lawrence (the guy I spoke to 
you about over the telephone) and his new resume.
I will call Alec tonight in London to let him know that you sent the "other 
Howard" (Howard Haughton over to Enron UK).
Lawrence has Banking and Online experience with HSBC- he is being examined 
only by one other company that I know of (Williams) that is my competitor. He 
also went to the Chief Investment Officer of the San Diego Pension Fund (a 
friend of mine). I don't think he is a "best fit"- but, If you like him- I'll 
get him for you!
I have a great relationship with him.
OK!
Thanks,
Jeff Wesley

Ps- I kinda like Lawrence's "look", Vince.


ALWAYS HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE.
