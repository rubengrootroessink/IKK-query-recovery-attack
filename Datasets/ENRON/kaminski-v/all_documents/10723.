Vince and Stinson,

I have Mr. Chen's resume here who has strong background fitting into our 
needs.
He has a Ph.D. in Geophysics from MIT and a MS finance from UH.    Do you 
want to set up a time to talk to him ?

He is currently in IT group reporting to Tom Moore. I got to know him because 
he was
working on option models in ERMS system. He is already familar with many our 
models.
Sounds like he is determinded to move to financial modeling area.


Zimin
