Kevin,

UPDATE: One vendor has not provided enough information for me to give you an 
"apples to apples" comparison, so I have sent him an urgent e-mail message 
for him to provide clarification on some points.

All being well, we will have the info. to you sometime on Monday = If the 
Vendor I mentioned above does not get back to me on Monday, I will send you 
the quote I have on file from Danka.

  Thanks for your patience,                    Iain.................

Kevin,

I have sent a request to our Vendors to provide us with quotes on the Color 
Copier Equipment available and will contact you as soon as I receive the bids.

     Thanks,           Iain.................

Hello Iain ,
I need your expertise again.
Our department is in need of a color
copier.
We need a color copier that can handle
our daily work-load.

This printer will be for the use of Research and
the trading floors.
As you may already know we use a lot of maps ,
charts , graphs etc..

Please inform me as soon as possible.

                                Thanks
                            Kevin Moore

What I need is cost.
