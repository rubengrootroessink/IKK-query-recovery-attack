Vince,

Thank you for making the visit to Pittsburgh and learning first-hand of the
MSCF program.  It was a pleasure having dinner with Kevin and yourself.

Jean Eisel has been in touch with me (and others) to follow up on your
interest in establishing "liaisons" at CMU.   We have a number of faculty in
the business school keenly interested in the energy field and in energy
derivatives particularly that it might make sense for you to meet.

Indeed, there are many avenues we could explore.   If your interest lies
more in broadband than energy, we might consider possibilities with faculty
conducting research in wireless technologies.  Alternatively, I would be
pleased to offer our distance-ed program (currently running live interactive
video broadcasts via ISDN to London, Frankfurt and Bangalore, India) as a
"testing ground for internet-based transmissions.

Let me know how you would like me to proceed.  (If any or all of the above
is "off-the-mark," my apologies.  As they say, things sometimes get lost in
translation!)
