Vince,

If you are interested in this candidate I would suggest that you talk to him 
directly.  He probably is not a "fit" for the Global Technology Track.

Thanks,
Ashley

Ashley,

Another student who responded after my presentation.
What do you think? Should we talk to him (Research) directly?

Vince

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Hi,
I am a Ph.D student at IEOR department at U.C.Berkeley.
Thanks for your presentation today.
It gave me knowledge and interest in electricity markets,
and your company.
As you mentioned in the presentation,
I send a resume to give me opportunity to learn more
about your company.
I hope I can join the super saturday event.
