Dale,

Friday is a bad day (Performance Review Committee all day).
What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

Vince

Vince:

Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That
would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at
about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much
of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient
with me.
