Thanks for your message. No resume has been attached to your communication.
Can you, please, send me an electronic version of your CV?

Mr. Vince Kaminski

Thank you for your response. I inquired about sending a resume to your
company, and you kindly asked me to send it directly to you and you would pass
it on.  I sent that out about 2 - 2 1/2 weeks ago. I never received a
response, so I was just following up. I apologize for any inconveniences, I'm
just very determined and dedicated about building my career, as well as my
life around Enron. You are very kind to respond to my emails, Mr. Kaminski. I
deeply appreciate it. Nobody else that I've talked to at the "other" energy
companies have given me the "time-of-day". You are very professional and
courteous and I feel this is indicative of your well-established company.
That's why I sought out Enron to establish my career. Thank you for your
valuable time.

Warmest Regards,
Eric Hilton
