Hi Vince,

Hope everything is going well.  I am now back in Houston permanently and 
would like to get together for lunch one of these days.    Are you free early 
next week or sometime during the first week of April?  If not, please feel 
free to suggest another time.

Look forward to seeing you,

Michael
