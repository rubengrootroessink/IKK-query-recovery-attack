Vince:

As we discussed earlier, I attached the copy of the petition for my summer 
internship with Enron Analyst and Associate group.
I also have the hard copy of the letter, which I will deliver to you 
presonally.

I am looking forward to, finally, become an official Enron employee.  Thank 
you very much for your valuable contributions to
my experience with the company.
