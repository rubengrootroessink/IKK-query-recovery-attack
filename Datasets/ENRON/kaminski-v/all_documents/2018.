Friends,

Attached below are please find:

1. Wharton Tiger team Agenda, Friday, 19 January 2001, 7:30 am - 4:30 pm;

2. Wharton Tiger Team Brochure (explaining the program).

Thank you in advance for your participation.  Meeting room 32 C 2  will be 
equipped for computer presentations.  The format of your presentation is 
entirely up to you--formal, conversational, computerized, hard copy--however 
you feel most comfortable.  We're currently expecting a total of 18 in the 
group.

Everyone is invited to come to Churrasco's this evening.  The Wharton group 
will be picked up from the Warwick at 6:30, so should arrive at the 
restaurant at about 6:45-7p.  Please come if you can!

Thanks again!  This is an enthusiastic, talented group of prospective Enron 
recruits--and their research efforts might also well prove interesting to our 
businesses .

Regards--  Christie.
