Hi Vince,

This candidate was forwarded from the Norway office.  He is finishing his PhD 
in Cambridge but is available soon.  If you are free on Thursday before the 
regular weekly meeting that would be good - would 3pm or 4pm work for you 
(9am or 10am your time) to set up the video interview?

Regards,

Anjam
