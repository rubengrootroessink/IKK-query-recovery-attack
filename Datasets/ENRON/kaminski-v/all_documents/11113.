Subject: Presentation in Seoul

Better late than never -- I again wanted to thank both of you for taking the 
time and making the effort to make the RAROC and Real Options presentations 
in Seoul earlier this month.  Both presentations were well received and I had 
a number of favorable comments and expressions of thanks form our hosts after 
the presentations.  I know you both have very busy schedules -- especially 
around this time of year -- and very much appreciate your help.   Regards. 
Anthony  Duenner
