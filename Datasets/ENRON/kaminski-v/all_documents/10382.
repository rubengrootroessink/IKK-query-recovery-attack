probably a bit to techy for me but maybe a good fit for Vince Kaminski in 
Houston Research.

Hi Amy

A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a PHD whose
background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
developing  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
well. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there
would be any interest from your headquarters there.

Please find attached his details.

Speak to you soon.

Regards

Simon
