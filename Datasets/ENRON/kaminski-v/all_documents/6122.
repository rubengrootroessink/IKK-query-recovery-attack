Stinson,

I will present "Market Risk Management in Petroleum Industry" for 
2000 International Chinese Petroleum & Petrochemical Technology 
Conference, Houston, Dec. 1-4, 2000.

There will be 200 plus delegates from US, China and Taiwan to participate
the conference.  It is a free advertizing opportunity for Enron.

If you have time, could you take a look at the presentation to see if any 
errors.


Thanks,

Zimin
