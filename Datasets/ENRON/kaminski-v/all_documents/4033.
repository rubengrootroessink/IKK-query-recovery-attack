Shmuel,

What about the following: "Volatility of Electricity Prices. Measurement and
Analysis of Underlying Causes."

What about dinner on the 23rd, following the presentation?  I shall be on the
campus on the 16th, but it seems that my presentation to the students will
end rather late (assuming they will show up). Please, let me know what you
think.

Vince
