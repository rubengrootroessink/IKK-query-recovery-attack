Dear Ms Feldman,
Thank you for your email.Vince Kaminski had
mentioned your name to me and I am pleased to
get in contact with you.
I am making slight adjustments in the license to
make it as admissible to you as possible(it has been
sold so far to major utilities in Europe) .My husband
and second passport are US and I am using the help
of a lawyer in my family.
I will email you a license proposal by Saturday.
Sincerely
