Dear Vince:  I just wanted to thank you for supplying a copy of the book.
The article on the natural gas market is just what I've been looking for.
The new addition, coupled with the first version's discussion of the
volatility of the gas market in the mid 90's should be very helpful in
convincing these government watchdog types that basis adjustments in
pricing formulas are not some sinister plot to deprive the feds of their
royalties.  Or should if there is any rationality in government.

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards,

Steve Williams
