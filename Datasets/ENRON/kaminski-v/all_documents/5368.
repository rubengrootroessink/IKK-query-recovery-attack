Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond
725pm 4 July
