Hi, Mr. Kaminski:


How are you? I hope you had a wonderful holiday. I just came back from
Chicago.

There is an Enron on Campus interview at CMU scheduled on  12/11. Is this
the interview for our class or for MBA students? I am concerned because I
was not selected for this interview, and I would like very much to have a
chance to talk you about what I can do at Enron.

Frank
