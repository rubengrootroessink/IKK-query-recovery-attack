Hi Vince:
This Zeigham Khokher at the University of Texas at  Austin, Finance
Department.

I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available
here. It is basically the historical prices  for price of oil, gas and
gold futures contracts and options.

Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all. Let me
know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.
All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.

Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk  at UT this fall and
look forward to seeing you then.

Regards
Zeigham
