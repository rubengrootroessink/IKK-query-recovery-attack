Helyette,

I am looking forward to receiving the brochure from you. We
are definitely interested in buying the software package from you.
Hope to talk to you soon.

Vince

Dear Vince,
1.Thanks for the beautiful"parchemin"
2.I am glad I bought some Enron shares after meeting
Mr Skilling last April with Bob Merton
3.After a terrible month of January,we may have found
a possible route to improve my son's health
4.We have added to our software forward start plain-
vanilla and Asian options,caps,floors(consistently
with the Asian options and swaptions);a whole variety
of swings of different specifications.
I really believe it is quite good(in particular the consistent
modelling of forward &Futures price moves)
I am putting a new brochure in the mail for you and
would be delighted if you decided to use part of it
(or the totality!)as a comparison with your own results.
Kind regards
Helyette
