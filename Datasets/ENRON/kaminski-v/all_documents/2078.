Just checking to be sure you're okay with a March 1 start date for Iris?

Hi,

     Thanks for the Fed Ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent
information about Enron.

     I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of
other forms.  You should receive these documents via Fed Ex on tomorrow
morning.

     Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in California, I won't
be able to start until March 1st.  I hope that is okay.

     Thanks so much.

Regards,
Iris
