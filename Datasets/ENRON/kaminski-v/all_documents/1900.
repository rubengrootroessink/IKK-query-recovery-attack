Kim:

The interviews conducted on February 2 are just exploratory interviews to
see where Punit might fit within Enron.  Vince thought he might fit in John's
group. 

The title and $$ amount will not be determined until it is decided where he
should be (if at all).  If John is interested after the interview, then he and
Vince can get together to discuss $$ and title.

If you or John have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley,

It is to my understand that Vince is bringing in Punit for a day of 
interviews.  John has agreed to meet with him on February 2.

Please inform Vince and have Vince get with John on what his title/$$ will be.

Thanks

Kim:

Punit is a Carnegie Mellon student that will be graduating with an MS in
Computational Finance in May 2001.  Several of our guys interviewed him
at Carnegie Mellon recently and were very impressed.  Vince says that he 
is definately a trading candidate.

Would John be interested in interviewing him?  I am attaching his resume
for you to look over and then let me know if John would be interested.

Thanks!

Have a Merry Christmas!

Shirley
