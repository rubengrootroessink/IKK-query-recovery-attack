Subject: Memory

Goodmorning ,

Shirley  , we are in need of a printer that will allow us to print
several  pages , none of the printers on this floor will permit
us to do that without adding memory.

I even sent the print-out to Bandit and it also needs more memory to 
print these pages. 
What we are printing is 189 pages.

Mike would like to print these pages , so instead of paying for 
memory on someone else's printer could we add memory to 
one of our own.

Please inform..........

                                             Thanks
                                          Kevin Moore

The printer is a Laser Jet 8100N.
