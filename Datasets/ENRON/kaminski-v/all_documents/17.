Hi Vince,
Just a note to confirm our meeting on Wednesday at 3:30pm.
Best setup would include a portable projector for my notebook.
I don't know how many people other than yourself you want to have at the 
meeting.
If it's only yourself, we could use a monitor on a conference table in place 
of the projector, if that's better for you.
Looking forward to seeing you.
Bob Brooks
