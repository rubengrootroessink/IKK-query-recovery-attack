patricia,

i have forwarded your resume along with an introductory note to Kerry
Cooper, Don Fraser, and Malcom Richards of the A&M Finance department.
Please give them a phone call and tell them that I suggested you call.
They are all very nice folks and would be happy to help you I am sure.

good luck,
