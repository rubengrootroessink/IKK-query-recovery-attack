Steven,

I am sure you will not embarrass the company. Let's talk about it tomorrow 
morning and 
if you still have reservations, we shall think about a replacement. I shall 
send
you the spreadsheet tonight.

Hi Vince

I don't feel too confident about preparing for the weather derivs talk at 
such short notice.  Can we consider another stand-in? Should I ask locally?  
I don't want to embarass the company.

Failing this, could you send me sample valuation spreadsheets for weather 
derivs?

Cheers,
Steve
