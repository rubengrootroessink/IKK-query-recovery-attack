   CORNEY & BARROW, the mainly City wine bar chain, is going into the
derivatives market. The chain is thought to be the first in the
hospitality industry to take a position against our atrocious
weather.

   Sarah Heward, the managing director, got the idea after meeting a
bunch of customers who had just left Garban to set up their own
business, Speedwell Weather Derivatives. About half her wine bars
have outside terraces which have understandably not proven too
popular of late.
   "They set me up with a hedge - my counterparty is Enron US," says
Heward. This safeguards a modest Pounds 15,000 of turnover.
