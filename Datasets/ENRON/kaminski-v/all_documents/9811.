Vince,
A few days ago, you met with John Goodpasture and Kim Watson concerning GPG's 
need for strategic gas modeling capabilities.  Unfortunately, I was on 
vacation and was unable to attend the meeting, however, I am very much 
looking forward to having a tool that will provide assistance to our 
development efforts.  

Additionally, let me say that we very much appreciate the work of the 
Research group and the strength that you and your organization bring to Enron.

It is my understanding from speaking with John and Kim that you will be 
contacting us during the first half of April to talk about modeling 
capabilities after you have had the opportunity to review the internally 
created model that your department has developed.  We look forward to hearing 
from you on that issue.

In the meantime, Clayton had mentioned briefly that he receives a 
report/spreadsheet/database dump periodically from James Tobin who is with 
one of the U.S. Government agencies, which contains information on the 
proposed pipeline construction projects in North America.

Would you be willing to have a copy of that spreadsheet forwarded to me as it 
becomes available from the government?
Having access to this spreadsheet would save a considerable amount of time 
since the information is consolidated all in one place.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this request.  Your assistance is greatly 
appreciated, as always.

Best regards,
Sarabeth Smith
