Hi-- one of the Ph.D.-econ students over here, Sevil Yaman, has been
talking with you.  She's interested in a summer internship that will help
her "ground" her dissertation.  With our help, Sevil has become totally
corrupted (!).  I have successfully impacted her view of the world re.
academic economics v. industry.  She would like her diss to be as relevant
as possible, and with that in mind already moved from a pure electricity
transmission pricing topic to focusing more on congestion management and
trying to address practical market problems.  She has in mind to work in
industry when her degree is finished.  I recommend her to you highly.  She
is extremely bright and competent, needs some guidance and input to get
going in the right direction to finish up.  Talk soon--

Michelle
