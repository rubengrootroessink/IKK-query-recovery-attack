My apologies.

Mr. Kaminski,

In Sheila Walton's absence (she is on vacation this week), please go ahead 
and have Shirley Crenshaw forward the job description that you would like 
posted to Norma Villarreal for handling.  

If you or Shirley require any additional assistance before forwarding your 
material to Norma, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you.

Sheila,

No, we have to go through the posting phase first.
I shall ask Shirley to provide the job description.


Vince

Vince, Alice has strong qualities for a Sr Admin Asst.  Vince, have we posted 
this position on the job posting board?  If so, great.  If not, we need to 
post this opening to prove that we have given an opportunity to all existing 
Enron employees before we go outside to external candidates.  Otherwise, 
existing employees have a valid complaint that we are limiting their 
advancement within Enron but hiring externally.   If we have not posted this, 
I will have the recruiter contact Shirley so Shirley can give us a job 
description.  Then we can post and interview Anita simultaneously.  Please 
let me know ASAP if this has been posted.  Thanks.

Sheila Walton
