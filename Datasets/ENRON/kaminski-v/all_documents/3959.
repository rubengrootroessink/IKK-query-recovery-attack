Thanks.  I'll let Walter know if he calls.  I just wanted to make sure things 
were done correctly.

Martin,

It's OK for Walter to use remaining hours. No real cost to Enron,
just the benefits.

Vince

Subject: power flow software question

Walter Coffer contacted me regarding whether we still have power flow 
software available.  We do have almost all of a 200 execution-hour license 
for PSS/E, which was purchased for the transmission congestion project last 
summer.  This was purchased by East Power Trading.  Should Walter want to use 
the remaining hours, who has authority to grant this?

Thanks,
Martin
