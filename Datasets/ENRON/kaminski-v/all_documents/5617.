Ben and I have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated 
support from Houston on our project.  We are wondering what the possibility 
is of having either Amitava or Vasant come over for 8 - 12 weeks to help get 
things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as 
provide some guidance on the CLO part of the business and potentially hiring 
an additional  full time resource.  If there is any possibility, it would be 
hugely valuable given the long lead times to get someone from the City in and 
integrated in addition to the significant cost.

Let me know your thoughts
