Dear Vince
The brochure has now been printed and we are in the process of marketing
this event. Please can you confirm the correct person and/or dept. (eg.
marketing or PR) that I would need to speak to as I would like to discuss
the following marketing ideas which could be of interest to your company:

- I would like to send a quantity of brochures out to your clients/
contacts. We would of course cover any postage costs this incurs. We could
also include a personalised letter from you (written by us or you) and
offering a discount.
- If you have a newsletter that you send to your clients, we may be able 
to
include a copy of the brochure or a notice, highlighting your company's/
speaker's involvement.
- Alternatively, we could place our EPRM logo and details of the 
conference
on your website

I hope one or more of these ideas are of interest to you.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kind Regards
Angela Adedeji
