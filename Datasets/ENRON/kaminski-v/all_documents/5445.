Subject: Backwardation hedge strategy

Vince,

I am sending via internal mail samples of a hedge strategy that may offer 
opportunity to store commodities in a backwardated market.  I would like your 
opinion as to if this strategy works, and if it is practical (ie cost of 
hedges and complexity of execution/ monitoring is reasonable).  If you think 
there is value, or have other ideas along the same lines....we are very much 
need of such a risk and inventory management tool for several deals we are 
originating.

We seek a cost effective method to manage backwardation while storing large 
quantities of petroleum products for 3-5 year deals.  The inventory stored in 
tank will turn over, but continuous, large,  minimum operating balances are 
required (1 million barrels of gasoline and 2 million barrels of crude oil).

Thanks for your assistance,

If there is any question, please do not hesitate to call.  I will be on 
vacation from June 29th pm - July 11th. In my absence, please contact Tim 
Battaglia.

Wendy King
