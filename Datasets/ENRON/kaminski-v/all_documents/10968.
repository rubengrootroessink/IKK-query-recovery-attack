Clayton,

My understanding of the difference between ExIm Bank and OPIC: ExIm 
guarantees bank nad commercial transactions.
OPIC provides insurance for physical assets located in foreign countries, 
owned by  US investors. OPIC offers protection
against political risk. ExIm guarantee, I think, covers commercial risk. Brad 
Blesie would know 
what exactly the difference is.

Vince

Vasant-

Here is a CNN story on the Russian story I was alluding to. (Note the use of 
Ex-Im loan guarantees as project insurance.)
