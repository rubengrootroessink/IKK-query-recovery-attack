Shirley -

I spoke with Janelle Duree  (Manager - Move Team), she is investigating the 
mystery of the missing phone and will call me back with status - If you can 
take care of the PC, I think we look good on the phone. I also spoke with 
Paul Racicot to make sure we are all of the same mind and he is set as well.

Hi Emmanuel:

We need a computer installed on the 44th floor tomorrow, if at all possible.

We have a new summer intern coming on Monday the 19th and the
computer and everything else has disappeared from his desk.

The location is EB4444B.

The computer we are moving is Clayton Vernon's old computer.  He is
finishing up moving his files to his new computer as I am writing this.

Please call me in the morning and we will talk further.

Thanks!
