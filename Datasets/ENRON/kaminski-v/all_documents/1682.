Dear Vince

As Chair, you will introduce and sum-up?the  stream.?You will also introduc=

to?their attention prior to the last?5 minutes  allocated to them.?It is al=
so=20
the role of the Chair to?ask the  delegates for questions, asking each=20
questioner?for their name and the  organisation they represent. Should=20
delegates be a little slow on?the Q and  A take-up, often the Chair will ha=
ve=20
some thought-provoking questions to put  forward. I shall ensure that there=

are GARP people in the room with microphones  to hand to delegates with a=
