Subject: Living Arrangements  

Will the temporary living expenses be billed to Enron?  Lloyd Whiteurst 
(3-6695) in Relocation has been my contact for temporary living 
arrangements.  As for arranging for cars, Lloyd has informed that Travel 
Agency in the Park can arrange for rental cars, Shirley can contact them 
directly.  She can also arrange to have Enron direct billed for the cars if 
that's what you want to have happen.  

Please have Shirley contact me if I am not clear on the housing needs for the 
London group and the employee from India.

Also - we're making arrangements for Norberto's interview and I've been in 
touch with Liza Woods-Ford.

- Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

Yes, she referred Norberto to us. We had an informal interview
with him.

We would like to  invite him for a round of formal interviews later this week.
Please include me, Tanya Tamarchenko, Ted Murphy, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni,
Grant Masson.

I asked Liza to talk to you to set up formal arrangements with Enron
HR (a contract, fee schedule approval, etc.).

I shall ask you for help next week when we have more information:
several members of our group  from London will rotate through our Houston
office this summer. We shall need help in making living  arrangements,
including apartments, car, etc. Also, we have an employee from India
rotating through our group this summer. Please, let me know 
who is the best person in HR to ask for assistance.


Vince
