RiskBrief issue 4
From FinanceWise: the only dedicated financial search engine
============================================================
22 March 2000

Dear RiskBrief subscribers

The fourth edition is here, and this month's theme is weather.
Weather derivatives is increasingly a hot topic on the web at the
moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
including tradeweather.com, weather-risk.com and WeatherRiskAdvisory.com.
Along with the weather trading site from Liffe (I-WeX.com),
launched in January, and the introduction last September of
weather futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), there is
something of a rush on.

To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
an introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
exclusive book offer.

http://www.tradeweather.com (see site reviews)
http://www.weather-risk.com (see site reviews)
http://www.WeatherRiskAdvisory.com
http://www.i-wex.com
http://www.cme.com/news/weather921.html

How fast will the weather derivatives market grow? Will there be
enough liquidity? Let us know what you think.

In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of this month's issue,
with 14 articles on currency trading, e-trading, and news of conferences,
jobs and more.

Regards

Rob Minto
Producer, FinanceWise
