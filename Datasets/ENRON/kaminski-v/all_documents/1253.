Vince,

I left you a voice message that explains a little about the history of this 
inquiry (you may want to refer to that first).

Please let me know what you know about this and your opinion.

Thank you,

Anthony

Anthony,
Please contact Vince Kaminsky at ext. 3-3848.  I think his group has this 
type of training set up.  Ask him is you can be added to their classes.  Let 
me know if this works for you.

Gracie

Hi, Gracie.

I'm just following up on my inquiry from last week.  Have you begun any 
discussions on Statistics classes?

Anthony

Subject: Question about ERNIE

Gracie,

Does Enron have any statistics classes?  Ones more focused on basic 
statistics and the lingo (ex: alpha, beta, delta-gamma, Type I & II error, 
distributions, kurtosis, etc.) than the VaR class?

I have not seen any in the class schedule.  In working with traders and 
studying Risk Mangement concepts, even our "experts" that know almost 
everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem 
to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics!!!  This lack of 
knowledge basically makes my job as a Fundamentals Analyst (researching the 
underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing EGM/EA/EIM 
profits) very inefficient.

If they already do not exist, I recommend that ERNIE institute two types of 
statistics classes (which mirror the existing Finance class selection).  
"Introduction to Statistics" (perhaps a database approach - including 
application to Excel?) and "Applied Statistics" (which would be a more 
advanced approach that specifies how Enron uses - or should use - statistics 
in risk management marketing).

Please let me know what you think.

Cordially,

Anthony Sexton
