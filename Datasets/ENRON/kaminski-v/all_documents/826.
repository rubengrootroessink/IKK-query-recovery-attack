Hi Lola,

     As per our recent conversation, today we had a conference call with the 
Enron Research and Credit groups in the US and the UK.

     It was decided that we would require the folowing software to assist us 
in developing the Private Firm models:

  1.  Eviews statistical package
  2.  SPSS statistical package (The UK office already has an SPSS site 
license.)
  3.  TOPS software
  4.  Neural net software package (George in the UK developed this package).

     Please discuss submit these requests to Craig Chaney for his approval.

Thanks,
Iris
