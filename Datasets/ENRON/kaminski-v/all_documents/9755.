Dear Vince,
?
I hope you are well. I am leaving Risk at the  end of next week and before I 
leave I am producing the mathematics for energy  derivatives training course. 
I have written a programme and attached it to this  email and I wondered 
whether you could have a look at it and let me know what  you think. I also 
wondered whether you would be interested in speaking at the  course.
?
I will give you a call on Monday to  it.
?
Best regards,
?
Vicky
