Presumably if the Eastern Credit Reserve issues take lots of his time away 
from EnronCredit, we could extend his stay for another week? Especially as 
it's unlikely we could get Vasant over in the foreseeable future.

Subject: Amitava is Diverted

Bryan,

Just FYI - Amitava will be diverted for an unspecified portion of his stay 
here next week.

The did the initial coding for software / pricing systems used to value the 
Eastern deal.  There are over-riding concerns there I  or Steve L. can fill 
you in on if you like.  Problem could be Monday morning or all week.

We could press for Vasant to re-prioritize his time. 

Any thoughts?  I haven't checked with Ben about impacts yet...

Ben?



Mike
