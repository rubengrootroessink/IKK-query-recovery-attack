Good morning Amy:

Vince Kaminski will need the following:

An LCD Projector to hook up to a lap tap for his presentation
He will have dinner with the conference organizers and speakers on the 29th.
He will need 2 nights (the 28th and the 29th) hotel reservations.

He will send you an abstract shortly.

Thanks and have a great day!

Ms. Crenshaw,

Thank you for sending the bio so quickly.  It's exactly what I was looking
for.

We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution
to the participants.  While I will not need Dr. Kaminski's contribution for
several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be
very useful to the conference organizers.

I will also need the following information:

- Dr. Kaminski's audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation
- will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on
May 29?
- which nights will he be staying in Toronto?  I will reserve a room at the
conference hotel
- any dietary restrictions or special requests

Your help is much appreciated.

Best wishes,

Amy
