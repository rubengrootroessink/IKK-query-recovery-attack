Hi Christine!

Thanks for being so prompt!  

I have scheduled the telephone interview for 2:00 PM on Thursday, 
November 30th.  They will call you at (504) 861-9110.  If this is not
the telephone number that you wish to be contacted at, please let me 
know the number that you do want them to call you on.

The Research Group does sponsor green cards and visas.  Below is
a short synopsis of what the Research group does.  However, they will
be glad to answer any questions you have during the interview. 

"The Enron Research Group is responsible for option modeling, building
systems for risk quantification and management, development of
optimization systems, help with statistical analysis and anything that 
requires
advanced math".  The Research Group supports all units of Enron.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me, or feel
free to ask during the interview.

Talk to you on Thursday!

Best regards,

Shirley Crenshaw
