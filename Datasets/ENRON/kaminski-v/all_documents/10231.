Dear Vince,
I am delighted to be working with you at last. I can confirm the lessons
learned session, and I shall leave it up to you to consider the content.
The session will last one hour, including Q&A. The VaR sessions I was
hoping you would address are actually part of the post conference seminar
and I realise that I did not send you the schedule for that. Please accept
my apologies. I have attached the seminar outline for you information.
Glenn Labhart of Dynegy will take the first and last sessions. Is there any
chance you could do the others? I realise that this is a lot but it would
be great if you could consider it. Please let me know when you can.
Thanks again for agreeing to come all that way. I am sure it will be a
worthwhile trip.
Best regards,
Joel.
