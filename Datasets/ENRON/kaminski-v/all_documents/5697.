Subject: Purpose of Thursday's Meeting

I want to give a high-level purpose of Thursday's meeting for those of you 
who were wondering "what is a 'valuation visioning' session".

Basically, Beth has a vision to create a common valuation framework for all 
products which flow through our systems.  The initial criteria for this 
framework are:

new projects would use this framwork as they were developed, and existing 
systems would move to the framework as needed
this framework needs to be capable of working with all systems (i.e., no 
technical or functional barriers)
we would need to be capable of kicking off a project and seeing tangible 
results within 6 months

As far as what this framework looks like (common components, common 
approaches, standards, all or none of the above) and how it is implemented, 
well that is what we are going to discuss on Thursday.  I will be sending out 
an agenda within the next couple of days to provide more details on the 
logistics of the meeting.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
Chris
