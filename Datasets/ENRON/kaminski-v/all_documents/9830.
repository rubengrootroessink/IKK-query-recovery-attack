Dear Mr. Kaminski,

To the suggestion of Ms. Sally Beck, in November of last year I contacted
you to express my interest in the Research Group of Enron. It was very
kind of you to invite me for a visit with your group at that time. I
enjoyed very much talking to you as well as Mr. Gibner, Mr. Lu and Ms.
Tamarchenko.

After those discussions I became even more excited about the possibility
of joining your group after I finish from Texas A&M. I am going to
graduate in the beginning of May and, as you told me, I'm writing to check
back with you about an entry-level position with your group.

I have recently received a job offer from Bell Atlantic. But I have not
replied to that offer yet.  The reason is that I would really like to work
for Enron since I believe it offers me better advancement opportunities in
a field that I like a great deal.

So, I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know about any
employment opportunities with the group that you are heading. I am
attaching my resume to this email for your review. Hoping to hear from you
soon.

Best regards
Parid Hoxha
