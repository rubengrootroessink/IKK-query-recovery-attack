J..do you want to do this??    I've kept us in the 'game', participated in 
earlier busiss plan reviews (that have ultimately resulted in this event for 
the final 'Great 8'), etc.  Vince and I plan to attend, but I think you, as a 
commercial business unit leader, would be the best person to  participate in 
the final round.

If all is well with the weather, flights, etc, it's possible to leave Monday 
morning and get there in just enough time.  However, I don't think there is a 
flight late enough to return the same evening.
Please let me know.

Thanks!

--Christie.

Ms. Patrick:

We are writing to invite you to serve as a judge and/or find the appropriate 
person in your organization to participate in the final round of this year's 
Wharton Business Plan Competition at the Wharton Venture Fair on April 30th 
from 12:00 - 6:30 p.m.

The Wharton Business Plan Competition consists of three phases that spanned 
several months and judging rounds to select the top eight business plans of 
the lot, dubbed the "Great Eight". The Venture Fair is the final event, where 
the finalist teams will be presenting to a select panel of judges and the 
Wharton community.

Participation in Phase I of this year's competition was double that of last 
year as 226 student teams from across the University of Pennsylvania 
submitted business concepts for judging. Seventy teams participated in Phase 
II in which teams turned in 5,000-word analyses of their "product, market and 
competitors."  From the pool of Phase II participants, 25 teams were chosen 
to submit full business plans for Phase III. Finally, the field was narrowed 
to the 8 finalist teams to vie for the top prize at the Venture Fair.

We would love for you to be an integral part of our culminating event. If you 
agree to be a judge, you will be presented with judging guidelines in advance 
of and at the Venture Fair.

Please reply by April 20, 2001 if you wish to be a judge. We look forward to 
having you on board and thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Michelle C. Toledo
