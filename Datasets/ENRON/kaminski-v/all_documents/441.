Hi Ben,


 I think I have read all the papers that are to be used in the comparative 
model study to be sent to Professor Duffie at Stanford.  

 These documents are all listed below.   Please let me know if I have omitted 
any (However, don't get the impression that I am begging for more papers to 
read).

 Now I will try to transform my notes into a draft for Professor Duffie.

Thanks,
Iris
