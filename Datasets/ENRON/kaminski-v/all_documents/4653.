Andrzej,

Thanks. Please, send me the information about the dates
when you plan to visit Houston. Also, the information about
your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
about the other members of your team) would be useful.

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Wicek
