Hi Trushar

Please find attached our draft analysis.  It is still very preliminary as we
have not been provided the latest version of legal documents and so the 
analysis
reflects our understanding of the economics of the transaction as outlined to 
us
based on discussions with Enron and available prior draft documentation..

The analysis uses the Enron share price as of March 28, 2000 ($72.81) and
assumes the LJM2 distribution is based on $30m or 25% IRR.  We anticipated 
that
this might reach 30% IRR based on Enron discussions with LJM2.

Please call Steve Stampf's phone number for tomorrow's conference call at 
9.30am
our time on 212 597 3162.

Regards
