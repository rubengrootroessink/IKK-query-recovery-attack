Dear Mr.Kaminski, Mr. Krishnarao and Mr. Sezgen,

I was very pleased to have an wonderful telephone interview with you.
It's exciting and challenging. I like it.
I talked to my financial engineering program classmate, Bob Lee who
was just hired by Enron recently. He told me he is very impressed by
your company and very excited to work there.
I believe I'm a strong candidate for this position. I'd like to share
more my background and experience with you.
I look forward to meeting you. Thank you.

P.S. Thank Shirley for her coordinate work. When I come to Houston,
I may need her help again.

Sincerely,

Jeff He
