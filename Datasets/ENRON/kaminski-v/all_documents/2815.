Dear Vince and Mike,

To maximize my time in Houston an agenda needs to be agreed upon as well as 
milestones. 

Here is a summary of what I have in mind:

*Mesoscale Weather Analysis and Forecasting
*computer models vs. human forecasters, performance issues
*NWP modeling
 -types of numerical weather predictio models (NWP models)
 -objective analysis and initialization
 -data iisues and feeds 
 -(physical) processes that determine the quality of a forecast
*predictibility and verification

*visualisation of weather and climate forecasts



*installation of 
 -short-to-medium term forecast system
 -seasonal forecast system
 -system testing and verification

*issues 
 -data feeds
 -platform considerations
 -realtime performance


What we need to agree on is a firm agenda, milestones, resources, etc. ...and 
a time table....
