Shirley,

Thank you for your e-mail, I hope all has turned out well with Vince and his
family.

This is my first day back in the office, so the reason for contacting you is 
to
acknowledge receipt of your note and to inquire as to when Vince will next be 
in
the UK.

Please contact me at you convenience,

ALLAN

Allen:

I apologize!  I tried to call on the numbers below, but they would not go
through.  I sent you an email explaining why Vince was not there,
unfortunately
it did not get to you in time!

Vince's wife and son were driving to California for his junior year at
Stanford.
They stopped in Phoenix and his wife got sick.  Vince is afraid he will
have to
fly out there and drive them on to Calif.

Please accept our deepest apologies and we will reschedule for October,
if it is ok.

Regards,

Shirley Crenshaw

Dear Shirley,

My colleagues and I were expecting to lunch with Vince today.
Unfortunately,
Vince did not show.

The reason for contacting you is to inform you of the situation and to
enquire
as to whether everything is OK.

His plane arrived on time, but we have not heard from him today.

If you need to contact me urgently, please call me on +44 370 584 695, or
my EA
Angela on +44 7304 8102.

Regards, ALLAN
