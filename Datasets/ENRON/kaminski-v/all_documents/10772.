Hi Lyn:

I have not received an answer for the below request for another Sun
computer.  Did you get it?

We also need to order another regular computer like the others that have
been supplied to the Research Group.  It will be for Tanya Tamarchenko
and her location on the 19th floor is EB 1940.  Tanya has two offices and
does not have a computer in her office on the 19th floor.

Co# 0011 - RC# 100038

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Best,
Alex
