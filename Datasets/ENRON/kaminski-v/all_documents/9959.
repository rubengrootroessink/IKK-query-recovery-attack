Hello everyone,

I have modified the storage valuation model to adopt the deal of synthetic 
storage.
For the 11 month synthetic storage deal proposed by the
Peoples Energy , the model gives $0.51/mmBtu.    Thus the People's bid for  
$0.49/mmBtu is in line with the model.

I would be happy to discuss the details for everyone who is interested.   In 
essence, the model allows optimal  injections
during March-May and optimal withdraws dring Dec-Jan.  The model also 
encourages the storage to be full at the 
end of May, and empty at the end of Jan.
