Vince-

I recently spoke with Chris Helfrich and Rodney Malcolm.  They suggested that 
I contact you.

Todd Perry is a PH.D. student at University of Oregon.  Todd was very helpful 
to me when I was an undergrad, and has asked for any help I can lend him 
regarding employment with Enron.  He has extensive Oil & Gas experience, was 
a Financial Analyst for McKinsey & Co. and was an equity trader for CALPERS.  
Chris Helfrich indicated that he could be a very good fit for your group.

My personal experience with Todd was limited to my undergrad days at 
University of Oregon.  He was the most prominent graduate student in the 
program and was very well liked and respected by both students and faculty.

I believe Todd would be an excellent addition to any group at Enron.  I am 
attaching his resume for your review.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Dave Hunker
