Dr. Kaminski,
I think I'll be able to start work from the last week of May,
but not from monday,
probably, I'll be able to work from 5/30 (wed).
Will it be good? I know it is not that much earlier than I mentioned..6/4
I am sorry.

And actually, there is an e-business conference at Haas school of business,
organized by my advisor
Could you distribute the link and the attached invitation letter to groups
interested in e-business and especially procurement?
The link is as following.
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm/conferences/010522/

I am afraid you might forgot this I told you in the last email...
My advisor (Arie Segev at Haas school of business; segev@haas.berkeley.edu)
wants me to ask whether you have any idea on joint research with him
during the summer, while I am staying there.
His interest is in e-business.. (what else..?)
and has expertise in e-procurement system and marketplace...
XML based standard such as OBI,cXML, xCBL, RosettaNet, BizTalk ..
system interoperability study, auction and negotiation, workflow system,
e-catalog management, digital signature, EDI, etc etc...
many technical aspects of e-business...
He wants to do some kind of technical case study
that is beneficial for both ENRON and him.
He may travel one or two times to Houston to have a meeting during the
summer.
(And to be frankly, this will be good for me too,
because I can have a meeting for my dissertation while he is in Houston..)
Could you think about the possibility of joint research, with him?

Thank you..

Sincerely,
Jinbaek
