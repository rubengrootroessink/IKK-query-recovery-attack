Tom,

I got sick and had to reschedule the meeting with Nick Bambos.
I shall meet him on Saturday this week. I shall talk to him about the 
following:

1. Financing research projects by graduate students ($100K per year, spread 
over several projects)
2. Inviting Nick to visit Enron
3. I can mention the possibility of Nick consulting for us. Given his status, 
involvement in the Internet2 project,
and views that closely parallel Enron's vision, it makes sense to have him 
working for us. He could
be a very effective voice supporting our initiatives.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince
