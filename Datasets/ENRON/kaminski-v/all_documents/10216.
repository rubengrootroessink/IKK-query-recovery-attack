Hi All,

After all the hard work, we are at time of harvesting!  But as we all know 
that there still a few more hurdles ahead of us in order to release credit

promised us a big feast after we push the product out of door.  So let commit 
our self to do one last dash to the finish line!

Let hit the items on the list and get it over with
