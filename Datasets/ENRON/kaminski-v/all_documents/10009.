Subject: Move Research Employee from one location to another on the 19th floor

Hello all:

Attached is a churn request to move Clayton Vernon from EB1943 to EB1952.

He will need 3 boxes and labels delivered to his EB1943 location, a few 
days before you schedule his move.

If you need any other information, please let me know.

Thanks and have a great weekend!
