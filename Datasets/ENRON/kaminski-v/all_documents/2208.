Hi, Vince,

FYI, we had a couple of new Total Return Swap deals on board. And the 
following is the updated list:

1. Bammel Looper
2.Mid Texas
3.American Coal
4.Motown
5.Corn Husker
6.Catalytica (New)
7.EEX
8.Hawaii 125 Series McGarret C, D, G, F(Riva)(New) H(Braveheart) (New) and 
Danno B(Alchemy)
9. Cerberus (New)
10. Avici (New)
11. Bacchus (New)
12. Riverside 3 and 6
13. Riverside 9/EEP5 & ECTRL
14.ETOL(New)
15..Margaux

To Hawaii 125 Series, most of them is to monetize New Power Company warrants 
which are convertible to New Power Company stocks. And there is one to 
monetize the future cash flow expected from Blockbuster to EBS. 

There is a significant difference in recent FAS 125 deals from previous ones, 
the underlying assets are more liquid assets such as warrants and stocks 
rather than power plants and pipelines, therefore, it is relatively easier to 
simulate the asset valuation.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
