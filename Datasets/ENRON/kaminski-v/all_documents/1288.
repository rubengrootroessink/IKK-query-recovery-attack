Robert Johnston has asked me to charge Vince's department for 1/3 of the cost 
of the annual subscription to IIF.  The annual cost is $47K.  Therefore the 
cost for 1/3 is $15,666.67.  This information is for Maureen Raymond's use.

I will be happy to process the invoice for payment but in order for me to do 
so, I will need the proper coding for Vince's department.

Please let me know if you are agreeable to this.  If you have questions, you 
may wish to contact Robert Johnston directly at 3-9934.

Thanks,
Sharon
