Tara:

Thanks for the update. It seems Anjam is playing hard ball a little. My 
initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer, but on 
second thoughts, could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a 
12-month assignment when you have a moment?  Compensation, benefits, 
responsibilities, career path implications, etc.

Many thanks!

Regards,
Grant.
