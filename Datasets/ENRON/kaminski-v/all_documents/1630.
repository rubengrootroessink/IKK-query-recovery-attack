Vince,

I have made bold face edits to the attached document.  I still have two edits 
to make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version.  
Sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn't use the edit function in word 
so I have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper.  

I still haven't made the change regarding the take-or-pay problem (I left 
that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow 
morning).  Also, I haven't added anything regarding the conflict that arose 
over pay for new hires nor have I received the Business Week e-mail from you.

However, if the paper looks ok to Mark Palmer we can make these minor edits 
on the galley pages of the article.  

thanks

john

p.s. i am very disappointed about the scheduling conflict you have on Feb 
23rd.  you will be greatly missed but i certainly understand.
