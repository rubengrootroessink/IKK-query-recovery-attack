Recently a new person moved into our
space on 32nd floor.


Being that the gentleman is there , I decided
to move our computer out of his working space.

The computer will be moved  to desk in our area
until the new hire arrives.

                                        FYI
                                     Thanks
                                 Kevin Moore
