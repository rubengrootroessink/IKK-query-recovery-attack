Vince,

I shipped you the paper along with my note to Don.  However, I wanted to
share with you what I feel are the remaining "to dos".  Specifically,

1.  We need to document carefully the forces that were behind the original
transformation of Enron.  Specifically, the fallout from deregulation (take
or pay contract defaults, etc.), the impact of the losses from the oil
trading operation, the nationalization of the Peruvian pipeline, and the
leveraging up to fend off the Carl Ichan takeover attempt.

2.  We need to complete/beef up the network strategy section.

3.  Finally, the concluding section needs to be carefully crafted to
"hammer home" the basic principles underlying the transformation.

What do you think?

Hope you have a great weekend.

John
