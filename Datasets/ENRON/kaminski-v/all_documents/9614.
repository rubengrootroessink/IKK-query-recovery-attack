Hello all:

Unfortunately, in the last two weeks we have had two of our Research "chairs"
disappear from their location.  We have reported this to Security, but in all
likelihood they will be almost impossible to locate. 

Facilities has told us that they are not responsible for missing chairs and we
will have to order new ones.   Since they are very expensive,  we have 
decided to "mark" our chairs underneath the seat with a location or name.  
Sam is going to order some "silver or white" markers and we will begin 
marking 
each chair.

It is a shame we have to do this, but know of no other alternative.  We will 
let you 
know when this will take place.

Thanks!

Shirley
