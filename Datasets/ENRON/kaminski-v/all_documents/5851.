Vince,

I thought you might be interested in this too...
We have had several meetings with UH up until now and things are progressing 
nicely.
Rice U will follow in mid January and after that, Uof Co at Boulder and 
Chicago will follow too.

Per Mark Tawney's request, I am going to include you in another message 
following this.  Don Kouri from UH will be visiting soon.  The purpose of 
that discussion will be his area of research - more details in the next 
message on that - and a seminar we'd like to set up and include your folks 
too...

Yannis

Folks,

in view of our upcoming collaboration with educational & research 
institutions, I am putting together a compendium of problem statements within 
various research domains.  This list will be used to solicit the interest of 
researchers and graduate students who would then work under our supervision.  

While the details of how this effort will be organized are still largely up 
in the air (list of financial institutions, reporting structure, financial 
considerations, confidentiality agreements, exchange of seminars and short 
courses, etc) we are making an attempt to define our common interests.  Such 
areas are:
Econophysical (e.g. market development; how weather expectations shape the 
market; etc.)
Product development (e.g. agriculture and weather; solar radiation and 
telecommunications, the Jet stream and Airlines; etc.)
Analytical/Mathematical/Simulation efforts (building a MC simulation for any 
given problem might fall under here; working with incomplete data sheets/ways 
for filling in data holes; etc.)
Purely weather (e.g. a statistical analysis of the long term effects of solar 
phenomena on weather would enter this category)

In light of the above and within the next couple of days,I would like to ask 
you to provide me with problem statements within these areas that you have an 
interest in and which might offer themselves to this kind of collaboration.  
At this point, we're brainstorming; we would thus be happy to have even the 
sketchiest of ideas and have the weakest of expectations for well formulated 
projects.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Yannis T.
