Mark,

He is interested in regulatory economics. The  reason we referred him to you 
was that  we thought 
he might be able to help you.

Mark,

I understand that the student would like to write a dissertation on a topic 
selected by us
that we could use internally. He would like to get from us a grant (a few 
hundred pounds) and
access to publicly available information (to reduce the time he would spend 
doing research
on his own). No access to internal documents would be required.

Vince

My diary indicates that I am free after 1700, London time.  I have already 
forwarded one CV from an MBA student at Cranfield to Nigel Sellens, our HR 
head here in London.  I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the 
student, but also an Indian national, I believe.  That student was referred 
to me by one of our employees in India (again, name escapes me).  I am happy 
to speak with you, but as with the other MBA candidate, I think it is for HR 
in London to sort out with our commercial team if this is something they are 
willing to do, as it obviously results in some disclosure of info.  Also, is 
it seen by traders/HR as a possible recruiting tool (I also assume that is 
why youwant to get involved), either for Houston, London, or Mumbai offices?  
Again, though, that is something I am not in a position to decide/resolve.  
Feel free to call at 1700 if it is still useful for you.   thanks  mcs

Vince requested me to forward this info. to you. Vince and I would like to 
speak to you over the phone Monday morning (afternoon for you). This is 
regarding an MBA student at Cranfield school of Business in UK, Ajay, who 
wants to do a project with Enron on deregulation of power markets. If you can 
have these two files printed, it would help.

Thank you,
Krishna.
