Larry,

I had a brief discussion with our lawyers.  They are strongly advising us to 
keep the changes we earlier incorporated, but to which you have not 
assented.  As this is a matter of company policy, unfortunately we do not 
have much room to maneuver.  If it would help you to have a direct 
conversation with the lawyers to appreciate our company's perspective, I can 
arrange for a phone call.  Please advise.  Thanks.  

Rakesh

Hi Rakesh,

Thanks for your work on the non-disclosure agreement.

Your integration of our mutually agreed upon modifications looks good, 
Rakesh.  Thanks!  I'll await your next version.

Larry
