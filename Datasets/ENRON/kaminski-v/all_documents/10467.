Vince:

I have just finished talking with Rick.  He will have the HR person to 
workout the details and get me on board this week.   Thank you so much for 
your help.  I would like to let you know that your help meant a great deal 
for me,  I am not taking it lightly.   I will do my best to get the work down 
and live up to yours and Rick's expectations.

Thank you again.

Ding.
