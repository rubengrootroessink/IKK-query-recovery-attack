Vince I thought this resume might be of interest to you.  Alan Lambert is a 
personal friend of mine.  However, rather than put him onto you, I thought 
I'd send this by you first.  If you have interest please feel free to contact 
Alan directly.  If there are others you'd recommend me sending this by, 
please let me know.  If neither, please let me know so I can tell Alan its 
just not a fit.
