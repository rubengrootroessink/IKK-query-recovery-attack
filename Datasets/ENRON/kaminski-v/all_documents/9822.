Becky,

I shall call you in the morning to give you an update on this. Many changes in
my group swing the estimated percentages around.

Subject: Allocation percentage for Research

We met a month ago with Mark Confer and you have indicated that you were 
working on providing us with a better allocation percentage based on the 
support your group provided for ENA.  Can you tell me what is the status of 
this?  Will I be able to implement the new percentage this month?  Thanx.
