Hi Stinson, as per my discussion, here is e-mail to let Vince know about the 
subject.

We have requested the following office spaces for Network planning (Jim 
Irvine)--optimization work, etc. and other EBS support personnel.

For network planning and traffic Engineering: 

-  1 director level space ( to be used by Jim and other EBS research people 
as needed when Jim is not there) and  four other cube space (Chonowee, Martin 
Lin, and two students.

For other EBS activities:
- 3 or 4 summer interns and analysts level space for other EBS people (Roman 
and other students).

This is what Kristy is going to request and get it into the office space 
request loop. We should be able to get into most of the space that I have 
requested.

Ravi.
