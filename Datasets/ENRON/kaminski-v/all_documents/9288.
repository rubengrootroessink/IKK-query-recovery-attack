Dear Mr. Kaminski:

        I am currently wanting to make career change from retail
logistics to power operations/scheduling(entry-level). Would you or a
close contact know of an opportunity available that I might apply for? I
graduated with a Bachelor's in marketing in 1997 and have been a retail
manager/junior executive for the last three years. I feel I have reached
my full potential in the retail market in the logistics field and would
very much like to get an opportunity to "break" into the energy industry
and remain there for the rest of my career. Any information you could
give would be greatly appreciated. Enron Corporation  is a very
well-respected company who I would greatly like to put my education and
experience to work for. Since you are a very busy professional, I will
be very happy to send you my resume only at your request. Once again Mr.
Kaminski,  thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from
you.

Warmest Regards,
Eric Hilton
