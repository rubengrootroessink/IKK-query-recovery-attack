Hi Darlene:

Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to bring Todd Perry in
for an interview. 

They have already had a "telephone interview" and feel like he may be a
good fit somewhere in the Research Group.  A copy of his resume is attached.

He will be able to come on Friday, June 2.

Please contact him and arrange his travel.  When this is completed, call
me and we will set up the interview schedule.

The Interviewers would be:

Vince Kaminski
Stinson Gibner
Krishna Krishnarao
Grant Masson
Zimin Lu
Vasant Shanbhogue

If you have any questions, please call me.

Thanks!

Shirley
