Yes you did and my assistant Felicia Solis is working on the schedule.  She

Elizabeth,

We want to bring this guy for a formal interview on Jan 24. Did I send you 
his resume?

Hi, Vince

I haven't yet heard from HR.  Is there someone I should contact so I can
finalize my travel arrangements?

I'm looking forward to the visit.

Thanks, Bob Lee
