Vince,
?
Hi, sorry to bother you, but was wondering if you've heard anything about  
seeking approval to use the text in the letter I sent last week?? We would  
like to send this out early next week so if you know of someone who I should  
contact within corporate communications, please let me know.
?
Thanks, and hope all is well.

Julie
