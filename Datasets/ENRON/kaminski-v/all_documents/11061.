Dear Vince,

Thank you for agreeing to take part in our annual US congress.
There were 2 things that I would ideally like you to be involved in.  The 
first would be to present any new research you may have.  This would be part 
of stream 3 (see attached) which looks at new research in derivatives 
modelling and analysis.  If you would like to present any new research that 
fits into the rough areas outlined that would be great.
The second would be part of a panel discussion on weather derivatives (number 
44 attached).  I have also invited Jeff Porter (Koch) and Ravi Nathan 
(Aquila).
Please let me know if you would like to present any new research and/or take 
part in the panel.

i look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
Oliver
