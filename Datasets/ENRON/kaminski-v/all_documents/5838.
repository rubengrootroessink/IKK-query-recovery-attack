SENT FOR SEAN HOLMES:

Thanks for your participation so far on the Breakthrough project.  We value 
your time, and recognize the burden our schedule is creating for many of our 
"Cat" participants.  We would like to amend the participation expectation as 
follows to help make the most of your time as a key leader within EES:

We will limit our all group "checkpoint" sessions to two hour maximum 
briefings, with Thursday's 12/14 marathon session (1 - 7 pm) being CANCELLED, 
and REPLACED with the following:

Tuesday, 12/19
2 pm - 4 pm
Two AC 12 - The Forum

Please put this session on your calendar, or in the alternative, designate 
someone who can represent your business unit in your absence.

We will also request  business unit participation as appropriate to certain 
unrepresented functions in our design sessions.  This direct participation 
should help assure that the final process design incorporates all 
perspectives and knowledge.  We will also step up our informal dialogue with 
both market initiative and risk representatives to assure good communication, 
specifics to follow.

Thanks for your patience, and especially your support to date.
