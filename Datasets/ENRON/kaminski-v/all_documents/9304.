Subject: Option Sales Program- Valuation Model

Zimin, you and I are scheduled to meet in your office from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. 
on Tuesday, May 16.  As you can see from the above, I'm distributing this 
note to Krishna and Vince in hopes that they can also join us along with Kim 
Watson.  

To review, Zimin and I have been working on a valuation model for purposes of 
Transwestern (and later other GPG pipelines) selling options on pipeline 
capacity.   However, I am also aware that Vince and his group are working on 
the scientific/technical aspects of the Revenue Management initiative for 
Transwestern.

Kim Watson and I spoke this afternoon and we thought it might be valuable for 
the five of us (schedules permitting) to get together and see what are the 
possible areas of overlap between Revenue Management and the Option Sales 
Program.  In particular, I see the potential for a material benefit if we 
could use some of the data import capability of the Revenue Management system 
for use on the Option Sales Program.

Vince, Krishna, since I've already heard from Kim and Zimin and they're 
available, will you guys let me know if you can get together for a short 
meeting on Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 p.m.?  Thanks.

p.s.  Zimin, if we need more space [than your office] for all five of us, can 
you arrange a meeting room or at least a work table somewhere in your area?  
Thanks.
