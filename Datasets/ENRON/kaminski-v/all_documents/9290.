 Dear Energy in Europe Speaker
As the conference in Berlin draw closer, I would like to remind you that we 
urgently need to receive a copy of your presentation materials by Friday, 
26th May 2000.
If you could please send me a hard copy of your talk text or copies of any 
slides you plan to use,  as soon as possible I would be most grateful. I am 
sure you are aware of the importance of documentation, even if you plan to 
speak off the cuff please try and supply at least an outline of your proposed 
speech. If this material doesn't reach me by 26th May I am afraid they will 
not form part of the delegate packs. You can send a hard copy either by post 
or fax to the above address and details or you can e-mail it to me at the 
following address: ttulsi@icbi.co.uk.
If you have already sent copies of your presentation then please ignore this 
fax. Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me, and I 
look forward to seeing you in Berlin shortly.
Kind regards
Tanuja Tulsiani
