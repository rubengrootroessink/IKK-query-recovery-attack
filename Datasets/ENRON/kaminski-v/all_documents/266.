Hi,

 Here is the title and abstract for Professor Kulatilaka's talk on May 17th 
at our 11:30 am Research Group luncheon/seminar.

Iris
 


Title: "Using the Mobile Internet to Make New Markets"



Abstract: 

  Professor Kulatilaka will talk about some new ideas that  he is working on 
which involve
using the micro billing/payments capability of a packet-switched wireless
network to create new markets.  The potential markets range from spot
markets for local spectrum to congestion-based pricing for highways.
