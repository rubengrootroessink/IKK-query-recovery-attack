 <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.
