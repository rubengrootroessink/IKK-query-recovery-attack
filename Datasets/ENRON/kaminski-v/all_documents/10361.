Nick,

I shall be in Stanford for Parents' Weekend (my son is a junior at Stanford).
I plan to be on the campus Friday through Sunday this week. I shall be glad 
to meet you anytime during the weekend. What about  a lunch on Friday?
I would like to talk to you about Enron underwriting  research projects by 
the graduate students
at your department.

You can reach me at Stanford at my son's phone number: 650 497 6938.
Please, let me know if you are free for lunch and I shall make the  
reservation

Vince
