Colleen,

We are looking at some FAB 133 related issues and we need all the help we can 
get.
We can hire Ainsley as a temp (outside the A&A pool - they closed the list 
for the summer).
We shall contact her directly and ask if she is interested.

Vince

P.S. Shirley, please set up a phone interview for me and Datren.

Subject: Resume


If you are looking for any summer interns, please take a look at this 
student's resume.  She's a junior at UT in the Honors Business Program, 
extremely intelligent, with great potential.  My sister was one of her 
teachers at Humble High School and speaks very highly of her character, 
intelligence and drive.  She always tells me to remember her name because 
I'll hear it again some day.  If you know of anyone else who may be 
interested, let me know and I will forward her resume to them.
