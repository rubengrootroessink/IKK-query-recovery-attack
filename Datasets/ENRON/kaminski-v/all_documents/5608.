Hi Navroz

Having presented my real options work at a recent conference, I think I can 
see my way clear to producing a much reduced version (3 or 4 pages) of my 
"Diagrammatic Real Options" paper.  Would Risk still be interested in such a 
shortened article?

Cheers,
Steve

Steven,
After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work 
would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion) 
and outline what has happened to:
?
?pjorion@uci.edu
?
then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this 
decision.
?
Best Wishes,
?
Navroz Patel,
Technical Assistant, Risk Magazine.
