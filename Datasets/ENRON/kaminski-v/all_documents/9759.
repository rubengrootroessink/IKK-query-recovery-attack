Subject: Copy Room

To Whom It May Concern :

I would like to know who will be responsible for keeping up with
the copy room near my area.  EB32 Copy Room1
I am aware that this is something that must be decided by 
whoever is in charge however , I would like to participate in keeping this
room operational.
Please note that I use this room more often than anyone else
and I pay more attention to what is needed there on a daily basis.

I am not asking for full charge over the room but I would like to assist
whereby , it will always be operational .
             
                                                     Thanks
                                                   Kevin Moore
