Vince,

FEA has arrived at a very simple, direct, and inexpensive approach to
licensing our two VaR-related patents as a package.  I hope that you will
agree that our proposed license fee of $2,500 plus $1 per employee, with
licenses to go to all of your affiliates, would be an attractive offer.  I
would love to sign up Enron for this package as an early customer.  Do you
think you could forward the attached pdf license agreement to the
appropriate people at Enron, together with your recommendation? I am highly
motivated to get Enron as a licensee, and I strongly believe that it will be
a worthwhile effort for both parties.

Best regards,

Mark B. Garman
