Hi Vince- I just got off the phone with RW and Enron London.
Alec told me that Howard is idle and waiting for your command and the 
coordination of the directors.
Melanie is working with Vuthy RW directly on this for you and Rachel Quirk 
said she will contact you to set the time up..."Unofficially" they were 
trying to do something with Howard tomorrow as I was told- not sure.
I have a couple other candidates I would like to send you after I collect 
some sleep ( 3;30 AM now)- I'll send them to you after I wake.
One guy from Oxford, Worked Citibank Fixed Income risk the other over at Ford 
Motor Company who is looking to move to London (highly recommended by the 
professor).
I'll send them later as to let you be the judge.
Talk soon- thanks for the business!
Jeff
