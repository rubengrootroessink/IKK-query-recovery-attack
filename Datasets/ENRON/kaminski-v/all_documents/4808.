Al,

Wednesday next week is fine with me. I would prefer to meet earlier
rather than later. What about 6:45 or 7:00?

Vince

Vince:  Pursuant to Bjorn's suggestion and my voice mail message,
attached you will find the background information on Jim Woods.  Jim is
not a pure quant  and enjoys much more the areas of strategic thinking
and related processes.  From what I can tell, he enjoys the process of
creating an arguement for a client's position in some disputed matter.
He is looking forward to having an opportunity of meeting you.  His
availability next week is only on Wednesday.  An early breakfast at the
Hyatt would work great for him.  Please let me know if that might work.
If not, when?  Al Arfsten
