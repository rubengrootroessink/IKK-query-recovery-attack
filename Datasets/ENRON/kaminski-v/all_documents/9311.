Margaret,

No, I don't have this information. Maybe somebody at  Calgary office
or CERA will have this info?

I cc this message to Chris Calger in Calgary. Maybe he can point out to the 
right source.

Do  you have  a source of  what Canadian industrials  and residentials  paid
for their natural  gas   in   1999  vs  what they paid in   1985  (  eek)     
in nominal terms..???
We have the  demand  side  but  OECD  data  I have   only  goes to 1990  and  
1998...  Help   I owe you BIG TIME
Margaret
