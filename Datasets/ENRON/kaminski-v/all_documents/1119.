Vince,

Paulo and I talked to Mr. Zhang on the phone.  He is currently with
Kock equity trading and formly a quant supporting power trading.
His power market experience could be valuable to us.

I would recommend to bring him for an on-site interview.  

Since we get more demanding power projects,  Alex needs some help.
