Cecil,
I've spoken with Charlene just now and she sounds very helpful. 
Can you give her a call tomorrow morning to iron out exactly how
you want to access the Enpower Data base? I've left your name
with her so she's expecting your call. 

Best,
Alex

Michelle,

The name of the DB Administrator for Enpower is Charlene Fricker,
5-3487. Alex will contact her regarding the access to the curve.

I think it's a problem many layers below Gary Hickerson's level
of responsibility and I hope we can handle it without using his valuable
time.

Vince
