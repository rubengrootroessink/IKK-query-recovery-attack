Larry, Ken Parkhill passed your contact info along to our project team. We 
plan to call you at 3:15pm EST today (Monday) i.e. 2:15pm Houston time. 
Attached is a presentation describing the scope of our project. We are 
interested in discussing your experiences with competitor trading exchanges 
like ICE, DynegyDirect, HoustonStreet.com, etc. relative to EnronOnline. Look 
forward to talking with you today.

Thanks,
Vincent

Hello Team 1,

I spoke with Larry Gagliardi on the Crude/Refinery Products desk this
morning and he agreed to talk with you after 12:30 today or after 2:30 any
other weekday.  He is very familiar with the other platforms and should be
a great resource.  Larry suggested that you surf EOL to find names of power
and/or natural gas traders, and call them up.  Please let me know if you
have difficulty finding/contacting folks this way and I will see if I can
help.

Larry's office number is 713-853-0543, and his email is
Larry.Gagliardi@enron.com.

good luck
ken
