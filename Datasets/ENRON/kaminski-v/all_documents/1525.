Vince: 
 Looks like an excellent value overall if they cover the same topics in these 
classes as in the Enron internal classes. The website says that registering 
for one of the classes automatically registers you to the expo. I would like 
to recommend them to my team. Did someone from our group already register for 
this? 

Thanks
Krishna.
