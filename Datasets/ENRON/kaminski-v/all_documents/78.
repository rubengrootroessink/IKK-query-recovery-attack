Vince,
I enjoyed your presentation at the SIAM workshop last Friday. I have
a much greater appreciation for the difficult problems you all solve.
If at all possible, I would like to get a copy of your talk and
any references to review papers in the general area of market modeling
and potentially control. Have a great weekend.

Best Regards,

Dean Kassmann
