Bhavna:

The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called 
Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database.
It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little 
hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the 
numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.  

It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep 
this mail message as a reference.
1)  Add 12 to the expression in "PrintMacro"!B35 i.e. change 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))

2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be 
printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report 
went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name "Jan93" defined 
as "Basis"!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are 
recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  "Jan94" to refer to 
"Basis"!A76.  That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to 
Dec 2000.

3)  Change the expression in "PrintMacro"!B45 to use this new cell reference 
i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))

4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers 
shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the 
"PrintFormat" page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999, 
1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Don't move any numbers or formulas!


That's it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it 
is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to 
find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.


Regards, and Happy New Year!
Grant.
