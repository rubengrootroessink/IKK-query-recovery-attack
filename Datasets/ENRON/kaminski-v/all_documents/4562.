Subject: Risk Management IT Offsite Meeting Notes

The EES/IBM IT team would again like to thank all of you for your vigorous 
participation in last weeks IT needs analysis workshop.   In particular, we 
would like to extend appreciation to Jay, Dave Roberts, and Dennis for their 
business presentations.  Thanks, as well, to Meghan Corley, Barry 
Vanderhorst, Burt Bailey, and Glenn Dickson for presenting their individual 
area needs, to Meredith for overall assistance in creating and delivering the 
agenda, and to Marty for his sponsorship and support.

The team is currently assimilating the results and formulating an action plan 
to address Priority 1, 2, and 3 needs.   Actions to address many Priority 1 
items are underway.  We will be reporting on this in Marty's weekly staff 
meeting.

Attached below are the results from the meeting, as well as copies of all 
materials that were presented.  Any additional feedback is welcome and 
encouraged.  

Apologies to any participants that do not appear on this distribution.  One 
thing we failed to do was to take an attendees list.  Please forward to your 
team mates, accordingly.

Thank you,
Maureen Craig and John Krakoski
