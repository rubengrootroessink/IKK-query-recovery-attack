This information was also sent  to IT Purchasing.
I need to know what options we have and how soon it
can be delivered.
Don't we need to know as well? Before purchase.
I  also need a central location for this printer.

                                               Thanks
                                             Kevin Moore

Kevin:

What kind of information do you need?  I thought you were going to look
at some colored printer literature.   Sam seemed to be aware of a
colored printer that might work for us.  Ask him.  I don't think we need
anything as big as "Sapphire".

 It will be located in your area on the 19th floor.

Thanks!
