Vince,

We would like to continue to receive the IIF service for a cost to the 
Research Group of $15,000 per annum.  Can I ask you to approve this charge?  
Please let me know if you'd like to discuss.  We decided to cancel the Oxford 
Analytica service (daily country briefs and access to the website) as we are 
getting consensus forecasts for FX and inflation from another source, so we 
will not be subject to the $10,000 fee referenced below. 

Thanks,

Gwyn

Hi Maureen and Gwyn-

On the Oxford Analytica front, I'm glad you have found the service useful.  
Our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more 
users to have access.  Our current contract is for $50K or $10K per user per 
year.  We can charge $10K back to you.

On the IIF front, the invoice for $47K is due at the end of the month.  Here 
I would propose that we pay two thirds (to cover our costs and the costs of 
our Competitive Analysis colleagues in London), leaving $15K for you to cover.

Since we took on these services last year, we have expanded our range of 
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less. Thus I 
need to allocate some of our costs from OxAn and IIF to other projects.

Let me know what you think about this proposal.  Maureen, congratulations on 
your secondment to Enron Metals (Gwyn mentioned it to me).  FYI, our 
colleague Jim Roth is providing Competitive Analysis support to Joe Gold and 
John Sherriff on that project from London.

RJ
