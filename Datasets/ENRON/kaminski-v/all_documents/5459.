CONFIDENTIAL:  FOR DR. KAMINSKI ONLY:
Dr. Kaminski:  Our client is one of the foremost financial advisory
firms in the world.  They are building a consulting practice focused
upon leading edge strategies in Real Options and related areas.  You are

on a short list of people that could be helpful, if not a candidate.
This leadership role will require face to face interaction with board-
and C-level clients and managing other highly credentialed professionals

to become the premier group in this area.  The role has prestige, high
compensation and professional challenge.  The candidate can live
anywhere to do this job.  Of course, New York and San Francisco are the
primarily locations where they have critical mass.  Even if this is not
for you, I would appreciate talking briefly (confidentially) with you to

get your recommendations.  Al Arfsten, BFL Associates Ltd. 713 965
2158.  Our website can be found at www.BFLassociates.com to get
background on us.
