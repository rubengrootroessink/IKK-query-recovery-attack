Vince and Shirley:

I have spoken with Steve Collins the National Sales Manager at Great Divide 
Lodge.  He has agreed to honor our $6000.00 credit as long as we fulfill the 
following  two requirements:

Confirm reservations prior to July 31

Hold event prior to Thanksgiving

The appropriate contact number is 970.453.3152  Steven Collins

Thanks for working with us on that.
