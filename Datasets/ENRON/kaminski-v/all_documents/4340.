> Dear Mr. Kaminski,
>
>  It is a great pleasure and a great honor to schedule you on the MSCF
> Speaker Series list for November 3rd, I will make reservation for 8
persons
> at a restaurant in Pittsburgh for that evening. Also, if you want I can
book
> an hotel for you.
>
> Let me know if you have anything in mind  for the topic of the
presentation.
> There is no real guidelines as we like our speakers to have as much room
as
> possible. Here is one of the past presentations that had an impact. One of
> our speakers divided the presentation in two, the first part was
technical,
> the second was more general, explaining what his firm was looking for when
> hiring new employees.
>
> Thank you very much for accepting our invitation.
>
> Sincerely,
>
