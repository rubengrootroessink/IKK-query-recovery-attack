Peter,

I am in London till Wednesday afternoon. I shall be back at the office on 
Thursday.

Please, feel free to call my  secretary, Shirley Crenshaw 713 853 5290,  to 
schedule
a conference call. I cannot access my calendar from London and don't know my
commitments for this day.

Vince

Dear Vince and Gary,

We are all speaking at the March Real Options Session in NY.   My work in
real options in the energy field has come, to a large part, from my
casewriting in your two organizations, so I feel that we should probably
allocate more time toward your presentations and less to mine.   While we
have a two hour block among the three of us, I think we can freely
re-arrange things to produce the best result.  Would you two like to
schedule a brief conference call to coordinate our talks?    I am free
virtually all of next Wednesday 2/23, perhaps we could talk at 10 am (EST)
or 2 pm (EST)?   I am happy to arrange the call, if you send me your phone
numbers.  Thanks.

Peter Tufano
