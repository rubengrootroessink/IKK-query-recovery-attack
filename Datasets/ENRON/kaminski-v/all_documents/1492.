Vince and Kristin,  I forwarded by separate eMails the lists of Tiger Teams 1

Thanks!

Vince and Christie,

Greetings.  I am writing because I need a break out of names for the Tiger 
Team group 1 and 3.  I understand Tiger Team group 2 has decided not to be a 
part of Enron and I also need to know who those students are.  I have a 
listing of all the tiger team members but they are listed alphabetically so 
that does not help me with my quest.  We are trying to firm up the details 
and get offers out to the correct people for summer associate positions in 
Vince's department.

Regards,

Kristin
