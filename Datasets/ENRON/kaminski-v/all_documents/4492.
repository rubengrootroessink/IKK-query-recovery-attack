Hi Vince,
?
How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have  the latest version of your 
part of chapter 3? (I think GRant has sent thru a  seperate, updated version 
to you, which has been typeset). Everything else has  been tied up and we 
will go with the version we have, unless we hear  otherwise.
?
Many thanks and best regards.
?
Chris.
