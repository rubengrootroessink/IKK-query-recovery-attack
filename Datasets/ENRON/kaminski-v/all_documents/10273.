FYI  -   US inflation-linked bond

I can not replicate the nominal yield and inflation adjected cash flow
calculation from Bloomberg. So I called the bond analytics group.
I got to the point that they admit that they have made mistakes in their
calculation, and promised to fix it. 

Once I got the issues settled, there will be a better US inflation model.
