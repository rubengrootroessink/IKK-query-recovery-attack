Chris,

Yes, I mentioned it to both the US-editor and Robin.
They were very interested and I don't think there should be any problem
with this initiative.

I shall follow up with another message to Jane Locke and Robin Lancaster.

Vince

Vince,

Thanks, I would be very interested to have a look.

My question was a bit vague - I meant to ask if you had spoken to the editor
about the series of articles?

Best regards.

Chris.
