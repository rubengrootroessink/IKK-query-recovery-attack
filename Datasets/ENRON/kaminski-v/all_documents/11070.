Subject: 12/17 Churn -- EB29 to EB19

Hi Lupe!

There are approximately 25 boxes, several small file cabinets and 2 plants (a 
3ft and  a 9ft plant) that are ready to be moved from 29 to 19.  This is part 
of the 29th floor 12/17 churn.

The items are located in various offices of the "Fishbowl" area on the 29th 
floor.  They are labeled with the 19th floor designated location.  

There are 2 larger file cabinets that are located in the hallway.

The 2 plants need to be taken to EB1944.

Is there anyway to work this in your schedule on tommorrow?

Thanks
Linda
