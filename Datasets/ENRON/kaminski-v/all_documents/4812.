More about the Pacific Decadal Oscillation...

Q. Will we have a drought in southern California? 

A. If the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has switched we are likely to have 
20-30 years with lower rainfall that
     we have had since the late '70's.  We will still have winter rains, but 
the number of really wet years is likely
     to decrease.
