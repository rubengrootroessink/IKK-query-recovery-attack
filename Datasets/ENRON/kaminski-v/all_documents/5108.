Kate,

Has the paperwork been finalized yet?  Let me know if we've agreed a start 
date yet.

Thanks,

Dale

Subject: Sharad Agnihotri

I have just spoken to Alex Blair from Alexander Mann who met with Sharad this 
morning.

Sharad has verbally accepted our revised offer and is expected to return the 
paperwork tomorrow. I will let you know as soon as I get a start date from 
him.

Regards
Kate
