Dear Stinson,

I apologize for the delay in responding. I was away Wed-Sun and
just returned. Thank you very much for your email. I plan to make
a firm decision on my future plans sometime in the later half of
April, and would be extremely interested in getting an offer from
ENRON. I think the opportunities at ENRON are very exciting and
there is room for some real contribution to the group.

Best wishes,
Salal
