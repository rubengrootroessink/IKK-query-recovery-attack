Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am interested in working on a part-time, telecommuting basis
(roughly the equivalent of 1 to 2 days a week) for about a year or
two. I can visit as necessary. I am attaching a brief resume.

Is this something that might be of interest to you? Should you have no
opportunities, can you suggest other groups? I look forward
to hearing from you.

Regards
Reddy
