I have communicated to them that we are taking a fresh look at all our 
scoring vendors.  Based upon Moody's acquisition of Famas/LAE, I told them I 
would like to hear their product suite "vision" for a customer such as ENE.  
I emphasized our interest in predictive power of any model(s), and 
requirement for mapability to Moody's/S&P/Enron ratings based upon historical 
default rates.
