Dear Krishna,

Dear Dr. Yan,


In updating your paper "Optimal Production Control in a
Discrete Manufacturing System..." we noticed there is a
change in your co-author's address. Unfortunately, the fax
did not transmit clearly and I am unable to read the
new name (Enron Corp?) and address. Can you email me
the correct information?


Many thanks,

Ms. Tara Duggan, IEEE
