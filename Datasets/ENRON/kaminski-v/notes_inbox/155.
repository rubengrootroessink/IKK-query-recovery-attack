 There is a VERY good reason why he cannot pass "official" interviews.  I 
will be more than happy to interview him, but if he doesn't know anything, 
then it shows that he hasn't put in the effort to learn, and is cheating his 
way through school.  

 If memory serves me correct, this was the guy who talked all the time, and 
flattered anyone who he thought would be valuable to him.  There are many 
other reasons why he doesn't want to appear on interview lists.   I would be 
reluctant to treat him any differently than his classmates.
