This  summer may prove to be an especially?crucial period for the economy, 
with  the California power crisis possibly spreading to other regions and 
gasoline  prices likely to skyrocket.

This coupled  with continuing recessionary pressures in other sectors of the 
global economy  has greatly increased the importance of re-evaluating 
business strategies and  developing scenario plans to mitigate the growing 
financial  risks.

I am attaching  a list that highlights activities that?could be of value to 
you in this  environment.? If we?may be of  assistance to you, please do call 
me  (972-539-2868).

With best  regards,
Shannon Burchett
