acquisitions.? In case you are unable to attend or would like to include 
another senior manager from the M&A sector, please feel free to forward this 
invitation to a colleague.


An agenda for the symposium is attached, though we stress that the direction

About The High Tech Acquisitions Research Project
A Research Collaboration of the Wharton School & Insead


The High Technology Acquisitions Research Project, jointly organized by The 
Wharton School and INSEAD, has been conducting research to identify the 
determinants of success in high technology acquisitions.?


Our research includes developing a portfolio of in-depth case studies, 
building a unique acquisitions database, and hosting semi-annual workshops 
for industry practitioners.? These tools allow? us to perform rigorous 
analysis to determine success factors in high technology mergers and 
acquisitions.? Firms that have participated in our research process so far 
include Cisco, Cable & Wireless, Hewlett Packard, Lucent, Symantec, and Xerox.


Timely Insights for Company Decision-Makers.? One of the most unique aspects 
of this project is the reporting of research in progress, to give industry 
decision makers access to the insights from our research as they are 
revealed.? To test and refine our findings, we host an ongoing series of 
workshops that bring together practitioners from some of the most experienced 
acquirers in the high tech arena, and academicians whose research interests 
converge on the role of acquisitions in technology-based competition.


Our next workshop on December 5 will be the third in the series.? Prior 
events were held in December 1999 at Wharton and June 2000 at INSEAD in 
Paris, France. (Reports of these events are available on the ET website: 
http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu).


Objectives.? Our objective is to build a community of practice around the 
complex phenomenon of managing acquisitions in high-tech environments.? A 
major goal is to identify and validate new best practices and winning 
strategies in mergers and acquisitions.? Most of our focus involves issues of 
value and concern to large multinational corporations.? We are particularly 
interested in how mergers and acquisitions are pursued as part of a company's 
GROWTH STRATEGY.


Research Team.? The research team on this initiative includes:? Prof. Harbir 
Singh, Chairmsn of the Management Department and Co-Director, Mack Center for 
Technological Innovation (Wharton); Phanish Puranam, Project Director and
