In cooperation with the Economist Intelligence Unit and Knowledge@Wharton,
we are pleased to invite you and your colleagues to a one-day workshop on
"The Conscious Corporation: Organizing for Knowledge in the Global Economy."
The date is December 8th, 2000 and the location is the Aresty Executive
Education Building at the Wharton School in Philadelphia.

We feel this subject is of pivotal importance in today's fast-moving
economy.  The experiences over the past decade in knowledge management
indicate that directives to share knowledge are rarely adequate.  Knowledge
development requires active and ongoing mechanisms of organizing to sustain
the exchange.

The workshop will consist of presentations of Wharton faculty research plus
the experiences of industry.  We are attaching an agenda.

We do hope you can join us.  Contact Rachel Barrett at
rlbarret@wharton.upenn.edu if you are interested in attending.

Very truly yours,

Sid Winter & Bruce Kogut
Co-Directors, Reginald H. Jones Center
The Wharton School
University of Pennsylvania
