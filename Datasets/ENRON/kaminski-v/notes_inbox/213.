Tom:

I do not think Vince has any plans to go to UT the rest of this year.  Would
Professor Lasdon be interested in coming to Houston?   They sometimes
do that if they have something they really want to discuss with him.

If not,  I will forward this to Vince and keep him in mind for the next trip.

Thanks!

Shirley

Shirley,
Leon Lasdon would like to meet Vince sometime when Vince is at UT Austin.   
He'd like to find out more about what we do, and of course is looking for 
opportunities for research projects and summer interns.  I am planning to 
visit him sometime soon as he has an interesting hydro modelling project.

Leon is a well known person in the optimization world - his nonlinear solver 
is used in Excel, he's written text books (I used it lots during my thesis 
work), and he is a Professor in the Department of Management Science and 
Information Systems at Austin.  tel 512 471 9433, email 
lasdon@mail.utexas.edu.

Tom
