Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

At its brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a stripped-down consent agenda, 
without discussion, as described below.  Following this summary is an updated 
listing of filings at FERC.

In particular, FERC:

(1) Approved, 3-1, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, an extension of the existing 
temporary $1,000/MWh bid caps in the ISO-NE energy, automatic generation 
control and operating reserve markets through March 31, 2001.

(2) Rejected an aspect of ISO-NE's July 28 CMS/MSS compliance filing, namely 
its proposed Installed Capacity (ICAP) deficiency charge, and directed the 
ISO to reinstitute the previous, administratively-determined deficiency 
charge that the Commission required the ISO to revert to in its June 28 
Order; other aspects of the filing will be addressed separately, FERC 
indicated.

(3) Accepted in part, and rejected in part, American Transmission Company, 
LLC.'s (ATC) proposed OATT and rates, with Comm. Massey concurring.  Among 
other things, FERC rejected ATC's innovative rate proposal, without prejudice 
to ATC submitting a new FPA Section 205 rate filing, based on its finding 
that ATC's ROE and other rate proposals amounted to a "request for the 
innovative rates that we have indicated we would consider in an RTO 
context."  ATC sought such rates prior to joining an approved RTO, FERC 
specified, distinguishing this case from its September 28 Order authorizing 
innovative rate treatment for International Transmission Company.

(4) Accepted for filing TransEnergie's two filed compliance reports on its 
procedures for reassignment of transmission rights and the results of its 
open season, respectively.

(5) Rejected proposed amendments filed by two Southern Energy parties to 
their respective Reliability Must Run (RMR) Agreements with CA ISO, after 
finding the amendments were inconsistent with the terms of a prior RMR 
settlement.

Numerous significant items were stricken, including the Alliance RTO 
compliance filing (CAE-27), the Southern petition concerning its RTO plans 
(CAE-23), and the Illinois Power-MISO withdrawal docket (CAE-16).
