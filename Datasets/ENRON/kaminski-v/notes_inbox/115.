Subject: internships at Enron?



Mr. Kindall:

I am a PhD student at GSIA whho has been working on modeling energy
commodities.

When you and Mr. Kaminski visited Carnegie Mellon, I had the opportunity
to talk with Mr. Kaminski about a model for electricity that I am trying
to develop. During our conversation, Mr. Kaminski suggested the
possibility of developing the model at Enron. I have tried contacting Mr. 
Kaminski
subsequently, to find out whether my working at Enron, possibly as an
intern, was still an option, but have been unable to reach him. I have his
email address as: vince.j.kaminski@enron.com. Is this the correct address?

Alternately, could I talk with someone else regarding internship
opportunities at Enron.

Thank You
