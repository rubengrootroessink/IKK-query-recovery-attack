Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Dr. Arnold suggested that I get in touch with you for possible employment 
after I finish the MBA program. He was not certain as to the exact 
position(s) for which I would be considered and recommended discussing it 
with you further. I have an undergraduate degree in Finance in which I was 
exposed to a formal derivatives class, and I am currently in Dr. Arnold's 
real options class. Additionally, I have had some working experience with 
this class of securities. Please find attached a copy of my resume (Word 
format). 

If you have any questions, I can be reached via email or at 225-266-6200. I 
am looking forward to speaking with you.

Thank you,
George T. Moss
