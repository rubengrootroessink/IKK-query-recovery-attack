Thanks - I think this one is fairly hot at the moment - so as soon as you can 
get comfortable would be good !

It might be worth spending some time together on it - let me know what you 
would prefer

David,

When do you need my signature. I missed the presentation last Tuesday
(I was sick) and would like a day or two to review the product.

Specifically it requires the following to get it over the line:

Vince, your concurrence with a simplistic VAR calculation the start - up 
period

Everybody else, your signatures, or agreement to sign via email

In addition, here is the commercial presentation which wil be attached to the
