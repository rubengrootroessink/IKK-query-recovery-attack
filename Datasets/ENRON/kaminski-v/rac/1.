Dear All,

In order to "E-rate" the countries where Enron has assets and trading activity by Friday, we have divided the work in order to meet the deadline.

Felipe Ibarra will offer his expertise on the following countries:
Colombia/ Dom. Republic / India/ Jamaica
Mexico / Nicaragua/ Panama

Ahmet Kose will put his credit on the following:
Turkey/ Hungary / UAE

Pauline Reyes
Philippines

Kyu Bong Lee
S.Korea

Ethel Koskas will do the rest of the countries. 

We need the rating for each of these countries by THIS FRIDAY (afternoon).
With a short paragraph explaining why the rating should be changed if need be and justification of the new rating.

Document will be sent to Dave Gorte, Maureen Raymond Castaneda ( Research), Olivier Herbelot (Rac Underwriting Europe) on friday evening.
They will have 3 days to review it and then discuss with Rick Buy on thursday prior to posting the new E-rating template on the RAC WEBSITE.

In parallel, we are trying to implement an E-rating by country search possible on the Rac website.

Thank you so much in advance.

All the best,

Felipe and Ethel.
