The meeting is from 9:30 am-11:00 am, not pm.  Sorry!!!



Its' that time of the year...Fall recruiting season is just around the corner and you've been selected to represent Enron and the GTT at various campus events at the University of California, Berkeley!  

Mark your calendars!  There will be a Cal campus team meeting on August 9 to discuss the campus events.

I hope to see you all there.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.
