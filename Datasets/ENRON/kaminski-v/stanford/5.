Carol:

For your information and Susan's, Christie Patrick will not be available on the
4th of May.  She will be out of the city.  Maybe Susan can contact her directly
at another time.

I still have 1:30 as the time for Vince and Susan to meet.

Thanks!

Shirley Crenshaw

Good morning Susan:

Vince forwarded the below message to me and after looking over his
calendar, he appears to be free most of the afternoon on the 4th of May.

Please let me know what would be a good time for you and I will block
it out before someone else gets it.

Thanks!

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

Let me briefly introduce myself, I am the Director of Corporate Relations
for the School of Engineering at Stanford University.  In this role, I am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions.

I believe you know Hill Huntington, who is a senior researcher with
Stanford's Energy Modeling Forum.  He suggested I get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at Enron.  I'm in the process of planning a trip
to Texas in early May along with my colleague Donna Lawrence, the
university's Director of Corporate Relations.  We were hoping to be able to
include a stop at Enron on our itinerary. Right now it appears that Friday,
May 4th would work best for us but we're at the very beginning of our trip
planning.

The purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between Enron and Stanford, to give you an overview of current priorities
in the School of Engineering, and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact.

I look forward to hearing from you about your availability,

Sincerely,
Susan Hansen
