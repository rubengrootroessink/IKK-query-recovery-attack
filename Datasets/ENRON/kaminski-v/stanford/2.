Stanford Team, 

We have received yet another acceptance - Noah Jacobs has accepted our offer as a summer associate.  We are now 4 of 6 for our summer offers.  I have sent Paul Kasper, our one full time offer a cultivation gift and will be checking in on him next week.  Also Eric Cope, a Stanford student that Vince Kaminski's group had interviewed here in Houston for a summer associate position has also accepted.  All in all our Stanford numbers are looking great!

Many thanks to everyone and keep up the great work!
Althea
