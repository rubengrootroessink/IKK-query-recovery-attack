Hello Nick:

I agree  e-mail is much easier.

There is a two-hour time difference between Calif and Texas, i.e., 1:00 pm 
Texas Time - 11:00 am Calif time.

Would tomorrow at 11:00 am Calif time be ok with you (1:00 pm Texas)?  
This time is fine for Vince, Tom Gros and Stinson Gibner.

Can they call you and if so, what number?

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Shirley
713-853-5290

Shirley,

It's easier to communcate by e-mail, since I am moving from
meeting to meeting (but I have the laptop always with me).

Please give me a phone number that I could call tomorrow.
What is the time difference between California and your
location? I think it's 2 hours (CA->TX) - is that right?

I can do the conference call any time from 9-11 CA time.
Would that be OK on your side?


Thanks,

Nick
