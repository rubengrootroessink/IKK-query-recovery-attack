Hi Vince, Stinson

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships 
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive 
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

Best Regards,

Nick


PS: Vince, I look forward to seeing you during your visit to the Bay Area
in October.
