Vince,

  I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.

Frank Wolak
