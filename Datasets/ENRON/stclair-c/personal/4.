 Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based=20
Employee Referral Program.

 This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs.=20
Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quali=

and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the=20
company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. Thi=

k=20

 There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired,=

you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

 So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and hel=
p=20
