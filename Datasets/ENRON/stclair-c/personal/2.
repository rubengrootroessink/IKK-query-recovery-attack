Did we ever get confirmation on the legal issues.  I don't want to release a 
confirmation if we are not sure we can do this transaction.

Please let me know how to proceed.

Lou / Nick,

As requested, attached is a draft copy of a confirmation for the optional 
steel purchase from A. K. Steel. 

I am not sure this is the type of document needed for this part of the 
transaction, as I discussed with Nick this morning.  I also, think we need an 
additional agreement, other than a confirmation or master agreement, to 
actual define the deal - the gas fixed price option, the payment of 
$2,280,00.00 over twelve months, the option to purchase the steel over a 42 
month period.  Also, there is no provision in this confirmation to address 
extending credit to A.K. Steel.

I would like to meet with you for further discussions.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.
