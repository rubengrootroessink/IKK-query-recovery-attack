Carol, did you look over Penny's resume?  Interested?  She just called this 
morning and said her job has been eliminated.  She's freaking out!  

Did you find a restaurant for your mom and sister? I didn't get the voice 
mail until this morning.  I'm so sorry. I don't know any vegetarian 
restaurants though.
