Here is the latest version of the contract, which just went out to the 
customer.  The next step is a negotiations meeting scheduled for this 
Thursday.  Our objective is still a close early next week.

Cheers,

Harald

Attached you will find the master agreement and the confirmation for the CA 
facilities.  I have marked in red provisions that we have added or deleted 
based upon our conversation last week and your subsequent comments.  We will 
need to discuss further with you any comments that you have given that we 
have  not addressed in this draft.

We look forward to meeting with you on Thurs.  MDS
