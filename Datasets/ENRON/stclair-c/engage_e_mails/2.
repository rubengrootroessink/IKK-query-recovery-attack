I think that after my phone conversation today with Glen Mackey.  Carol St 
Clair is the attorney working on this now that Janice Moore has left Enron.  
By copy of this email, I am letting Carol know that you are also interested 
in the outcome and are a potential contact if we have commercial 
questions/issues.  Thanks.
Paul

Not to worry...I don't have that authority.
I am on the marketing team ..
If you don't mind....when the EEI & guaranty are in place, will you give me a 
heads up ?
Thanks ..

Until we have our EEI executed and the guaranty in house, please do not turn 
them on for power EOL.

Teresa, I am working with Engage on Gas and Financial, Paul Radous in my 
group is working with them on Power.  I can not make any credit decisions on 
the Power side, although I can say, that until we get guaranty's in on the 
gas/financial side we can not turn them on EOL, and I am sure this is the 
same for Power, unless they have come to some other agreement.

I have been working with Engage to get them in position to trade power.  I 
know you are working with them as well, regarding a guarantee.  As I 
understand, this should be in place and the production group should be able 
to provide them with their execute packet very soon.

I just wanted to make sure this is the case, since I'm somewhere in the 
middle !

Please verify what I'm thinking ...thank you both.

T. Mandola
