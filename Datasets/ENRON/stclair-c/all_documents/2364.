Rhonda,

Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement
between us, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Capital Group
Inc.  We would like to have the document ready to execute at about the same
time we execute the derivatives Consent to Assignment Agreement with Enron
North America, and we are waiting for FERC approval on the Physical Power
Sales as well.  I just wanted to present the agreement to you now, so that
if it is necessary, we have time to discuss any concerns.  I look forward to
talking with you to work toward the execution of the Agreement.

Thanks,

Kristina M. Drew
