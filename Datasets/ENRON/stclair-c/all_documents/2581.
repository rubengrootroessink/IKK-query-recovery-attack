		Aged Boerenkaas
		 Cheese of the Month - Aged Boerenkaas 
		Not commonly exported to the US, Boerenkaas is a farmhouse, unpasteurized 
cow?s milk cheese that has been aged for over 18 months.  A special variant 
of traditional Gouda, its characteristics are similar to our ever-popular 
Extra Aged Gouda.  Aged Boerenkaas? interior is firm and has a sharp, tangy 
flavor that is anything but mild.  Hints of Swiss and Cheddar can be detected 
beneath its salty fruitiness.  With its rich, robust flavor, Aged Boerenkaas 
is suitable as either a table cheese or a dessert cheese, and is excellent 
with your choice of fruit and a bold red wine. LIMITED QUANTITY: AVAILABLE 
ONLY TO CHEESE OF THE MONTH SUBSCRIBERS.

		Super Special!
		SuperSpecial - Oud Brugge 
		Dad likes a sale too, right?  For the month of June, we are featuring Oud 
Brugge at a SuperSpecial price of $4.99 per pound.  You?ll never find a 
wonderful cheese like Oud Brugge for such a low price anywhere but at 
iGourmet.com!  Tradition and nostalgia were the driving factors behind the 
creation of Oud Brugge, meaning ?Old Bruges?, which is named after the 
charming Belgian town. This special cheese is ripened for twelve months, over 
which time it develops its delicious taste and even texture. Very little salt 
is used in the creation of this product, which allows it to maintain a mild 
but complex flavor, in spite of its long ripening time. Similar to Old 
Amsterdam and Extra Aged Gouda, it is sure to become a new favorite.  Oud 
Brugge is perfect with a glass of fine wine or port!
