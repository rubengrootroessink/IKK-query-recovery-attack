This Stage 3 Revival and Closing  task is akin to SMUD and I have asked Carol 
St. Clair if she can do it.  I think that is the best chance of getting 
reasonable progress underway on it.  ----cgy

Christian:

One of the things that didn't quite get done prior to Shari Stack's departure 
was the San Diego EEI.  We had gotten it almost to the finish line, but got 
bogged down on a definition of replacement cost.  SDG&E wanted ISO penalties 
to be included in Replacement Costs.  As you know, EPMI's preferred 
definition of CAISO Firm, and regular Firm, excludes penalties.  We ended up 
with an agreement that said we are OK with penalties as long as we are 
notified of incurrence of these penalties within 24 hrs.  This language was 
the last draft we sent to SDG&E and is attached.  

Sharon Firooz called today and wanted to get the EEI back on track.  I 
reiterated the above as where we were when the process got bogged down.  I 
indicated we are ready to sign based on that last draft.  Or we might be 
willing to use an alternative version of CAISO Firm that basically is silent 
ton the definition of Replacement Cost.  

I would like to arrange a time as soon as possible to get you up to speed on 
the issues here so we can get give SDG&E a clear indication of our continued 
willingness to execute the EEI with the language indicated on the draft below 
as well as perhaps an alternative definition of firm that would be silent on 
Replacement Costs.

Thanks

Chris

The attached draft EEI Cover Sheet contains the latest amendments to the 
Replacement Price/Sales Price definitions. The changes are blacklined - 
everything else has remained the same.
