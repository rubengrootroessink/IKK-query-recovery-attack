Chris, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it 
could expedite the approval process.? I have attached the language we propose 
which basically deletes the specific language regarding penalty for 
replacement and sale prices (see section 1.a (1) and (2)in the attached).? I 
wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the 
other one. THX

Sharon: 

As indicated by my previous e-mail to you, since Shari Stack has left 
Enron, it will take me a couple days to resurrect this EEI.? Later today it 
is likely I will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we 
sent.? Subsequently, I will get you a clear statement as to alternative 
language that leaves the Replacement Cost definition less clear ala WSPP. 

Thanks 

Chris

?? The attached draft EEI Cover Sheet contains the latest amendments to the 
?? Replacement Price/Sales Price definitions. The changes are blacklined -
