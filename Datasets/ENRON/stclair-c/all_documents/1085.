I wish I knew of someone for you -- I'll keep my ears open.  How are you 
doing?  Our baby is due 1/16 -- we are all very excited although it will be 
interesting to see how 31-month old Emma reacts!  Looks like we might be 
ships passing in the night with my leaving and your returning, but I hope to 
see you soon.  

Leslie

I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can 
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We 
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone 
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you 
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I 
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me 
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think 
might be able to help.  Thanks.
