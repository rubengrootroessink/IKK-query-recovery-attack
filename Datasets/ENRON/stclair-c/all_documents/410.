Scott:
I have been monitoring drafts of the swap docs.  Are you or someone else in 
your group reviewing the other docs that involve Enron Corp. such as the 
Certificate Purchase Agreement that appears to have a bunch of reps that 
Enron has to make?  I( have not been paying to much attention to the docs 
that don't involver the swap.
