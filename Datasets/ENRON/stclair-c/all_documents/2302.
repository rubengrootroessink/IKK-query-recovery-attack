Dan:
I have taken a very quick look at the Financial Swaps Section.  Here are my 
thoughts:

1. Are there any "credit terms" that need to be disclosed at this point?  
Should it be made subject to credit terms?  Should we mention that these 
swaps will be documented under an ISDA Master Agreement with schedules to be 
negotiated or will the swps be done under the existing Master Agreement that 
we have with Olympic?

2. In Section A, I am not familiar with the "EnronOnline 1-2 month bid price, 
but I'm assuming that one of our businerss people has taken a look at this 
wording and is okay with it.

3.
