Janette,

Yes, Mark is available.  

Just a suggestion--I have found it very helpful to have "read" access of 
Calendars for all of Mark's direct reports-for availibility purposes.  Let me 
know if you want me to have METaylor to edit his Calendar Profile.

Taffy  :)

Taffy:  

I have scheduled this for 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, December 20th.  Does that 
work for Mark Taylor?

Please let me know.

Janette:
I need to meet with both Marks to finalize the details on my return to work. 
I'm happy to come to the office to meet with them.  Next week, the only day 
that is not good is next Tuesday.  I think that we need about 1 hour.  Could 
you please check with Mark Taylor's secretary and then let me know what works 
best for Mark H. and Mark T.? Thanks.
