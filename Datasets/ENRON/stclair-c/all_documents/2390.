Attached is the final red-line showing all the changes made to our existing 
large commodity form based on the spot check item in the EES/EWS Coordination 
Plan.  We will drive these changes into all remaining forms (mid-market, CMA, 
Fast-Track and industrial and commercial gas agreements) as well as all 
transactions currently in the beginning or middle stages of negotiation.

On a go forward basis for new transactions, we will identify and explain all 
material deviations from these revised forms.   

 Jim
