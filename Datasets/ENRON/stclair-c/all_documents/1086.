Carol,

I am about to be on nanny #9 since July, 1999 - I haven't had great luck and 
always have a live-in.  I am presently going through Au Pair in America and I 
would be happy to have them send you info - but they do live in and there is 
a pretty substantial agency fee.  My assistant, Erica Braden, also found an 
interesting website www.nanniesplus.com which seems to have a whole range of 
different types of nannies who work in different circumstances (i.e. live-in, 
live-out, housework, no housework, etc.) - this also involves an agency and a 
smaller (but not insignificant) fee than au pair in America.  From time to 
time Ali's school will have a posting for a nanny - I'll forward it to you if 
I see such a listing.  Good luck - may you fare better than I have!

Cynthia

I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can 
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We 
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone 
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you 
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I 
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me 
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think 
might be able to help.  Thanks.
