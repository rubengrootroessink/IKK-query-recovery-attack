Carol,

I have spoken with Corrine Greasley @ ISDA regard your request for missing 
ISDA Netting and Collateral Opinions.  She said that since the list of 
missing opinions was quite extensive, that ordering a complete set of the 
opinions would be the way to go.

The cost for such endeavor would be:

(a) ISDA Netting Opinions -- $500.00 (complete set)
(b) ISDA Collateral Opinions -- $500.00 (complete set)

Let me know if you wish to go this route. 

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey

Corrinne:
As a follow up to my earlier e-mail message to you, I am enclosing a list of 
the ISDA Netting and Collateral Opinions that we currently have.  In most 
cases, we are missing the updates.  We have very few of the Collateral 
Opinions.  After you have had a chance to look at our list, I would 
appreciate hearing from you as to the best way to obtaining the opinions and 
updates that we currently do not have.  Thanks.

Ms. Greasley:
I am an attorney in Enron Corp.'s legal department and Mark Taylor is my
boss.   We were unable to access the website to obtain the latest netting
opinions and would like to make arrangements to get hard copies of them.
Please call or e-mail me when convenient.  Thanks.
