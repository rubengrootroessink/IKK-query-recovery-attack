Hi Carol

I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a 
service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of 
candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).

Good luck on your search.

ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
Thanksgiving.
