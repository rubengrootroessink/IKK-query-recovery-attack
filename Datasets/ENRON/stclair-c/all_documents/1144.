		Coombe Farm Cheddar
		SuperSpecial - Coombe Farm English Cheddar $3.99/lb!
		 Cheddar cheese has been produced on farms in the county of Somerset in 
Southwestern England for hundreds of years. Cheeses called "Cheddar" that 
come from anywhere other than Somerset and its neighboring counties are 
merely imposters. The authentic English Cheddar we are featuring here is made 
in Somerset from rich, local milk and aged for over 12 months in temperature 
controlled storage units. We found it to be of excellent quality, possessing 
all the great traits we've come to expect in a good cheddar - sharp, nutty 
and not overly dry.

Club, our Coffee and Tea Clubs are proving to be great holiday gifts this

steaming hot milk.
