Carol,

In response to your questions:

#1:  legal is fine.  done.
#2:  I'm fine w/that also.  Its basically saying the same thing as the ISDA.  
done.
#3:  I'm fine w/excluding the Joint Powers Agency (take or pay contracts) 
that cp may have.  done.  I don't recall them excluding it from the ISDA 
though...may want to verify and ask them of that.
#4:  I'm fine w/posting of 10days...as long as its on a bilateral basis.  I 
thought the ISDA accomplished that...but I may have misread it to apply to 
all margin calls similar to SMUD doing so.  Carol, can we have it apply to 
all margin calls?

Thanks for handling.

Tracy

Ron noted that I failed to note one change that we would like you to
consider, i.e., an ACH payment from SMUD to Enron in addition to the wire
transfer.

One change that did not get in was on page 1 - adding ach as a payment
method along with wires to Enron.
