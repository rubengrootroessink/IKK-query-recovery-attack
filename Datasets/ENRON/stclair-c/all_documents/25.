David:
Has anything been set up yet in terms of a formal termination notice 
process?  Also, I still have that one counterparty that requested some type 
of notice when we change the product descriptions.  Do you have any problems 
with that?  I'll be out of the office at the legal conference but will be 
checking my voice mail.
