transactions is not to make any chnages.  However, in some cases exceptions 
are made.  Here are my thoughts on their comments should we decide to make an 
excpetion for this counterparty:

Sean:

Per our phone conversation, please see attached files with clauses to be
amended. Please note that we are still reviewing a couple other issues but I
wanted to get these changes to you and get the ball rolling as soon as
possible to get this contract in place.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 212 878-4088.

Thanks again and have a great weekend.
