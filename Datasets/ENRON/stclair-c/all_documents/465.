Pam:
How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got about 
another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over 
with.  I hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  
Are you free for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  
E-mail me back with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell 
Patti I said hi.

Carol
