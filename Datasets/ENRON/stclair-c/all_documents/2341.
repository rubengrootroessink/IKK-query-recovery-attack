Subject: Q2 Deals

Just to ensure we're all on the same page here, following are the priority 
deals for Q2. We really need to be sure we are all closely coordinated and 
very focused on bringing these to closure.

Mann: Harrah's, Sysco, Danacorp
Muench: Tyco, Quebecor
Schwarz: Park Place Entertainment
Sutter: Consolidated Container Corp.
Sharp: Various commodity deals


We can't afford internal downtime on these deals and we need everyone to step 
up to make them happen. Let me know if I can help...
