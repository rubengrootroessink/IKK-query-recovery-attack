Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

Mary:
I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?
