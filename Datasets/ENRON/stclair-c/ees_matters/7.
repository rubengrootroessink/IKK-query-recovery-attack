Subject: PacTel Revised Commodity Agmt

Attached to this email pls find the latest version of the subject agreement, 
incorporating the thoughts and comments received to date (including PacTel's 
comments).  Note that there are number of outstanding issues.  We will be 
working off this version commencing Monday p.m. (21 May) in SBC's offices in 
San Ramon.  I have also included a redline against the version that we sent 
to PacTel.

Pls email comments questions etc. and I'll be able to pick them up from the 
(Enron) San Ramon office.  If you need to get a hold of me in person, the 
best way is to send me an email page to 8773417930@skytel.com.
