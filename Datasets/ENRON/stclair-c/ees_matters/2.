Carol,  this is one of the deals on the list we discussed this morning.  
Since it is on the fastest track, we need to discuss at our meeting 
tomorrow.  Cathy will coordinate with you to set up a time.

 Jim

Debbie,
?
Attached is a draft of the referenced agreement which  has been redlined to 
reflect Sysco's comments.? The draft has not been  reviewed completely by me 
or at all by Sysco's business people, so it remains  subject to additional 
comments.? I will see you at 2pm.
?
Aaron
