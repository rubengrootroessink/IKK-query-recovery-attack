Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent 
would be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role 
that Enron Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am 
looking at a June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the 
language in Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.
