Carol, attached is the agreement with the changes you requested and my
suggested wording to Section 4. I trust I picked up your changes correctly,
as they were not too clear on the fax.

Except for two small changes in 4,(adding the word "on" in line 12, and
changing "confirmed" to "executed" in the last line) I did not make the
changes you faxed on 2(g) or 4 as we require some language to carve out of
those limitaions the information we use for our offer. Please see what I
suggested instead of the wording sent last time.

Trust this will be acceptable and we can attach this to a letter agreement
stating this is the ETA. This will also have to be referenced in the
Password Agreement
