Steve:
Just wanted to let you know that Bill is running for an open position on the 
Cy-Fair School Board.  The election is Saturday May 6th at Emmott but early 
voting takes place tomorrow from 8-12 at the instructional Support Building 
on Jones Road.   If you and Julie are planning on voting and are undecided, I 
hope to solicit your support.  His opponent is Don Ryan.
Carol
