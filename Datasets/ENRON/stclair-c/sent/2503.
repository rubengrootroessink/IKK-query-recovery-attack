Scott and Bruce:
I just sent you the revised documents that we received from ACE.  I spoke 
with Bill Windle this afternoon and told him that it was unlikely that we 
would be in a position to talk with ACE by 4 tomorrow.  He would like to try 
and have an internal call with ourselves and you sometime tomorrow if 
possible. I'm going to be unavailable from 10-2 tomorrow, but could you 
please give Leslie Hansen a call and let her know what if anything we can 
accomplish tomorrow?  Thanks.
Carol
