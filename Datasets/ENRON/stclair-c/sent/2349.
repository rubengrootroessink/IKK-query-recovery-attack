Carol,

Christina Drew has now notified me that effective May 31, 2001, FERC approval 
has been secured.

Therefore, at this time she would like to go forward with the consents she 
furnished to us for review last month.

If their forms meet with your approval, please date them effective as of 
today.  

We are to have triplicate originals of each Consent signed by ENA. 

Let me know if I may be of assistance.

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey
