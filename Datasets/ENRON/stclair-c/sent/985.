I will call you probabbly mid-morning tomorrow.  Charles' schedule is still 
unpredictable, but I'm sure we will hook up one way or another.

What's the best time to call you to discuss your memo?  Also, unless I hear 
from you otherwise, I will plan on conferencing you into our legal/credit 
meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm.  I have your number as (281) 890-7122.

Sara:
Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well.  
Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by 
phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me.
