Here is what John wants to do.  He wants to put everything under the 1996 
Master Agreement and is willing to increase their collateral threshold from 
$10,000,000 to $16,000,000.  He also wants to increase our threshold the 
same.  He has alos given is permission to do our form updates.  Could you 
please communicate this to your contact and if they need to speak with 
someone in credit, please give them John's name.  Thanks.
