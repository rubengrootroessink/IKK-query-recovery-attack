I think that you just need to do whatever you need to do and if I am still 
here I will just work with the floater.

Carol, I spend 3.5 hours in the dental chair this morning and have a sore 
mouth, as well as cramps.  It's not one of my better days.  I also found out 
I have to have a root canal, 8 crowns, a fortune will be spent.  Anyway, she 
said the crown stuff would take 4 hours, which means 6-8, so I was wondering 
if you thought it better for me to take off when you guys weren't around.  
The week of July 17th, you'll be gone, Mary will be on vacation and Dan will 
be on vacation.  Would that be a good time for me to be gone too since it'll 
be quiet.  I have a lot of decay and need to get this over and done with 
soon.  After that's done, I should be finished except for routine cleanings.  
She's already done both side of my mouth.  Now, it's the front that has to be 
done.  I wanted to get your input before I started scheduling appointments 
where I'll have to be out an entire day.  

The Astros won last night and we were there!!!  We brought them luck!!!!!!
