Peter:
Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change 
the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the 
following:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities 
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."  Our current rep is 
attached.  Is this something that we can agree to?
Carol
