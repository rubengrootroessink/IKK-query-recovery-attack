Lucy:
Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about 
the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.  He wants us to 
talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks 
associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such 
info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.  I'm out 
tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this 
discussion at our Monday morning meeting.  does everyone on your side know 
about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?  If that time is a problem, 
please contact my assistant Suzanne Adams.
