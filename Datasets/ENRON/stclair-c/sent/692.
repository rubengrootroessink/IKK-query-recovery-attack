Dave and Grant:
I understand from lisa Lees that there is now a push to get Crestar signed 
up.  You may recall that they had alot of commnets to the ETA which I sent to 
you both with my thoughts on certian of the comments.  What is the next step 
with them?  Dave, do you have any thoughts on their comments?
