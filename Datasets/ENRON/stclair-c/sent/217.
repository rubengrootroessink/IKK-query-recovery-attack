Carol:  Per your voice mail I am attaching a portion of a memo that has not 
been circulated yet, but it summarizes the requirements, approvals and 
notifications required by Corp and ENA Legal policy regarding Standstills, 
Nohires and Noncompetes in confidentiality agreements.  This is the portion 
relating to Nohires.
 The memo I've been working on is a summary of Jim Derrick's 10/27/99 memo 
regarding required approvals plus other ENA policies and language re these 
provisions.    THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you 
mentioned.
 Regarding approvals, since business persons (Detmering, Metts) must make 
them there is much feeling among attorneys I work most with that business 
persons should secure these approvals.

Let me know if you have comments, questions or need anything else.
K
