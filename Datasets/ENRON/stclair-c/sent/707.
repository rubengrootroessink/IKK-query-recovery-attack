Joe:
Here is my stab at a form of confirm reply letter.  This one assumes that we 
are the confirming party but it can be modified if the counterparty is the 
confirming party and we want to send this.  I will work on  modifying 
Southern's cover letter into something that we could send to our 
counterparties.  Call me if you have any questions.
Carol
