Sounds like we have the same credit people.  Actually, I asked the business
people to push our credit officer for an answer. Hopefully I'll have an
answer soon.

Steve:
I am waiting on my credit person to get back to me.  I know that he is out
for a
good portion of this week but I will continue to follow up with him.  Have
you
made any decisions about the amendment to the BT Agreement that we
discussed a
few weeks ago?
Carol
