Chris:
Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
