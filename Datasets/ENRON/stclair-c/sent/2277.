Vicki:
I believe that it was and I'm checking with Chris Long on this.  As soon as I 
hear back from him I will call you.  Also, I'm having my assistant look into 
where those materials that you sent ended up.  Thanks.

Carol, it would help if I knew what was on the table. For example, does the 
proposed amendment already redefine forward contracts?  Give me a call.  
Thanks.

Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

Chris:
Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
