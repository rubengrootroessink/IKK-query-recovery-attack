Hi,

The sick leave policy is 4 weeks at 100% and 22 weeks at 90%.  So some of 
that time will fall into the 90% pay.

Take care!

Michele, is this 8 weeks of sick pay at full pay?

Good Morning,

She will get 8 weeks of sick pay. Please be sure that her time is coded as 
sick starting today.

Thanks

Michele, Carol had her baby last night and had to have a csection.  Does this 
add time to her maternity leave?  What about the other 26 weeks that we are 
given for illness.  She can't use them?  Suzanne (Carol's assistant)

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark
