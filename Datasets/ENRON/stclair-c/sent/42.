Suzanne:
We are going to try and schedule some more lunch meetings before I go on 
leave.  I would like to do one in early May, one in late May and one in 
JUne.  Could you please check the availability of  the conference room on 30 
that we used last time and let me know what dates are open?
Thanks.
Carol
