Doug:
Please talk with Mark Taylor on who should handle this in our group as given 
my situation, I will probably not be able to take this on.

Gareth & Carol,

Attached are the term sheets associated with a proposal from Citibank in 
response to our desire to set up a revolving type facility to execute 
short-dated crude oil prepays (i.e. 180 day financially settled prepays) in 
order to minimize execution costs.  I will call to set up a meeting to fill 
you in on the details but there is a high probability that we will need to 
finalize and close by the end of this month.
