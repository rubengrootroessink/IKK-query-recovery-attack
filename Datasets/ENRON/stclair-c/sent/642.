Further to my voice-mail message, please see below.  Can you please let me

Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.

Many thanks

Add the first one to the ISDA status list.

For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they 
usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to 
whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing 
deals from Europe.

Thanks, Edmund

Paul

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

Martin
