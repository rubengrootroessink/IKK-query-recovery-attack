Mark:
I will definitely be up before the 20th.  Hope yopu have a great vacation.  
Things are going well here.  I'm gradually getting more sleep and Bill and I 
have started playing tennis again which I am really enjoying although we 
don't yet have much free time on our hands.  Hope you have a great long 
weekend.  have you received any more info on the stock options?  take care.

Carol - I would really like to come but unfortunately I will be leaving on 
vacation (to France) on the 20th and won't be back until October.  I hear you 
will be at the offsite but is there any chance we'll get a visit up here 
before then?
