Karen:
Please take a look at what we have agreed to in Section 4(b) of the 
amendment.  Your new language does not track that language and if you are 
going to add language to the LC it needs to track that language.  I 
personally feel that this language is unnecessary so long as the drawing 
condition is specified.
Carol

Carol:

The additional transfer language is sufficient.

I black lined an insert to address TEFP's concern that the letter of credit 
may be exercised on
default, only when funds are owed.

Please advise if this change is acceptable to Enron.  (If it is, I will print 
copies of the
attached, & replace the existing letter of credit format with the attached 
document, so that
Susan does not have to generate executions copies again.)


Thank you,



Karen
