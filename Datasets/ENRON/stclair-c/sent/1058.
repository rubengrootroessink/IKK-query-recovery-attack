Sorry I haven't called or written in quite some time but I'm in my own little 
world here at home.  Things are going very well here.  Charles will be almost 
4 months old and I can't believe how much he has grown.  We finally have 
established a day and night routine for him and I'm happy to report that I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.  I'm still running and playing alot 
of tennis which has helped me keep my sanity.  I have really enjoyed my stay 
at home.  It's nice to be able to watch  your kids grow up and both Arthur 
and Charles I think have really benefitted from us both being home with 
them.  I feel very fortunate.

I would really like to have lunch with you in the next few weeks so that I 
can catch up on what has been going on and begin discussing with you my 
thoughts about returning to work.  It's something that I haven't given too 
much thought to but need to as the end of the year approaches.  Here are some 
good dates for me.

November 13th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 22nd.  Let me know waht works for you.  
Sorry that I haven't brought Charles up to see everyone but with all that we 
have going on here it's hard to find the time to make the trip into down 
town.  Look forward to hearing from you.


Carol
