Some of the 8 week sick pay will be paid at 100% (4 weeks I believe) and some 
at 90%.  Therefore, please enter my vacation time as vacation time so I get 
paid 100% and not 90%.  Thanks.  Call us if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Suzanne:
Thanks.  I just want to make sure that my vacation time gets paid at 100% 
before I go down to the 90% level.  Thanks for taking care of this.  As you 
can see, I now have access to my e-mail so when I'm not pumping, feeding, 
changing diapers, etc...  I acn be checking up on things!!!

Carol, I turn it in as sick and Taffy will code it how I turn it in.  I've 
got it all on the calendar, so it's taken care of.
