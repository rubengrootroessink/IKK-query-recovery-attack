To whom it may concern:
This morning I filled at an online registration form for Camp Enron for my 
son Arthur for the June 26-30 and July 10-14 sessions.  I wish to confirm 
your receipt of my application.  I also wanted to know who I should send the 
release form to.  My phone number is 713-853-3989 and my e-mail address is 
Carol.St.Clair@enron.com.

Thank you.

Carol
