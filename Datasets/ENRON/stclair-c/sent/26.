Suzanne:
If Bill gets his act together I will hand you an invitation to our party 
tomorrow, but here are the details:  Saturday, April 22, 5-7.  If you have 
some time, please stop by this afternoon and hopefully I can narrow down what 
I want to order.  Alos, have you had any kluck in getting some Enron stuff 
for my JA class?

Carol
