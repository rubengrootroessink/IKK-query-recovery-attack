Pablo:
Weather derivatives are derivative transactions that we do with 
counterparties based on temperature chnages, rainfall amounts etc.  For 
example, a counterparty (i.e., a ski lift operator) may want us to agree to 
pay them within a certain seasonal period based on  the number of days that 
the temperature exceeds a certain level.  With respect to credit derivatives, 
these are again financial transactions that we may enter into with a 
counterparty where we may agree to pay them if an entity taht they have a 
relationship with goes bankrupt.

I am sorry, but, Could you define what do you understand by weather or credit

Pablo and Jose:
As  a follow-up to our discussion yesterday, would you consider either weather
derivatives or credit derivatives to be "securities".
