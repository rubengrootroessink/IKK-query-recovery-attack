Mark:
I need for you to send an e-mail to Michelle Word informing her of the 
following in connection with my leave that you have approved:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, I am planning on 
adding to that period and using any remaining vacation time that I have for 
2000 which I believe is an additional 10-12 days.

2. After that time is used up, I plan to take an unpaid leave of absence.  
Michelle informs me that I have to specify a date and as you are aware I am 
not sure how long I will take but if I need to specify a date, let's just 
pick until December 31, 2000 and as you and I have discussed, I will keep you 
informed throughout my leave as to what my plans are once I decide.


3. Tentatively, I am planning for July 14th to be my last day but I should 
know more after next Wednesday.


Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.

Carol

Hi Carol,

All I need is a note from the Dr. showing the delivery date.  If you are 
planning on taking any additional time, it must be cleared by your supervisor 
prior to you leaving.
I can give you a form to return once the baby is born if you are going to add 
the baby to your insurance.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.
