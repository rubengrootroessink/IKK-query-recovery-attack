Suzanne:
Please include Jim Crump in the Inland meeting that I need to have with Ken 
Curry.  He would like to meet as early on Tuesday as possible as he will be 
travelling later on Tuesday.  His assistant's name is Dora Trevino.  Does Ken 
Curry have an assistant that can access his calendar?  If not, why don';t you 
get a time that works for Jim and me and leave Ken a voice mail message so he 
can get back to you on Monday.  We need about 1 hour.  thanks.
