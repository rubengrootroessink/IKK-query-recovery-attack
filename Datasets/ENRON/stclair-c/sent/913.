I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this 
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.  
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need 
to run this by someone else please let me know.
