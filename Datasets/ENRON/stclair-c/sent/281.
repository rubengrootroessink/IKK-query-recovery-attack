Carol, from the way this sounds, your four weeks goes on into the 26 weeks as 
long as your doctor hasn't released you.  What do you think.  Man, this stuff 
is hard to decifer!

Under doctors care, the employee is paid 4 wks at 100% of their base, granted 
that no sick time has been taken prior to the maternity leave.  If the doctor 
requires her to be off work before her due date, this time would be coded as 
sick.  Even after delivery and still under doctors care you would code her 
sick time.  until the doctor releases her to return to work.  Once she has 
been released by the doctor Carol has the option to take time off using any 
vacation available or could take FMLA leave (if  she qualifies )  with 
supervisor approval.

Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the 
baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor 
need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already 
starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return 
to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks, 
Suzanne
