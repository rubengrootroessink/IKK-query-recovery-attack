Hi again:

Fast response, I know.  I was sending a message to Travis when yours came in, 
so I'll reply right away.  I would like to put in $35 if that is okay with 
you - I'm not sure what the grand total would be.  Good luck again with nanny 
search.  Glad to hear that everyone is well.  Hard to believe, but Britta, my 
oldest, just had her 14th birthday last week!!  They grow so quickly and are 
so precious.  Take care,

Mary

Mary:
Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return 
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly 
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes 
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after 
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look 
forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

Carol

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

Mary:
I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?
