Zulie:
I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's 
school.  I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done 
and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something 
akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.  Would I be eligible for 
this?  I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to 
ask.  My extension is 33989.
