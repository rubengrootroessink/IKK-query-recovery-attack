Debra said that you might have some ideas as to whom I can contact.  Susan 
Flynn gave me Zulie Flores' name.

Debra:
Susan Flynn mentioned that you might be able to help me out on getting some 
Enron stuff for the kids that I teach Junior Achievement to at my son's 
school.  I have been trying to contact someone that would be willing to give 
this class some Enron freebies with no luck.  I think that Marge Nadasky was 
the last person that my secretary talked to.  Do you know of anyone that can 
help me out?
Carol
