Tanya:
When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master 
between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or 
come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a 
letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to 
The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was 
not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in 
fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?
