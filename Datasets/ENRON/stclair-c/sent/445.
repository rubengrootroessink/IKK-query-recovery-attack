Brant:
Is this what was agreed to?  When we last spoke, it appeared as if you had 
not agreed to a collateral threshold of $50M and a cap of $55M.  Please 
advise.

By cap, I assume you mean the Guaranty amount or limit - $55MM was agreed
upon.

> 1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant

> 3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word
