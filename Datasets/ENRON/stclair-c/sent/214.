Jim:
We have finally devised a procedure for handling termination rights.  I will 
amend the ETA amendment letter and send it to you.  We have a new procedure 
in place that requires me to get commercial approval for all amendments so I 
first will need to run this by the head of the Online group but will send it 
to you right after I receive that approval.  Sorry for the delay.
