Steve:
I am faxing to you my response to your Guarnty comments.  While we are 
waiting on my credit person, would it be possible to get a redraft of the 
schgedules from you since a good portion of the comments that we discussed I 
beleieve we agreed to and would help me focus on what is left to discuss with 
my people?  We have alos modified recently our form of LC and I have enclosed 
it for your review.  Thanks.
