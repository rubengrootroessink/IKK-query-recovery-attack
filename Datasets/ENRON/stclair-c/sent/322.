ATTORNEY CLIENT  PRIVILEGED.



The assignment looks fine, but I don't understand the underlying 
transaction.  Is EEL transferring this domain name "WEATHER-DESK.COM" without 
any consideration other than using RMS' software program for six months?

Before executing this agreement, you need to secure Mark Palmer's permission 
since the agreement states that no variation of the name may be used.  He is 
the vice president of advertising at Enron Corp.  I have copied him on this.

Mark

Not sure of your exact email address but hopefully one of these is correct.
Can you please confirm that you receive this?

Below is the agreement our attorneys have drafted for the transfer of the
www.weather-desk.com domain name.  Note that they have recommended that a
few of the more specific details regarding the corresponding Enron usage of
the RMS weather model be addressed in a simple but separate license
agreement.   As discussed, in addition to general confidentialiy
provisions, those terms will include (1) the access will not cover any
international weather data that may be added to the system during the term
of use through December 31, as our costs associated with such data are
uncertain and (2) the use of the model will be for Enron internal purposes
only with no data or analysis results to be shared with third parties.

I would appreciate if you can forward this to your legal dept. to review so
that we can hopefully get this resolved quickly.

Thanks/regards

Paul
