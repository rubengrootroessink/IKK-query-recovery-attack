=09=09 Subject: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA

Hi Carol,

Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can=
=20
agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ("WCL") in order to=20
replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o=
f=20
this e-mail) in the ISDA to:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."

From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n=
ot=20
be appropriate.  They are as follows:

1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives ("91-504") and the=
=20
corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20
time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20
Securities Commission ("OSC") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=
t=20
brought the "securities representation" issue to our attention and he has=
=20
confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20
announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=
=20
adoption.

2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade=
=20
with Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is likely to be considered a "trad=
e=20
within Alberta" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=
=20
office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a=
=20
result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta=
=20
securities law.

3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a "trade" can take place in =
a=20
number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =
=20
Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be=
=20
made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=
f=20
British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20
similar "blanket orders", "policies" or "rules" with respect to this issue.=
 =20
However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=
he=20
forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20
jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=
04=20
is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =
=20
Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=
a=20
in place at this time.

4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=
e=20
fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an "OTC Derivative"=
=20
(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20
potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be=
=20
beneficial to either party to remove this representation.

With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =
3=20
above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20
provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act=
=20
(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=
nd=20
are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following=
=20
clause:

"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an =
=01&OTC=20
derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=
ties=20
legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20
securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the=
=20
Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=
=20
paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20
paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order=
=20
BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=
om=20
time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=
=20
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=
=20
jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;"

I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to=
=20
the "open-ended" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer=
=20
to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I=
=20
would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:

Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC=
=20
Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=
s Act=20
(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=
s=20
a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=
curities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20
Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=
e=20
hereof.

to:

Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an=
=20
"OTC derivative" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20
Commission Order Doc#394043 ("ASC 394043"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=
ia=20
Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) ("BCSC 91-501") and/or=
=20
paragraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)=
=20
Over-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20
Commission on January 7, 2000] ("[Proposed] OSC 91-504"), as applicable to=
=20
such Transaction, (ii) it is a "Qualified Party" within the meaning of=20
paragraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe=
ct=20
on the date hereof, and (iii) it is a "qualified party" within the meaning =
of=20
paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.

Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=
=20
language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=
=20
were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=
he=20
Alberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=
ta=20
or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=
=20
respect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, y=
ou=20
may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).

I hope this discussion is useful for you.  If you have any questions, pleas=
e=20
do not hesitate to give me a call.  I can be reached directly at (403)=20
