Sarah:
I just wanted to thank you for the time and effort that you have spent on my 
behalf in trying to resolve this ratings situation.  I know that Bill S. is 
still trying to plead my case today with Cindy Benson, but I am afraid that 
the damage was done when Memorial's team captain voiced her objection.  Why 
do you think that she did what she did and won't this happen again when we 
play them?  I look forward to hearing from you.
