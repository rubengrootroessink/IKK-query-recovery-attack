John:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  I will wait to hear back from either you 
or John M. before I respond to Reliant on our issues list.  I do agree with 
you on all of the points that they need to address.  On the Event of Default 
issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and 
void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?  I was concerned 
that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some 
confusion as to what Events of default are covered.  What do you think?
