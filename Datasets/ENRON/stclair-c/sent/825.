John:
The Schedules look fine.  Just one minor chnage which I can maker.  In the 
form of LC, I'm deleting the words "Rider 1" at the bottm and in the last 
paragrpah of page 1, chnagung the word "receipts" to "receipt".  We will 
generate and send to you execution sets.  With respect to the Guaranty, we 
would prefer that you sue the fopm which I sent to you a few weeks ago.  Here 
it is.  This form is our updated form and matches up with the Enron Guaarnty 
that we are giving you.

Carol -

Enclosed are what I hope will be the final drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph
13, LC provisions, and Schedule 1.

I have accepted and incorporated the new changes you made plus all the
changes which we have agreed upon.  I also changed the presentation of our
address in Part 4a of the schedule - it's the same information presented in
a more concise way.  Finally, I changed the signature block on the schedule
to eliminate EPME-Gas Company (it no longer exists) as a 'general partner" -
I don't know where that came from.

Also enclosed is our version of the Guarantee.  Please let me know if any
other changes are required.  If not, let's proceed with execution copies -
let me know if you want to generate them, or if you want me to.

John
