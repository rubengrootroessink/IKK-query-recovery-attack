Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

Thanks and regards-
