I have left a message with John that I have received approval from Dave to 
give them a bilateral termination right.  I will send them the language 
shortly.

Carol --

In talking to this customer, he said that he has not heard from anyone at 
Enron regarding this question.  Could you update me on this request?

Thanks,

Carol --

John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
contract.  
Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?

Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
Mary "Griff" Gray
