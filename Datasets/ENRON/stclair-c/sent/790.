Susan and Samantha:
Could one of you please draft a CSA for Occidental Energy marketing, Inc.  in 
accordance with the credit worksheet below.  I am currently working with 
their form of ISDA Schedule.  Thanks.

Carol

Hello Carol,

I believe the e-mail below was meant to address Oxy, not El Paso.  Please 
refer to the credit worksheet attached hereto.

Thanks

Brant:
Can you please e-mail me with the particulars on what should go into the El 
Paso CSA so I can get that drafted and sent over to them?  Thanks.
Carol

Carol:

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here
is to have it fully negotiated in advance.  As to the idea of just using
S&P, I will pass that along to our Treasury Dept.

  Mike:
  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit
  Support Annex?
