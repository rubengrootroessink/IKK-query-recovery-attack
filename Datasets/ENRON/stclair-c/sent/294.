Subject: RE: Project Margaux - Transaction Documents List


I have reviewed the last Transaction Document List produced by Milbank on
April 7  ( the "TDL" ) and suggest that the documents referenced below will
need to be in pretty close to final shape before we mail the preliminary
offering memo.  Since many of these documents need to be agreed between DLJ
and Enron and then between Enron and the "Equity," we should probably get
started on these documents as soon as possible.  We have seen drafts of some
of these docs, but not most.

Using the TDL as a reference, these documents are items I.1., I.2., I.3.,
I.4., II.A.1.-5. and 7., C.1.1.1-1.4., 1.7, 1.8. and 1.10 and all of C.12.
Thanks, JE.
