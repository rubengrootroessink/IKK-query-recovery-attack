Sara and Mary:
Could we get together for lunch sometime soon so you can update me on what 
has been happening at the office?  Let me know which dates work best for you 
in the next few weeks.  My mother in law is coming for a visit next week so 
can we shoot for sometime the week of November 6th?  Look forward to hearing 
from you.  Charles is doing great.  Growing like a weed and becoming more 
interactive with us.  While I miss the office routine, I am really enjoying 
my time away from the office.
