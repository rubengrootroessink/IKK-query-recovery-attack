John:
The head of our Online group reviewed the letter that I sent to you last week 
and requested one change.  Enclosed is a marked and clean version of the ETA 
amendment letter which addresses all of the issues that we discussed and may 
need to be revised further to address the issues that you discussed with 
Leslie Hansen.
