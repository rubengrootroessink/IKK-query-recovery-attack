David:
CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done 
5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.  We are in the 
process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding 
credit issues.  How should I respond to their mark-up?  This was one of 
Janice's files.
