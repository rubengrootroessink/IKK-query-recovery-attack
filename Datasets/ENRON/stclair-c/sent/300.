Sara:
I spoke with Mark about this and he was all in favor of having a party for 
Marie although I got the feeling that if we wait on him to organize it it 
won't happen.  Anyway, would you consider having a get together at your 
house?  We were just going to limit it to the swap group.  Let me know what 
you think.
