My mother-in-law is in town this week.  Here are some dates next week that 
work for me if you want to play at lunch:

Monday, 11/6, Wednesday, 11/8, Friday, 11/10.  Are any of these good for 
you?

Hi Carol

Was just wondering if you wanted  to play tennis, maybe sometime next week 
(I'm trying to get excited about something next week - work has been very 
busy and I need to fill in it with other things).  Let me know if you want to 
try and play. Hope all is well.
