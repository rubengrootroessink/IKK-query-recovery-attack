Adele:
Tanya left a message for Cindy and offerred $10M as a cap for each Guaranty.  
The reason for the cushion is to protect the party who terminates at a time 
when its exposure is close to the credit threshold and by the time that the 
date is set and the amount is calculated there is a move in the market that 
results in its exposure being above the threshold.
