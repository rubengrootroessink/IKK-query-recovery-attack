Bill:
I'm available from 9-10 tomorrow and then after 2.  Who is on the call at 4 
and do we need to get our counsel plugged in?  I have forwarded the docs to 
Bruce and Scott and I am not sure what their availability is or whether they 
would be ready for a call.

Bill:  Attached is a revised draft of the Agreements for our telephone
conversation tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.  This incorporates the changes from our
last discussion. David, Ed and I have reviewed the proposed changes, but
have only briefly discussed the current version among ourselves.  As a
result, we may have a few other items to discuss that are not noted on the
documents.  We look forward to the call.  Best regards.  Rick.
