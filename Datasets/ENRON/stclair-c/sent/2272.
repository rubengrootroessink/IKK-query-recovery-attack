Pam:
I saw Janet Greene last week and she said that she was working with you.  She 
looked great!  Can we get together for lunch sometime soon?  Let me know some 
dates that work for you in the next 1-2 weeks.  I'm in the office Tuesday 
through Thursday.

Everything is going well.  Charles is on the verge of walking!  I'm now in 
the power trading group and loving the work.  Hope to hear from you soon.
