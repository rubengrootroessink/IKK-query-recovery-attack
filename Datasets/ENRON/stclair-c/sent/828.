Thanks for your quick response.  As for me, I've got about 3 weeks to go and 
after this week, pretty much anything goes.  I feel great and am really 
excited and anxious.  In the meantime, I'm using my pregnancy as an excuse to 
get our counterparties to finalize our ISDA's and it appears to be working!  
Thanks for asking.
Carol

I'm okay with the language.  How are you doing?

We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where 
we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that 
basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the 
rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to 
only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it 
were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted 
your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
