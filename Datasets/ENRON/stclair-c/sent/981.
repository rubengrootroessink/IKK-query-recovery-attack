Terry:
Just wanted to let you know that our son, Charles Eugene, was born on July 
12th.  He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the 
time and effort that it took to have him.  After a prolonged stay in the 
hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.  I'm on cloud nine and 
I'm sure that all of this will hit me soon.  Hope you are doing well.  Take 
care.
