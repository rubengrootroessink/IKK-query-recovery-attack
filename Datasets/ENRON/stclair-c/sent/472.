Please find attached clean and black-lined versions of the Swap Confirmation, 
Swap Assignment Agreement and Calculation Agency Agreement.

Please note that in the Swap Confirmation, items relating to the Sarlux 
Indexation Adjustment, forms of Calculation Agent Certificate and Independent 
Engineers Certificate and Schedule 4 (Projected Adjustments) still require 
completion.? We would therefore welcome the suggestions of the working group 
in order to finalise these outstanding items.? We currently plan to circulate 
revised drafts of the Swap documents on Monday to the Equity,? which will 
incorporate comments we receive from the group by Monday am (London time).

You will note that the $ amount for the Trakya Forced Outage Adjustment has 
been changed to $911,000 (from $910,000).? This reflects the most up to date 
figures sent to us from Jeff Ball at DLJ.

Kind regards 

James Eveling?
