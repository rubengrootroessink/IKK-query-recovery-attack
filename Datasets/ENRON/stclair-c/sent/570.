Sue:
Sorry that I didn't get back to you over the weekend but with Arthur's 
baseball schedule and all the running around that we were trying to do, 
things were a bit hectic.  I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that 
I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.

Things on the baby front are progressing well.  On our last ultrasound we got 
the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so 
I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am 
still taking it easy and swimming alot.  The baby weighed about 4 pounds a 
few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.  Now I'm 
trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.  the people here 
at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will 
help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.  
Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few 
weeks.  I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time 
off but we will see how that goes.  I really feel great except for being 
uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is 
good practice for when the baby comes.

Arthur is doing great.  We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger 
pet!  They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.  He is 
still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which 
we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!  He called dad practically every 
day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping 
that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.  Arthur would  be on 
cloud nine if he came.  We'll see.  Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a 
week over the summer and we are looking into that.  I'm toying with the 
possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but  I'll just have to see 
how it works out.  I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby 
is born.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  You are obvious;y welcome at any 
time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in 
august.  Let me know what you think.

How is Cindy doing?  Do you know what she needs for her new addition?  Do you 
want to get her a joint gift?  Let me know.  I'm happy to do either something 
on my own or jointly with you.  How's Cate?  Give her my best.

What's new with you and your career situation?  I hope that you are enjoying 
what you are doing.  I certainly am and  I am still undecided about what I am 
going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the 
rest of the year off.

I've got to run to my "baby class" tonight.  Take care and I will try to 
catch up with you sometime.  I love you!

Carol
