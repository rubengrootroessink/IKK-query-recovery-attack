Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the 
exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop.  
As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 
1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE 
sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and 
matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I 
don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any 
of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

here is a redlined version from the previous draft.  i'm giving you this to
highlight what changed, but you may want to just "Accept all changes" to
have a fresh copy to look at.  this still has some things to work on, so let
your counsel know that.  let me know when we can meet monday or tuesday.
