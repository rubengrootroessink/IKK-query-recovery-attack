Hi Carol:

Here is the Tax Language.

Regards,

Steve

(i)  Section 5(b)(ii) of the Agreement is amended by adding the following
language at the end of clause (2) thereof and before the semicolon therein:

=10_g(a =10_gNet Payment=10_h), provided, however, that, in the event of th=
e receipt
by a party of a Net Payment due to the failure of a Tax to be an
Indemnifiable Tax because of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority imposing such Tax and
the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient, the
relevant date referred to in clause (x) and (y) above shall be the date
which is sixty days prior to the date on which a Transaction is entered
into (rather than the date on which a Transaction is entered into)=10_h.
