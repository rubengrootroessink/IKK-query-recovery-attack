Gaurav:
Thanks.  I have forwarded this to Mark Taylor.  Elizabeth and I spoke with 
him this morning and he confirmed that he is your contact to work through the 
online piece of this so please feel free to contact him directly at ext. 
37459.  We alos left a voice mail message for Lou about getting outside 
counsel involved on the insurance/derivative issue.  Finally, do you have a 
list of proposed counterparties that you can send to us?  To the extent that 
approvals need to be obtained to trade with these counterparties, it may be a 
good idea to get that going. 
Carol
