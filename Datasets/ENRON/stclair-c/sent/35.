Carol,

Some of the data sets we receive on a regular basis from the National Weather 
Service are not 100% complete.  i.e., a day or two of data may be missing 
from the data set.  In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures, 
rainfall, and/or snowfall) may be missing.  For our internal purposes, our 
research group uses analytical tools to determine a "best guess" at what the 
actual data was.  We replace the blanks in our files with our best guesses.  
We usually highlight derived data in our files, but we cannot be sure that we 
have highlighted derived data in every case.

A customer is requesting some historical data from us.  We would like to send 
this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of 
misrepresenting our analysis as fact.  What do we need to do to absolve 
ourselves of any liability in this regard?

Please call with any questions.

Regards,

Gary Taylor

Would you like me to give him the information??? 
 I've given him Raleigh and St. Louis  in the past because we had deals with 
Inergy in those cities. 
 We currently have NO active deals with Inergy.

Lucy,

I work with Bill Gautreaux at Inergy Services.  I am working on several
proposals in which historical degree day averages are needed.  Would you
be able to provide the 10 yr, 15 yr, 20 yr and 30 degree day averages
(ending with calendar 1999) for the following locations.

Raliegh, NC
Chattanooga, TN
Fort Wayne, IN
Chicago, IL
Detroit, MI

You have recently provided us with some of the information above, but I
am missing several components.

I can be reached at 816-741-5080 if you have any questions.

I appreciate your help in providing the information.

Carl Hughes
