Susan:
I've been intending to send this e-mail to you for a few weeks but somehow 
got distracted.  I was wondering how things have been going with you over the 
past few months and was hoping that you could send me an e-mail with your 
impressions of the group and how it has been doing since my leave.  As for 
me, I'm doing great.  Charles is really growing fast and it has been a great 
experience for me staying home with him.  I'm really enjoying it, although I 
miss work too!   I'm sorry that I haven't brought him up for a visit but we 
have been so busy here that it's hard to plan a trip downtown, but someday 
I'll make it up there.  Hope everything is going well with you.  Look forward 
to hearing from you.

Carol
