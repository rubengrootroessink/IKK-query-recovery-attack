Has Cindy re-rated me?  Someone filed another mixed doubles protest.  I'll

Line 3 doubles -
The three teams I would like to play doubles are Cyndy & Patricia, Cas &
Christie, & Carol Leigh & Jeannie.  Sandi & I are available if someone has a
problem (I would need to play early to use the baby sitting).  If someone has
a preference as to when they would like to play let me know.  Please e-mail
me with availability.
