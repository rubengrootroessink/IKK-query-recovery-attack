Jeff:
Congratulations!  What a beautiful baby!  We had our son, Charles Eugene, on 
July 12th.  He weighed in at 8 lbs 8 ounces and was 21 inches long.  So far 
so good.  everyone is doing fine and trying to adjust to our new schedule.  
Thanks for the pictures and give my best to the rest of the family.
