Shari:

I need your thoughts on 2 things:

We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and 
Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some 
modifications to our Annex A.  Do you remember what those modifications 
were?  Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.  How do you think that 
this counterparty will react to getting a new form?  I loook forward to 
hearing from you.

Carol
