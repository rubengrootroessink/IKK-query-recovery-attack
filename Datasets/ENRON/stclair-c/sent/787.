Susan,

The below e-mail/Telex was sent to our Trading desk as MG's Confirmation for 
a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

My question for you is are we going to accept this as a form of Confirmation?

Thanks,
Joe
