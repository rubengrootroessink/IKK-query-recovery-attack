Suzanne:
Everything is fine although I am really looking forward to spending more time 
out of the house.  I think that Bill and I need some space as well.  Can you 
sense that I am getting restless already?  I am really going to try hard to 
stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that 
talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift.  
Charles is doing well.  I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we 
are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach 
normalcy in a few weeks.  we met our new pediatrician this past week and we 
both really like him.  Charles checked out fine.  He had gained over a pound 
since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough 
to eat.  My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the 
christening and I am looking forward to that.  Please mark your calendar for 
that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very 
much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.

Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.  I 
would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.

I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.  Hopefully, in a few 
weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do 
so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.  Alos, Mark mentioned that I 
should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I 
apparently received recently.  Could you please be on the look-out for it?  
I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet 
(which I know you will).

As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family 
except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.  I told Bill 
that he could go but he decided not to.  We bought her some really pretty 
(and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.  She has not yet given 
us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the 
doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.  I 
really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.

Well, I've got to go.  hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by 
for a visit.

Carol

Carol, I received an invoice from LeBoeuf Lamb regarding the ACE insurance 
matter.  What should be done with it?
