Jack,
We have located your Fed Ex.  sorry for the confusion.  I have skimmed 
through your comments.  Looks like most of them are credit-related.  Could we 
schedule a call with the lawyers and credit folks to wrap this up and then 
you and I can discuss remaining legal issues?  Let me know what you think as 
well as times that would be good for you and your folks.  I would guess that 
we need about 1-11/2 hours.

Jack,
Did you send over your comments?  I have not received anything by fax or
messenger and our business folks are anxious to move this forward.  Please
let me know where things stand.  Thanks.
