Tanya:
We still don't have it and we were hoping that someone on the commercial side 
would place a call to J Aron.  We agreed to it weeks ago and there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have it by now.  Since the existing Guaranty does not 
cover the new Master I do not consider the new Master to be effective.   
Apparently there is some confusion on J Aron's part since they keep referring 
to the new Master in their confirms.  I have left a message for their 
counsel, Luanne Giessen, that we do not consider the new Master effective 
until we receive the new Guaranty.  Tana has left numerous messages with her 
alos about getting the Guaranty.

Tanya:  Please talk to either Carol or Tana.  Maybe they need commercial help
