Hi Everyone,
I was thinking of getting Suzanne a gift certificate from Urban Retreat as a 
Christmas gift and was wondering if anyone else would want to join me.  If 
you are interested, let me know by e-mail how much you would be willing to 
contribute and I will take care of it.  Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!
