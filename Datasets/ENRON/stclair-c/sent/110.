Angela:
Jeff Sorenson forarded me your letter to him regarding the Annex A letter 
that you received.  The reason that you received this letter was because of 
trades that we do with Aquila Canada Corp.  You are correct that we are in 
the process of finanlizing a Master with UtiliCorp but only trades with ARMC 
will go under that Master.  We are alos in the process of sending out a draft 
of the Master that we intend to put in place with Aquila Canada Corp but 
until that is completed, all trades with ACC will be done using the Annex A 
terms and conditions.  Please call me if you have any questions at 
713-853-3989.
