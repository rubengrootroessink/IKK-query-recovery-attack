Russell:
There are several credit issues here that we need to discuss like:

1. Their comment on the affiliate language in the setoff provision - I don't 
think that they understand how this works.

2. Their first and second comments to the CSA.

3. Their comment in the CSA about requiring a different standard for holding 
collateral.

4. Their desire to change from Fed Funds Rate to LIBOR  

5. Their renewal notice comment concerning the LC.


Please call me to discuss.  Also, Susan Bailey and I need to talk with you 
about Global Companies LLC.
Carol
