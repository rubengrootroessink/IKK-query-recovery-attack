Kristina, here are the proposed changes to the Assignment Consent Agreement.  
Our attorney is Carol St. Clair .  Please respond to her (and copy me if via 
email) with your response to the proposed changes.  She indicated that we are 
negotiating an amendment to our master with Morgan in order to accommodate 
this assignment so we will not be executing the Assignment Consent Agreement 
until Enron and Morgan sign the amendment to our Master with them.   We need 
to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is that 
establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and each of 
Morgan and MEGA.  She indicated that her revised draft of the Consent makes 
it clearer how this cutoff date works.  Carol's contact information is below.
