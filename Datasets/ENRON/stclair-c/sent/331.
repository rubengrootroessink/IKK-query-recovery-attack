Mary:
I'm waiting for Dave Forester to okay this but I have spoken with Matt 
Goering here a few times about this and I believe he has been in contact with 
Pruett.  I will give Pruett a call and let him know where things stand but 
until I hear from Dave, I can't do anything.

Carol --

In talking to this customer, he said that he has not heard from anyone at 
Enron regarding this question.  Could you update me on this request?

Thanks,
Griff

Carol --

John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
contract.  
Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?

Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
