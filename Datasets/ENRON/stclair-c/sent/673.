Can you take a look at the product description that we have drafted in the 
next day or two and let me know how we can turn this into a confirm?
Thanks.

Attached please find Enron's draft version of the form of "swap agreement" 
for the Reliable Power Product.  The swap agreement is comprised of two 
components:  the Reliable Power Product Description and the General Terms and 
Conditions.  We look forward to receiving the revised draft of the policy and 
discussing your comments relating to the attached documents.



Regards,
