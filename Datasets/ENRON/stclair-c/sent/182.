FYI.  I spoke with Lisa Mellencamp about Donald yesterday and her contact had 
nothing bad to report about him from a work standpoint.  The only negative 
comment that she had was on a personal basis as she described him as being a 
"flirt" at the firm who on occassion has taken a liking to certain female 
employees at the firm.  Apparently, with one particular employee he was quite 
a pest.

Hi Carol:

How are you doing this beautiful morning. Thanks for the telephone call last 
night. I am thoroughly happy that you are still interested in me. I was 
hoping you would be. As I mentioned to Nedre Strambler, I have been wanting 
to work for Enron for quite some time. I believe that Enron is a top class 
organization.

With regard to references, I would appreciate it if you would not contact my 
present employer at this time, but in the alternative, contact my past 
employer for references.

My immediate supervisors with Star Enterprise were as follows:

1.    Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist  -
       (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND 
HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and

2.     Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist  -  (713) 241-1813.

In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron 
Job Application that I completed.

After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to 
speak to my current employer references, please advise.

Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing 
from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the "swaps and 
derivitives" group at ENRON!

Have a great day!

Don
