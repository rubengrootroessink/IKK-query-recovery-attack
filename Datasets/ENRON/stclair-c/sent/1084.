Thanks so much for the info.  I will contact Irma just in case and in the 
meantime, if you hear about someone that might be looking for a job, please 
let me know.  Thanks.

I am sure Irma has come up with a position by now, but I will give you her
name and number just in case.  It is Irma Navas, 713/838-7360.  She speaks
very limited english, so if you don't speak any Spanish that could be a bit
of a problem, although her daughter *(age 18) is bi-lingual.

If I hear of anyone else I will keep your name around.  I got my nanny thru
word of mouth -- seems like the a common way!

Sarah:
I am a friend of Trina Chandler's and am currently looking for a full time
nanny to take care of my 4 month old.  Trina mentioned to me that you had a
temp a few months ago that was looking for a full time position.  Do you
know if she is still available?  If so, please call me at home at
281-890-7122 or e-mail me.  If you know of anyone else that may be looking
for a job, please keep me in mind.  How did you find your nanny?
Carol
