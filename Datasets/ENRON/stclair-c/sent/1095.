Robin:
I misread your message the first time.  The dates that I gave you are the 
dates that are NOT good for me so any other date will work.  Can you and 
Carolyn pick a date that works for both Julia and Kristina and just let me 
know what you come up with?  Thanks.
Carol

Carol,

 At the moment she's available 12/7, 12/8 or 12/19.   Let me know this can 
change at any minute.   Hope you and all your "BOYS" are doing fine.

Carolyn and Robin:
I would like to take Julia and Kristina out to lunch for Christmas.  Could 
you please let me know which date would work best for both of them?  The 
following dates are not good for me:

12/5, 12/6, 12/7, 12/8, 12/19, 

Thanks.

Carol
