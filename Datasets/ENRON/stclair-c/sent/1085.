Sheila:
Thanks for offering to participate.  I will probably go ahead and get her the 
gift certificate from Urban Retreat.  I just need to hear back from Mary 
before I get it.  Looks like everyone else has already gotten her a gift.  
Things are going great here.  Charles is now a little over 4 months old and 
almost 16 lbs. and is doing great.  I'm sorry that I haven't been up there 
for a visit but hopefully someday soon before he goes off to college I will 
come up for a visit!  Hope that you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing 
you soon.  Also, we are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of someone 
or agency that you would trust please let me know.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day, but can be flexible on the hours 
because Bill will be here.  Take care and thanks again for the offer on 
Suzanne's gift.  If I do something different, I'll let you know.

I would be pleased to participate.  How about $50?  If you change your mind, 
please let me know.  How are you?  Any chance we'll ever get to see the baby?
