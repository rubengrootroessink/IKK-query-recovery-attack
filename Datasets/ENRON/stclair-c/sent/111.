Ms. Daley:
Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me your March 21st letter which responded to the 
Annex A letter that we sent to you.  I left Robert Schulten a voice mail 
message about this some time ago and have not heard from him.  Can you and I 
talk about this.  We have extended our launch date until May 1st.  Our 
records indicate that there is a financial trade with GE that was done in 
August, 1999.  My phone number is 713-853-3989.
Carol St. Clair
