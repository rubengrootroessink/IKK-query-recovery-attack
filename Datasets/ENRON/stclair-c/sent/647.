Rob:
Enclosed is what I think should be the final form of the Schedules.  I have 
made some clean-up chnages.  In the LC,. my notes indicate that we were going 
to keep the renewal language in.  Please let me know if this draft is okay 
with you and then we will coordinate getting it executed.  Thanks for your 
help.
Carol
