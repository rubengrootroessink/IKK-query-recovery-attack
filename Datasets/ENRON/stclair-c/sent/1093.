Carol,

 At the moment she's available 12/7, 12/8 or 12/19.   Let me know this can 
change at any minute.   Hope you and all your "BOYS" are doing fine.

Carolyn and Robin:
I would like to take Julia and Kristina out to lunch for Christmas.  Could 
you please let me know which date would work best for both of them?  The 
following dates are not good for me:

12/5, 12/6, 12/7, 12/8, 12/19, 

Thanks.

Carol
