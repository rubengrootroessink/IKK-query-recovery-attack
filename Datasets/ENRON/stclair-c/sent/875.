Carol,

I have been working with Mexican tax counsel regarding the online issues and 
received written advice from them yesterday, which I'll summarize and provide 
to all of you ASAP.  Best regards.

Jaime:
Here is a message that I received from our counsel.  Again, I and they are 
just focusing on the Enron Online issues and Sara is handling the issues 
relating to doing transactions offline between Enron Mexico and the Mexican 
counterparties.  I will suggest to our counsel that we have a call mid next 
week involving you, me and them.  What is your availability on Wednesday?  
Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we 
probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed 
with respect to the online and offline transactions?

 

Jeff:
Are there any tax issues that we need to be concerned about regarding the 
online piece of this?

Carol:

We are working on the questionaire, but we have been delayed. We will have an 
initial draft by the middle of next week.

Pablo and Jose:
Could one of you e-mail me with an update of how your review of the online
issues and documents is going and when we may be able to visit about your 
views
on these matters?  Thanks.
