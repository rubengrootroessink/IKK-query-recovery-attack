Carol,

I've reviewed the attached questionnaire and have the following comments:

1.  Section 5. --  I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a 
non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties 
where such countparties are "vetted" before trading commences.  It seems 
that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then 
such an offerings can be made.

2.  Section 9(c) -- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply 
to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant 
to certain financial derivative transactions.  In addition, a non-Mexican 
entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay 
Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.  (Please 
refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments 
pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided 
to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT 
tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such 
payments to Mexican tax.)  I have been working extensively with Mexican tax 
counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's "No" 
response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted 
through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).

Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.

Best regards.
