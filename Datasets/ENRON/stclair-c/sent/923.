Thanks.  I expect to get a new draft of the Schedules from DB later today.  
As for the crib, it is perfect and Bill and a friend managed to put it 
together.  Thanks so much for lending it to us.  I'm hoping that we will have 
a child to put in it within the next week.  As for Mexico, the issue there is 
that they do not recognize setoff in bankruptcy so that if deals are done 
with 2 different Enron counterparties we will not be able to setoff.

I will continue with this one, for as long as we can adapt to the time 
difference.  I will approve the A/A2 minimum requirement.

Did Bill get the crib together?

I don't know if you are still handling this.  We are close to getting this 
finalized.  One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.  
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2 
from Moody's.  We usually put A- and A3.  are you okay with this?  If I need 
to run this by someone else please let me know.
