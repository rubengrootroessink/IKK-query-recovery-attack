Rhonda and/or Christian:
Could someone revise the amendment that I sent around to amend these

The following deal confirmations do not contain the product definitions for 
SP-15 delivery (CAISO) and Palo Verde/Mid Columbia (West Firm)

226189 (SP15)
220051 (SP15)
220052 (SP15)
249547 (PV)
200536 (MidC)

Therefore, the amendment will need to contain the definition of CAISO Energy 
and West Firm Energy.

To Rhonda,

My bad...It looks like MEGA is assigning ALL of its physical power positions 
with EPMI to ENA.  The attached spreadsheet below has the options in the 
lower section, which should really be part of the "to be assigned" group.

To All,

Sorry for the confusion,

Wendy

Please find attached a spreadsheet which matches up the MEGA Deals with the 
EPMI deals to be assigned from MEGA to Morgan.  Please review deal numbers 
for accuracy and then review the confirms to ensure that all necessary West 
Product Definitions are either in the confirm.  If they are not in the 
confirm, they need to be identified in the amendment to the Master Agreement 
with Morgan.


Thanks,
Wendy
