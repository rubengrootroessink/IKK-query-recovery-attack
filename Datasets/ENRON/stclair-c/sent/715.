Yes, and I've assumed that she is coming.  I also invited Jason and asked him 
to get back to you.  Let's wait and see how large the group is and decide if 
we need to relocate if that is possible.  Might there be any conference rooms 
that are larger if we need it (like on 44)?  If not, we will make do but will 
need someone to bring us some extra chairs.

I left them a voice mail but assume "yes" for all of them.

Do the legal assistants know about it because it wasn't on Susan Bailey's 
calendar yesterday.  Isn't Tana on vacation?  I've heard from 2 people so 
far, Nidia and Paul.  I'll follow up a little later in the day.  Should I 
send an email to our Susan, Susan, Samantha & Tana?

Suzanne:
From our side it would be me, Sara and the 4 legal assistants.  This group 
needs to RSVP to you before we know how many are coming.

We are planning to hold another informal lunch this coming Friday in 
Conference Room 38C2 from 12-1:30 to go over in more depth how the ISDA 
Master and ISDA Credit Support Annex works.  If you are interested in 
attending, could you please contact my assistant, Suzanne Adams at 37340 
TODAY so that she can get a head count for lunch.  Thanks and sorry about the 
short notice.
