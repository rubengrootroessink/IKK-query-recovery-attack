Enclosed is Alan's response to the draft.

Do you know if Enron Corp is prepared to execute a similiar guarantee?

I believe that the introductory sections on liquids could be expanded to 
include, SO2 and NOx and other emission credit trading, coal, bandwidth and 
pulp, paper and other wood products trading.

I think this is a very good idea. I assume that Corp. will be willing to sign 
a reciprocal form of this Guaranty.

Yes, I believe coal, emissions, bandwidth and pulp & paper (?) should be 
added to the form in the "Transactions" paragraph as bracketed language that 
could be used as appropriate. Harry, I assume you will handle developing the 
language and submitting to Carol. 

Do you know if Corp. has signed off on the form yet?

Please find attached for your review and approval a new multi-commodity 
guaranty, which has been developed by Carol St. Clair. This new form would be 
used for power, gas and liquids transactions.

I believe that it could also be used for emissions and coal transactions

Jeff has already signed off on this new format.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.
