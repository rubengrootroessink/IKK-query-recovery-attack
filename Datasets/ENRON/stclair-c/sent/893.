Hello,

I need to send our format for incoming guaranty to some of my liquids 
customers.  The format does not need any power language.  Please let  me know 
if it is OK to take out the highlighted language from the format I will be 
using for the financial and physical liquids Gty.  (No master swap has been 
signed yet.)





Thanks,

Nidia

Mary:
Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.


Carol
