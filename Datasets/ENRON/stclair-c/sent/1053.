Suzanne:
Sorry I didn't call you last weekend.  How's everything at the office?  Is 
Julia back yet?  I wrote her a card and I hope that over the next few weeks 
and months she can grieve and at the same time get on with her life.  I 
really feel for her.  Keep me posted on how she's doing?  What have you and 
Ric been up to?  Charles and Arthur are doing great.  Bill's mom is here for 
a visit and we are having alot of fun.   I had lunch with Kristina last week 
and she updated me on the "Enron" happenings.  Seems like every week there is 
a major organizational announcement.  Where do you think Scott Sefton will 
end up?  She seemed to thing that he might take the compensation package that 
apparently was offerred to him.  It was good to talk to her and get back in 
touch with work.  I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.  
Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so 
Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.  i 
still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start 
discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.  It's hard to believe 
that I have been out for over 3 months.  time really does fly by.  

Give my best to everyone and write back when you can.  Did Stacy have her 
baby yet?
