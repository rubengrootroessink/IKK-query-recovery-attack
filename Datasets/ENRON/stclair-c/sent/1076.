Janette:
I met with Mark Taylor yesterday and he told me that I needed to meet with 
Mark to discuss my plans to return back to work in January.  Could you please 
check with Mark to see how he would prefer to meet (office, lunch, over the 
phone) and then call me at home (281-908-7122) so we can schedule something 
in the next few weeks.  Thanks.
