John:
I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points 
that I wanted him to confirm.  The only change that he raised was on the 
cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the 
Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.    I will send you a 
new mark up on that.  Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in 
your draft.
