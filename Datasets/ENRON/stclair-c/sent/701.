 An Enron entity will be Calculation Agent.  Do you have concerns
about Sections 2(c) and 7?  The latest draft is the June 9 draft, but we are
still commenting on it.

Jeff:
Has there been any discussion on our side with who the Calculation Agent
would
be?  Normally, it is one of the swap counterparties.  Is this a role that
Enron
Corp. can and should perform?  With respect to the Agreement, I am looking
at a
June 2nd draft and was wondering if anyone has focused on the language in
Section 2, and in particular, Section 2(c)  and Section 7.
