Jaime:
Thanks.  I spoke with Mark and he confirmed that we should do nothing until 
we have received and reviewed the memo from our counsel which hopefully we 
will get shortly and Mark and I will get on it right away.  Per your voice 
mail message, if we could include something in the cover letter to address 
our counsel's concern, that would be great.

Jaime:
when are you planning on sending this out?  I'm checking with Mark on this 
but I thought that we would wait until we had seen our counsel's memo before 
we would issue a press release or send these letters out.  Is that the plan?  
Given the ramifications of a press release, I want Mark's input on what it 
says and when it should be sent out.
Carol
