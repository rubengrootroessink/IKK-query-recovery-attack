Hello Carol,

I am ok with deleting this section entirely from the contract.  We have 
margin rights and the threshold is relatively low given the size and quality 
of this credit.

Thanks
Brant

There is one issue that is left to resolve.  In the CSA, we define 
independent amount as any amount specified for a party in any Confirmation or 
if no amount is specified, 0.  They wnat to either delete this entirely or 
add language requiring some type of notice to the credit dept. of the party 
that has to put up the independent amount before it becomes effective.  What 
do you want to do?
Carol
