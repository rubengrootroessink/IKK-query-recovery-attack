Pam:
We have an opening in our group for a legal assistant position.  Do you know 
of anyone over there that might be interested?  We would prefer someone with 
transactional experience.  Salary ranges vary depending upon experience, but 
I think we are pretty competitive.  If you know of anyone please have them 
call me as we are looking to fill this position ASAP.  Also, would it be 
possible for you and I to get together 1 more time for lunch before I leave?  
How does the week of July 10th look?
