Harry:
Thanks.  I am due to go on maternity leave in a few days so it is more likely 
that either Leslie Hansen or Mark Taylor will be handling this.    Any 
amendments to the PA or ETA will need to be cleared through Dave Forster.

Dear Carol:

Thank you for your time this afternoon.  I will fax the language that was 
sent by AK Steel.  Bill Berkeland in the Mid-Marketing group will be sending 
you an e-mail with the AK Steel legal contact.  If there is any other 
information that you need please contact me.

Thanks
