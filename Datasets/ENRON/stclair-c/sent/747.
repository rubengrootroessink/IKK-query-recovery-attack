We need your help on this language. Please see the below blue paragraphs,=

particularly "Common Pricing" clause. =20
London wants us to add this in our Dated vs IPE brent spreads. This allows=

the settlement of the deal to be based on only good business days for both=

indices. =20
We got the permission from our (ENA) trader to use the languange in the bel=

ENA-ECTInternational deals, but we are not sure about all other Dated vs IP=

brent deals.  Our trader has agreed to this because he has no position, but=

ECTInternational is going to want this clause in all similar spread deals. =

Please advise

Souad/Sheetal,

Do not revise these deals.  Show this language to our Crude guys.  We have=
=20
had a problem recently with the below.  The "Common Pricing" clause below=
=20
would mean that when IPE is closed then the price Platt's publishes that da=
y=20
would be void.  Our guys do not like that ideology.  Therefore, check with=
=20
them before doing this.  Also, we should get approval from legal before usi=
ng=20
the below.

Joe
