Anne:
I'm slightly embarrassed to be asking you this, but there was one gift from 
Baby Gap that we can't seem to figure out who the "giver" was, and we've 
narrowed it down to a group that includes you.  It was 2 outfits with animal 
patterns on it.  Are you the mystery giver?

Alos, again I just wanted to say congratulations again on your engagement.  I 
am really happy for you and Trushar and wish you all the best.  I will try to 
see if we can get together for lunch before I leave.

Carol
