Tanya:
Here is a summary of what has been agreed to with El Paso:

Cross Default Threshold - $100,000,000 for each of us.  They want this just 
to apply at the Credit Support provider level
Guaranty Cap - $55,000,000 for each of us
Collateral Threshold - $50,000,000; Rounding at $250,000.  No minimum 
transfer amount
Setoff may possibly still be open re affiliates but I think that they will 
come around on this
