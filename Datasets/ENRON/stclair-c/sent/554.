Jeff:
Thanks for your message.  I would make sure that Nora and/or Scott are okay 
generally with the concept of submission to jurisdiction.

Carol:

 We're still trying for the Enron preferred route of not submitting
to jurisdiction, but somehow the new language slipped in anyway.  If it does
have to stay, I'll double check to make sure it is the language that Enron
accepts when forced to submit to jurisdiction in NY.  I believe it is.

Jeff:
I am assuming that someone on the Enron Corp. side has signed off on the new
"jurisdiction" language that has now been inserted into the swap assignment
and
schedule as this language is a fairly radical change from what we had in
there
before.  Please confirm.
