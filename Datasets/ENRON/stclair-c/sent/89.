Mark and Sara:
David Runnells has come up with a lawyer from A&K to help us out.  His name 
is Jason Peters and he is coming over at 3:30 on Monday to meet with us.  
Shonnie and Peter D. have worked with him and Shonnie left me a voice mail 
telling me that he was very good.  Haven't heard from Peter yet.
