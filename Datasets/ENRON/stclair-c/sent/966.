If you don't want the flowers, call me and I'll come get them.  These people 
are paying tons of money for them and I don't want to see them go to waste.  
I'm by your house all the time.  I can just stand outside!  Susan Bailey is 
sending you something from that fancy flower store, I can't think of the name 
now.  Don't you dare throw that away, I'll rescue it.  Should I have them 
send chocolate instead?????????  I'll see what I can do if someone else 
calls.  Remember I'll be out tomorrow at the dentist.  I'm glad I can email 
you so I don't bother you calling.  I'll get your boxes to you this week and 
you aren't really getting much mail.

Suzanne:
Thanks.  Is there a polite way to discourage flowers?  Bill is allergic and 
we just end up throwing them out after a day or 2.  Cash and diaper donations 
are always acceptable!!! (just kidding).    We have been getting alot of 
stuff and I really appreciate it.  Thank you notes were sent to you by mail.  
On my mail, just collect it and send it out once a week.  Can you please send 
those 3 white boxes to me that are in my office at the end of this weeK?  
Bill did talk to his mother and I think persuaded her to wait a few weeks 
until I'm more mobile which I am hoping will occur in a week or so.  
Hopefully by next week I can be driving.  I'm not getting much sleep but I'm 
really enjoying this experience.  I think that Charles looks like Bill with 
my nose but I will let you be the judge when you see him which hopefully can 
happen in a week or so.  I'll keep in touch and thanks again for all that you 
have done.  Tell Ric I hope to see him at the club in a few weeks.

You should be getting lots of flowers and gifts because quite a few people 
have called for your address.  I see your email is working now.  How are 
things?  Did you talk to your mother-in-law?

It's been extremely quiet over here, but Susan Bailey is going crazy.  They 
must have given her what she wanted since she's still here.  No other news.

Good Morning,

She will get 8 weeks of sick pay. Please be sure that her time is coded as 
sick starting today.

Thanks

Michele, Carol had her baby last night and had to have a csection.  Does this 
add time to her maternity leave?  What about the other 26 weeks that we are 
given for illness.  She can't use them?  Suzanne (Carol's assistant)

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark
