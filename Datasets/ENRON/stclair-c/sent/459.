Susan:
Could you please when you return on Monday circulate a list of issues that we 
need to discuss regarding the forms?  Susan Flynn was keeping track of some 
of those issues after you left.   I would like to try to get those issues 
addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can 
turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.  Thanks.
