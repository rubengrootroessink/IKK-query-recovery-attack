Dave:
I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our 
exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with 
this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around 
this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online.

Carol,

- Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland?
- What is our exposure to Federal Law?

David:
Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above 
counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA 
is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.
