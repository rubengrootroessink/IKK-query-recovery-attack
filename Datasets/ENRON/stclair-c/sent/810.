> process of negotiating with Equitable Energy.  The financial partners that
> will be involved in this deal have agreed upon this ISDA schedule so I
> think it may be best if you try to edit our version of the ISDA.  Please
> see the changes on the schedule A to the ISDA.  Please replace this
> schedule with the earlier draft of the schedule A to the ISDA that I sent
