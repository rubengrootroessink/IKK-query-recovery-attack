		 Subject: Deposit Correction

A payment test file was sent to the bank in error and, as a result, a deposit 
was posted on Monday, July 10, 2000.  This impacts only employees who utilize 
direct deposits (ACH) and are paid semi-monthly.

To correct this situation, on Tuesday, July 11, 2000 a withdrawal of the 
amount deposited will be processed.  Your bank may not post this transaction 
until Wednesday, July 12, 2000.

If you have any questions, please call (713) 345-5555.  We apologize for any 
inconvenience.
