It would help if in whatever you send to her today that Enron preserves its 
right to call for margin in the future pursuant to the terms of the agreement
 taht we have with them and that by cancelling the margin call we in no way 
waive our right to make future calls.

Carol:

I called Ferrellgas for Margin yesterday, 6/15, for COB 6/14.  However, 
today's MTM is under the threshold, thus no longer resulting in the need for 
Margin.  I spoke with Erin Hamilton at Ferrellgas and she requested 
confirmation, using today's MTM, that the previous Margin call should be 
cancelled.  Should there be any specific language used in a cancellation 
confirmation about reserving the right to call for Margin in the future, even 
though we will cancel the Margin call for COB 6/14?  Please let me know your 
thoughts.

Thank you,
