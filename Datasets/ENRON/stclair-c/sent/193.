Cynthia:
Thanks for sending this.  Just 2 questions:

1. In Section 7 of Annex 1 could we please add the recording language?

2. I understand from our folks that most notices are provided over the phone 
and not necessarily followed up in writing and that this is the practice.  
Can we provide for that in Section 13 of the Agreement?

Carol
