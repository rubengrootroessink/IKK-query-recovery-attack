Thanks.  If there is some discreet way to check with Mark, Anne, Tana and 
Mary about this I would really appreciate it.  I'm guessing that the gift 
came from Anne.  Again, it was from Baby Gift on University Blvd. and it was 
2 one piece outfits - 1 with an Elephant/Turtle/Bear design and 1 with a 
Monkey design.  Thanks for your help.
Carol

Carol,

None of the attendees you mentioned participated in the group gift.  If you 
need help finding who the gift was from, let me know and I will do some 
checking.

Carolyn
