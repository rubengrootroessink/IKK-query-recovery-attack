Carol,

We are fine with proposed amendment, item (2) in the June 14, 2000 letter.
I don't understand the purpose for the increase to $10 million proposed in
item (1).  Is this based on current business or some internal credit policy?
My records show, with the exception of June, ESI is in a net sell position
pretty much through the term of the Guaranty.

Please advise and provide your detail if you show otherwise.
