Carol:  I received your voice mail this afternoon and it looks like we just 
need to wait for the documents to role in and then try to review them ASAP.  
In the meantime, would you please add Sam Berins in our Washington DC office 
and John McGreevy here in New York to the distribution/working group list.  
Their email addresses are sberins@llgm.com and jmcgreevy@llgm.com.  Best 
regards.
