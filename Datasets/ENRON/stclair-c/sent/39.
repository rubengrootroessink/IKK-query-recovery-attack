David:
Thanks for your e-mail.  With respect to one of your points, we have in the 
past agreed to modify Section 4(b) of the ETA by adding the following at the 
end:  "unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or 
omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or 
contrcators.''  Alos, with respect to the Deemed ISDA issue, for ENA or ECC 
trades, we do not consider the Deemed ISDA to constitute a "Master Agreement" 
and our deemed ISDA counterparties are required to accept the GTC's before 
trading.  Are the rules different in Australia?
Carol
