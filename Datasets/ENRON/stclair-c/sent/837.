Bill:
Could you please forward this to the business folks at Ace since this is a 
critical point and I don't want them caught by surprise tomorrow.  Thanks.
Carol

Rick:  In addition to the comments on the mark-up of the policy I faxed to 
you yesterday, please note that the reference to the "Approved Transaction 
Counterparty" contained in Section 6.1(a) should be deleted as that issue is 
now addressed in the revised text of the Force Majeure definition.  Best 
regards.
