Joe:
I think that Tana is right.  I guess that if we do a telephone trade and use 
the ECC Canada Annex A then we need to make the same modifications to that.  
Is that correct?  Have they requested any modifications to the online GTC?

Carol,

We've had some issues lately with EnronOnline deals and Puget Sound.  Should 
this entity always be booked with ECC?  Currently, depending on the index 
traded, it downloads into Trade Capture as either ENA or ECC.  In speaking 
with Tana the other day we had decided that whichever Enron entity downloads 
is the one we should confirm the deal under.

thanks,
Joe
