Mark:
Who should handle this?  Given my situation, I would prefer not to take this 
on and I have talked to Seth about my situation.  Please let me know what you 
think.  Would this be something that Lou Stoler would work on with our help?

Carol, I'd like to speak with you regarding the following structure proposed 
by Sorema, which address the fact that they can't sell/buy derivatives and 
can't reinsure any contract governed by NY law.  The credit issue 
remains--they propose solving it by means of an assignment clause.

Sorema did six deals with us last year using Palladium.
