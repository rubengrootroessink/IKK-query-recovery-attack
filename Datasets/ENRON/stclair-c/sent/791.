Carol,
I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we did a while back with 
Aquila that encompassed multiple deals. I have also attached our deal count 
for the last year and a half in case you were interested in the increase in 
the number of deals.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jarrod
