Carol, 
The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial 
customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern 
California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a 
price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to do 
an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA 
background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with the 
City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us 
in this manner?  ----cgy
