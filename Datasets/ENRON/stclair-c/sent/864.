Carol,

In response to the comments PanCanadian has with out ISDA;

1)  I can live with excluding obligations with Affilates, if it is defined 
this way in the Canadian Master.  Although I would like to know your thoughts 
on this.

2) The Minimum Transfer amount must remain ar $1.00

3) I can agree to the rounding of $100,000 for both counterparty's.

4) I will agree to the L/C Bank to be either a major US or Canadian Bank.

5) I can not remove the current ratio trigger, this company is a marketing 
company with large current assets and liabilities and this is a way to 
monitor the company's balance of receivables to payables.

Please call with questions

Russell

Russell:
Here are the credit related comments that Pancanadian Energy Services Inc. 
made 

1. They want the definition of Specified Indebtedness to exclude obligations 
with Affiliates.  This is how it is defined in the Canadian Master.

2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount for each of us of $100,000.

3. They want rounding to be reduced to $100,000 for each of us.

4. In the definition of Letter of Credit, they want the LC Bank to either be 
a major US or Canadian Bank, but not a foreign bank with a US branch office.

5. In the definition of Material Adverse Change, they want to delete the 
Current assets/Current Liabilities ratio trigger.

Carol
