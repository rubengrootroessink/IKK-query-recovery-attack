Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA 
Schedule.  With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the 
original language.  We view the "credit rating" language as a one time 
exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent 
transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.  Can we set up 
a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?  Let me 
know some times this week that work for you.  Thanks.
