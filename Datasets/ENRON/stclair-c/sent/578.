Paul:
Did you mean to refer to dates in June?  Alos, could you let me know which 
persons or persons will be handling the areas that we need covered as so far 
I am only aware of you and Scott and i wasn't sure if others would be 
involved.  Thanks.
Carol

I will be away from the office on business from the evening of Friday, May 
12th, returning on Monday, May 22nd.  During this period, I will not have 
email access for a portion of the trip and there may, therefore, be a delay 
in my responding to emails sent during this period.
