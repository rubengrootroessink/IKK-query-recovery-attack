Mark:
I wanted to let you know that I did meet with Mark Haedicke last week to 
discuss my work situation, and in particular, coming back on a part-time 
basis sometime in January.  I think that he was okay with what I proposed, 
which is to work approx. 30 hours a week on a 4 day week.  I would like your 
input on which day you would prefer I take off, as my initial thought was 
Friday, but I'm open to suggestion on that.  I think that the next step is 
for the 3 of us to meet to discuss what my role in the group will be, and in 
particular, what work areas I will be responsible for.  I will try to set 
something up in the next few weeks.  I alos had lunch with Mary and Sara and 
was encouraged with what I heard from them.  We talked about the possibility 
of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, 
work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.  What do you 
think about that idea?  As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some 
direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group 
and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it 
seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what 
work is in order.  Let me know what you think.  Take care.

Carol
