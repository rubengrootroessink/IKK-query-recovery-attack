Suzanne:
Thanks for the message.  I don't think there is any way that we will get 100% 
pay on all 8 weeks so let's just go with the 100/90 split.  you may want to 
ask michelle how best to code it with my vacation time so that they get it 
right the first time.    as for charles, he is doing great.  i'm typing all 
small letters now because he is insisting on me holding him, but i'm learning 
how to do more than 1 thing at a time.  he is a night owl so i try to sleep 
some in the afternoon and so far so good.  i'm learning how to exist on 
little sleep.  it is a big help to have bill at home and while charles 
sleeps, we get alot done as there are still some house things that we need to 
finish.

tell dan happy birthday and as for yours, i'll catch up as soon as i become 
more portable which should be soon.  as for flower pick-up, feel free to stop 
by after work whenever.  just call and let me know.  i've got 2 baskets that 
will probably only survive here another day or so so you are welcome to them 
and you can sneak a peek at charles at the same time.  

well i've got to go.  i'll talk/see you soon.

carol

ps - if anyone has some astros tickets for this weekend let me know as bill 
and arthur may want to go.

Well, I survived the dentist (7 hours in the chair),  Of course I started my 
period too, so I had cramps a backache and headache and my mouth open all 
going on at the same time.  It was NOT fun at all, but I made it through. 
It's nice to know the worst is over.  My temporaries look pretty good too.  I 
still have to go by the lab and do a couple of other things, but my permanent 
teeth should be put in on August 18th.  I'm just going to take the day too 
because lord only knows how long it'll take!  Then I'm finished until next 
year!  Whew!

I'll figure up 4 weeks of sick time and then I'll do your vacation and then 
do 4 more weeks of sick time.  I emailed Michelle Word from your email if the 
8 weeks were all 100% paid, so if you get that email, be sure and let me know 
what she says.  I'm trying to get you 8 weeks at 100% pay.  

It's pretty quiet around here so far today.  Dan's birthday is next Monday 
and we are going to take him to lunch and I'm getting him cigars (of 
course).  Mine is also coming up so Ric is going to take me to Pappas 
Steakhouse.  I've never been there and have been wanting to go.  He's already 
made the reservations and everything.  I can't believe I'm going to be 
45!!!!!!!  My body feels every year though!

How are you adjusting?  Charles sleeping any longer?  Keep in touch.  Oh, I 
received the thank you cards and will distribute them.  Thank you for the 
nice one to me.
