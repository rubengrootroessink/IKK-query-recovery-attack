That would be great!  I'll let you decide what to order but except for water, 
don't worry about me.  Thanks.

Will you want drinks and snacks since it's going to be rather long?

There will be a conference call on Monday June 5th starting at 1:00 (Houston) 
time to discuss comments to the draft insurance policy that we expect to 
receive from ACE tomorrow.  My assistant, Suzanne Adams (713-853-3989) will 
notify the Enron people of the conference room and will notify the LeBeouf
