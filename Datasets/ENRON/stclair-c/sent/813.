Guys:
Here is where I understand Bill came out on the 6.1(a) issue that we were 
discussing.  ACE agreed to insert language that would carve out "publicly 
available" information, but with respect to all other information that would 
be covered by 6.1(a) and the Right of Recovery section, they would not agree 
to limit the Enron group.
