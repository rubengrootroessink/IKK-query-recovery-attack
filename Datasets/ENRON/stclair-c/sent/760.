Joe;
Per our conversation, here is the scoop on Oneok.  By the way, Sara resolved 
the IPE Brent issues so we don't need to talk.

Susan and Susan:
Could one of you send out a notice concerning the following and update lotus 
notes:

1. Oneok Gas Marketing Company has changed its name to Oneok Energy Marketing 
and Trading Company, II ("Oneok II").

2. K N Marketing, L.P. is now known as Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading 
Company, L.P. ("Oneok LP") 

We have Masters with both of these entities.


I have sent to Oneok a Transfer and Termination Agreement where the following 
will occur once it becomes effective:

1. Onoek II will assign all of its trades and its rights under its Master to 
Oneok LP.

2. The Oneok LP Master will be terminated and all trades will be under the 
Oneok II Master.

In summary, once this becomes effective, all trades will be done with Oneok 
LP under the Oneok II Master that was assigned to it.  Credit Support comes 
from the parent Onoek Inc.

Enclosed is a draft of the Agreement.


Carol
