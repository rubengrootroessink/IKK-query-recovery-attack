Kristina:
I'm thrilled that you are coming.  I'll e-mail you directions soon and I 
can't wait to see you.  I'm doing well.  Believe it or not, I'm playing alot 
of tennis (word spread at our club that i was home during the day) and with 
Bill home we pretty much just "tag- team" it with Charles  and the club 
provides babysitting services which we sometimes use.  This has been a great 
outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time.  
Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively.  
I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.  As for Charles, 
he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.  I have stopped 
breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better 
particularly at night.  He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm 
starting to get more sleep which is nice.

Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.  Bill is usually here 
and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.  I've thought about 
coming up to the office a few times but  with Bill's schedule, Arthur's 
tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.  Hopefully I'll 
get up there soon although I must sound like a broken record by now.  Hope 
you are doing well and I look forward to seeing you soon, as well as having 
you meet my parents and sister and of course see Charles again.  Talk to you 
soon.

Carol- Just got the invitation- had been wondering how you were doing.  I 
plan on attending.  Could I trouble you for directions??

Call just to let me know how you are doing... I am leary of calling the house 
b/c you may have just gotten Charles or yourself down for a nap and the phone 
rings!
