Randy:
We are still discussing internally the time period that should be specified 
in the definition of Credit Support Provider.  We are not comfortable with 
specifying October 2002 as the date.  What is the reason for this?  We are 
trying to make this language as transaction specific as possible.  Is there 
anything else that we can add to it to make it more precise?  Please call me 
in the morning.  I'm in by 8:30.  Thanks.
