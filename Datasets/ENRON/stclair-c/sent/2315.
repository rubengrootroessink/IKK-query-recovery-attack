Morris,

My comments on the Master Steel Agreement are as follows:

1.   Section 3.7 - The Taxes arising at the Delivery Point should be the=20
responsibility of the Buyer rather than Seller (i.e., Seller should be=20
responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising upstream of the Delivery Point and Buyer should be=
=20
responsible for all Taxes applicable to the Commodity being sold under the=
=20
Master Agreement arising at and downstream of the Delivery Point).

2.   Section 3.7 - The phrase "within [___] days" should be added immediate=
ly=20
before the comma in the sentence beginning "[i]f Buyer and Seller are unabl=
e=20
to reach mutual agreement...."

3.   Section 3.7 - The following sentence should be inserted before the=20
sentence beginning "If either party is exempt from Taxes...":

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party is not liable for any applicable Tax=
es=20
that are legally imposed on the other Party and that are refundable to the=
=20
other Party, including without limitation value added or goods and services=
=20
taxes.

4.   Section 9 - The following sentence should be added to the definition o=
f=20
Delivery Point:

For purposes of  transactions involving an Option on the Commodity, the=20
Delivery Point shall be defined to mean the date of delivery to the Buyer o=
f=20
written confirmation of the purchase and sale of the Option, which date sha=
ll=20
be in all cases not earlier than one day following the day of acceptance of=
=20
the Counterparty=01,s offer.

5.   Section 9 - The phrase "goods and services taxes," should be added to=
=20
the definition of New Taxes immediately after the phrase "value added taxes=
,".

6.   Section 9 - The words "value added, goods and services," should be add=
ed=20
to the definition of Taxes immediately after the word "use,".

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

Susan,

Can you please take a look at the attached steel master agreement  and=20
provide any additional language that you think is necessary (I imagine it=
=20
should work similar to the paper and pulp master that we discussed).  My=20
concern with the steel master is twofold: (i) it will be used for=20
international counterparties; and (ii) the treatment of options in many=20
foreign jurisdictions.  Thanks for your help.

MRC
