Dave:
Richard Sanders , our litigation manager, was okay with this since this just 
defines the location of the arbitration, not necessarily who gets selected.  
With respect to your second question, I will talk to Mark about it and get 
back to you.

Carol,

- Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland?
- What is our exposure to Federal Law?

David:
Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above 
counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA 
is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.
