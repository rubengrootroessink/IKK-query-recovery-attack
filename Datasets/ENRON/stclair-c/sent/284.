Subject: Update on Duke Energy

We currently have the following outstanding confirmations with Duke:

1. Duke Energy Marketing Ltd. Partnership (Canada)    601 confirmations

We were delayed in calling this c/p because ECC was forwarding an 'approved'
list of c/p for us to contact. Duke is on the 'approved' list.

I faxed a list of outstanding confirms to Manolo recently, and am calling him 
today to follow-up.
Manolo Martinez may be contacted at 403-297-9889.

2. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing (Houston) 321 confirmations

Theresa Copeland has been my contact at 713-260-8540.
In late 99/early 00, she said that an arrangement was made with Diane Swiber 
whereby Duke didn't need to sign or send confirmations back to us, but the 321
above represents financial deals only.

Theresa said that if there are any discrepancies with any confirmations, that 
Duke is able
to mark any changes on the confirmations, and fax these back to us within 48 
hours,

If you would, briefly discuss your history with Duke,
