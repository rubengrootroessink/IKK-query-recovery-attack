Mr. Dever:
Jeff Sorenson forwarded to me the March 21 letter that you sent to him in 
response to our Annex A letter.  Your letter refers to chnages that we have 
previously agreed to.  I pulled the latest confirm that we entered into with 
your company and didn't see any chnages.  Could you please call me to 
discuss?  My number is 713-853-3989.
Carol
