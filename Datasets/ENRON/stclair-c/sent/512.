Hello Parents!

Camp is about to begin!  Are you ready?  Well, we are, and we're excited 
about it!!!  Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions 
you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer 
camp.

Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must 
bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the 
latest) each morning.  You do not need visitor badges for your children.  
Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each 
morning.  We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with 
the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.    
When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated 
elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.  Kidventure camp counselors 
will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning 
until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4 
p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you 
pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.  All children MUST be picked up by 5 
p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.

At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your 
balance to Kidventure Camps.  Your children will also receive their official 
camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.  You may purchase additional t-shirts 
for $10.00 each.  Each child will also make a name tag on their first day 
which they will use for their camp term.  

Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them 
by tomorrow. Thanks!

Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at 
x37514 or e-mail me.
Thank you and have a great summer!
