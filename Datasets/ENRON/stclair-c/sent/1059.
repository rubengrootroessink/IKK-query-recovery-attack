That works for me.  I might try to call you next week just to catch up a 
little.  Take care.

Carol:

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to 
have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and 
the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on 
(EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the 
group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but 
things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.

Mark
