regarding their desire to sign up on EnronOnline.  GPU Utilitiues is the 
parent  corp that has 3 operating subs under it (Metropolitan Edison Company, 
Pennsylvania Electric Company and Jersey Central Power & Light).  He 
mentioned that there is some type of Services Agreement bewteen EPMI and GPU 
Services Corp.  He wants to know which legal entity should be on the omline 
application.  Can you help?
