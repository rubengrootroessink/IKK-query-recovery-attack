Ladies:
I just wanted to thank you again for your thoughtfulness, support  and hard 
work in making today such a special event for me and Charles Eugene!  As I 
said at the shower, I'm lucky to have people like you as friends and 
co-workers and each of you throughout the last year has helped me get through 
this pregnancy and the events leading up to it, for which I am extremely 
grateful.  I am truly overwhelmed by everyone's generosity and look forward 
to finally putting all of my gifts to good use in the upcoming weeks.  
Carol
