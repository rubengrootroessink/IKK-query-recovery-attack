Rod:
Thanks for the info.  Our family doctor has recommended someone close by so 
we'll give him a try.  Hang in there on the moving details.  I know that 
things will settle down soon.  Things are great here.  Charles Eugene seems 
to be adjusting well and we are really enjoying him.  He'll be in his crib in 
a few weeks.  As for the swap group, yes they are thin but they appear to be 
hanging in there.  I spoke with Mark yesterday.  When I left, Sara was in 
London taking care of her mom who became very ill while ahe was over there.  
She is fine now and Sara is back but Mark pretty much had to handle things on 
his own for a few days.  He appears to have survived.  we just hired Susan 
Flynn's replacement so hopefully by the end of August the LA's will be back 
at full strength which will help out alot.  Take care and keep in touch.  You 
may be getting some e-mails from Mary Cook about some of my files which she 
has now inherited.

We used a pediatrician in Tomball, Dr. Carr.  Dawn liked him quite well (and 
I did too), but it's a bit of a drive.  I could ask my wife for other names?

I'm pulling my hair out with moving details - bank accounts, leases, 
shipments, tax forms ...  Sara tells me legal is pretty thin these days.  
Credit is the same in Houston.  Tracey is moving to Portland, Christopher 
left and John is moving to the Market Risk Group.  I got out just in time.
