Russell:
Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.  Since we are still 
confirming deals under ARMS, does the effective date on the Transfer and 
Termination Agreement work?  I want to make sure that it covers all trades 
that have been confirmed with ARMS until we start confirming with Utilicorp.  
Please advise.
Carol

Carol,

Not yet.  The master agreement documents were sent out by FED EX on Monday, 
May 8th.

As for the effective date of the (a) Master Agreement and (b) Transfer and 
Termination Agreement, both documents were given an effective date of May 3, 
2000.

Susan:
Has this Master been executed?  I forgot what we specified as the effective 
date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make 
absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by 
ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective 
date of our Master.  Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the 
Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.  
Thanks.
Carol
