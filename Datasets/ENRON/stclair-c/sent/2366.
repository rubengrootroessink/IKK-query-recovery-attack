Tracy:
There was some confusion still on my part as to what type of transaction you 
were looking to do with Kaiser and with which entity.  Could you please send 
me an e-mail with a description.  You may recall that we have an ISDA in 
place between Kaiser and ENA as well as a Master Swap Agreement between 
Kaiser and an affiliate of ENA for aluminum products.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner Carol.  Greg Wolfe was out on 
paternal leave (he and his wife just had a baby...Annika) and therefore, I 
was unable to get the continued green light from Greg.  Just spoke with Greg, 
and he would still like for legal to pursue w/UK legal.

Thanks,
Tracy

Tracy and/or Rod:
Just curious about what happened to the proposed trade that we were going to 
do with Kaiser.  Is there anything that the lawyers need to do at this point?
