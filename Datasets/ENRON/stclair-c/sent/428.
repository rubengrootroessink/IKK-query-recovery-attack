Rob:
I'll do my best to get back to you tomorrow although I still have not heard 
from my credit person.  Other than the credit issue, I do want to talk to you 
about the following:

1. Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)(c).  If we have to choose 
between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much 
rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.

2. In the new language that you added in the "Recording" section, I don't 
think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make 
it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is 
made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.  Also, at the very 
beginning where it says "that originates from and" the word "and" needs to be 
"or" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is 
not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.

3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word "herein" 
to "this Agreement" and please change the last reference to "the Existing 
Transactions" to "this Agreement" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.

4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change 
the word "either" to "both" and the word "or" to "and", as I thought this is 
what we agreed to.

5. In the form of LC, our credit group has asked us to add language that 
amends Section 13(b) of the UCP to shorten the time frame from 7 to 3 days 
and I will fax that to you.

I will be tied up until late morning but otherwise available.

Carol

Thanks Susan  - I'll include the wire transfer information that you sent.

Carol/Susan  - I will be leaving on vacation Thursday PM. If possible I'd
like to wrap up this agreement and get it signed before I leave. We don't
seem to have much left. Please get back to me when you can.

Thanks

Rob Rieth
