Molly:
Here is a draft letter for Statoil.  Under the Master, they have a 1 Business 
Day cure period after they receive notice from us of their failure to post 
collateral before we can declare an event of Default.  Please call me to 
discuss after you have had a chance to decide what you want to do.
Carol
