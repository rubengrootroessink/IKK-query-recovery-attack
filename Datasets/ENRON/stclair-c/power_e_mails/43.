Wendy:
Looks like we sent them a draft EEI Cover Sheet earlier this year.  

Genia, Can you e-mail that draft to Wendy?

Carol,

I think we would like to push for an EEI with Morgan.  I will send up a 
credit worksheet ASAP.

Wendy

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

Wendy:
Have you had a chance to take a look at this and if so, do you have any 
credit issues with this assignment?
