Carol and Chris,
I'm not sure Sharon knows what she is doing.  If we accept her blacklined 
changes, it seems to me we go back to the original EEI language about 
penalties which we like.  Perhaps we should just try this. The drafting 
technique she wants to use does not get her where she thinks it does.

If and when her attorney reads this thing, the issue will be:  do we remain 
silent about penalties, or do we go into more detail?  We want to go into 
more detail if they cannot accept the standard language. 

Our choice seems to be:  1. Tell her we accept her change and sign the cover 
sheet and try to blow it by them, or 2. open the can of worms of more detail 
and get it over with.   Let's discuss this.   ----cgy

Chris, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it 
could expedite the approval process.  I have attached the language we propose 
which basically deletes the specific language regarding penalty for 
replacement and sale prices (see section 1.a (1) and (2)in the attached).  I 
wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the 
other one. THX

Sharon: 

As indicated by my previous e-mail to you, since Shari Stack has left 
Enron, it will take me a couple days to resurrect this EEI.  Later today it 
is likely I will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we 
sent.  Subsequently, I will get you a clear statement as to alternative 
language that leaves the Replacement Cost definition less clear ala WSPP. 

Thanks 

Chris

   The attached draft EEI Cover Sheet contains the latest amendments to the 
   Replacement Price/Sales Price definitions. The changes are blacklined - 
   everything else has remained the same.
