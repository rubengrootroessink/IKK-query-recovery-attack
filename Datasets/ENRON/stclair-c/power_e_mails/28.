The last issue on the listed deals is 586665.  Amy Clemons paid Merrill b/c 
they said it was their deal and Jim T. was incorrect.  I think everything 
else is settled on these deals.  Of course, Joy Werner is still getting 
feedback from Allegheny indicating they do not see some of the deals that 
were transferred in the big transfer.  I sent her the spreadsheet and she 
will forward the list of physical deals that transferred to Allegheny's 
settlements person.  Why can't everyone be as efficient as Enron?  We are the 
best evil empire.
