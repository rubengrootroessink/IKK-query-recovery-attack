Gerald, here is some language that we have used in the past. I have adjusted it to reflect ENA. If there are any other changes, please do so. Otherwise, Sandy is will attach this to a file we are sending out with some historical numbers. 

Pls note: IF there are any changes, copy me on them and I will update my file.
