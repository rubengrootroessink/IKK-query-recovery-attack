Glad to hear about the vegas grouping.  Rumor has it that you and i are bunking together... John thought you might want to share a king bed but until we get to know each other better, we should get two queens.  Can you look after getting us a room.  I have not stayed at the belagio, should be nice.  I will call you sometime tues.  See you on friday around 6:00 pm.
