Mark, In my discussions with Lavorato, he has asked us to provide a summary/outline of the business operations of each of the co's that we have syndicated this capacity with. 

Set up your summary that includes, Co. Name, Principal, primary business, dealings history ( if any ), number of employees, contact name of deal maker. 

Cannon, Patina, FMI Weld, Huber,Misaka

Don't spend too much time with this, but a little history on each co. is what John wants for his review. 

Thanks, BT
