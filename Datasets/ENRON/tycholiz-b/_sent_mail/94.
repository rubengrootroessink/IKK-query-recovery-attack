Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North
America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these
transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these
transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the
transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day
of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which
would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load
factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what
physically flowed.

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

Barry  Tycholiz
Vice President, Enron North America
