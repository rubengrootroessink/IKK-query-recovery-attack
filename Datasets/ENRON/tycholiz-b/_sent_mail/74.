Kim, I think this is the form you need to complete. Can you download and print... I have also made a hard copy of this and will bring it home tonight.

Just go in and click on this web site.. and then print this form off on our computer. You can access as follows.

www.irs.gov
then click on forms
then go to form 1099 W-7.. this should be it.
