Jim, good to hear from you.  Glad to hear that everything is going OK.  My transition down to Houston has all in all gone pretty good.  We settled in pretty quick at home and Kim is being quite a trooper regarding her home life although I know she misses outside interaction. She may be able to work soon so this should help keep her busy. 

Work has been exiting, the West US markets have provided good opportunities to me and I am slowly making my way to meet the customers.  I could easily spend every day on the road. 

I have loved the winter.. hilight has to be no snow to shovell... but I will pay the price for the summer because you can't do anything when it is a 100 degrees.  

Better run,.... drop me a line sometime... and if you are ever getting your way down this way, call first, we will get together.

BT
