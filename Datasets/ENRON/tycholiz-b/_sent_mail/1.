Dorie, Laura... can I get together with you guys for a few minutes to discuss some customer offsite alternatives, Our group is in the early stages of planning a function with invited guests ( 10 guests, 6 staff).  

I am interested in locations ( recomendations ), your roles and responsibilities in pulling this together, total cost ( value ) timelines. 

pls give me a call. Thanks, BT
