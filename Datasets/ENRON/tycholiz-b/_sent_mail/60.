Marg, you had co-ordinated for me the L1-A visa I acquired to move from Canada to Houston. 

I need a lawyer to assist in the preparation and filing of a Visa for my spouse. She has been advised to pursue a visa called "TN" which would allow her to work as a registered nurse. Apparently under the US - Canada free trade agreement, she can acquire this visa which is supposed to be low cost and easy to get.   

Can you advise as to the best route to get this underway. 

Thanks, Barry Tycholiz
