Tanya, here are the draft confirms that we have negotiated with Sierra. I am also going to add some specific language regarding delivery point and pro-rata cuts.. and you guys need to work with gerald and put in netting / set off language that you feel protects our interests. 

As an aside, I talked to the commercial person at Sierra and advised them that we will be amending this draft again to incorporate Netting provisions and she advised me that that would not be a problem. 

Thanks.  BT
