Stephanie

We are still interested, just reviewing our plans. We do have some studies
to finish before we could make an offer.  When we first talked, you did
mention that you are willing to make a payment of the difference between the
tariff and what we agree would be the market for the transportation. I am
assuming that this is still the case.
