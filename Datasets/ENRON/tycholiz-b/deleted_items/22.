Dear Sir,

As per Mr. Ed McMichael's kind recommendation, I would very much appreciate the chance to discuss an opportunity to rotate into your group in December.  To that end, please note that I have attached my resume below and am free to meet at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks!
Vikram Singh
