Dynegy vs. Enron:
A "Tale of Two Companies" =20
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, repo=
rting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share=
, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in =
2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the c=
ompany's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.=
5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week =
high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the co=
mpany's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 com=
panies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778=
 people. =20
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quart=
er, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its no=
n-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-=
offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, an=
d revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000.=
 Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently=
 trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company an=
d is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron empl=
oys 20,600 people. =20
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be o=
n a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an=
 unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, =
characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the comp=
any's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same mark=
et space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the=
 younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story whil=
e Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in=
 this article are: What is Dynegy doing "right"? What is Enron doing "wrong=
"? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this "=
tale of two companies"?=20
Although they are often referred to as "cross-town rivals," Dynegy and Enro=
n are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent=
 approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-m=
ost important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 20=
01. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, an=
d-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strateg=
y is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on =
two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key =
areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to whi=
ch the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors.=20
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the =
power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similar=
ities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decid=
edly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary,=
 let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs t=
o own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading =
sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of ph=
ysical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the compa=
ny as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry. =20
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it =
is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficul=
t to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates comm=
odity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The=
 participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does n=
ot necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routi=
nely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wh=
olesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philos=
ophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell th=
e commodities it needs to participate in trading venues. =20
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of genera=
tion and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch =
its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled i=
n that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale o=
f Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewi=
se in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enro=
n has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, u=
nlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generati=
ng units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its m=
ost recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, En=
ron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint owner=
ships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies o=
perating in the power trading sector. =20
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different fr=
om Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, "Dynegy's long-term strategy =
is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports=
 earnings sustainability." Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been=
 on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its g=
eneration capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of =
generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,0=
00 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive area=
s. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the =
U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired ass=
ets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just =
as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy a=
cquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating ca=
pacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, wher=
e it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in En=
gland. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best w=
ay to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the=
 approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the t=
hird quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale bus=
iness. =20
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference be=
tween Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It i=
s not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning phys=
ical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the cour=
se of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and=
 anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actu=
al output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a=
 trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be=
 in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load a=
nd when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on in=
frastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market=
 unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By t=
he same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have g=
reater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (=
the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson=
 fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around t=
he volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shorta=
ges exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomp=
lish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in=
 power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and =
power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities.=20
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's appro=
ach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly,=
 by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital o=
n the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when ma=
rket prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy=
 capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an as=
set-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixe=
d payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find th=
at their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilit=
ies in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasin=
gly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential conce=
rn for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establ=
ishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell r=
equirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What E=
nron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being=
 tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own po=
rtfolio.=20
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the "g=
reat debate" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall perfor=
mance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessari=
ly provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new ge=
neration facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily=
 from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband a=
nd water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trad=
ing business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay ha=
s been quick to reiterate to investors. "Our 26-percent increase in recurri=
ng earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core who=
lesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines," Lay sai=
d. "The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leadi=
ng market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."=
=20
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issu=
e that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earn=
ings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new line=
s of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron=
, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged =
into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the lea=
dership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into=
 purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would qui=
ckly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company "could have gotten i=
nto the broadband business with less capital" and that Enron "spent too muc=
h too soon" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non=
-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third qua=
rter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by red=
ucing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter. =20
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom=
 sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared t=
o Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom s=
ector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband bu=
siness compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dyneg=
y clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity=
 and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical wa=
y that merely supplements its core business.=20
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage w=
hen it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enro=
n was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead =
of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydi=
rect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, =
but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was s=
uccessful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its =
competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline ha=
s recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its incep=
tion in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional tr=
ansactions. =20
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their =
approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused =
of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from=
 a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues =
an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my rec=
ollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet,=
 and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I =
don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any=
 time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will cont=
inue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and =
Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. A=
s noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, =
but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. Th=
at doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way t=
o strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and thos=
e businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous.=
=20
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the to=
rtoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the t=
ortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is =
far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on i=
ts more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how bot=
h companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly mo=
dify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies. =20
