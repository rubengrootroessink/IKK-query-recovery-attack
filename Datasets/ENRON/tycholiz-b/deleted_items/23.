Dear Friends,

After having had the chance to meet you all, I wanted to take an opportunity to collectively thank you and reiterate one last time how much a rotation into your esteemed group means to me. I assure you that, whatever shortcomings you may feel I have, can be overcome by my proven ability to work hard, dedication and dogged ambition.  

As I expressed to a number of you, I am certainly open to undertaking any assigned readings and/or classes you may like to recommend in anticipation of a December rotation.  I would like to do my utmost to hit the ground running and prove my worth.

Thanks so much again.  I look forward to staying in touch and hopefully having the chance to see you all again very soon.

Best Wishes,
Vikram
