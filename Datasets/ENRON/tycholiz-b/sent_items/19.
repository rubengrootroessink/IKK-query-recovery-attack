BT - Yes, we are selling them gas monthly, they still operate a Rolling Mill which requires some gas to function.  I have been talking to them about their plans to reopen pot lines but they tell me the price of aluminum does not justify reopening at this time.  DF

Dave, the fundy's report is saying that both Kaiser plants are closed, the one in Mead and the other is in Tacoma... are they not buying gas from us on a monthly basis and if so, is this for process?
