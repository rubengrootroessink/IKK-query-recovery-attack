Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.  In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further. 

BT

The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.  In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business. 

Xcel Energy (PSCo) and affiliate e Prime.
Devon Energy
Cross Timbers
Hallwood Energy
Forest Oil
Prima
Patina Oil and Gas
