Eric, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium. In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement. I.E. if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.
