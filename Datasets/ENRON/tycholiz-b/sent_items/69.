Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search. 

BT

Barry,

Thanks for the updates on the previous candidates.  I am forwarding the resume of Todd Neugebauer from EBS London.  Todd is a manager in the origination group who is currently searching for potential opportunities in the States.  He can be reached at the numbers as listed below.  Let me know if you are interested, as Todd will be in Houston next week if you would care to meet with him in person.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

 << File: Neugebauer Resume.doc >> 
Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  As I mentioned on our call, I am planning to be in Houston later next week and would be available to meet with members of the group then (possibility I may be in all week).  If that doesn't work, I am definitely able to speak by phone.  

Regards,

Todd
