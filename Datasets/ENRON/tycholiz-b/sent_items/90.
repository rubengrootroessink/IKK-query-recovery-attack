Good morning... There is NO issue on your e-mail that is going to get in the way of Family issues... so don't worry about that. Don't knee cap the band because you guys owe me $ 4,000.00.  I was just checking on what your decision was... keep me posted.

 Well, I am glad you made it home from Denver. It must have been a little hairy around there Sept. 11. Were you in the air already or just getting ready to leave when it all happened. Does any of this change you plans for Xmas?
 
We have not made a decision yet. The reason for that is, we can't make a 'good' decision until we know whether we will get to the U.S. or not for the tour. It is that up in the air. If things work out for the worst, we will not recover from this and will be forced to sell the van. It will be the end of the band obviously. Hopeful y that will not happen. My problem is that I don't want o get in any situation that might cause you and I any problems. This business that you and I do together is for the band. The band is just not that important to let it get in the way of family. I won't let it get in the way of Michele and I ..........so. I just want to make a good decision on this. I( guess for you it does not make too much difference either way, does it? I mean either you will get the balance paid or a payment in November. Sorry I did not get back to you about it, it's just that I really didn't have an answer. How's Kim. I guess you know Marge got a dog.

I never heard back from you guys.. what did you decide to do?  Are you going to sell the van or defer the payments for the next couple of months.
 
Let me know...
