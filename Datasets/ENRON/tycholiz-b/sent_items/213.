Lorelie, I had sent to you last week a amending doc regarding a one month extension that the customer was looking for in order to exercise the option on some of that small volume.  They have contacted us and I beleive they will be exercising and would like to get the paperwork back in order to get this process moving. 

Can you please have document signed and returned to me soonest.

Thanks, BT
