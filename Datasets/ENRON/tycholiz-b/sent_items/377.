Ina, please make the tour arrangements for our group for Tues Nov, 6 at 3:30. West Gas trading and West Gas orig. ( I can get you the names if you need them).

Let me know if this is booked and I will put on my calender. Other than Mike, the group does not know we are planning for this tour. 


Thanks. BT
