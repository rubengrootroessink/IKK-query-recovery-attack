Lorelie, I know we did not get to finish our conversation. call me on Friday ( if you so desire or have time) . 

In thinking through this issue, I am not really sure that it matters how these deals are now being confirmed, nominated or paid. settled or netted against. I am not even sure that we can do anything to change them once we filed.  

There is a good chance I am not thinking about it properly and will be happy to discuss on friday.

Thanks, 

BT
