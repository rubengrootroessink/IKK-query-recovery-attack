Patrick, sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in L.A. this week.  As mentioned, I am responsible for the Gas Marketing efforts in the West. For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing. 

My groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc... .items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.  

We spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc.

You had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.

Please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim.... if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.

Thanks in advance. 

Barry Tycholiz
Vice President
Enron North America
