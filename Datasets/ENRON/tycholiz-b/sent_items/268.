Mark, further to our conversation of last night.  IT is important to the PROCESS that you guys complete the forms submited to you by Kelly Little... and this document gets incorporated into a master file ( being used by the exec committee.).

Can you please ensure that this document is completed asap. 

As always, Thanks. BT
