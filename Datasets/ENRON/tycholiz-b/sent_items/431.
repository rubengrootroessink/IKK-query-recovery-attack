Carl, just wanted you to know that I have decided to NOT offer William a rotation in west gas and I have talked to him this a.m.

As discussed, I like his basic skill sets but I decided this a.m. to hold off for the next 2 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year.  I am sure he will find a good rotation, just wasn't the best fit for me at this time.

Thanks, BT
