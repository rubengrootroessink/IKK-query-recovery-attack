Hey that sounds great!  Were you on holidays last week? or just really busy, I was suprised I didn't hear from you earlier.

Can't wait to see Houston...

Hey guys, I'm coming to Houston October 6th - 9th and I was hoping that we could do lunch or dinner or something.

Let me know if your going to be around and maybe we can hookup

Thanks
