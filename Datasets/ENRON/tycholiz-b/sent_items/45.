If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.
