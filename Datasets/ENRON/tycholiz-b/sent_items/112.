Eva, I was talking to Jean the other day and she has advised me that you will be working in the Producer One group.  I would like to talk to you about some of the things you worked on this year as they relate to storage development etc... 

Can you contact me early next week to get together for 1/2 hour.

Thanks in advance.

BT
