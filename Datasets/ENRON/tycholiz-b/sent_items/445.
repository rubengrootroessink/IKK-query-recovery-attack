Thanks for the note back.... yeah, I am still kicking.... and I am sure you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake this guy... when I grab on , I grab on tight.... 

Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our documents.. I think we have all had to dust off the paper... but I sincerely hope most of it is behind us. 

I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work... 

I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be back up... and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis.... all in all Houston is treating us pretty good.  Work really has been great and I have such a good marketing region... california, arizona, Denver.... vegas... are some of the highlights... so when I need to, I go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..

Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year).... she may have to pick up the pace on that effort... ( she is fighting me on that one)... House is good, weather right now is great... 80 degrees ( all the time)... there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals... 

Better run, take care, talk soonest.

hey guy,

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass
pipeline (bypasses NGTL in the Med Hat area). The week before that we had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

karen is over at progas and seems to be enjoying it.

when are you coming up to the great white north ? let me know and we should
have a beer and shot some pool.

cheers

jdmiller
