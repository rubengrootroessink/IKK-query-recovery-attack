Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff
