because you have a cool hr rep.

Actually, I believe compensation did not properly grant your options at year end and this  grant is to make up for that error.  VPs are handled by executive comp so I don't review or send out that info.  Let me know if you need more info and I'll give you a direct contact.

I just received a letter on some options being granted ( a total of 1400)... at $ 35.00 strike. 

What is this for?
