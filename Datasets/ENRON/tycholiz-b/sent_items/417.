Entering into term agreements with Enron today is probably not the best play until our credit / restructuring issues are resolved.  What are you thinking about? 

All is fine, hanging in there, pissed off like you would not believe... but not much I can do now but wait it out.. I have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting.
