Thanks for the reply.. 

Let's talk asap regarding this transportation. I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place. You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south. We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).  

25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!

I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).


Thanks in advance,  Barry Tycholiz

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.
