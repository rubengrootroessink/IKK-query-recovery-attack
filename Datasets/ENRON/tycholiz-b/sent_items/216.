There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?
