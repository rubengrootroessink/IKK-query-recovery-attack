Jeff, I did leave you a message on Friday that I was unable to meet with DWR on monday... You and I need to hook up on Monday to discuss plan of attack regarding gas and as per your original message I agree with you, it starts with some basic discussions around their intent, vs trying to bang out a Master agreement that may go no where. 

Talk to you today I hope.
