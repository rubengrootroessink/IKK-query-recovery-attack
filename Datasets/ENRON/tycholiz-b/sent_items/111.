I condensed the two charts into one on the "Santa Clara Load/Supply Profile" page.  Is it too busy?

Also, I have included two pages (10&11) on the forward value of the EPNG capacity.  Which do you like better?  Regardless of which one we use, we do need to talk about the appropriate SJ/Perm split and physical premiums (if any).

I'll call in the morning.
