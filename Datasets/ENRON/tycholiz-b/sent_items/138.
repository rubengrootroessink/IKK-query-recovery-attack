Kim, Russel Diamond is going to provide to you a complete overview of deals, power and gas, and MTM positions, plus contractual status. You should get a copy of the master documents. ( this will include credit covenants).

Also, can I have a summary of LADWP, how they operate, how they are paid.... Russel will have this to you by tommorow. Pls have the consolidated package for me prior to my departure at 1:30 to Las Vegas.
