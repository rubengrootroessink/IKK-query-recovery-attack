Dave, We believe that Avista has been kicking tires on picking up some term PGT, Nova and ANG capacity... We may be selling it.  

Pls hunt down a contact who handles this and find out if they want to see our piece.  We will probably have 10,000 MMBtu/day. starting out of Nov 2002. 23 years. at expansion rates. 

Call stephanie or myself to discuss. 

BT
