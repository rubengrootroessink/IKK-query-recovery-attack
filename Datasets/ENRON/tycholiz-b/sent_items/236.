We need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations Pemex believes they will have in the next 1 - 5,10 years.  The more obligation they have at the border, the better off we are..

What they used to deliver upstream of the border, we can replace for them synthetically. 

Pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days.
