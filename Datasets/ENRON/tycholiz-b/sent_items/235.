Jaime, thanks for setting up last weeks meetings... I thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties.

We will follow up directly with Pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals.

Did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters? 

Is there any specific action required by west gas at this time, if so, pls contact me to coordinate? 

regards,

BT
