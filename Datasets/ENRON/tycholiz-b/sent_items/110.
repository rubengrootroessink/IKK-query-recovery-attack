Jacy called me the other day and said you guys met... He is a really good guy.. they have three young kids... 

For right now, the best thing that we can do is try to find a nasdaq related fund and possibly by half of that and the balance in some sort of term bond fund. I have not set you the documents back as of yet.

     Hey Barry, how's things going down there. Must be a bit crazy for you 
     Americans about now. By the way, I met your bud Jaycee at a meeting a 
     couple of weeks ago. Seems like a nice guy. I never had a chance to 
     visit with him much, we didn't stick around after the meeting. Maybe 
     next time.
     Was just following up on that stuff I sent. You may have some concerns 
     about now on the suggested funds. Email me if you do.
     
     Rob
