Good morning Barry:

I am attaching a copy of my updated resume.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss any possible opportunities that you may have in your group.  I began the Analyst Program in July and have been working in Generation Investments under Carl Tricoli.  The experience has been tremendous thus far.  We discovered last week that our group is being restructured and I am forced to look for re-deployment.  Thank you for time and consideration.
