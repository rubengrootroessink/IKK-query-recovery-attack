Mark, thanks for seeing us this week. 

I am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe I am making progress. I shall get back to you soonest.   

Can you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR. For example, if I were to sell you gas via Enron Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery? 

Is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).

Thanks in advance, 

Barry Tycholiz
