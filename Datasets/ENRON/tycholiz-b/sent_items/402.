Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions.
