Leon, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect. This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to. However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.  As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines. 

Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.

Thanks. Barry Tycholiz

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
("Agreement") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.
