Ty, pls check your model, I would believe you have a file reference error on the July 25, 55 day payables number ( when you include new deals).

Pls update and re-issue to me first thing.

I've updated the spreadsheet to show the payables totals for the existing and proposed deals as Jan 25, 2002 and July 25, 2002, respectively.  I have also modified the payables calculation to consider only 2002 prices, as this is the applicable period for our exercise.
