Sonya, can you please contact Frank Vickers ( VP East Orig). He was looking at my screen and was interested in getting it. 

Also, can you provide for him a report on what systems his group currently has and whether or not there is an opportunity to reduce some of his costs by using the system that you set me up with.

No need to reply, pls contact Frank.
