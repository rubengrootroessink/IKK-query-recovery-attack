Gas folks -- your groups may be interested in these brief summaries of Enron's positions on the electric Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and utility hedging.  We are gathering additional brief position summaries on code of conduct, affiliates, and POLR.

Here are some recent materials on RTOs and hedging.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.  Concerning the RTO info., please check with me, Janel or Sue Nord, if you, or the gas origination folks, want to distribute externally.
