Fran... I have received the L1 visa package and will use documents to Enter 
the US on Friday morning. 

I have also received the bridge loan documents and have signed these forms 
and sent them back to as of right now via inter office mail..... you should 
have by tommorrow ( Weds).  Can you please sign as required.

I think that is about it other than I need to make arrangements for a cheque 
to be in my hands for friday morning.  At this time, I still do not know 
where to have this sent.  

Thanks. BT
