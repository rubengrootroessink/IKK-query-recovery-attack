Fran.... Kerri Rigsby from Associates will be contacting you regarding the 
Bridge Loan.  She needs a letter on file verifying that I will have these 
funds. 

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a 
cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the 
funds required for closing. 

Thanks. BT
