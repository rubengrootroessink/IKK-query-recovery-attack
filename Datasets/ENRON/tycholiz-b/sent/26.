Attached is updated information on your assigned associates/analysts for the 
year-end 2000 PRC meeting.  This spreadsheet includes updated PRC 
Supervisors  - these are the individuals who have been identified as being 
responsible for gathering feedback, pre-rating the associates/analysts, and 
giving the written performance evaluations after the PRC.  In addition, we 
have included mid-year 2000 ratings, when available.  Please call Terry 
Bosien ( x35230), Ivonne Brown (x57106), or Gwen Gray (x35234), if you have 
any questions about this information.
