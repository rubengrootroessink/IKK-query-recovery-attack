I hope this is the first e-mail you open on Monday when you get it. !!!

1. The closing date on my house is Nov. 30  ----- Are we ready for it?
2. I need a power of attorney as I will not be in Houston to transition.  I 
will be in on the 2nd of Dec.
3.  I do not have a US bank accounts as of yet and am trying to get these set 
up now.. but I need to know how to get the money to you.
4.  Do you have all the final economics on costs, mortage amount, Taxes, Int. 
Rate, Monthly payments.
5. You sent me a package which lists all of the closing costs.. Am I too 
assume you are paying those directly and getting reimbursed by ENA or do I 
need to pay them myself?
6. Have you secured mortage financing for me ? 

MONDAY morning is very important for you and I go hammer out final details.
