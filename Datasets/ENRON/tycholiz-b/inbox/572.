Barry -

My name is Brian Wood and I am an Associate who is currently up for rotation. I spoke with Shelly Friesenhahn from the Associate/Analyst Program and she recommended that I contact you about openings within your group.  I would be very interested in talking to you in order to find out if I would be a good fit for your needs.

I have spoken with an Associate in your group, Phil Polsky, and am excited about the business and learning opportunities in West Coast Gas Origination.  In my previous rotations, I have participated in a broad base of structuring, modeling, and origination activities.  To provide further detail about my experiences and achievements, I have attached my resume for your review.  

With everything going on in the company, I know it may be difficult to find time to meet with me.   Please let me know when it would be most convenient to stop by.  I look forward to having the chance to explain how I could provide value to your group.

Thank you for your consideration,

Brian Wood
