While Lucci pats himself on the back it was much more of a team effort with substantial credit going to Theresa Staab and Jay Reitmayer.

Paul,
Thanks for getting back to me this afternoon.  I am sorry that Enron did not
have the best bid in the last round of RFPs Greeley sent out for the
upcomming winter season.  However, I will look forward to receiving your bid
in the future.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you and
Theresa for the excellent customer service Greeley has received regarding
the current summer deal.


Thanks Again,
Robert Poole
