I will be in on Saturday evening so I could do lunch on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday.  Pick a day and I will plan for it.  I know you are busy so I will let you pick

Hey that sounds great!  Were you on holidays last week? or just really busy, I was suprised I didn't hear from you earlier.

Can't wait to see Houston...
