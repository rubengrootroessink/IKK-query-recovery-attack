Mr. Gross,

Barry Tycholiz wanted me to contact you regarding next Monday's meeting.
Due to the events in New York and Washington Barry has been stuck in
Denver.  Because of this and other associated business delays, we would
appreciate it if you could reschedule the meeting.  Either Barry or
Stephanie Miller will contact you later to firm up a date.

Thank you for your understanding.  If you have any questions please feel
free to contact me at the number below.
