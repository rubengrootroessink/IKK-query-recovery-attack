See below.  Once you have a complete table, would you please distribute it to the whole group? Thanks.

I assume you are going to be the lead in the coordinating?

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise. 

thanks, BT
