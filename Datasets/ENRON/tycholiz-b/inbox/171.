     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.
     
     Regards
     Rob
