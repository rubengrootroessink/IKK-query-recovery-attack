I am disappointed with this ranking and find it hard to believe that with the year that we have had and the strides that have been made by Mark and the producer services group in Denver that he would be ranked as average. Am I missing something?

VP's get cross ranked accross Enron Corp by a group of MD's of which I am one.
 
The ranks are final.

John, Mark Whitt's ranking seems low to where we started and I thought agreed.  Can I talk to you about this or is it done.

Thanks, BT
