Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,
-D

Thanks. BT
