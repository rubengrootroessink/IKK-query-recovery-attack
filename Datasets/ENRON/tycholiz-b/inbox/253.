We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

Has this bill been paid as of yet?

What was our buget vs actual for each of these events. 

I would still like to reconcile all expenses... even though they were all not master billed..

Let me know if you have any questions.
I did not have a cost for the fishing, it was put onto Mark Whitt's credit card.
