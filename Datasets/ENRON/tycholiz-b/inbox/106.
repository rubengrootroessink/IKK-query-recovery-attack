If you have quesitons, comments, or suggestions for additional research needed, just holler. Please forward to others who might need it.

Best,
Jeff

Electric:  SCE, PG&E and SDG&E are all authorized to enter into bilateral
forward transactions with non-ISO or PX parties.  D.00-08-023 and
D.00-09-075.  These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire
on or before 12-31-05.  Initial contracts are subject to a blanket
reasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of
portfolio=deemed reasonable)  but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject
to a CPUC preapproval process.

Gas:   PG&E authorized to use gas hedges for all purposes (D.98-12-082) but
limited to contracts expiring on or beforce 12-31-02 and limited to $200
million in cost or 800 MMcfd in volume.  We are looking for a similar
resolution or decision for Sempra.  Haven't found it yet, but we believe
they have been given similar authority.
