Hi Dave,

As we've been running our numbers on this proposal, I was curious if your
offer of $13MM factors in any kind of tax make-up for the up-front payment?
I'm continuing to try to identify where we have differences in value so we
can discuss further tomorrow.  By the way, I think there will be 3 to 4 of
us tomorrow:

Myself
Tim Miller - Origination (Southwest)
Bill Burden - Business Development Gas and Power
Kim Colburn - Business Development Gas and Power

Give me a call and we can set up a place to meet in front of the restaurant
- they won't seat anyone until everyone is there anyway.

Penny

Penny,

We do not have a hard deadline for placing this capacity, however, some
of it has already been spoken for.   We could do something as early as
Nov 01 but I understand that may be a bit aggressive.  Our offer
currently stands at about $13MM for 100,000/day, Nov 01 - May 06.  We
will look to you to take on the obligation for that payment or make us a
counter offer.  We would be happy to sit down with you as early as next
week to work through any questions or issues.  I hope that answers your
question, please let me know if it doesn't.

Dave

PS - I'll be in Houston next week if a meeting would be useful.

Dave,

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the
next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let
me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
timeline. 

Thanks,  Penny

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,
