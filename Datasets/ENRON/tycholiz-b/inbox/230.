UNION members:

The attached presentation provides one format to develop a general orig "plan" for attacking the industrial market.  The objective is to encapsulate our "common view" of the industrial market opportunities, resource strategy, product strategy, etc..(it also shows Louise that we are working together), .   A more specific plan would be needed for each region driven by specific market needs.   There is no pride of authorship for this format - changes/rewrites are expected.

I you agree this has some value as a way to capture the results of our discussions, I will have an Associate from my group, JD Buss, to develop this further and coordinate comments and input from you or someone on your teams.  Let JD know who he should get in touch with.

Regards,
Brian
