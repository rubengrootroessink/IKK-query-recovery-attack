Natural Gas Futures and Cash Tumble=20

    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.162 =
to $2.544 per MMBtu yesterday, after hitting a 18-month low on weak overall=
 fundamentals. The October contract dropped $0.154 to $2.582 per MMBtu. The=
 September contract traded at its lowest price since February 2000 when it =
reached a low of $2.53. Bearish fundamentals are triggered by last week's r=
evised storage, mild weather and no tropical storm action on the immediate =
horizon. Last week, the AGA revised the prior week's reported data up 47 Bc=
f in addition to the higher than expect injection for the that week. The fa=
lloff is in preparation for this week's expected much higher than normal.  =
Most of New England and interior New York state will experience mild weathe=
r this as will most of the Pacific coast. Temperatures will turn mild in th=
e Midwest, northern Plains and Northeast later this week, putting more pres=
sure on the market. Look for prices to open lower this morning and continue=
 under pressure. September options expire today and futures tomorrow. Look =
for next support at $2.43 and then $2.39; with resistance seen at $2.83, an=
d then $2.97. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada wa=
s generally $0.15 to $0.20 lower yesterday, except out West where spot pric=
es dipped about $0.05. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub l=
ost $0.17 to $2.60 per MMBtu.=20

JP Morgan Cuts Forest and Louis Dreyfus Ratings

     JP Morgan has cut its ratings on Forest Oil and Louis Dreyfus Natural =
Gas to 'market performer' from 'long-term buy', citing lower forecasts for =
natural gas prices. The downgrades came after JP Morgan revised its 3rd qua=
rter Henry Hub natural price forecast to $2.90 per MMBtu from $3.25 per MMB=
tu. It also dropped its 4th quarter forecast to $2.75 MMBtu from $3.75 per =
MMBtu. Other than lower expected natural gas prices, JP Morgan had nothing =
but good things to say about both companies, calling Louis Dreyfus as a wel=
l-run company with attractive assets, and noting that Forest offers attract=
ive exploration upside potential relative to peers and appears to be set fo=
r a strong year in terms of reserve additions after recent drilling success=
 in the Cook Inlet of Alaska.

DOE Project to Help Nuclear Power Plant Construction

  The DOE has unveiled a pilot project which will encourage private compani=
es to consider new nuclear power plant sites. The DOE wants private compani=
es to submit early requests to have potential sites licensed with the NRC, =
and has dedicated  $700,000 to subsidize site permitting studies. The plan =
is to help break down barriers affecting future near-term deployment of new=
 nuclear power plants. The DOE program will look at existing sites, green-f=
ield sites and federal sites. Applications for the program are due by Octob=
er 15th. =20

Enron Wind May Be Overvalued

    Enron is reportedly having problems in a effort to sell Enron Wind, wit=
h top prospective buyers saying the company is too expensive and there is n=
o need to consolidate. The world's largest supplier of wind turbines with a=
 third of the global market, Danish Vestas Wind Systems, says their strateg=
y is grow on their own as the market grows, and will not even consider buyi=
ng Enron Wind. The global wind power market is predicted to increase by an =
annual average rate of 19% per year over the next ten years. Enron Wind has=
 unofficially been up for sale for several years, but has not received any =
reported serious interest near the asking price. German-Danish Nordex is ac=
tively seeking potential acquisition candidates and was talking to Enron Wi=
nd, but says it is too highly valued. Last week, Enron's wind turbine unit =
was valued at $725 million. NEG Micon, with a market share more than twice =
as large as Enron Wind, is worth $860 million based its stock price.=20

New California Energy Board at Odds with FERC

    In its first meeting, the California Consumer Power and Conservation Fi=
nancing Authority was told that plans to build additional natural gas stora=
ge fields will provide the state with insurance against sudden price hikes =
resulting from supply shortages. California's governor has given the author=
ity for up to $5 billion to build more power plants, add natural gas storag=
e, increase renewable energy, and create conservation incentives. However, =
there are concerns that the agency will dampen enthusiasm for private inves=
tment in the state's beleaguered power system. In order to control their ow=
n destiny, officials say that California needs a sufficient surplus of natu=
ral gas to ensure competition. Mirroring its accusations against power gene=
rators, California has alleged that natural gas pipeline companies created =
non-existent shortages to drive up prices. However, the mandate given to th=
e authority by the governor could put the state on a collision course with =
the FERC, which claims exclusive jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act. =
The authority will expire in 2006, unless the state legislature revives it.
