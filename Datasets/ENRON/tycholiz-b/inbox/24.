Barry,

I had a long chat with Malowney and we agreed to work together on L-P, we're meeting them here on the 24th.  Regarding other industrials - I'm the gas guy. We're going to share contact lists and try to put forth a cohesive effort on the part of Enron, but I'm gas and he's power, L-P is an exception given their request that he be the contact (for now at least).  Make sense?
