I had planned on attending with Dave.  I thought you might have some interest as well.  Would you like Dave to find out who is attending from Portland?

We should probably discuss this conference, including coordination with the Portland Office. Although it is a gas conference, I would still like to know who else thinks they should be going.

I would like some of us to attend this conference.  I am a lttle reluctant on any major sponsorhsip since I have not attended before.  What do you think about their request for a speaker?  Any ideas?

Mark, 

Thank you for your help identifying the right speaker for the ZEG/NW Gas Association Conference in Portland - October 3.  I have attached an advanced draft agenda so you can see the line up of executives and topics. We certainly hope that Enron will agree to speak and sponsor....I would recommend the reception sponsorship....I believe a good value for the $.....see attached letter to David Fuller re sponsorship and Sponsorship Detail Sheet. 

As you will see from the agenda, the topic is PRICE...natural gas price.....what I believe would be of interest is the relationship between gas and electric prices in the West....factoring hydro etc.,......identifying the wildcards.... 

The morning of Day 2 is high level - CEO discussions of DEMAND - consumer/industry/gas fired gen and PRICE...as I said Enron - as largest marketer in NA - should be the company delivering the discussion. - This is a GAS industry conference - not a "public" forum.  Louise Kitchen would be an great choice - I've heard she is an excellent presenter - and I believe of equivalent stature to the other a.m. presenters....... 

Thanks...... please give me a call as soon as you can after the holiday.
