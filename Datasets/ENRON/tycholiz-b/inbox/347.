Here is an opportunity to get a box for one of the games.  Detroit on Feb 4th would be great!  That is a Monday.  If you and Kim wanted to you could come up and ski that weekend prior.  Let me know what you think.

A friend of mine who works for Clear Channel passed this on to me. Thought you might be interested. He tells me that their suite is on the blue line. Pat
