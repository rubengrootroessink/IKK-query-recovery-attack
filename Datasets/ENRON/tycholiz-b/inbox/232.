Barry, I'm trying to see if we can do it from 10 - 11 a.m. (Houston time) on Tuesday.  Is this time slot good for you?
Can you also give me some other times on Tuesday (just in case one of the other participants can't do 10 -11)?

Thanks,
S

It is almost impossible for me to meet on Monday but tues a.m. works really well.  I am at my own offsite all dayMonday, with presentations starting at 8:00 and ending at 5:00, then Enron is hosting a customer function starting at 5:15.  

Is Tues A.M.  possible.

Barry, Mark Powell has asked me to set up a conference call between Peter Keohane, Jeff Hodge, Eric LeDain, Mark Powell and yourself on Monday to discuss PG&E.  Can you please let me know what your schedule is for Monday?  It'll take approximately 1 hour.

Thanks,
