Thanks for your response. We are still scoping out the project and would be
interested in indicitive quotes. I am still gathering information on the
delivery point. I will update you on where we are with the process.

Faizal.... sorry for the delay in providing a quote to you on this
project.

We continue to work on numbers and have had other co's contact us for a
quote.

At this time, do you know if TransAlta is going to pursue submitting a
response to this project?  Do you still require numbers from us?

If so, then I need to coordinate with the appropriate desks pricing and
ENA's response to you and other co's!! ( if any)

Drop me a note as soon as possible and I will go from there. Thanks. BT
