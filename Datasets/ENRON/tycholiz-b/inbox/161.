What about a Thursday pm with Colin and Friday am with office and PG&E? Can you please ask Jessica to book a flight for me to match your outbound and return Friday afternoon?
 
I'll arrange meetings tomorrow.

Stephanie, I have booked my flights to San Fransisco.  I will arrive on thurs aug 30 around 4:00 PM via continental. 

can you book meetings with Calpine, Jeff Dasovich, and PG&E ( we can discuss who at PG&E ).  We should also review the Sonoran shippers list and as part of this trip see some of these shippers who could use the PG&E recallable capacity (incl. Calpine).

I  am staying in California for the weekend so I can book meetings all day on friday.  Also, if you want to go out thurs a.m. and come back friday afternoon, that works for me also. please advise asap.
