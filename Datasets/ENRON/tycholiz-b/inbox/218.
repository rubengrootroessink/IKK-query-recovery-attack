Guys--attached please find the most recent Harvard cases, including both the text  and the "multi-media" versions. These are intended for internal distribution only--I leave the definition and boundaries of "internal" to your most reasonable business judgement.  Under copywrite law and our agreement with Harvard, external requests for these cases are to be directed to Harvard for purchase.
 
Let me know if you need anything else!
 
Thanks--Christie.
