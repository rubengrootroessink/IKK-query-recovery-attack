Kim:

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.
