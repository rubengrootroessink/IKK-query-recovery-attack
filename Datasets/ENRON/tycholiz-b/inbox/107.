Sounds good.  You can reach me at 415.782.7822.  Because my schedule is a mess (thanks to the mess California has created), if you don't reach me on my office line, please try 415.505.6633.  Also, I think that it would be very useful to have Leslie Lawner on, since she's involved a lot in California gas matters, but it's your call.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, for the meeting on Thurs a.m.  9:30 ( Houston Time ), we should keep our group to the list I have identified. I would like to start with a simple plan and work out from there. We are working towards an action plan for handling PUC issues ( from a commercial perspective) in california and other states, prior to anybody addressing the PUC we need agreement as to what it is we want to put forward. 

We will call you on thurs a.m.  Can you please verify your contact phone number.  

Thanks in advance. 

Jessica, pls reserve a room. 

BT
