Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  

Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.

Kim, what is the status of paper and credit with the DWR. Are we negotiating the credit terms.  Who are the lead players for ENA. Jay ?, Stacey?
