1.	CIG, RP01-350
CIG  has filed an answer to the comments and protests.  Although they referenced our protest, they did not discuss it in any detail except to say that our issues and those of PSCo and Barrett could be explored through "normal procedures" after the suspension, presumably through settlement conferences or hearing.  Note that I gave you a copy, though I can't remember exactly when.  It might have been when we met with Paul in my office.

The suspension order was issued on 4/25 -- rates effective 10/1/01, subject to refund.  Copies were distributed to parties on my list on 4/30.  All of the issues in the "Appendix B" tariff sheets are set for the technical conference (basically, everything except the rates and cost of service, which are to be addressed at hearing).  The hearing schedule is held in abeyance until after the technical conference issues are resolved.  At that point, a procedural schedule will be established, with a target hearing date and dates for testimony, discovery, rebuttal testimony, etc.  Of course, settlement negotiations will also be going on at the same time, I would assume.

2.	PGT, CP01-141

The application was filed on 4/2, and interventions/protests were not due until 4/25.  As you know, certificate proceedings do not have the same requirement for FERC to act within 30 days.  Environmental issues will be of primary concern initially.  On 4/12, FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Assessment with reqeust for comments.   FERC sent PGT a data request on environmental issues, to which PGT responded on 4/30.  Interestingly, on 5/3, REBOUND, an organization of skilled construction trade workers, filed a letter arguing that a "full and complete" Environmental Impact Statement is the proper avenue for consideration of the environmental impacts of the project.  An EIS is much more extensive than an Environmental Assessment.  REBOUND's justification for an EIS didn't seem to be very strong.  

While the environmental work is ongoing, FERC will probably issue a preliminary determination on the non-environmental issues.  If RIMS is correct, there weren't many protests -- only us, DEK Energy Company, and Pan Alberta Gas -- and only PanCanadian Petroleum filed comments.
