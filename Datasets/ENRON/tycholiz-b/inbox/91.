Good morning Barry,

I'd be happy to provide you with assistance in this regard.  Will Enron be
paying for this service?

Please let me know when it would be convenient for you to meet (I am
assuming this will be over the phone).

Best regards,

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT
