Barry,
How about Friday at 11:00 in my office? Then we can go out to lunch around
noon--did you have a place in mind? Also, I'd like to include our legal guy,
Dave Anderson, and our contracts person, Charlotte Baxter.

Ray, thanks for the return call the other day.  As discussed in our
voice mails there remains a variety of reasons that ENA should be
talking to you.  As such we would like to meet with you on Friday  for
an early meeting and or lunch  just to bring to a current status all the
legal,credit and commercial opportunities that should be reviewed. 

If Lunch on friday ( aug 31 ) is good for you, please set it aside.. we
can pick at spot for lunch... next week if the schedules line up.
Stephanie Miller will be joining me.

thanks in advance.
