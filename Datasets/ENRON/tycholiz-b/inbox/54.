This was forwarded to me by Paul Kaufman 

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. 

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.
