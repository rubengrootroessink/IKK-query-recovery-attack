Sameh - Thought I would touch base to see how the responses turned out.  Do you think you have a "workable" vehicle or  were there too many moving parts?

Call me at 713-853-1688 if you want to dicuss it.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie:

We have released our RFP for the pipeline capacity and Wallula tolling.  I
will be sending you an original copy via FEDEX, but wanted you to have the
enclosed copy for expediency.  I have also attached the heat balance diagram
(which is Attachment 3 to the Reverse RFP) so that your technical people can
have a basis to start from.  Attachments 1 and 2 you already have through
the PGT open season process, but we will include the version that we
executed in the FEDEX package.  Let me know if you have any questions.
