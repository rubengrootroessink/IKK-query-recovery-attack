We actually use the same airplanes for both NBA and NHL. They were
originally configured for the NBA then we added some hockey teams to our
contract. There are 12 international first class seats and a table with
four chairs in the front cabin, the middle has 2 tables with 4 chairs and
an additional 4 world business class seats, then the back has 24 domestic
first class seats and a sofa. They are old 727's that were reconfigured.
Obviously, the NBA players sit in the front cabin since that was the idea
of the 12 seats, and coaches in the middle with tables to work,  but the
hockey players sit in the middle and back with coaches and staff occupying
the front or middle. Each Hockey teams seating is different depending on
the teams preference. Just to have a private flight makes the hockey guys
happy. Most of them still remember when they had to fly commercial. They
are not too picky. And with the steller service we provide, they don't even
notice the decor!!!

Off to bang that little white ball around grass, sand and trees!

See ya,
