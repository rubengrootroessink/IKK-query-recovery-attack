Hope all is well with both of you! 

As Colin and I discussed, we are looking to place some transportation capacity. In that regard, I offer the attached proposal for your consideration. I believe these transportation paths are a good fit for your needs on PG&E. This proposal offers diversity of supply (Baja and Redwood) for your generation projects on the PG&E system. You would also receive the future benefit of existing tolls relative to incrementally priced expansions.Start date is open for discussion.

Please call me as soon as possible - we are going to move fast.

Best regards,

Stephanie
