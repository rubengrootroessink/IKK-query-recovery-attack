Stephanie:

I attach a copy of the presentation we gave to Eric Gonzales last week.  Based on our analysis and the information we received from yourself and gas traders here and in Portland, we made certain assumptions about how the NW Pipeline system works.  During our planned meeting on Friday (we will learn for sure whether the meeting is taking place only on Wednesday -- Kirk Morgan will be reporting for jury duty that day and will let us know whether he's released or not), we wanted to confirm that our conclusions are correct, whether the LNG terminal idea is completely crazy and whether there are any synergies that we may get from working with NW P/L and/or Williams on LNG terminal development.

Please let me know what you think,

Z

I understand that you were able to set up a meeting with NWPL.  Since I'm responsible for ENA's relationship with this pipeline, I am trying to determine if I should attend.  Do you have an agenda yet?
