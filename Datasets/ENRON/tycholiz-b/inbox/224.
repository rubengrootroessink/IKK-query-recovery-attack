Greetings Monday Night Football attendees,

We will be providing transportation to and from the game on Monday night.  For those of you who would like to ride over with us, we will be meeting in the Tabor Center lobby at 5:00pm.  The group will depart for Invesco Field soon thereafter for a stadium tour and pre-game food and drinks.  If you would prefer to meet us at the stadium later, please call Mark Whitt (303-575-6478) or Dan Bump (720-946-3632) or reply to this e-mail, and we will have your tickets delivered to you.

We look forward to seeing all of you on Monday!

Thanks,
Enron North America
