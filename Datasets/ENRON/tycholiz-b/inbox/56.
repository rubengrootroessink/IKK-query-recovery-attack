I think Malowney asks these guys to write these things.

PS - Rawson had nothing to do with "arranging" my visit, I set up myself

John,

I was informed by Ron Whitehead that Les Rawson has arranged for Dave Fuller
to visit us on 6/13 to discuss natural gas opportunities.  (I mentioned that
we would be interested in this topic during my 5/4 visit.)

As you know, we attach significant value to having you as our one
point-of-contact with Enron - and we want to continue to work through you on
any new activities.  Given this, I am hoping that you will be available to
attend this meeting or that we can reschedule it so that you can be
available.

Please let me know if this is possible.
