Barry,

In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see
opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real
busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually
Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as
one of three or four minority businesses that will be
involved with supplying the power for contracts. These
contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.

Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have
the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and
best.
One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is
to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on
the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can
convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on
their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less
than a year, just think what could be done with a
supportive back office and timely information.

What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at
my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

Tyrone Killebrew
