Energy West has been covered by the Canadian Desk for the last 5 years..... I think dave priced a 10 year deal lower than what Canada had already priced the deal at... so we have two issues, 1.  coverage (ownership), 2. coordination efforts.

No, canada is not part of the union but at times the thinkness of the 49th parallel ocelates.

What was the issue?  Montana is ours.  I did a deal with MPC Storage earlier in the year and am also working with Industrials up there.  Did Montana secede the Union and join Canada?  You think it would have made the news!

Eric, I received your message on discussions with Energy West.  Firstly, I was unaware of any pricing discussions or notional prices being put out to the customer and I have not discussed with Dave, or Mark Whitt. With that being said, I am sure Dave is out marketing products and services to all of the Utilities in the PNW. 

With out a doubt, we need to discuss this effort as it relates to and creates conflict or duplicate coverage.. I look forward to the discussion and did try to call you earlier today to discuss directly.
