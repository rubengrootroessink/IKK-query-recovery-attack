Dave,

I faxed the signed contract to Annette Willis, who assured me that
everything will work out.  She is much easier to work with than Roger
Reynolds, who we never want to do business with again.

Thanks for your help.

		Alan,

		My sincerest apologies, please keep me posted on what
happens.  I'd like
		to buy you lunch sometime soon and talk about how we can
avoid these
		situations in the future.  I think if we get master
documents in place
		and convey to you a better understanding of our corporate
structure,
		you'll find Enron easy to deal with, flexible, responsive,
and
		competitive.  I'll call you soon in hopes we can get
together.

		Dave

				Roger,

				I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I
can't get
		to
		you by phone.

				Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs,
but I
		noticed
		that none of
				the
				corrected company information I provided the
last time
		around is
				included.
				The name of our company is incorrect.  You
have Ralph
		Mill's
		name with
				my
				address, phone number, and my (incorrect)
fax number.
		The
		facility name
				is
				incorrect and the street name is misspelled.
All of
		this
		was correct on
				the
				last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no
customer
		contact
		information on
				the
				second page.

				Since the file is protected, I can't even
correct this.

				How are we going to get this fixed in the
next 2 hours?
