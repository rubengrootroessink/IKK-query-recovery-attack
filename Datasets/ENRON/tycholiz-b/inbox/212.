Leslie --

Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?

Jim

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks.
