Frank,

I didn't see an attachment on your email showing what you had written so far, but following is an email I sent to the regional heads for East Power Origination. Feel free to cut and paste as appropriate.

Subject:	EES Agreement

Earlier this week, EES (Dave Delainey and Janet Dietrich) agreed the following with ENA:

- EES will continue to approach utilities/munis to sell their "whitepaper" concept, but will restrict their efforts to only the following, until such time as the concept is proven or abandoned:

	- City of San Antonio
	- City of Austin
	- Brownsville Public Utility Board
	- City of Anaheim
	- Peoples
	- SMUD
	- Silicon Valley (Santa Clara)
	- City of Memphis

- EES agreed that they should not be approaching industrials which fall within the previously established ENA SIC codes and committed to reigning their people in. It was agreed that EES would work with ENA to determine if there are subgroups within the SIC codes which are too small for ENA, but which EES should be covering. Chris Calger agreed to work with EES on determining this. The SIC Code categories which ENA is responsible for are as follows (note that while the categories have been agreed, the actual code numbers are my own interpretation of the categories):

10 - Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
13 - Oil and Gas Extraction
26 - Paper and Forest Products
5169, 2899, 5191, 5169 - Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers  (DOW Chemical)
2911 - Refining
29 - Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
30 - Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
5191 - Fertilizer
3531 - Rail
2891, 3559, 5094, 1422, 3241, 3297, 5032 - Cement
3274, 1422, 5191, 2041, 2869 - Large Agricultural Processing
