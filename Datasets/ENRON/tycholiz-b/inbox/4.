Barry, 

It is working great.  Thanks for the support.  One small format issue......Phil has it titled Pacific Gas & Electric Company and it should be PG&E Energy Trading - Gas Corporation.

I will let you know if I need anything else.

Bill

Bill, just following up to see if the MTM reports that are being provided to you are working as you require. Format, data etc.

If there is anything else on this, call me.
