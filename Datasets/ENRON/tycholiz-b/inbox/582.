Greetings Becky 

Wanted to make sure we protested the filing based on fuel treatment - page 10 description.  You and I have talked about their interpretation of the Transco ruling - we need to reinforce the currently effective FERC policy of incremental treatment for projects that would raise rates/fuel for existing shippers, regardless of their claim that their tariff does not provide for an incremental fuel charge.

I believe Newport Generation tried to get the previous incremental fuel ruling for the 2002 expansion overturned - they were unsuccessful. FERC's answer to that request may provide good language to cite...... 

What is the timeline?
