Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Thank You,
Brenda Buxa
Contract Administration
