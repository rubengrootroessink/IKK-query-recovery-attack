As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.
 
For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 15, 2001 is attached below:
