Dave, as you'll see our presentation was well received.  I've spoken to Roger a couple of times and next week they'll be meeting with "management" to obtain their approval of our concept, following that I'll be working on them to using Enron exclusively.  If we are successful, they will be expecting us to develop and manage the whole portfolio.  I appreciate your help and look forward to working together on this.  John

Well I appreciate the feedback.... I feel both Roger and Jeff liked and
understood the concept, but were concerned we "controlled" the number.   I
liken it to checking in the paper as to what the Prime interest rate is
prior to negotiating a home loan.  Once you know the relative interest
rate, you talk to a few mortgage bankers regarding points, services, etc.
and then move forward.  I would hope this is what L-P would do and
naturally I'd hope they would move forward with us.  John

John,
Sounds like you guys were quite a hit yesterday! I've  heard from Roger
and several other sources that the presentation was very  well received.

Cinch up your belt, things are getting fun!!
