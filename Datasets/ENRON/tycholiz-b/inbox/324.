One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud.
