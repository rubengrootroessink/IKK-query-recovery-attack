Following is an email I have sent to my group, outlining a process to ensure everyone is on board and nothing falls through the cracks.

Subject:	Terminations Process

Following is a suggested order of events:

1) Contact customer to float concept. If they are interested in a termination, present an initial suggested number. If they are interested in an assignment to a third party, ask for their permission to discuss their deals with other companies, such as Duke and Williams. It is preferred to do a simple termination to the assignment

2) Ask Melissa Murphy (31886) for a list of transactions, the MTM values and copies of the confirms associated with them. Ensure the values represent today's MTM

3) Show the transaction list and valuations to the gas and power traders responsible for those delivery points. Ask them to initial the MTM values and the volumes. Ensure they understand that terminating the deals will make them longer/shorter at each location and obtain their approval to proceed with doing so.

4) Contact customer with the fresh MTM number and obtain final verbal agreement.

5) Work with Jim Meyn/Leonardo Pacheco to put together final contract, complete with copies of the terminated confirms.

6) Bring the final contract to Dave Forster for final signature/approval.

7) Ensure full contract execution ASAP. Chase counterparty as necessary.
