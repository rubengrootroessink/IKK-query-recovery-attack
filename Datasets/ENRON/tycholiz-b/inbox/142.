Barry,

I've left hard copies of the attached on your desk.  The EPNG document is my memo regarding the information you had requested on EPNG's tariffs, etc.  The Marathon Oil doc shows the deltas on the legs of the PNM sale.  The +757 thousand change from Thursday's value is primarily due to an increase in Winter 02/03 border prices and a drop in SJ basis from Nov 02 out.  

Please let me know should you have any questions.

Phil
