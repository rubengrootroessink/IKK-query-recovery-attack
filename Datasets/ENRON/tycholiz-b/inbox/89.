There will be a conference call Wed. at 1:00 pm Central, July 11, to discuss California intrastate gas issues.  Ruben Buerger will send out the call in information.

Items to be addressed are:  LDC hedging, unbundling rates and infrastructure needs. Jeff Dasovich will give us a status report on these issues and we then discuss where to go from there.
