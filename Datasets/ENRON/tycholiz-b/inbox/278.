[Neustaedter, Robert]  The attached are the consulting and legal opinion letters that were provided related to the ENA storage monetization proposal.  The AckerEnronBas. document addresses the FERC precedents with regard to retention of proceeds.  Please do not distribute these memos outside of Enron.
