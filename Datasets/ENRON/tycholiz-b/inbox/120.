Mike, further to our conversation of this week.. let's get together early next week... ( Tues ) to sit down and hash out expectations of Jane and Keith as they relate to your needs, my needs and how they mutally benefit our efforts.
 
I think we may have to formalize the reporting process on the regulatory but before I worry about that, I am more interested in you and me working out expectations... we may be far off as to what the priorities are and as such our regulatory focus may need to splinter.
 
I have decided to go up to Canada for a couple days to handle some family affairs.  I can be reached on my cell, otherwise I will talk to you on tues.
