Stephanie Miller	300	Lower rate plan to 49.99 (350 minutes)	

RATE PLANS	
$ 29.99	$ 39.99	$ 49.99	$ 69.99	$ 99.99	$ 149.99	$ 199.99	
100 min.	175 min.	350 min.	550 min.	900 min.	1500 min.	2000 min	

Any extra charges you see on the bill, doesn't mean they are getting charged for roaming/long distance.  They most likely include:  411 calls, accessories, or exceeding minutes.

I will get back to you with how much is being spent in Denver.

Jessica

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT
