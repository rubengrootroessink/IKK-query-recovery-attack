Bill -

I have attached a breakdown of our gas inventories by location.  The valuations have not been updated to take into account the downward move in gas prices.  

When we meet with you here in Purchase we would like to this to be one of the topics of discussion.  If you need any additional information (or more detail), please let me know asap.

Todd
