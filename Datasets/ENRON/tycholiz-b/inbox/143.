Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a "Post Arrival Consultation"/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the "PAC" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Judy Perdomo
