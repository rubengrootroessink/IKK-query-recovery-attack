Subject:	revised price cap comments

Here is the revised set of comments on reimposition of max prices on capacity releases. I redid somewhat the basis differential discussion, and Phillip and Stephanie are going to review this in particular.

Get comments back to me and Becky, this needs to be filed Monday. Thanks
