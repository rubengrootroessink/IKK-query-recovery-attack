At Peter's request, please find attached a copy of the most recent draft of the PG&E Master as compared to the modified version forwarded to us by PG&E in May.  The document also has my comments as to the reasons for some of the key changes.  Those comments are in red (so it might be easier to read the document on line).

Sharon will be coordinating a meeting to discuss the document in advance of our anticipated meeting with PG&E (which I believe is expected to occur on next Tuesday).

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call (6708).
