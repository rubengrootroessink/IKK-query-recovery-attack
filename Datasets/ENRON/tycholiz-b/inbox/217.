I spoke to Christian on Friday.  He was not able to reach agreement on a power agreement so EPMI did not sign one with DWR.  He gave me the name and number of the outside counsel that he used.  I will call him this afternoon.

What is status of our DWR discussions.  I am hearing conflicting stories as to whether or not ENA power has executed a Enabling agreement with DWR.  Stacey, any luck with Christian?

I will get an update with Louise on ENA's interests with DWR and advise.
