Barry,

Definately give a call before you come to LA. Either "the girls" can show
you arond or I can definately give you some good info. You can reach me at
310-372-3086.

I also dropped "Ceasar" a note but haven't heard back from him. Did he make
it back alive from Cabo or did a big fish pull him under?

Later,

Debra
