Barry and Stephanie, I'll check on this when I get in in the morning.  I ha=
ve a faint recollection that copies of the agreement were included in PGT's=
 filing, but I may have it confused with another proceeding.  I was going t=
o check it out from home but changed my mind when I discovered that the RIM=
S copy of the filing is over 900 pages!

Steph./ Becky .. is there a possibility that there is a condition precedent=
 "out" clause to Newport Gen regarding rolled in vs incremental tariff ( in=
cl.) fuel that would allow them to not have to take on this transportation?=
  If so, this could affect the Malin Supply out of Nov 2002. Is there any w=
ay that we can see the TA's that were filed with FERC that underpinned the =
2002 expansion?

Yep - in fact, they did.  I just haven't got around to summarizing the orde=
r yet.  Here's some excerpts:=20

"We reach no determination regarding whether PG&E Transmission's system-wid=
e cost of fuel will increase above the current cost, since the outcome depe=
nds on numerous factors, such as the total pipeline volumes transported and=
 the price of fuel.  Instead, as discussed below, and in accordance with En=
ron's request [way to go, FERC!!], we will act to insulate existing shipper=
s from increased fuel costs attributable to the proposed expansion."

After suggesting that it would have been more appropriate to calculate fuel=
 costs by using the average of the latest twelve months of actual data in p=
lace of the theoretical maximum rate, FERC directed "PG&E Transmission to d=
esign a surcharge to ensure that expansion shippers are subject to an incre=
mental fuel charge for fuel costs above the costs attributable to fuel abse=
nt the proposed addition of 97,500 horsepower of compression.  In addition,=
 PG&E must indicate compliance with this condition whenever it files to adj=
ust its compressor fuel surcharge and whenever it files its annual gas fuel=
 reimbursement reports." (emphasis added)

Do you think the Commission would apply this same principal to PGT's 2002 e=
xpansion?=20

According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting t=
oday, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the Califo=
rnia Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including r=
estrictions on rolled-in rate treatment. =20

The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed th=
e rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based=
 on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of ro=
lled-in rate treatment by providing that, "in its future compliance tariff =
filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must s=
ubmit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cos=
t-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are conside=
red" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates f=
or existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certifi=
cated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Ad=
ditionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas =
fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established =
in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of f=
uel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure t=
hat this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.

The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as S=
oCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  =
The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not w=
arrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because =
SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing =
shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas=
. =20

The Draft Order is 49 pages long.  Please advise if you would like a hard c=
opy.
