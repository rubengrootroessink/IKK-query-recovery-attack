Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

C

Please review the attached proposed compromise to be sent to Citizens following internal review.  Lou worked with Don and myself to draft this document.  Jim and Chris, your comments are appreciated.  My apologies for the short turn around time, however, we need to get back to Citizens as quickly as possible due to the plant going commercial sometime between 6/18 and 6/21.
