I called Bill Gaines of Puget to try to relax our credit constraints.  We just traded voicemails, but agreed to talk on Monday.  My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: "lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec".  

Thoughts?

Chris
