Hey there Barry! No, I never heard from him. Guess I will drop him another
note and see how he is surviving this series! We actually went to get the
Av's in NJ. Lisa, Lynn, myself and another girl who is flying the Laker
trips with us got snagged to fly the trip since we were sitting around with
nothing to do until Sat. when we go to Philly. I guess they decided rather
than pay us for sitting on our butts they would put us to work! I am not
particularly fond of their players. Some of them are OK. Joe Sakic is nice.
And of course, I got to see Rob Blake which was a plus. He just doesn't
look right in that Av uniform, or sitting on the plane in a different seat
with all of those "other" guys around him! Patrick Roy sits in the seat he
use to sit in with the Kings, so I guess we know who won out on that deal!
I sure wouldn't ask him to get up! Yikes, he scares me! Now, Bob Hartley,
he is THE nicest guy! And not bad to look at either! All of the coaches are
nice, and quite amusing! Until they lost last night I was hoping to take
them back to NJ this week. How awsome would that have been to bring them
home with THE cup on the plane! Now that it isn't going to happen that way
it is just as well we are not going out there. I guess they found some
other charter FA's to handle it.

I am planning to go to Denver for the opening Bronco game on Mon. night
Sept. 10th. We may have to have a reunion! Are your buddies Bronco fans
too?

Take care, talk with you soon,

Debra
