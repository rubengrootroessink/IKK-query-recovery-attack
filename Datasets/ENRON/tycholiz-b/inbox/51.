Are you referring to the Kern origination?  If so, it appears that the orig has not yet been redistributed.  Who controls the changes/updates to the orig reports?

Regarding your comments on the Pricing Sheet - I just want to make sure I understand what you are looking for.  Where you suggesting that I include historical NYMEX  final settles (previous 12 months?) in addition to the current forward strip?
