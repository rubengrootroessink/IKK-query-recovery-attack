The Origination Track manual is being drafted by Tom Wilbeck and Ted Bland in HR. We should have a copy to circulate for your comments shortly.

1) Attached is a list of potential Origination Track candidates. These are analysts and associates ranked 1, 2 or 3 who have had at least one rotation in a relevant area. These are people who could be interviewed by us to determine if they would be a good fit for the track. Please have a look at the list. If you spot any errors or omissions, please let me know.

 
2) There are an additional 30 analysts and associates who have relevant rotations, but who have not yet been ranked. Any who rank 1-3 could be additional candidates for us to interview.

3) In addition, any analyst - 2 or associate - 1's who rank 1-3 could be candidates for the track. I will forward this list when received from HR.

I will forward lists #2 and #3 once I have the info.

Dave
