Mara, 

Attached is the spreadsheet for billing Palo Alto.  I think that everything we need for billing purposes is there, we just need to improve it and make it user friendly.  We will provide this spreadsheet to accounting by the 10th of each month for the previous flow month. therefore, once we get August done, we will need to work on September.  Once you've had a chance to look at it, we can discuss.  Also, I have a notebook at my desk that details everything about Palo Alto.  

Thanks,

Kim
