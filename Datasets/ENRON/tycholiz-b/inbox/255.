Don Baldridge indicated that they would prefer to front-load the re-priced swap, with a higher price next year and a market-based price for '03-'05 and no lump sum payout this year.  This structure probably works better for us also due to the increased focus on funds flows.

I also have John Disturnal (ENA Canada) pricing up an at the money swaption for '03-'05, which might be an attractive hedge for Crestone.  Don is going to run some traps on his end and get back to me this afternoon.

Tyrell was to follow up with Crestone yesterday.  I do not know where they stand but I know we have been working on structures and they need to do something before the end of the quarter.
Tyrell, can you give us an update?

Mark, Good Morning.  

Any updates on Crestone structure ( re-price of deal), also, Paul discussed the Northern Border deal with potentially the producers underpinning... pls keep me posted on status.
