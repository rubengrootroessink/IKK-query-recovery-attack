I do not talk to the El Paso folks. Generally if we have a regulatory question, Becky will call them for Gov Affairs.

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise. 

thanks, BT
