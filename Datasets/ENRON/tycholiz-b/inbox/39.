Hey there Barry! Just wanted to drop you an note to say thanks for the
cocktails and laughs the other night in Denver. We had a great time with
you guys.

I will store your card and give you a call or drop you a note before we
come to Houston next season. Maybe you can round up some Houston buddies
that could entertain us as much as your Denver ones!

We are off to San Antonio this week with the Lakers. It is a fun town. I am
sure we will manage to find some kind of trouble to get into. Do you ever
go there? Any good restaurant recomendations? There are so many to choose
from.

Talk with you later,

Debra
