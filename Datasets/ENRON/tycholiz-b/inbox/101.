Barry,

We normally charge Enron $900 for departure counselling and it involves an
interview of about 2 hours in which we discuss residency, US tax
considerations, etc.  Please let me know when you would like to schedule
the meeting.

Thanks for the reply. It would be my expectation that Enron will pay but
I will look into this and get back to you. What do you think the cost
will be.

Good morning Barry,

I'd be happy to provide you with assistance in this regard.  Will Enron
be
paying for this service?

Please let me know when it would be convenient for you to meet (I am
assuming this will be over the phone).

Best regards,

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT
