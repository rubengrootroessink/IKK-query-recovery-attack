Barry:  Jeanie Slone has asked me to send to you the Permanent Residency forms so that we can proceed with getting you a Green Card through Enron.

Please complete both forms and obtain all appropriate signatures and return to me at 3AC2026a, along with a detailed current resume.  Upon receipt, we will forward all information to the attorneys and get started.
