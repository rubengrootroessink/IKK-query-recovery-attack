I was in Mexico City... for school

What has happened to your stock price.... you will have to work for many
more years.  

What is the hedging loss about that I saw reported? 

When are you coming to cowtown and have time for a quick visit? 

Bryn and I are in Denver Nov 2-5.  Any chance you happen to be there then? A

Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the
hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a
few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.


What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?


Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all
been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian
assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT
