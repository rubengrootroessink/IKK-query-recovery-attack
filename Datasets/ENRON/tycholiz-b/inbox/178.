     Barry, I just sent out your stuff to get you to sign and return, and I 
     just realized I forgot to put a return envelope in there, (cheap 
     bugger). My apologies.
     
     I am just transferring it to a money market fund until it all gets 
     there,then I will do the direction from there, and I will let you know 
     which funds I think will do the job then.
     
     Regards
     Rob
