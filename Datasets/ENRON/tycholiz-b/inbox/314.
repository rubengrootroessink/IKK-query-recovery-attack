Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.
