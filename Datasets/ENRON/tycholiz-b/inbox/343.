Laura, Barry, Chris and Frank,

Thank you for giving Mastio & Company the opportunity to discuss our market
research capabilities for customer satisfaction and benchmarking.

Mastio & Company would like to have the privilege of building a relationship
with you and assisting your efforts in maximizing customer satisfaction and
delight.  We believe that meeting customer needs, and exceeding expectations
is not only one of the most important business processes, but also builds
loyalty and increases profits.

We would be delighted to have you subscribe to the 2001 multi-client Natural
Gas Marketer Customer Satisfaction Study.
The main benefit of Mastio's multi-client report is, not only will you be
able to discover what customers think of you on 30+ customer service
attributes, you will also learn what customers think of 45+ other gas
marketers, as well.  This study will be an excellent tool if you want to
maximize & improve customer satisfaction, measure & plot progress for
improving customer service, benchmark yourself against competitors, retain &
find new customers and build customer loyalty.
Mastio & Company is convinced you would reap substantial benefits by
discovering your perceived level of customer satisfaction.  As in other
highly competitive industries, natural gas marketers are discovering that
ignoring customer dissatisfaction can be a crucial mistake. The bottom line
is, superior customer service is a given these days, not a difference.
Customers now take superior customer service for granted. Customers are
raising their expectations. Leading companies are responding to this trend
by instituting customer service initiatives and measuring their progress,
versus customer needs and their competition.
Customer satisfaction matters with winning companies, especially for
companies interested in profitable growth.  These leading companies have
actually moved customer satisfaction from a slogan to reality.  They have
made a commitment to value and are realizing superior growth and
profitability because their business strategies focus on enhancing the value
of what they offer customers.
I would like to further point out that our report comes with an electronic
version.  The electronic version allows the segmentation of all the
respondents by state, volume, and customer-type, switching status, head to
head comparisons with competitors, etc. The software can be installed on
your network and up to 50 people can query the software at the same time.
The biggest advantage is the custom tagging feature.  This feature allows
the grouping of your customers, for example, by the key person responsible
for interaction, customer service teams by name, territory, profitability,
strategic importance, etc.  The options are unlimited.  This powerful tool
will empower people to do additional analysis on their own.  They will take
ownership, because the analysis of the data is personalized.

Sincerely,
MASTIO & COMPANY
