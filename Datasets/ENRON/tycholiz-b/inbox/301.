The overview last week was great.  Are you going to have Phil put together a graph of all expansions?  That would be a nice visual for the desk.
 
Thanks,

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs... 

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.
