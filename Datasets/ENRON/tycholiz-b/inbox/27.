Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those obligations and liabilities.

I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.
