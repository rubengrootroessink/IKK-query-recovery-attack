There is only 1 week left before moving into the new building.  There are two shredco containers located at EB3206E and in the freight elevator for documents that need shredding.

Remember:

1.  You can only move 6 boxes per person plus equipment
2.  Take home all IPAQ'S, Blackberry's, Palm Pilots and Laptops Friday 11/9/01 so that nothing is misplaced
