I see how you are doing this.  You are using some early estimates of fuel I
gave you.  You know you should not trust me.  We have some better numbers
now.  It turns out that our average fuel usage rate for calendar 2000 was
.0044 % per pipeline mile.  Stretching this out over 612 miles, KG to Malin
yields a rate of 2.69%.  This is just one place to start when examining the
impact of the expansion.  The modeling of the expansion yields an
incremental rate for the 200,000 mcfd of 7.46%.  If you combine those on a
weighted average you will get 3.24%.  The quantities at KG are significantly
higher than in your estimate.  Regardless, these are the numbers we are
currently predicting.  The actuals will be different and perhaps lower as
the operators optimize the system performance.  Who knows.  Also we are
predicting that the pipeline looping will be constructed in advance and put
into service ahead of the compression.  So on a long term basis (like the
first year) the fuel rate will decrease due to the  looping.

I had promised that I would send my fuel calculation over! Please check on
this:

Current fuel (king to malin) = 2,200,000 mmbtu/d*.03 = 66,000 mmbtu

Proposed fuel = 2,400,000 mmbtu/d*.036 = 86,400 mmbtu

Difference = 20,400/200,000 incremental capacity = 10.2%

Please advise!!

Thanks.

Stephanie
