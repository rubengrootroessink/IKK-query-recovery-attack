 My comments pertain to page 2 of the chart under section C.4
referring to increasing the cashout prices to 75% and 125%.  I recommend a
few changes.  First the chart makes a reference to increasing Tier II
cashout prices under the Content Column.  This should be changed to Tier I
cashout prices consistent with the OFO settlement.  Second, it may be
appropriate to provide some additional details on this issue in the Change
to Gas Accord column.  One option is something along the following lines:
"None.  This change is consistent with the Gas Accord provision which allows
PG&E to file to revise imbalance charges and cash-out options.  The current
Tier I cashout prices do not provide an economic disincentive for incurring
cash-out imbalances in all months as intended in the Gas Accord.  This can
serve as a factor contributing to pipeline OFOs.  The change to the Tier I
cash-out prices is consistent with the intent of the Gas Accord, and the
objective to reduce pipeline OFO's."

Subject: FW: Comments on OFO Settlement


Enclosed is a copy of the proposed Comments of the Settlement Parties in
Support of the OFO Settlement.  ("Comments")  The Comments address the
specific issues raised by ALJ Biren at the last prehearing conference as
laid out below in our previous email.

I am also attaching a copy of the Declaration of Dan Thomas (addressing how
the Settlement is in the public interest) and the matrix developed by PG&E
that compares the terms of the OFO Settlement to those in the Gas Accord.

In order to expedite the process, PG&E has suggested that it, as a
representative of all settlement parties, be the sole signatory to the
Comments.  Therefore, please review the enclosed documents, provide any
revisions and an indication of your assent/dissent to having PG&E sign the
document on your behalf by end of business tomorrow (Thursday, November 18).
The deadline for filing the Comments in Monday, November 22.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.
