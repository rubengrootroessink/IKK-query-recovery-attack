> CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION SUBJECT TO CPUC RULE 51

>
>  As you recall, at the prehearing conference, Judge Biren directed
> the OFO settlement parties to provide her with additional information
> regarding the OFO settlement.  Friday, Nov.12, Patrick Golden and I had a
> follow-up conversation with Judge Biren to confirm the procedure by which
> she desires to receive the information.
>
>  As a result of the call, Patrick and I suggest that the OFO
> settlement parties file joint "Comments Supporting Settlement" on Nov 22,
> along with any other party which may file comments on the settlement.  Our
> comments would encompass the following:
>
> 1) The settlement is in the public interest as attested by an attached
> declaration.
>
> 2) The settlement does not constitute a change in the basic Gas Accord
> settlement; it merely refines implementation details on the Gas Accord.
> As a result, no hearings are necessary on the settlement.
>
> 3) Neither SB1602 nor 1421 impact immediate Commission approval of the
> settlement.
>
> 4) The settlement is intended to be a final, not an interim, settlement.
>
>  With respect to Judge Biren's request for declarations (which she
> reconfirmed despite agreeing that Rule 51 does not require declarations),
> Patrick and I discussed having the settling parties provide one
> declaration from PG&E outlining the reasons why the settlement is in the
> public interest, and having the PG&E declarant be authorized to state that
> the following parties authorize him to state that they support his
> declaration.
>
>  Judge Biren confirmed that any replies to our comments would be due
> along with all other reply comments on the settlement.
>
>  If you have any comments or suggestions on this approach, please let
> either Salle Yoo or me know ASAP.
