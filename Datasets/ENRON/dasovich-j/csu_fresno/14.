Jeff - unless a miracle happens, PG&E is not about to back down from the 
quoted interconnect cost. As we discussed in a meeting a month ago, we would 
not escalate this issue unless we had given PG&E a graceful way to back out. 
We are now at a point where the project is DOA unless we can PG&E to agree to 
a few things, such as letting us design and build the interconnection, and 
allowing us to review their design criteria and costing method. 
None of that will happen without some encouragement. 
CSUFresno is ready to blow the lid off through their organization, but we 
need to do our part. One of the reasons I sold them on the substation was 
their perception of our ability to get things done even if it meant standing 
up to the mighty utility. 
We have to find a silver bullet in our organization. Do you have any 
suggestions? Fresno will make the go/no go decision shortly.
