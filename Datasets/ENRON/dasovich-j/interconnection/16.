Jeff - another issue for you to sink your teeth into. 
You may be aware that at San Jose we recently installed a bi-directional 
meter to accommodate the PG&E power purchase agreement (PPA,sell to grid) and 
the regular intake off the grid.
As we positioned ourselves to be the 'buy and sell' MDMA, PG&E has informed 
us, and SJSU, that the PPA stipulates that only PG&E meter data can be used 
to determine power purchase payments. The PG&E ESP Relations Department has 
internally protested this arrangement but the PG&E lawyers apparently 
prevailed. 
Since PG&E was not clear on this during the meter installation arrangement, 
PG&E has now decided to disconnect the outflow channel of the customer-owned 
meter and install its own meter at PG&E expense.
This is a ludicrous but workable solution. Until the PG&E meter is installed, 
our webpage info will be used to determine the payments to SJSU. 
We are currently discussing a similar meter installation at Santa Cruz, and I 
am sure that others will follow on sites where customers have generation. We 
need to convince PG&E that customer-owned meters are just as good if not 
better than their meters and that their position is arcane. Will this be 
covered in the current proceedings before the CPUC?
