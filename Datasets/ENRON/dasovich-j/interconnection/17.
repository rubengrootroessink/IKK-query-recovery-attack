Mike:
Regarding your question about regulatory oversight of chilled water services 
by the CPUC in San Diego, my information indicates that the CPUC does not 
regulate the existing chilled water services in San Diego.  Also, to confirm 
our conversation, San Diego Power & Cooling is operating under what we 
understand is a non-exclusive franchise agreement with the City of San Diego.

I'll have an answer for you shortly on the "common facilities" question you 
posed.
