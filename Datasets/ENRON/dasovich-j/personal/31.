Hi Madeleine,

Have a great time in Chili.....  Just a thought, .....my daughter, Kyala,
has a friend who's family runs a river fishing and horseback riding
vacation place in Argentina....email Ky a <amiga@northcoast.com> to ask how
to contact them, if you are interested.

I'd love for you folks to come up again in January, although I will only be
here for a few days out of the month.  However, Helene could "lead" your
ride, and I'll bet Harvey would like to  join you.  I'll be on the
millenium trek from Jan 13th on.   I'm here from FEb 10th to 22nd, then
gone for another couple weeks.  I'm planning for "special" rides once a
month for the next year....would love to have you and yours be here for as
many of them as possible!

Here's the info for them...

Rates: $195 per day/arrange your own lodging & meals/ bring your own lunch/
English or Western horses available/ join other compatable RRR riders.
Sign up for as many/few days each weekend as you like.  Carpool information
from San Francisco Bay area available.

Also available: 3 ($75.00) or 4 hour ($100) rides.  If you would prefer to
have a "private" excursion, just whomever is in your group with a guide,
surcharge of  $25 (3 hours), $35 (4 hours, or $45 (all day) applies.
