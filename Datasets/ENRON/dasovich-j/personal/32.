I've often mentioned Porlock Vale to the group as a great place to visit.
Jeff Walker recently asked me about my impressions.  Curious, I decided to
see if Porlock Vale has a web site up and running and it does.  Just looking
at it makes me long to go back.  I'd say the pictures of the facilities and
the comments are fairly accurate of what one can expect to find there.
Thought you all might be interested in a look see.

Sorry I missed you on Saturday.  Hope to see you soon.
