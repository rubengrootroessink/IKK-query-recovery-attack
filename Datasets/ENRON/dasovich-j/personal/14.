Here's the e-mail I sent, thought I'd try out the address.

All his complaining turned out to be real after all.  Peter left Landels in
a group of six environmental partners (including Landels' biggest rainmaker)
on Friday and is now a partner at Farella, Braun and Martell.  It is a
medium-size, SF-based firm of about 100 lawyers that did not have an
environmental dept before.  There was a lot of drama at Landels over the
last month as this was taking place, but Peter is very happy to be leaving
and thinks the new firm is going to work out great.  I don't know, but they
do have a wine country office and represent Mondavi and Frog's Leap and a
few others so I might get a weekend trip or at least some wine out of the
deal.  You can read all about it in the SF Legal Recorder and Daily Journal
legal newspapers from last week.  Peter's group is covered in Friday's
editions.  Peter's new office number is 954-4940 and is at pmodlin@fbm.com.

I'm still plugging away for your so-called competition.  How's life?  How's
school?
