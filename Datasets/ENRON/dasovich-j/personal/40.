Jeff,
I will send you a fax tomorrow that outlines the financial planning process.  
I believe you will find that it a worthwhile exercise.  I would also like to 
better understand the phantom stock program.  I will ask a few questions 
around here and see what I can find out for you.

Regards,

Kevin Rolens
