     Hi all,

     Have been copied on the cruise email exchanges and agree with the July
     time frame reminding all of Dad's usual July 4th Keewatin excursion,
     important or not. Will attempt on my end to garnish feedback from
     those I know who have made the same cruise. My cruise is going
     remarkably well amidst Navy wargames etc.

     See you all at Mom's retirement party!

     Steve

My travel agent is sending me some brochures.  1-800-cruises called back with
more info too.  I will look at it all when I get back and we can discuss.
What about dinner out? Do we still want to do that? If so, dates that work
for you all?

Have a great time at Mom's party next week.  Add my best wishes for any and
all toasts.

Debbie
