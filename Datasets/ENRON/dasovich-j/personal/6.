For safe keeping today I reserved:solarium room; walden; redwood suite for
22nd, 23th, 24th. Great that Prentice can come! If she doesn't want to go on a
longer ride maybe she and Rob could cut off early...all depends on what she
wants and if Rob comes along. I'm all up for inviting Carl. I think he might
have a consulting gig in VA but I'm not sure. Want me to send an email to the
gang? I'm up for riding on Friday, Sat and 1/2 day on sunday or one day less.
Let me know your preference. Will you coordinate with Lari?
