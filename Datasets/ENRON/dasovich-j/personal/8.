Hi Jeff,

It will be great to see you guys again.? I have a trek July 10-16 with 28 
riders....so that week is definitely out!? We are really becoming extremely 
busy, so I'm glad you are planning early, as some weekends we totally book 
up.? (I presume we're talking about a weekend.....)? So, is July 22, 23 or 
July 29, 30 better for you?? How many will be coming, and for how many days?? 
I have bought 9 new horses this past month....want to try some of them out, 
or stick with the tried and true???? Russia is now a gelding, but I bought 
two Arabian stallions....we'll see which (if any) of them remain so....

We no longer routinely provide lunches on all day rides, by the way, but can 
do so for an additional $15 per lunch, with prior warning.?? 

Jeff Green's telephone number is 707-964-7346.? He's a busy guy, also.? Isn't 
country living supposed to be relaxing?

Re. the NY Times article (and all the reprints in newspapers all over the 
country).....be careful what you wish for!

But getting a message from you reminds me of what I love most about this 
business.....the opportunity to meet and schmooze with folks like you and 
yours!

Ciao,

Lari
