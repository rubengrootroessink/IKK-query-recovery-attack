Hi All,

We are already down a quarter of the Macro course and you'd have got
a sense of the class, weekend sections and the homework etc.

As the class rep, I would like to solicit your feedback/comments to
shape/improve the remainder of this course.

In particular, send me(kannan@haas) or Cathy(langridg@haas) your thoughts on

1. Class topics/discussions, participation issues...
2. Homework - whether would you like it to be assessed?
3. What would you like to see in the sections, how should it be done?
4. Class notes/handouts, newspaper articles...
5. Some of you had expressed concern over broad nature of class discussions
and how to crystallize this for the final exam? Anymore issues on the Final?
6. Whether you would like a mid-term?
7. Coverage of sample exam. questions during the section....
8. Final exam review sessions?

and/or anything else that you feel needs to be addressed.

Thanks
Suresh

P.S To clear the air, I am NOT going to enforce late fee for the Monday
section. Since it was agreed upon by the class, and it is for charity,
I would like this to be voluntary. ;-))
