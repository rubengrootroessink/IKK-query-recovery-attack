Hi everyone,

For this Saturday's section, I would like you guys to read (if you
haven't already) the article "Restructuring gives Japan's workers
culture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan's French boss have wide
implications for Japan's jobs-for-life practices"

from the 11/3 Fin. Times.

Please think about how you might answer the following questions:

1. Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid off
workers from Nissan?

2. Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less, and older
workers more, Does this policy make sense?

3. Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to
layoff fewer workers?

I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.  Also please note
that section is in C135.

In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil
that Prof. Levine sent out.

Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting
(from the FT) which discusses the dangers of "debt deflation". If we
have time I might discuss this as well.

See you on Saturday.
