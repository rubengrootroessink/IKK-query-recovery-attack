        Some Open Economy Macroeconomics

        Accounting:  Recall that Net Exports =3D NX =3D Exports - Imports.
Also, in
an open economy, Y =3D C + I + G + NX.  When exports rise, foreigners buy m=
ore=20
of
our output; thus, aggregate demand for domestically produced goods rises. =
=20
When
imports rise we are buying from foreigners, so imported purchases do not en=
ter
domestic aggregate demand.

        NX =3D trade surplus =3D -trade deficit =3D net borrowing from abro=
ad.  When
NX is negative (imports > exports), we have a trade deficit.  This is finan=
ced
by borrowing from abroad.  To a first approximation, when the US spends mor=
e=20
on
exports than it earns on imports, it needs to borrow to make up the
difference.

        The trade deficit is not exactly equal to borrowing from abroad=20
because
of the returns from net foreign assets.  When the US was a creditor nation,=
 it
also made money on its investments abroad--this income permitted a modest=
=20
trade
deficit without borrowing.  Now, as a debtor nation, a modest trade surplus=
 is
required to avoid the need for new borrowing.  (We are also ignoring=20
government
buying and selling of currencies.)  The Current Account Surplus =3D Exports=
 -
Imports + interest and profits received from net foreign assets.

        Exchange rates:  An exchange rate is the price of one currency in=
=20
terms
of another.  For example, a French Franc (FF) costs 15.7? yesterday, while =
it
was 10? when I traveled in France in 1985.

        The US currently has floating exchange rates, meaning that the valu=
e=20
of
the dollar fluctuates.  The is about 105.8 yen today, but has varied from
103.76 to 124.44 in the last 12 months.  Thus, the dollar bought fewer yeni=
t
weakenedover much of the last year.

        Under fixed exchange rates there would, in principle, be no day-to-=
day
changes in the exchange rate.  The Federal Reserve would buy and sell dolla=
rs
and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed.  The float is a lit=
tle
bit "dirty," since the Fed and other central banks intervene on currency
markets (i.e., buy and sell dollars) to affect the value of the dollar.

        Unlike the U.S., most nations in the world fix their exchange rates
with
someone.  A few dozen use common currencies: the West African Franc is used=
 by
many former French colonies and Panama uses the $U.S.  Other countries such=
 as
Argentine or Hong Kong promise to keep as many U.S. dollars (or DM) as they
have circulating currency; this "currency board" arrangement makes a fixed
exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency, th=
ere
are always dollars or DM to redeem them.

        The value of the dollar: Many factors affect the value of the
dollar: US
and foreign aggregate demand, U.S. and foreign interest rates, speculative
bubbles, and so forth.  The dollar becomes stronger (i.e., can buy more of =
a
foreign currency) when US real interest rates (r) are high.  If r is high,=
=20
then
foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into US banks and recei=
ve
the high interest rate.  When the demand for dollars goes up, so does its=
=20
price
in terms of foreign currencies -- it gets stronger.

The net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate (weaken)=
=20
when:


     *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. goods (U.S. exports low, foreigne=
rs
importing little);

     *   US want to buy foreign goods (U.S. imports high, foreigners
exporting a
lot).  US AD high implies leakage to foreign markets, IM high.

     *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. assets, often when U.S. interest
rates
are low.

     *  U.S. wants to buy foreign assets, often when foreign real interest
rates
are high.

     *  People think $ will get even weaker.  This adds a speculative
dimension,
so speculative bubbles sometimes appear to be important, as are expectation=
s=20
of
foreign or US changes in policy.

        A Morality Play of International Trade

Chris and Pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at Kip's.

Chris: Pat, I don't see how you can be for free trade.  If Taiwan grows fas=
ter
than us, we will lose.

Pat: Chris, you clearly do not understand the great economist Ricardo's ide=
a=20
of
Comparative Advantage.

C: That's for sure, I don't.  Wazzat?

P: Comparative advantage is what you are least worst, or most best at.  For
example, this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the world's fast=
est
typist, but hired a secretary nevertheless.  He was perhaps 5 times as
productive as she was as an entrepreneur, but only 3 times as productive as=
 a
typist--thus, he had absolute advantage in both, but she had comparative
advantage in typing.

C: So what does that have to do with free trade?

P: An example may clarify.  Step over to this handy blackboard, and let me
write a bit.  First, imagine a world with two countries, the US and Taiwan,=
=20
and
two goods, computers and wine.  Further, assume that labor is the only inpu=
t
into production.  Each country has 100 hours of labor.

First consider a case with no trade, when each nation's output equals their
consumption:

                        USA WITH NO TRADE


        Product                 Productivity            Output

        computers               30 hrs / PC              2
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          20

          total hours =3D 30 * 2 + 2 * 20 =3D 100


                  TAIWAN WITH NO TRADE

        Product              Productivity               Output

        computers               10 hrs / PC              8
        wine                    1 hrs / bottle          20

          total hours =3D 10 * 8 + 1 * 20 =3D 100


Note that Taiwan makes computers in 1/3 the US time, and wine in 1/2 the US
time.  Thus, Taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers.  Tai=
wan
has comparative advantage (is most best at) computers.  US has comparative
advantage (is least worse at) wine.

Now let's see what happens if we permit trade.  The US will specialize in=
=20
wine,
what it is best at.  The world price will be about 12 bottles of wine per P=
C=20
in
the world with trade.

                     USA WITH TRADE

        Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption


        computers               30 hrs / PC              0        2
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26



          total hours =3D 0 * 30 + 2 * 50 =3D 100
          consumption of wine =3D production - 24 sold to Taiwan
          consumption of computers =3D 2 bought from Taiwan


                   TAIWAN WITH TRADE

        Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption


        computers       10 hrs / PC             10          8
        wine            1 hrs / bottle           0         24


          total hours =3D 10 * 10 + 0 * 1 =3D 100


Both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade.  (The ex=
act
price with free trade, and therefore the amount of consumption in each=20
country,
depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors.)
Thus, in a world of comparative advantage, trade helps both countries! =20
Nations
should specialize in what they do best.  Complete specialization, as in thi=
s
example, is an extreme case. As Adam Smith pointed out 200 years ago,
specialization permits all to grow wealthier.

C: Your argument assumes quite a bit.  Implicit in your example is the
assumption that when the US quits producing computers, all of those Cory-ha=
ll
types be magically transformed into Vit & Eno majors from Davis.  If we are=
 in
a recession, then the computer workers who lose their jobs won't get new jo=
bs;
policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa=
se
aggregate demand.

P: You are recommending "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies, since any gain in o=
ur
demand is offset by losses to our neighbors'.  If we get started on that ta=
ck,
the whole world loses.  Not everyone can increase demand by restricting
imports!

C: Even without the macroeconomic problem, there is still the unemployment
caused by free trade destroying industries.  How will all the ex-computer f=
olk
get the skills to make wine?

P: You are correct, and both US computer makers and Taiwanese wine makers=
=20
(both
companies and employees) prefer not to have trade in the short run.  The po=
int
is that the winners (i.e., US wine makers, Taiwanese computer makers, and
consumers in both countries) win more than the losers lose.

C: If free trade brings so many benefits, then it should bring enough
prosperity to compensate the losers.  It is not fair to the computer worker=
s
that they bear the cost of adjustment.  It makes sense to tax some of the
winners, and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain.

Full employment is not your only key assumption.  You also assume that mark=
ets
are competitive, so that firms make no monopoly profits.  In fact, it appea=
rs
that some industries make big profits.  When we lose market share in these
industries, the capital flows to a less profitable industry.

P: Again, I must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an=
d
most Americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home.  In general,
free trade eliminates monopoly profits, and will help consumers enormously.

C: Yes, but in addition to there being high-profit industries, there are
high-wage industries, so workers care which industry they are in.  When we=
=20
lose
market share in these industries, the workers move to industries with lower=
=20
pay
and lower productivity.  Autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not
making a marginal switch to their next best-paying job.

For example, Boeing has traditionally made big profits, and paid its worker=
s
well.  When Europeans subsidized Airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing
jobs, we lost both those high profits, and the workers had to move to
lower-wage employers.

P: I agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a
nation's welfare, if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and high-wage jo=
bs.
Nevertheless, it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized, and=20
markets
were more competitive.  In the US today, both imports and exports are mostl=
y
made in high-wage jobs.  Thus, we should favor the expansion of trade, not
restrictions.

C: Your hypothetical situation is irrelevant, since other nations are
subsidizing.  Japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco=
me
big enough to compete internationally--then, watch out!

P: Do you really think that the US steel, auto and computer industries are =
too
small to compete internationally?

C: Well, I have to admit that USX, GM and IBM are not what one usually thin=
ks
of as part of infant industries.  But the Japanese also subsidize industrie=
s
and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business.
Once they have a monopoly, then they really gouge.

P: Have the Japanese really increased prices of color TVs, RAM chips, or ot=
her
goods?  Anti-dumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to=
=20
cut
prices--price cuts that would benefit US consumers.

Even with an uneven playing field, I disagree with you.  As usual with
protectionists, you ignore consumers.  When European subsidies created Airb=
us,
Airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive.  US
consumers won in terms of lower airfares--something you forgot to stress in
your arguments about Boeing's loss of high profits and high-wage jobs.

I am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of
industries, since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into
lobbying.  The large firms of the US steel industry have been incredibly
successful at lobbying for protection.  This protection has mostly protecte=
d=20
an
inefficient oligopoly, at great cost to US consumers.

C: But we sometimes need protection as a stick, to beat foreigners into=20
opening
their markets to us.

P: While protection can be a stick, it is not easy to wield.  It seems most
likely to lead to a trade war, where retaliation by foreigners leads them t=
o
close markets to us if we restrict trade.

Usually when we run protectionism, it is in the form of the misnamed
"voluntary" export restraint (VER), like the one that we have with the=20
Japanese
for automobiles.  These basically require the foreigners to form a cartel,
lower sales, and increase price.  I do not know why the US government helps
foreigners run cartels that hurt US consumers!  Anti-trust policy is suppos=
ed
to restrict cartels.  The auto VERs cost consumers over $100,000 for each
US job
that is saved.

C:  Well, I am not convinced.  All of your arguments concerning the advanta=
ges
of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage, which you
assume is somehow granted by nature.  In today's high-tech industries,
comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated
technologies, not by weather or natural resources.

P: If comparative advantage is won by experience, then experience in produc=
ing
becomes a sort of investment.  Why can't US firms undertake investments tha=
t
are profitable?  You cannot seriously believe that IBM is too small to comp=
ete
with foreigners.

C: But there are spillovers from one industry to another.  The experience o=
f
Silicon Valley, for example, shows that when one part of high-tech does wel=
l,
other parts learn from it and do well also.

Even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive
externalities that there is a role for public subsidies.  For example, an
innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme=
nt.
In the example above, when new computer technologies are developed, only th=
e
Taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise=
 in
PC manufacture.

P: I agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage=
d.
I think that support of university research, coupled with an R&D tax credit
makes more sense than protectionism.

You, on the other hand, seem to be promoting an "industrial policy," in whi=
ch
the government picks winners to promote.  Didn't the billions of dollars th=
at
France and Britain poured into the Concorde supersonic transport, as well a=
s
wastage of the US with Synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria=
l
policy won't work?

C: Well aren't you self-righteous.  The US has always had a multitude of
vigorous and expensive industrial policies, they have just gone under a=20
variety
of other names and have never been coordinated to work together.  Agricultu=
re
receives billions in subsidies, steel and textiles have quotas on imports,
Lockheed and Chrysler received government-backed loans, and housing gets th=
e
mortgage interest deduction.  Perhaps most importantly, a vast proportion o=
f
our research is funded by the military, which has always looked to advantag=
es
for certain industries.

All I want is a rational and democratic industrial policy.  We should
coordinate
our goals, and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do=
=20
not
work to cross-purposes.  For example, any bailouts or protection from impor=
ts
should be short run, and explicitly tied to promises to invest in new=20
machinery
and new skills for workers.  New technologies to be promoted should be chos=
en
by democratically-chosen representatives, not by nameless bureaucrats at DA=
RPA
(the Defense Advanced Projects Research Administration)--an agency almost
nobody has heard of.

P: I would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha=
t
subsidies I give.  Nevertheless, I grant you that if subsidies are given th=
ey
should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves=
t,
not just enjoy high current wages and profits.

C: You're starting to talk sense now.  We must always keep in mind that=20
America
needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness.

P: I don't understand this word "competitiveness."  I, like you, would like=
 US
productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous, and have more
resources to care for the disadvantaged, the environment, and so forth.  I=
=20
care
about the absolute level of US growth, not the relative level.

C: But if the US growth more slowly than Japan, we will lose our standing a=
s a
world power!

P: I am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful.  It is=
 ok
with me if the US must consult with its allies before invading various smal=
l
open economies.

C: Well, I have won enough points from you that I should probably stop.  Yo=
u
agree that (at least in theory) protectionism can help keep high-profit,
high-wage, and high-spillover industries at home, and raise national output=
.

P: I must agree in theory, and also remind you that the industries have
political clout to receive protectionism are often the worst-run. =20
Furthermore,
any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars, and they make
everyone
worse off.

C: Hey, that's enough economics talk.  Let's go have a beer--Anchor Steam, =
