Dear All,

After listening to the various viewpoints and concerns expressed in our
last conference call, I believe that the panel options listed in Option 3
of Rob's draft might be most effective in producing the type of discourse
that we are seeking.

I propose that we schedule a conference call for this Friday afternoon,
September 1, at 4PM EDT. I mentioned that I have reserved the Krutch
Theater (max.capacity 375) for the week of November 13-17. I have since
been informed that I can only hold the whole week through Wednesday,
September 6, therefore, it will be important to narrow the options down
very soon if we can.

Best wishes,
Heather
