Annette,
Please make a note of these names for our press outreach.  The Wall Street
Journal's reporter is Rebecca Smith.   I hear that the New York Times has a
reporter getting interested in the issue named Neela Banerjee.  Maybe I should
contact them, I'm not sure.  Either way, we owe you a more complete 
description
of the issues to be addressed by the forum so you can talk to people.
