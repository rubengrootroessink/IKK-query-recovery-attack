Hey! Everyone seems to miss a point I tried to make clear. The collaboration
I suggested is not with Haas. Don't mention that name! The collaboration is
with IBER and UEI, two research organizations that are not formally
connected with any school. Shapiro suggested that they could offer some
modest help with resources, and we have to figure out if it's worth asking
for any. Maybe if we are planning to keep the "conference fees" for GSPP
then it is better not to ask them for any money (and thus keep clear our
claim to any fees). Reactions?

Monday is Labor Day by the way.

Cheers,
Lee

Shall we try to talk again Monday?  I think I will talk to Borenstein to see
what the Haas folks have in mind.

I tried to capture everyone's comments.  Allen, you might want to explain
more
about your panel suggestions since I didn't do them justice.  As you'll see
I
took the liberty of offering a new characterization of the panels that I
didn't
bring up on the call.  Everything on there is offered as a strawman to be
criticized and changed.
