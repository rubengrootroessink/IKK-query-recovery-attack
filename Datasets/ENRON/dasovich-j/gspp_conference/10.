  Please confirm that this schedule works.  It is the only day
that worked for everyone.  Jeff Dasovich is still in the Sierras so I can 
check
in with him Monday.

  The agenda sounds simple but don't be deceived, there are many
many options.  Please be prepared with a list of 3 top speaker choices.

  1.  Topics of panels.

  2.  Speaker list.  Try to agree on an 'A' list who we can start
calling and a 'B' list of alternates.
