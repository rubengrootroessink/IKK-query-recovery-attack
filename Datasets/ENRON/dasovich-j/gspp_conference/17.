Jeff,
Annette Doornbos called from the school and we talked over the forum a little.
As for cost her initial thought was in the range of $10,000 for an early 
evening
forum including dinner for speakers afterwards, with these costs mostly being 
in
the form of paying for the school's events person to organize and advertise.  
An
all day event would be higher.

Let's try to set up a conference call this week or early next week so the 
three
of us plus Heather Cameron and possibly the Dean can agree on a general plan.
Agenda items are:

1) Structure of the forum:  all day or afternoon/evening.

We should all think about whether an all day event would have a big enough
audience because its a bigger commitment.  We could probably do it either way
but we need to decide how much effort and investment we're ready for. Since 
this
is sort of a test drive/demonstration project, we might want to shoot for one
panel with 4-5 speakers representing opposing viewpoints plus a moderator.  I
think that type of forum might maximize attendance and press attention.  
While I
tend to think the issues are so complex that its hard to address them in such 
a
short time, they have presidential debates in this time frame that are 
certainly
much more broad yet useful.  It could be like a congressional hearing, yet
controlled by policy questions rather than politics.  We might think about
asking the Dean moderate to raise the profile and the objectivity, and he's a
strong presence who can keep people in line.

2) Sponsorship

Jeff, if Enron supports this, are there certain companies or groups it not 
want
to jointly sponsor an event with?  Its in the school's interest to have a
variety of funders so as to appear more objective.

3)  Description for discussions with press

We need to put together a one-pager or so on the potential speakers and 
issues,
to assist Annette in seeking input from the press.  She may contact a GSPP 
alum
who owns (?) runs (?) the Sacramento Bee and other newspapers plus the UC 
public
affairs office.

4)  Initial speaker list (the "shoot high" list).

Please respond and we'll try to set something up.
Rob
