> As a member of the alumni board of the Goldman School of Public Policy at
> U.C.
> Berkeley, I am writing to guage your interest in a debate forum, held at the
> policy school, on appropriate policy responses to the current economic and
> reliability crisis in California.  The idea is to advance reasoned debate
> with
> top academics and top policy makers, using jargon-free language the general
> public can follow.  I work for an independent electric market analysis group
> in
> the Mid-Atlantic area, and my goal here is to follow the policy school's
> reputation for independent and careful analysis to challenge the views of
> the
> many various emotionally and politically motivated advocates.  We have no
> preconceived agenda other than trying to objectively advance public policies
> that benefit the public.  The school and a few of the top economists in the
> field are very interested in this idea.  I've read your articles on the
> subject
> in the Chronicle and our hope is that you will find such a forum useful and
> newsworthy.  What do you think?  We would try to make it suit your needs if
> you
> have opinions on the timing, forum, and speakers.
