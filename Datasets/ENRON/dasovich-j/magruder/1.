Hi Jeff,

Tim Hamilton asked me to give you my thoughts about the above mentioned 
tariff.

1) SCHEDULE G-CFS-CORE FIRM STORAGE (page 1 of 1)
  
 * How will PG&E implement the storage charge - will they retro this to April 
2000?
 * Is the storage rate applicable to our monthly storage inventory or monthly 
storage capacity?
  Our monthly storage inventory is about 300,000 dth and monthly storage 
capactity is about 4,000 dth.
    300,00dth X $0.10 = $30,000/month
     4,000 dth X $0.10 = $400/month

2) RULE 14 - CAPACITY ALLOCATION AND CONSTRAINT OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE (page 
11 of 18)
 OFO NONCOMPLIANCE CHARGE EXEMPTION:

 * The $1,000 per month exemption gives the small guy the right to be 
non-compliant.
   


3) SCHEDULE G-BAL-GAS BALANCING SERVICE FOR INTRASTATE TRANSPORTATION 
CUSTOMERS (page 7 of 11)
 SELF BALANCING OPTION:

 * The Self-Balancing credit of $0.005/dth is a good concept but we could not 
take advantage of that because our usage fluctuates too much from   day to 
day.
