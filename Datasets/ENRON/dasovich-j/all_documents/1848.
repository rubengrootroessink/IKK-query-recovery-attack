Dear Jeff:

This message provides more information about sponsoring the UC Berkeley Nov.
13 deregulation summit and the two sponsorship levels. Three UC
institutions, the Goldman School of Public Policy, the Competition Policy
Center, and the Energy Institute, are jointly organizing the summit. To
cover the costs of the conference we need financial support.

Enron Sponsorship will support the balanced effort to review where we are in
terms of the deregulation of electricity, and where we should be going, and
also to disseminate the conference proceedings to a larger audience. With a
contribution of $10,000, Enron will be designated as a Major Sponsor. A
contribution of $5000 will designate Enron as a Sponsor. Contributions are
fully tax deductible and will be acknowledged in all printed materials
distributed to the press, the UC community, at the conference itself and in
all related internet materials.

Our first large mailing to over 2500 individuals is scheduled to go out next
week, and will include Sponsor acknowledgments. We will be very pleased to
have your Sponsorship be a part of this first mailing. With your support, we
will also be able to disseminate a summary of the conference proceedings to
a broad public audience who would appreciate an objective presentation of
issues raised by electricity deregulation and different viewpoints on them.

I hope this clarification is useful, and to hear from you shortly. I would
be happy to provide any further information you may desire or personally
answer your questions.  In addition, our Special Projects Director, Heather
Cameron (hcameron@uclink.berkeley.edu, 510-642-9437), will be directly
responsible for all public relations, publicity and conference materials,
and can answer any questions about these. For reference, I have appended a
brief description of the conference below.

Best,
Lee

P. S. If you wish to purchase 10 tickets at $200 each (non-tax deductible)
and make a charitable contribution of $8,000, we will be happy to designate
you as a Major Conference Sponsor.  Similarly, should you wish to purchase 5
conference tickets and make a charitable contribution of $4000, we will
designate you as a Conference Sponsor. You are very welcome to purchase as
many additional tickets as you wish.

The Summit Conference on Electricity: Deregulation, Reregulation, or What?
University of California's Goldman School of Public Policy, Competition
Policy Center, and Energy Institute are hosting an energy summit on policy
options to remedy problems with electricity de-regulation.  The summit will
take place this November 13, from 12:30-6PM, on the UC Berkeley Clark Kerr
campus in Berkeley, CA.

The focus, and the audience, will be national but heavily informed and
influenced by the California crisis.  The conference will evaluate at a high
level (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2) how the many pitfalls
encountered so far can be avoided and remedied.  The university will convene
an open, honest and reasoned exchange between high level decision-makers
from various perspectives:  industry, regulators, consumers, legislators,
academics, and market and system operators.  The format entails two
roundtable discussions with six speakers and a moderator.  Each speaker will
make a brief opening statement that identifies key issues, followed by panel
discussion and an audience Q&A period.  We expect a live audience of about
200 people including a large press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively
offered to provide streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced
group of sponsors from APPA to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have confirmed positive
responses from Loretta Lynch's office (Chair, CPUC) and from PJM CEO Phil
Harris, and preliminary positive responses from Steven Littlechild
(England's primary electricity regulator) and Laura D'Andrea Tyson (Dean,
Haas School of Business and former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council. We are awaiting responses from U.S.
Represenatives Edward Markey and Joe Barton, and FERC Commissioner Bill
Massey. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist and UCEI head Severin Borenstein. We also expect
to have several speakers who are energy company CEOs, state legislators, and
consumer advocates.
