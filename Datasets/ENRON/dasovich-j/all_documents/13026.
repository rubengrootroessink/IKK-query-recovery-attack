Energy Committee Members:
As many of you kindly brought to my attention last week, Monday, May 28 is a
recognized holiday.  Therefore, the energy committee meeting scheduled for
that day has been postponed.  Unfortunately, the Motorola site on Kifer Road
is not available next week.

Thanks to Mike Brown and the kindness and flexibility of Motorola, the
energy committee has been offered a meeting room at Motorola's San Jose site
located at 3041 Orchard Parkway for Wednesday, May 30 at 3:00pm.  Due to a
very limited space capacity (20-25 people only), we need to know by close of
business Friday, May 25 how many people expect to participate on Wednesday's
meeting.

However, we do hope to accommodate all committee members who plan to
participate in this meeting and do not want to exclude any member because of
limited capacity.  If your organization has a meeting room that can
accommodate our group (40-50 people) on May 30 from 1-5pm (to accommodate
the Business Continuity Subcommittee as well) please let me know ASAP.  I
would like to give Mike confirmation by this Friday if we will be using the
Motorola facility.

Please RSVP before close of business on Friday by responding to this e-mail
or calling 408-501-7870.
