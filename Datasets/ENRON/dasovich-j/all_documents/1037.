Mary:

Attached is a copy of the data request for FERC's Bulk Power  Investigation=
.
Please consider this e-mail as our official data  request.

As far as the deadline, we'd like to have the information as soon as  possi=
ble
but we realize that doesn't give you much time.=01; As I mentioned,  some o=
f the
information probably won't require much effort, but we are asking =20
for=01;specifics
on generators which may take longer.=01; Just do the best  you can.=01; Als=
o, if you
find that you have the information in a different  format from the way we'v=
e
requested it, that will probably be fine for our  purposes.

Please feel free to call if you have any  questions.

Thanks.
