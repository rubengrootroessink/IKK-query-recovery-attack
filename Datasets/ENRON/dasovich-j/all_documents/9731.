Bill,

In light of the response below, let's change gears.  In lieu of preparing the 
three scenarios previously requested, what we would like to do at the 12:30 
pm PSTconference call, in addition to a general discussion of the results of 
your original analysis,  we would like you to modify the study with regard to 
the following 3 issues; 1) Assume that SB47X is not implemented, 2) Utilize a 
9% discount rate, and 3) Assume a dry season as most likely case.  It is our 
hope that you will be able to complete that analysis in time for the call.  
Please express the results in terms of cents/kwh and percentage increase over 
existing commercial/industrial rates.

Thanks.  Look forward to speaking with you later.

Robert

Robert,

Thanks for the note. A conference call at 12:30 pm PST would work for us.
However, on that call, we will not be able to present results of the
additional scenarios that you defined in your e-mail. The model that we
used was an annual rate model. The analysis that you are proposing would
require a monthly model, which would take additional time to develop.
Perhaps we should discuss this prior to the call at 2:30 pm CST. Roger and
I will give you a call when we get into the office on Wednesday morning.
This should be around 11 am CST.

Best regards,

Bill
