Thanks for the tip.  We made the change.  You didn't miss much on the call 
this a.m.  Most people were scratching their heads wondering what precisely 
the Commission was expecting to get from this proceeding.  We talked about 
the "focus" of our comments, making sure that most of the important elements 
of the Comprehensive Settlement were to be discussed.  With the possible 
exception of ORA, I think we've got our original contingent intact and will 
be represented in tomorrow's meeting.

Mark will be giving our little presentation for TW.  Please feel free to 
pitch in and help Mark out if the Commission or others in the audience start 
taking shots at TW.  I look forward to hearing from you guys after its over.  
Good luck.

Regards,
Jeff

Nice job.  Only comment is that the crazies in California now find market 
power under every rock and in every pipeline.  I think there's a chance that 
someone might assert that 20% share equals market power.  Might want to say 
"significant supplier" or something similar.  No big deal, but I thought I'd 
flag it for your consideration.

Best,
Jeff
