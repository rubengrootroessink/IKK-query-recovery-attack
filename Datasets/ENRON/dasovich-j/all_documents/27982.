Dear Energy Committee Members:

After nearly a year of acting as one of your two co-chairs, it is time for
me to focus more completely on my duties at Exodus Communications and to
bring in new leadership to the Energy Committee. In light of this change,
John Redding and I felt it important for the Committee to choose a well
qualified and experienced replacement co-chair that will lead the Energy
Committee to continued successes.

After taking nominations for over three weeks, we held formal elections
during yesterday's regular committee meeting. Paul Stephens, Joe Desmond,
and Nayeem Sheikh were nominated, and responded with intelligent answers to
questions given by the committee and it's leadership. After over an hour of
questions and thorough answers from the three nominees, your committee
selected Joe Desmond to replace myself as your new co-chair.

Joe has a wealth of impressive experience in energy and leadership and a
thorough knowledge of energy and the associated issues facing the SVMG
companies. He has been an active and valued member of the Energy Committee,
and has provided much leadership on salient issues, including Blackout
Notification, Real Time Pricing, and Direct Access.

Please welcome and join me in congratulating Joe Desmond as your new
co-chair. Along with John Redding, I am certain these two will lead the
Committee on the important energy issues of your company, and improve upon
the already lengthy list of successes this Committee has achieved for all
SVMG companies. They will help to grow the recognition and stewardship the
SVMG Energy Committee has attained amongst our peer groups and state and
federal policy makers.

I know that Joe will come to speed immediately on leading your Committee.
Nonetheless, I will wane my involvement over the next several weeks and
assist Joe in transitioning into his new role. We are lucky to have such
great leadership by both John and Joe, and I know we will have many more
great successes to come. Congratulations and thank you to all of our three
nominees, and welcome Co-Chair Joe Desmond.
