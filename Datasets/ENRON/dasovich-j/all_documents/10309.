			Spotlight on Leeuwin Estate
			
			In 1972, Robert Mondavi journeyed to the Southern Hemisphere in search of 
"the best vineyard land in the world." When he visited a former cattle ranch 
near Margaret River in Western Australia, he found what he'd been looking 
for. He subsequently helped owner Denis Horgan to develop what has since 
become one of Australia's great vineyards: Leeuwin Estate. Wine Spectator 
magazine awarded 15 of Leeuwin's 1980-1996 Chardonnays and Rieslings 90+ 
scores. 
			
			To introduce wine.com subscribers to the wines of Leeuwin Estate, this week 
we're spotlighting its famous white wines: the stunningly complex, highly 
sought-after 1996 Estate Chardonnay -- awarded 92 points by the Spectator and 
now approaching its peak -- and back-to-back vintages of the bright, crisp, 
fruit-and-mineral-infused 1998 Estate Riesling and 1999 Estate Riesling. 
Purchased individually, the prices of these wines add up to $99, but this 
week only, we're offering the package of three for $75 exclusively to our

			That's a Heap-Big Syrah, Kimosabe
			
			Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. Out of the past 
come the thundering hoof beats of a fiery horse with the speed of light, a 
cloud of dust, and a hearty hi-yo.... 
			
			The Rhone Rangers are riding again from 2 to 5 p.m. on Saturday, March 31, 
when their fourth annual wine tasting takes place in the Festival Pavilion at 
San Francisco's Fort Mason. 
			
			The Rhone Rangers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the 
public about wines made from Rhone grapes grown in the United States. To 
American wine drinkers, this will largely mean Syrah, but the Rangers 
recognize a total of 23 grape varieties that are allowed in French Cotes du 
Rhone, including Grenache, Mourvedre, Carignan, Cinsault, Marsanne, 
Roussanne, and Viognier. 
			
			Rhone grapes have been grown in the United States for 100 years, but their 
status has risen dramatically in the last decade. Beginning in the 1980s, a 
loose-knit group of nonconformist winemakers, apparently bored with 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon (and aware that California has a 
Mediterranean climate), began experimenting with Rhone varietals, and by 1991 
there were 19,000 acres of Roussanne, Viognier, Carignan, Grenache, 
Mourvedre, and Syrah planted. In 1997, 13 wineries banded together to form 
the Rhone Rangers, and the following year, 43 producers poured their wines 
for 1,000 people at the group's first public tasting. 
			
			Today the number of member wineries has increased tenfold, including members 
from such decidedly non-Mediterranean locales as Washington, Idaho, and 
Virginia. Meanwhile, the number of attendees at the tasting has tripled. 
			
			Wines poured at the event must contain at least 75 percent Rhone varieties, 
but beyond that regulation, variety rules. Not only is there a choice of 
white wines (Marsanne, Roussanne, and Viognier) in addition to reds (Syrah, 
Grenache, Mourvedre, Carignan, Cinsault), but there's also a selection of dry 
ros,s, a much-loved Rhone staple. 
			
			"We suggest that people figure out [beforehand] how they want to approach the 
tasting," advises Executive Director John Hardman. "You might just want to 
taste Syrah, or maybe only Roussanne or Marsanne. You wouldn't normally go 
back and forth between red and white, but it's fairly easy to clear your 
palate with all the food we have there. And we put out plastic cups so people 
can spit." 
			
			Admission is $45 in advance and $60 the day of the tasting. For more 
information, call the Fort Mason box office at (415) 441-3687 or log onto 
www.RhoneRangers.com. 
			
			In the meantime, check out the selection of Rhone and Rhone-style wines on 
wine.com.

			Wine Team Picks: Burke Owens on Surrendering to Pink
			
			Unlike my daughter Rose, I've never been particularly attracted to the color 
pink. However, when it comes to wine, I make an exception. After all, some of 
my favorite Champagnes -- rich, crisp, and intensely aromatic -- are ros,s, 
and nonbubbly pink wines are absolutely wonderful with food. You will quickly 
find this out by slicing ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella, layering them on 
an open-faced baguette, seasoning with salt, pepper, olive oil, and a touch 
of garlic, and covering all with a chiffonade of fresh basil. This 
combination is downright yummers with a cool glass of dry ros,. 
			
			Pink wines are so thirst quenching, in fact, that I find it's always a good 
idea to keep a couple around the house. For example: 
			
			1999 Andrew Rich Pinot Noir Ros,, Willamette Valley, Oregon, $11.00
			1998 Domaines Bunan Bandol Ros, Moulin des Costes, Provence, France, $16.00
			1999 Dom. de la Noblaie Chinon Rose, Loire Valley, France, $12.00
			Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros,, France, $57.99
			1988 Laurent Perrier Champagne Ros, Cuvee Alexandra Grand Siecle, France, 
$129.95
