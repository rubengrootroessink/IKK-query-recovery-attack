Roger: Please clean up this line of questioning that shows that PG&E is 
fishing for a windfall.  And that their liquidity problem is contrived or at 
least overstated.

Q.  How many MW of generation do you have related to Nuclear?

[Expect answer] About 4000MW

Q. What value have you put on these assets?

[Expect much waffling and an answer close to $0]

Q.  Would you accept, subject to check, that 12 month forward contracts for 
CA are trading at $180/MWh?

A [Expect much wafffling but a high number]

Q.  What is the vaiable (non capital related costs) of nuclear units in the 
next year?

A [Expect $20/MWh]


Q.  Is it true that:

$150/MWH minus $20/MWh = $130/MWh

Q. And that 

4,000 MW at 80% availability factor and 8760 hours per year = 28,000,000 MWh

Q.  And that 

28,000,000 MWh times $130 = 3.6b dolllars

Q.  And would you accept subject to check that PG&E would get to keep $1.8b 
of this amount given its past settlements?

A Yes

Q.  And could you confirm, subject to check 

Your total generation 10,000MW times 60% avail factor times $100/MWh gap 
would result in an increase in value of your existing assets by $8.8 b in 
2001 alone?

Q.  And would you expect there to be more value in 2002?

A Expect lots of weaseling and yes

Q.  And can you confirm your current estimated shortfall is $6b.

Q.  How much did you value your hydro assets at this summer in your previous 
filing?

A.  Expect 2.8 b

Q.  So the increase in value in assets in 2001 alone plus the original value 
of hydro is almost double what your current shortfall is even without 
counting on value from 2002 and beyond?

Q.  Does it strike you that you don't have a debt problem but lack of 
communication to investor problem?

A .  Sure we remove our request and concede everything :) :) :) :) :) :)

Q.  Would you be willing to turn over your existing generation assets to the 
government for $20b today?
