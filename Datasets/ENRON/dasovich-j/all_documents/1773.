Hi Jeff,

I want to thank you for the time you spent with us on the phone today. I
believe you understand the essence of what we are developing at Cambira and
I would like to give you some further explanation.

Cambira develops and markets intelligent optical application networking
solutions that enable Global 2000 enterprises and service providers to
rapidly deploy new integrated application services at the speed of light.

Our optical application networking solutions are targeted to provide
collaboration between disparate enterprise and IT applications or
business-to-business transactions. It consists of EcoNet Enterprise Edition
and Optical Application Router (OAR) that connects disparate enterprise
applications and IT systems or net-markets using any of the broadband access
and optical technologies.

As application-to-application collaboration increases, new solutions will be
required to support and accelerate integrated application service delivery.
Our products are designed to integrate existing enterprise applications and
network technology to protect existing investments in fiber and IT and
provide a migration path to next generation collaborative application
networks.

The Internet has undoubtedly changed the way businesses operate and has for
the most part enhanced global interaction. However, in order to truly
leverage real-time, knowledge-based transactions business must be able to
integrate their static, internal processes with external components to
optimize their overall value. This is the space Cambira's solutions address.
As our Vision Statement reflects, our solutions are designed to give
companies the dynamics to develop competitive intelligence and leverage
their core competencies to succeed in the New Economy.

Vision Statement:

 In the Internet economy, smart companies are relinquishing ownership of
most of their value-chain activities, commonly known as virtual enterprises.
They are relying on real-time information, customer knowledge and leveraging
Internet based partnerships to conduct business. The value of success is
established through "advantaged relationships" with trading partners,
knowing and fulfilling customer needs, anticipating future requirements, and
knowledge to create new products and services based on customer needs.
Customers require "Build to Order, Partner to Fit" based solutions that are
tailored to their requirements. This model relies on real-time knowledge
exchange within the virtual enterprise based on a network of alliances and
partnerships. Cambira solutions enable the creation of the network between
customer, vendor, virtual supply chain partners, and complementary solution
providers that will be known as the Virtual Trading Partner Network (V-TPN).

I hope this gives you a better idea as to why Cambira was created and what
our mission is and I would certainly appreciate the opportunity to give you
a more detailed presentation. Attached are a few slides to give you a more
visual depiction of our aims.  Again, we appreciate your time and I look
forward to future collaboration with you.

Best regards,
