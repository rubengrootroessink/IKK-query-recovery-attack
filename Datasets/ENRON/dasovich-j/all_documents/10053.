This order may be an opportunity to get additional back-up generation quick=
ly=20
installed at customer's facilities in WA State.  It is only applicable for=
=20
onsight energy use - not selling to the grid.

On January 29, 2001 Governor Gary Locke signed Energy Supply Order No. 01-0=
2,=20
suspending regulations pertaining to construction and portable source=20
requirements of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC 173-400-110) and=20
local air pollution control authority regulations adopted under RCW 70.94.1=
52=20
for 30 days.  The 30 days suspension was granted to allow temporary electri=
c=20
generators that may be a major source of air pollution to be installed or=
=20
constructed by utilities and other users of electricity without receiving a=
=20
construction approval from the state. The order allows non-utilities to=20
generate the electricity to offset their existing demand.  However,=20
non-utilities cannot sell the generated electricity.  The purpose of the=20
Order was to get sources generating electricity on line immediately.  The=
=20
order has now been extended to March 27, 2001 and is known as =01&Energy Su=
pply=20
Order No. 01-04.=018  It is likely the extension will continue.=20

The basic differences between this Energy Order and a regular plan approval=
=20
process is

1. Facility is allowed to operate a generator immediately without prior=20
construction approval.  However, the facility has to meet the same=20
requirements as they would if they were applying for a regular construction=
=20
approval and operating permit.
2. No control device is required on the source.  Under the Order, Washingto=
n=20
Department of Ecology will allow a source to operate without control on a=
=20
temporary basis.  They are thinking of defining =01&temporary=018 as less t=
han six=20
months.  After that the source must install a control device.  It is unclea=
r=20
if a construction plan approval will be required to install the control=20
device at that time. =20
3. The facility must obtain offsets or have a plan indicating how they are=
=20
going to get offsets in the Energy Alert notification to the Department. =
=20
There must be enough emission offsets to cover the operating time it would=
=20
normally take to receive a plan approval from the Department.  The normal=
=20
time frame to receive a plan approval from the Department is approximately=
=20
one month. =20

The only advantage with the Order is that a source can operate immediately=
=20
and without control device on a temporary basis as long as they follow all=
=20
the requirements listed.  =20
