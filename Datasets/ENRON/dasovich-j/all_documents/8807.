Here are my first thoughts on this:

If we are to agree to exit fees, which I think we obviously have to to be 
credible.  The definition of, "...costs imposed on the portfolio that are 
directly related to the load of the departing customer,"  should be the value 
of portfolio costs (including generation at embedded costs, QFs at cost, 
contracts, etc.) compared to market.  The LD cannot be just based on the 
liquidation of contract costs, or we don't get the benefit of embedded 
generation value (which today would liquidate as a credit).  This may bite us 
if market costs drop below embedded generation, but we are out of business 
now if we don't get it.  Also, if we don't get the market liquidation value 
of embedded generation then the portfolio gets, all else equal, a lower cost 
resulting from the departing load - not fair or equitable.

Harry raises some good points.  

I am attaching another copy of my comments from this morning--It looks like 
this draft came out before you got these comments.  

I will be traveling without access to my e-mail from 11-4 PST.  Please call 
on my cell phone 713 302 9089 if you have questions.  MDS

Initial comments for discussion:  

Fees (exit, entry):  should be transparent - in absolute terms and formula 
that will be used.  Can notional numbers be posted daily?

One-way tolling:  eliminate re-entry fees.  Puts new and returning customers 
on equal footing and eliminates additional admin burdens.

DWR stranded costs for exit fee:  should be an affirmative obligation on 
their part to mitigate any incremental costs (reselling, etc.)

KW threshold:  we're ok with 100 kw (or lower).

Limit on switching: once a year is reasonable.

Areas to clarify:
DWR carve-out:  if load departs (re-enters) DWR, does it simultaneously 
depart (re-enter) the utility? Assuming a clean break from bundled service, 
is there an exit fee from the utility portion of the bundle?

Closure:  need to specify when exit/re-entry fees no longer apply. 

Open Subscription Period:  if DWR does only 5+ year contracts, does this mean 
there will be no open periods for a long time?
