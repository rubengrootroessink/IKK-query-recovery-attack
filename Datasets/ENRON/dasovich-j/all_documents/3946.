Attached is a summary of several PG&E advice letters. 2057-E is protest  
material, as it establishes all new rate schedules based on PG&E's  
contention that the rate freeze has already?ended.? I will forward  that 
advice letter to you in a separate email.? Let's discuss what we want  to do 
with regard to their filing.? There is no date specified for  comments, but 
assuming the usual 20 days, that means protests are due on  December 12.
?
