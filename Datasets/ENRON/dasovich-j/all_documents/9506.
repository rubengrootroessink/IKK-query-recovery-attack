Here is a slightly reformatted note (1 page) that also adds Competitive 
Default Supply.  Give me your comments ASAP.

It sure doesn't look too good for the forces of "right".

Attached below are talking points for tomorrow morning's meeting with Dave 
Delainey.  Please let me know if you have anything additional to add, or if 
you want to make a suggestion regarding what already is there.  I know there 
is a very slight formatting error on the second page, but we will get that 
corrected first thing in the morning.

Thanks

John
