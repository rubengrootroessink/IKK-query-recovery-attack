Sorry about this gang, but my new computer messed up the e-mail list.
It's 4 am and I think I have fixed it.  Maybe.  Bear with me if you are
getting this for the second time this morning.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."=20

Everyone is getting into the act.? When I started this gig, I was the only=
=20
guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in=20
California.? I wrote about what=01,s new, what=01,s happening, and all the=
=20
important stuff.? This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own=
=20
Burrito.? His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he muscling in o=
n=20
my turf?? Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report=
=20
which looks into every facet of California=01,s power business.? No stone l=
eft=20
unturned. I=01,m telling you, there isn=01,t enough room in this business f=
or all=20
of us.? They need to clear out.=20

With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I=01,m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis a=
nd=20
Let=01,s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?? They re-define our reality =
each=20
week with mind-numbing aplomb.? For example, starting in early June, the PX=
=20
was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading=20
Vehicles.? Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to=
=20
an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year.? This week=
=20
the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE, thereby opening t=
he=20
PX to competition, and emasculating the PX=01,s Block Forward Market. Zip, =
bam,=20
boom.=20

I can=01,t wait to see what next week will bring.? I hear Senator Bowen is=
=20
holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the Governor=
=01,s=20
new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:=20

What=01,s for lunch?=20
Who will sit at the head of the table?=20
Does anyone have good seats for next week=01,s Democratic convention?=20
Is there anyone we haven=01,t indicted yet in the power industry?=20
Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?? It=01,s getting too w=
arm.=20

Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignor=
e=20
the facts, and publish a report.? It makes one want to take a deep breath,=
=20
and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.=20

Things on the Island of California=20
?@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?=20

Well, the answer very clearly is no.? I have been astounded by repeated=20
attempts of SDG&E=01,s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they m=
imic=20
apes.=20

Consider the following.? First, they waltz their default customers into the=
=20
summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale=20
market.? Forgivable in that it is human to err.? The prices skyrocket in=20
June, and they start looking for who to blame.? =01&Must be them damn=20
independent generators,=018 say their managers.? Gary Cotton informs the IS=
O=20
Governing Board that hedging SDG&E=01,s position in the Block Forward Marke=
t=20
wouldn=01,t have made any difference.? There=01,s one nobel laureate who mi=
ssed his=20
prime.=20

Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who=
=20
will assist the utility and their customers.? Nine offers show up at their=
=20
table, and they can=01,t choose any of them.? Again, Mr Cotton tells his fe=
llow=20
ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and we don=01,t to=
 rush=20
since there are many legislative barriers, and, well, the surfing was good=
=20
this week so why spoil it?=20

Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies=20
living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity=
=20
bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.? SDG&E puts a full=
=20
page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing=20
everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO f=
or=20
a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and=
=20
phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap.? I alway=
s=20
thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons.? N=
o=20
secrets in San Diego.=20

But we are not done.? No sir, we are not.? Those buffalo heads who run that=
=20
company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and=
=20
implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight=20
Board.? The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap =
at=20
$250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into=
=20
the ISO and the PX.? The primary reason is that Western power markets are n=
ot=20
workably competitive.? In other words, they want FERC to set a max price on=
=20
what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO ca=
n=20
buy!=20

What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues =
to=20
collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the=
=20
PX.?? These are sales from their stranded assets.? Their grief hasn=01,t ab=
ated=20
their greed.=20

So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win consume=
r=20
confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers and did nothin=
g=20
in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale=
=20
market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably=20
competitive.? Too much time in the direct sun light.=20

Things on the Island of California=20
