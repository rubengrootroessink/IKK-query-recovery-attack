Two new winners for the week - Eldon took first place and Cary took 3rd - we
won't talk about the second place winner.

Another big shift in ranking with Donna, Eldon, Mickey and Steve all moving
up nicely.

No one dropped out of the Last Person Standing pool (those still standing
are indicated by an asterisk)

La Famiglia and Byron brands.
