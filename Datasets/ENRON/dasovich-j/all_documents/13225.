There might be some interest around here to help fund an anti-price cap 
letter or survey from members of the American Economics Association on price 
caps and what to do about the California power crisis.  I believe you have 
done this sort of thing before on some other economics issues.

Do you want to price this out and test the waters to see if some others want 
to join in an effort?
