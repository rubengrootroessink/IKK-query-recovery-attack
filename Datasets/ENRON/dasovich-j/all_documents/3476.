Hi Everyone,

Attached you will find your Spring '01 schedule as of Round I. For those of
you taking elective classes, Round II is another opportunity to make
adjustments to your schedule. Please note the following:

(1) To make any adjustments to your schedule, you must e-mail me with the
changes you'd like to make. In your e-mail, please include which courses you
want to add or drop, how many one-unit courses you would like to have, and
the total number of units you want for the Spring '01 semester. The deadline
to make adjustments to your schedule in Round II is Monday, November 20 at
noon. The next opportunity you will have to make schedule changes will be
through the add/drop process with me in January during the first week of
classes.

(2) If you got into more than one one-unit course and there is a meeting
time conflict, please e-mail me which of the two one-unit courses you prefer
to take.

(3) If you are interested in enrolling in day classes, you may do so by
e-mailing me which course you would like take. Your name will go on a list,
and during the first week of classes, I will find out the availability of
seats in that class. I will then let you know whether you got into the
class.

Remember, Round II of pre-registration is done via e-mail to me, not via
TeleBEARS.

Thanks,

TJ
