About ten days ago, I sent the attached E-mail containing an Assigned
Cmmr.'s Ruling pertaining to the SCE MOU. The  ACR set forth a "model" for
determining revenue requirements for SCE's retained generation. On Friday,
SCE, as directed, filed comments on the Ruling.  Comments from other parties
are due this Friday, the 11th.

Of primary importance is that SCE used its comments to promote the
methodology for recovery of retained generation costs it had set forth in
Advice 1534-E-A (forwarded  to you last week).  This method provides for an
annual rate true-up mechanism and trigger mechanism.  Such mechanisms allow
for rate increases (or decreases) with the filing of an advice letter.

If we are opposed to such trigger / true-up mechanisms  we need to submit
comments on Friday and/or  a protest of the Advice Filing (also due on the
11th).
