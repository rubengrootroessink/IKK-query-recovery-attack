Jeff, Here are the e mail addresses I would send your message to.  I have
included Calpine, Greenmountain, Wild Goose, Transwestern, SPURR, Western
Hub and CIG (Dan Carroll), Edison, Kern River, and  Tom Beach (indicated
generators = Dynegy, Calpine, SCE, Watson, Cal Cogen Council).  For the ones
who have their own attorneys ( Western Hub, Calpine, Edison) you may want to
send a different letter, suggesting alternatively that they join the
coalition and share legal fees on particular briefs or filings in order to
save money, but still allow them to have their own counsel in the meetings.
I don't know for sure if that will help, but you will have to recruit those
guys more carefully.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Mike
