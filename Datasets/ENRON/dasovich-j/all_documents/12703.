I re-set the Core to Non Core T&D (in cents)  ratio (see the bottom of the 
spreedsheet for relative cost and attached the spreadsheet) to 200%.  As you 
can see the analysis is very sensative to this apportionment.  Robert and 
Harry, any additional ideas about apportioning this would improve the model's 
accuracy.

	PGE	SCE	SDGE
			
Core Rate T&D	             5.721 	         7.240 	        7.616 
Non Core T&D	             2.867 	         3.620 	        3.809 
 Total 	 $          3,836 	 $      5,147 	 $     1,285 
			
			
Core T&D/Non Core T&D	200%	200%	200%



By taking PGE's FYE 2000 10-K, I find the following:


Consumer Rev     $3008
All Other        $3658
Total            $6666

Estimated T&D    $3836
Gen portion      $2830


Consumer Kwh        28,753
Other               53,170
Total               81,923


If 45.1% of revenue is from consumer, and the T&D is estimated at $3836, you 
can apportion T&D if you assume gen is apportioned pro-rata:




                Consumer   Other    Total
Gen                993      1837    2830 
T&D               2015      1821    3836
Total             3008      3658    6666

T&D (cents)/kwh   7.01      3.42    4.68

Subject: Updated Core/Non-Core Analysis

Attached is the revised Core/Non-Core Analysis per our discussion.  We have 
updated to include the new CPUC rate schedules for PGE and SCE and a toggle 
switch 20- year bond scenario to cover the past utility debt that is the 
burden of Non-Core.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Kortney
