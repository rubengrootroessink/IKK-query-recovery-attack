FYI - check out this rotten legislation in LA.  I think this is a good one 
for our state coalition.  Regards.

LOUISIANA
ISPs would need permits under bill

Rep. Matthew (Pete) Schneider III (R., District 90) has prefiled a bill
to require the Public Service Commission to issue permits to Internet
service providers (ISPs).  HB 355 also would prohibit ISPs from issuing
preprinted solicitation checks to entice customers to enter into an
agreement with the ISP unless that ISP had a permit.

HB 355 would prohibit local exchange carriers (LECs) and interexchange
carriers (IXCs) from allowing an ISP without a permit to provide
Internet access to a telephone subscriber in the state.  The bill also
would bar banks from cashing any preprinted solicitation checks issued
by an ISP without a permit.

The bill would fine the LECs, IXCs, and banks $500 if they violated the
measure.  Those entities would have to keep track of permitted ISPs
through a list compiled by the commission.

HB 355 would require out-of-state ISPs to maintain a $10,000 surety bond
in the state to be permitted to provide Internet access to Louisiana
residents.  The PSC would be able to waive the bond requirement for any
provider demonstrating financial responsibility by submitting a letter
of credit from an accredited financial institution.

The bill would authorize the commission to set a fee for obtaining and
renewing the permit.  The permit would need to be renewed annually.
