CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
MISSISSIPPI
Senate passes no-call bill

The Senate has approved a bill to prevent telephone solicitors from
calling consumers who inform the Public Service Commission that they
object to such calls.  SB 2362, sponsored by Sen. Thomas E. Robertson
(R., District 51), would require the PSC to create a no-call database
containing telephone numbers of consumers who don't want calls from
solicitors.  (1/18/01 p.m.)

Only five senators voted against SB 2362, but a motion to reconsider was
entered, a legislative staff member told TR.  The motion means that SB
2362 could be called up for another Senate vote before Feb. 12, the
staff member said.

Rep. Les Barnett (R., District 116) has introduced a similar bill, HB
1414, which has been referred to the House Public Utilities Committee.

SB 2362 and HB 1414 have won the support of the Public Service
Commission.  (2/2/01 p.m.)  Almost 400 consumers in the past two months
have asked the commission to help limit telemarketing, and the two bills
would help accomplish this, according to the PSC.



FUTURE OF REGULATION
MINNESOTA
PUC chair would mediate disputes under bill

A bill introduced in the House would allow the chairman of the Public
Utilities Commission to mediate and resolve disputes between utility
providers.  The intent is to create a more efficient and informal method
of dispute resolution option than can be pursued in formal proceedings
before the full commission or a court, according to the measure.

The new dispute-resolution process could be initiated by a provider's
written complain to the chairman or by the chairman's own motion.  The
chairman could designate another commissioner to hear a particular
dispute.

Within 15 days of a mediation session, the parties would have to inform
the chairman as to whether they had reached a resolution.  If a
resolution weren't reached, the chairman could issue a written decision
or refer the issue to the full commission.

Reps. Loren Geo Jennings (D., District 18B) and Ken Wolf (R., District
41B) introduced HF 568.  It has been referred to the House Regulated
Industries Committee.



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
MASSACHUSETTS
Eleven bills to restrict telemarketers introduced

The Joint Committee on Government Regulations and the Joint Committee on
Commerce and Labor are considering five House bills and six Senate bills
aimed at restricting telemarketers.

HB 234, HB 602, HB 1378, SB 22, SB 44, and SB 91 each would establish a
statewide no-call database, with listing fees ranging from $5 to $10 per
consumer.  The bills would establish fines ranging from $500 to $5,000
per violation.  HB 602 also would require telemarketers to pay $500 to
access the list and would require carriers to notify customers about the
list and tell them how to sign up.

Two other House bills take a slightly different approach.  HB 577
addresses fraud by requiring telemarketers to issue a "notice of
confirmation and cancellation rights" after each transaction made by
phone.  The buyer could cancel the transactions up to three business
days after the receipt of the notice.  HB 1002 would levy fines of up to
$1,000 against telemarketers who deliberately blocked Caller ID during
solicitations.

SB 55, in addition to creating a no-call list, would establish
guidelines for conduct including requesting fees, telemarketing to
minors, and blocking Caller ID.  SB 126 would require telemarketers to
submit a registration statement and a $50,000 surety bond.  SB 126 also
suggests guidelines for recordkeeping, prohibited acts and practices,
and cancellation of transactions.

The Joint Committee on Government Regulations is considering three
bills--HB 602, sponsored by Rep. Scott P. Brown (R., Norfolk-9), HB
1378, sponsored by Rep. Charles A. Murphy (D., Middlesex-23), and HB
1002, sponsored by Rep. Mary Jane Simmons (D., Worcester-4).

The Joint Committee on Commerce and Labor is considering two of the
House bills--HB 234, sponsored by Rep. William M. Straus (D.,
Bristol-10), and HB 577, sponsored by Rep. Bruce J. Ayers (D.,
Norfolk-1).

The six Senate bills have been referred to the Joint Commerce and Labor
Committee.  SB 22 is sponsored by Sen. Robert A. Antonioni (D.,
Worcester), SB 44 is sponsored by Sen. Susan C. Fargo (D., 5th
Middlesex), SB 48 is sponsored by Sen. Cheryl A. Jacques (D., Norfolk),
SB 55 is sponsored by Sen. Michael R. Knapik (R., 2nd Hampden), SB 91 is
sponsored by Sen. David P. Magnani (D., Middlesex), and SB 126 is
sponsored by Sen. Richard R. Tisei (R., 3rd Middlesex).



TAXATION
CONNECTICUT
Bill would exempt cable TV companies from earnings tax

Rep. Richard O. Belden (R., District 113) has introduced a bill to
exempt cable TV companies from the state's 5% gross earnings tax.  HB
6165 has been referred to Committee on Energy and Technology.  Its text
is available at
http://www.cga.state.ct.us/2001/tob/h/2001HB-06165-R00-HB.htm.



LONG DISTANCE
COLORADO
Workshops on Qwest market-entry bid continue

Workshops on Qwest Corp.'s bid to enter the Colorado interLATA (local
access and transport area) service market are scheduled to resume at the
Public Utilities Commission Feb. 20-23.  Issues that will be addressed
include unbundled network element combinations, transport switching, and
"dark" (unpowered) fiber, a PUC staff member told TR.  The PUC plans to
hold workshops monthly through the spring, the staff member said.

Section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 bars Bell
companies from providing in-region interLATA services until the FCC
finds that they have complied with certain local exchange market-opening
requirements.  Section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996
requires the FCC to seek the advice of the relevant state commission.
Typically Bell companies have not submitted a section 271 application to
the FCC until state regulators indicate that they are satisfied that the
company has complied with the Act's market-opening mandates.



ADVANCED SERVICES
OKLAHOMA
SW Bell presents $30 million grant to educational trust

Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. has given $30 million to Attorney
General Drew Edmonson (D.) and trustees for the Oklahoma Education
Technology Trust to establish and activate a trust designed to help
schools capitalize on new computer and telecom technology.  The company
pledged the money during negotiations that led to the company opting out
of rate-of-return regulation.  (11/12/99 a.m.)  The state Corporation
Commission finalized the alternative regulation plan in December 1999.
(12/1/99 a.m.)

The trust will assist schools across the state by funding, obtaining,
installing, and integrating new computer and telecom equipment.  Only
the interest from the $30 million contribution can be tapped by the
appointed trustees.

Edmondson said, "The trust will oversee the placement of new computer
hardware and software and other telecommunications equipment in out
classrooms, so that students across out state have an opportunity to
claim a place in the information age."



INTERCOMPANY COMPENSATION
KANSAS
KCC denies SW Bell request to reconsider 'recip comp' order

The state Corporation Commission has rejected Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co.'s request to stay the commission's order finding that
Internet service provider (ISP)-bound traffic is subject to reciprocal
compensation.  The commission decided not to stay the order on the
grounds that it wouldn't be fair to continue to deny competitive local
exchange carriers reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound traffic.

The reciprocal compensation order, issued Dec. 18, 2000, maintains that
a call to an ISP qualifies as a local call if it connects to the ISP's
modem within the same calling area as the end user who initiated the
call.  As local calls, ISP-bound calls are subject to reciprocal
compensation at the same rate that applies to other local traffic,
according to the order.  (Docket no. 00-GIMT-1054-GIT, In the Matter of
a General Investigation to determine whether Reciprocal Compensation
Should Be Paid for Traffic to an Internet Service Provider)



WIRELESS
IOWA
Bill would restrict cellphone use while driving

Rep. Janet Peterson (D., District 72) has introduced a bill to prohibit
minors that are driving with an instruction permit or an intermediate
driver's license from using cellphones while driving.  Calls made to
"911" or another emergency number would be exempt.

Violators would be subject to confinement for up to 30 days or a $50 to
$500 fine.



PRICING
UTAH
Committee to take up bill addressing rate increases for small telcos

The House Public Utilities and Technology Standing Committee will be
considering a bill during its Feb. 9 meeting to change the number of
access lines a small telecom company must own to take advantage of an
abbreviated rate increase process.  Under current law, a telecom company
must have less than 5,000 lines in an exchange to use the abbreviated
rate increase process.

HB 297 would change that language to apply to access lines statewide.
Any small telecom company taking advantage of the shorter process would
have to operate less than 30,000 access lines statewide under HB 297.  A
Public Service Commission staff member explained to TR that the bill
would make the language of this statute consistent with language
contained in other statutes and rules.

For example, the PSC is working on new service-quality rules that, in
part, would apply to telecom companies with more than 30,000 access
lines in the state, namely Qwest Corp.  Rep. Thomas Hatch (R., District
73) sponsored HB 297.



INTERNET
ILLINOIS
Measure would create study of Internet voting

Rep. Louis Lang (D., Skokie) has introduced a bill to create a temporary
commission to study and recommend a system of Internet voting for the
2004 elections and thereafter.  Eight members of the General Assembly
and eight members of the general public would make up the commission.
The Senate president and minority leader and the House speaker and
minority leader each would appoint two legislative members and two
public members.

HB 590 has been referred to the House Election Campaign Reform
Committee.



CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
IDAHO
More than 7,000 join no-call list during the first month

During the first month of its existence, 7,256 Idahoans signed up for a
no-call list, which is administered by Attorney General Al Lance's (R.)
office.  (11/20/00 a.m.)  The registration period will continue through
March 31 for the first list, which is scheduled to be published April
2.  According to U.S. Census reports, about 1.3 million people live in
Idaho.

The initial registration fee is $10 for three years, and consumers can
renew their registration for an additional three years for $5.
Telemarketers can obtain the list from the AG's consumer protection unit
for $25.
