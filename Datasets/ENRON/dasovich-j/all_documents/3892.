There is an old one form the Dis OII -- The first one listed below -- it's 
180 days old.  Do you know any reason why that wasn't paid?

No problems Sue.  I think we agreed to do that after our bills were sent out
to you in early November, so that is why you would have a bill with that
amount still in your pile.  We will write it off immediately.

As I looked over the outstanding bills, the ones we really want to clear up
this asap include the following:

2704-110   $2,539.36   over 180 days old.  This is the distribution OII we
discussed that                should be approved on a
routine basis

2704-118  $6,596.45 in total covering this months bill plus two small ones
90 days and 150                days old.  This is
the Post Transition Ratemaking case, again, it
should be routine as we had an RCR in place.

2704-127   $2,031.79 over 150 days old.  This is Enron's share of the
ARM  RCS Direct Access               case.  Again, there
should not be a problem with the billings as more
recent bills have been paid.

2704-132   $21,012.22  This is the big kahuna, in the PG&E hydro case.
More recent                   amounts have all
been paid, but this 150 day old bill has not, and we
suspect it got caught in the accounting software changeover.  This is
one we would really love the find soon.

2704-140   PAID      We just got the check on Jeff's gas strategy
case.

2704-144   $2,929.08   This is Enron's share of the Electric
investigation work for ARM,                comprised of
two bills, the most recent one from early Nov. and a
$2,126.81 bill which is 90 days old.

So, those are the ones we would like to track, and if you have any problems
with any of these please let me know as soon as you can.  I will take care
of the write off on 2704-003.  Thanks for your help.    Mike Day

Mike,

Re:  Bills Dated 11/08/00 Which Were Just Received by Enron

I believe you and I spoke about writing off the $30.74 owed 180 days past.
This is for "gas Miscellaneous."  If we haven't, I'd like you to write that
bill off and eliminate that matter number.  Let me know if you have any
concerns with this approach.

Thanks.

Sue
