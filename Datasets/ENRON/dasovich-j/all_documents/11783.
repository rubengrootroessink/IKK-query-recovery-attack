President Bush=20

















(CBS) President Bush continues to receive some of his lowest marks from the=
=20
public for his handling of environmental issues, according to the latest CB=
S=20
News poll. Just 38 percent of the public approves of the way the president =
is=20
handling the environment, and as many =01) 39 percent - disapprove.=20

One of the most telling reasons for Mr. Bush's low ratings on the environme=
nt=20
is that the public views his priorities in this area as the opposite of=20
theirs. By more than 2-1, the public places a priority on protecting the=20
environment over producing energy. However, when asked which they think Mr.=
=20
Bush feels is more important, Americans overwhelmingly think he is on the=
=20
side of producing energy. While 58 percent of the public supports protectin=
g=20
the environment, 70 percent think Mr. Bush supports energy production.=20


These divergent priorities are clearly evident on the issue of drilling for=
=20
oil in the Arctic, something Bush strongly supports. A majority of American=
s=20
oppose opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling=
=20
for oil and natural gas: 54 percent disapprove of this plan, and 37 percent=
=20
approve of it. Public opposition to drilling in the Arctic has remained fir=
m=20
for the past few months.=20

The public is very clear on its priorities when it comes to the environment=
:=20
75 percent think we need to maintain our present environmental laws in orde=
r=20
to preserve the environment for future generations, while 19 percent want t=
o=20
relax environmental laws in order to achieve economic growth.=20

Over the past twenty years, the public has become more supportive of=20
maintaining environmental laws; in 1981, 67 percent supported maintaining=

environmental laws.=20
