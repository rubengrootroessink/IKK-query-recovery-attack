All good - very busy this summer, training and managing 4 research
assistants (thanking God for my LECG and Tilden experience), finishing up my
first big project, and analysing lots of very interesting data.  Went to
Moscow and Berlin for 10 days early this month, and we just bought a house
and moved.  Yikes!

How are you?  How's school, I assume you go straight through the summer?

I'm actually going to be in CA from August 9-21; I'd love to grab lunch one
day if you're around.

Amy
