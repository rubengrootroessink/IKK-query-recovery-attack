DELETE IF NOT  GRADUATING THIS SEMESTER.

John Morel has asked all of you to take a few minutes to report placement
information through BEARTracks.  I know that you're very busy, but this is
really, really important information for us.  There are a number of reasons
why this information is critical:

(1)  We are very often asked for this data by prospective students who want
to know if the  MBA Program is "worth it."   This data we are able to
present to them is critical to our marketing efforts.

(2)  We often have to report this information to survey administrators
(e.g., Bus Week, etc.), who then plug it into their methodologies.  If we
don't have the information, or if we have skewed information because too
few people have reported the data, it places us at risk in the rankings.

So please take a few minutes out to report your placement information on
BearTracks.  I've copied John Morel's e-mail, below.

Many thanks,

Diane
