OK gang.

I made some changes to Jeff's memo.  See what you think.

Basically, my belief is that Clarkson will be able to make payments, but
the loan is not enough.  He will use it all up immediately and that the
cash will not be there in the near future to repay the principle.  I also
feel that his real problem is in AR and inventory turnover.

Mark:  Let me know if there is a problem putting it all together with the
spreadsheets.  I can help out.
