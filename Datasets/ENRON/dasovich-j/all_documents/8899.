Paul,
here's an article that I found in the San Francisco Chronicle that featured 
an interview with Ken Lay.  I did not see an article in the Sacremento Bee.

I'm still searching for the article regarding Enron resourcing its customers 
to utilities.  As soon as I find it, I will forward it to you.
