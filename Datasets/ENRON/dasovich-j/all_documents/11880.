Good morning,
? Last night, FERC voted 2-to-1 to approve a California market mitigation=
=20
order, which will impose cost-based wholesale price restrictions in=20
California, during periods of Stage 1, 2, and 3 emergencies. The caps will =
be=20
in effect from May 1, 2001 to May 1, 2002 and determined on a day-ahead bas=
is=20
by the California ISO, based on generators=01, marginal costs.
? Sellers with participating generator agreements will be required to offer=
=20
all available power in the real time market. All generators, including thos=
e=20
not regulated by FERC, will be required to sell into the ISO as a condition=
=20
for using the ISO=01,s interstate transmission lines.
? The order only focuses on wholesale prices in California. It directs the=
=20
ISO to file an RTO proposal by June 1 and the utilities to adopt demand=20
reduction mechanisms. It also establishes an agency investigation into=20
potentially unreasonable prices in the Northwest region.
? We view FERC=01,s order as a relatively mild one and would caution invest=
ors=20
not to expect overly large reductions in California=01,s power prices, alth=
ough=20
some decline should occur.
? Although we believe most generators would still earn quite attractive=20
returns, clearly the marginal cost approach of the least efficient plant wi=
ll=20
advantage lower-cost base load plants over higher-cost peakers.

Please call us with any questions.
