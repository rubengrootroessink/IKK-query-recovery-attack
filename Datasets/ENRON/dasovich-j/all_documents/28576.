Jeff and Mona - Above is a link for the New Democrat Network (NDN) West Coast 
Retreat.  We are Executive Council Member of the NDN.  You can attend for all 
or portion of the retreat.  There will local, state, and federal elected 
officials attending.

Jeff - The NDN has been helpful by trying to moderate the tone of the energy 
debate in DC and they did not include price caps in their energy plan (though 
some of the West Coast members support them).  They will hold an energy panel 
and Speaker Hertzberg will attend

Mona- Note that the schedule is technology heavy and TechNet is a sponsor of 
the event.

Sorry for the late notice.  Let me  know if you are interested.

Thanks - Chris (202) 466-9158
