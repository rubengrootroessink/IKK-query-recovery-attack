Rick:  The California/dereg story and a sidebar are attached for your 
review.  Please circulate to all on your team who need to review them.  

We need to receive all comments by Monday, April 9.  I am out on Monday, so 
please send comments/approval to Sarah Palmer.

Thanks for the opportunity to do this story.  I think it will be of great 
interest to employees.

Mary
