This was a very small volume of power (5,000 MW with only 500 MW available 
for delivery in March).  I don't think it gives the CPUC great impedes to act 
immediately.

In talking to customer's, we have at least 5 deals of decent size that have a 
high level of interest.  I think it premature to pull the plug now.

Jeff, you and I haven't spoken in the last few days, what is the view from 
Regulatory?

The state of CA announced yesterday that it has entered into one or more 
power purchase agreements through DWR.  Does this affect our desire to 
continue marketing in CA?  This may mean that the CPUC could move more 
quickly to set the date on which Direct Access is suspended.  Please let me 
know your thoughts.  MDS
