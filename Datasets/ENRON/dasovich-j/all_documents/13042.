RE: Two Campus Tests Pertaining to Electrical Emergencies 

In order to prepare for a difficult summer of campus electricity 
curtailments caused by the state's energy crisis, two different tests 
are planned for this week. 

LOAD REDUCTION TEST: Thursday, May 24, 2001, 1:00pm - 2:30pm 

Our campus will participate in a UC systemwide test of electric load 
reduction capability. Please notify occupants of your building to turn 
off un-needed electrical equipment (lights, computer monitors,? 
computers, printers, copy machines, water coolers, etc.) between the 
hours of 1:00pm and 2:30pm on Thursday, May 24, 2001. The purpose of 
the test is to determine how much power the campus can save while 
employees continue to do their normal work. Therefore, only unneeded 
equipment should be shut off.

PP-CS will be implementing a "rolling" style curtailment of heating 
and ventilating equipment in non-laboratory buildings during the test 
period. 


EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION TEST: Friday, May 25, 2001, 12:30pm 

The campus emergency public address system was developed for use 
during earthquakes, fires, and other disasters.? This summer it will 
be used to notify the campus community of impending power blackouts. 
Please notify occupants of your building that on? Friday, May 25, 
2001, the emergency siren and public address system will be activated 
at 12:30 pm. Upon hearing the signal, NO ACTION is required by the 
campus community. This is just a test of the ability of people to hear 
the system. It is not a load reduction test.
