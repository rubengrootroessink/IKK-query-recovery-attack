Jeff --

Stephanie Miller asked me to send you this draft testimony that our group put
together.  Allan Thompson and Sam Wehn are looking it over now.  The map
is not quite done yet, so it has not been included.

Please call Stephanie if you have any comments or concerns.  As she said on
the phone yesterday, the testimony package is being put together today so that
it can be filed with the CEC tomorrow.  If there are any issues please let 
her know
ASAP.  Stephanie's phone number is 713-853-1688.

Thanks,
Ruth
