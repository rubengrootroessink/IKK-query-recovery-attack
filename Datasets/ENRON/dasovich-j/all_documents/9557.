Thanks very much for the update.  Scheduling a session at the NARUC summer 
meetings sounds like a good idea.  Are there next steps you think we should 
take to encourage this?

		 Subject: NARUC commissioners BIC meeting

Sue/Scott--as you know, Broadband Infastructure Coalition (BIC) met over 
breakfast this morning in D.C. with Commisioner Joan Smith of Oregon and Alan 
Thoms of Iowa, the chair and vice chair of the telecom committee.  Jim Prybil 
of Level 3, Rick Wood of WIlliams, Michael Freedman of Global Crossing and I 
were there on behalf of the coaliton.  The primary message that we delivered 
was that there should not be any expansion of extortion by local 
municiapalities for right of way access (that "just and reasonable costs" 
were being interpreted very liberally by the league of cities and other folks 
and that the true interpretation should be actual incurred costs) and that we 
hoped NARUC and these commissioners could support our position and promote 
positions that enhance our ability to expand infastructure without unfair 
fees or costs.

Both Commissioners were sympathetic and supportive, but Ms. Smith in 
particular indicated that the issue is generally outside of the their purview 
and that the political realities of strongly wading into the issue would be 
difficult for some COmmissioners on the committee (the city/muni/local 
political clout either with the Administration that appoints the 
commissioners or the electorate if commisioners are elected).  However, they 
both suggested that the NARUC committee should consider having a session on 
the issue, possibly at the summer NARUC meeting.  I spoke with Alan Thoms as 
he left the breakfast, and he indicated that he thought a full day of 
sessions covering this issue, poles and wires, as well as building access 
would be very productive.  I expressed to him our interest in the building 
access issue as well.

Rick Wood of Williams is going to take responsibility with the BIC for 
interaction with this NARUC committee.  (I believe that Rick came from a 
regulatory background at GTE).

I did not attend any of the NARUC telecom meetings, but I believe that Alison 
was going to cover and will send out an update if there was anything of note 
to report.



Paul--I copied you as a courtesy just so you knew that someone from Enron was 
in front of one of your Oregon commissioners.
