U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

U.S. stocks have reversed direction by midday, as the Dow and S&P
500 fell into the red while the NASDAQ pared its early gain.
Early optimism has given way to caution, as investors mull a
variety of earnings preannouncements. Intel's impending
midquarter financial update, scheduled after the close of today's
session, also looms large. This is the first time in its history
that Intel will give a midquarter update and some in the market
are concerned that the semiconductor behemoth may reduce
forecasts for its second quarter. However, shares of Intel are
leading the NASDAQ higher, as many in the market remain
optimistic that the firm will report good news. Not surprisingly,
shares of semiconductor manufacturers are the best-performing
issues in the S&P 500 at midday. Banks and financials are the
worst-performing issues in the index.

----------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY

Profit-taking continues in the Treasury markets as all maturities
suffer declines. Bullish economic data put a bid in Treasuries
earlier this morning after a larger-than-expected rise in initial
jobless claims and firmer-than-anticipated wholesale inventory
data helped boost the longer-dated issues. Treasuries initially
gained on the back of the economic releases, but profit-taking
quickly took over. Further, supply added a little additional
pressure as corporate issuance was becoming active once again. By
midday, all Treasuries were under pressure with longer-dated
issues under-performing shorter-dated maturities.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The U.S. dollar has taken a knock after a U.S. trade group
responded to U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's strong U.S.
dollar reiteration by seeking clarification of this policy and
stating that the U.S. should not condone foreign exchange
manipulation by trade partners - a swipe at Japan and the
European Central Bank "condoning a weak euro." The dollar has
fallen to around the 0.850 dollar per euro level and slipped back
to around 119.8 yen.
