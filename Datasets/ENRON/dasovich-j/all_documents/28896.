Napster says rights holders will get 50%

Napster told users on Wednesday it is completing work on a
fee-based service that will soon undergo testing. "Over half of
what you pay Napster will go directly to the artists,
songwriters and other rights holders whose works are transferred
between members of the Napster community," the company said in
an e-mail message to users. Napster said the new service will
charge a "small" monthly fee. A sneak peek at the new Web
service is available online. The screen shows features including
e-mail, messaging, a music player and a Web page highlighting
music and artists.

Print your own movie tickets

Fandango.com said that moviegoers in New York and California
will be able to purchase and print out movie passes at home.
Loews Cineplex in New York, including 13 theaters, and San Jose,
Calif.-based Century Theaters are partnering with a new online
ticketing company, Fandango.com. "It's a convenience for our
customers," says Mindy Tucker, a Lowes vice president, "We think
it will revolutionize the way people buy tickets," she told the
Industry Standard. The print outs will be given to a clerk at
the theaters. They will be scanned, a receipt printed and
tickets issued.

Britannica.com readies premium plan

Britannica.com said it would charge $5 a month, or $50 a year,
for access to the full text of the Encyclopedia Britannica
online. The encyclopedia has been available free since October
1999. The new premium service will be supplemented later this
year with a database of video clips and an encyclopedia for
elementary school students. The site will still offer some
material at no charge, including the opening paragraphs of
encyclopedia articles.

Microsoft renames WebTV

Microsoft said it is changing the name of its WebTV Internet
service to MSN TV. "Users will experience greater integration
and benefit from ongoing developments to the key MSN services
that they are currently using," said Yusuf Mehdi, vice president
of MSN and the Personal Services Business Group at Microsoft
Corp. The MSN Network announced it has added e-mail filtering
tools to its Hotmail service to help users manage their messages
and ignore junk e-mail.

Online teens want to shop

Almost one-third of teenagers use the Internet to window shop.
While 89% of teens, ages 13-17, have never made an online
purchase, 29% have researched products on the Internet before
buying them at stores, according to research by Jupiter Media
Metrix. Although teens don't own credit cards, they visit the
same sites as adults, including Amazon.com and eBay. "Many teens
use the Internet as a shopping mall -- a place to meet friends,
play games and shop, even without the intent to purchase," said
Jared Blank, a Jupiter Media Metrix analyst. There is a lesson
in the numbers for marketers. "Integrating online and offline
channels is imperative for retailers trying to reach teenagers,"
Blank said.
