We need to all talk Tuesday morning ASAP - I am frankly sick and  tired of 
self-delusion in the face of a stark and bleak reality in Sacramento- As a 
Democrat, it is clear to me that the Democrats from Gray on down are a lost 
cause( their response, from a public policy perspective, is shameful in its 
shortsidedness and contemptible in its lack of thoughtfulness and intellect- 
the Democrat's response in Cal. makes me ashamed to call myself a Democrat) 
and the Republicans too small a minority in Ca. to make a difference- From my 
vantage point ,nothing good and some( potentially much) bad came out of the 
three bills passed. We have a huge uphill battle coming in the next session 
and the prospects of further thoughtless retrenchment on the part of the 
Governor and legislature very high- to begin the preperation for that 
struggle,  we first have to be honest with ourselves and end any petty 
bickering internally on intrepretations of brutally clear  events and 
oucomes, events and outcomes which are the equivalent of getting hit upside 
the head by a 2 by  4, i.e; that usually does'nt require intrepretation or 
discussion as to whether it hurt... We end the self-delusion starting on 
Tuesday. Jeff- please arrange the call - all are invited .

since the siting legislation created only a program that is voluntary and not 
in place of the existing laws, and we have a committment from the 
legislature, the CEC and the govenor's office to take another shot in 
January, as they know that this legislation is flawed, too many conflicting 
interests trying to solve a complex problem in too short a time, I feel this 
is too harsh...we have already started the process of creating new 
legislation, that will be as close to a consensus as possible for next 
session..this legislation did not hurt us, and, some companies feel that they 
can use the processes.  We have to keep in mind that with the knowledge that 
there will be major reorganization legislation next year, we don't want to 
offend the friends that we have in Sacramento, particularly the Republicans 
who were the ones who insisted on an expedited siting bill
