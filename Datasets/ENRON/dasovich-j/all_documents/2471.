First, my thanks to all of you in your prompt response to get this important 
meeting scheduled.

The first date we discussed, the 23rd of October was not feasible for some of 
the group.  

Therefore, we have made the following arrangements:

Subject: California Strategy
Date:  Monday, October 30th
Time:  9:00am - 3:00pm (working lunch)
Place:  3 World Trade Center
  Portland Office
  Mt. Hood Conference Room (3rd Floor)

Tim & Chris: Please feel free to forward this to anyone in you group you feel 
should participate.

Anna/Jessica: Please change the appointments you scheduled for Tim and Chris 
from the 23rd, to 
  the date reflected above. (Anna, please call me at your convenience.)

Sue Mara: I know that your schedule does not allow you to the attend the 
meeting, but since I 
  was able to confirm the rest of the group we had to go ahead with this 
date.  I will 
  ensure that you receive an update of the meeting as well as any materials 
that 
  might come out of it.

Joseph: If you need assistance in making flight arrangments for this meeting, 
please do not
  hesitate to contact me.  I can also produce/copy any documents that may be 
needed 
  so that your group does not have to bring them on the plane.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 503/464-7927

Again, many thanks for your assistance in making this happen!
