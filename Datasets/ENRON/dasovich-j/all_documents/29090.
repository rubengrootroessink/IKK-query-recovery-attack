Here is  an update on the major discussion items: 

Real Time Pricing: 
Please review the enclosed proposed  decision of July 19. We need to have our 
comments in by Thursday, July 25.  

Conservation Voltage Reduction project: 
At our last load  management subcommittee, we voted to recommend CEC to fund 
a proposal from EPRI  to answer some critical issues related to conservation 
voltage reduction so that  we all can make informed decisions. The project 
required continual update on the  project from EPRI and our feedback to 
EPRI/CEC. Please find the updated scope of  work on this project. If you have 
any specific questions or issues that you want  addressed, please let us 
know.  

Energy baseline adjustment with ambient temperature: 
Our  loads in the Silicon Valley are very temperature sensitive which can 
have  enormous effects on ho baseline loads are calculated. I have some data 
to share.  It is important to all who are participating or planning to 
participate in any  demand responsive programs.  

See you at 1:30PM!?
