The Izio InfoPier website is now operational.? It was down this morning due 
to a problem within Convene's co-location facilities.? You should now be able 
to access course websites on the Izio system at http://haas.infopier.com

Convene.com would like to express their apologies for the inconvenience and 
the down time.
