Dear Sue -- Here are a couple of articles of possible interest we wanted to
send you.

Best regards.  Aileen.

`TECH SEVEN' LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE
WILL GET QUICK ACTION, BURNS SAYS

Quick action on new telecom and Internet-related legislation is
being promised by Senate communications subcommittee Chairman
Conrad Burns (R., Mont.).  Sen. Burns, who dubbed his high-tech
agenda for the previous Congress the "Digital Dozen," plans to
unveil a package of telecom and Internet bills next week that
will be called "The Tech Seven" this time around.

A spokesman said Sen. Burns' agenda will include a few "holdover
bills" that didn't make it through the 106th Congress, as well as
"some surprises."  They include proposals to expand deployment of
broadband services using low-power TV spectrum, to ease reporting
requirements for small incumbent local exchange carriers, and to
lift the caps on universal service support, the spokesman said.

The other "top priorities" on Sen. Burns' agenda are bills to
bolster online privacy and to curb "spamming."  Sen. Burns also
may address the process by which the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) selects Internet domain name
suffixes through legislation or through the subcommittee's
oversight capacity, the spokesman said.

Member assignments for the Senate communications subcommittee are
expected to be announced later this week.  Sources say Republican
freshmen George Allen (Va.) and John Ensign (Nev.) share the
inside track for the panel's vacant GOP spots, while Democrat
John R. Edwards (N.C.) is considered a lock to fill one of the
Democratic seats.

Meanwhile, efforts to organize the House telecommunications
subcommittee have bogged down in a debate over whether to add
seats to the full House Energy and Commerce Committee, says
committee spokesman Ken Johnson.  "There's still a possibility
that additional members will be added to the Commerce Committee,"
he told TR.

Late today Mr. Johnson said Commerce still plans to meet tomorrow
(Wednesday) to vote on subcommittee assignments and to organize
for the 107th Congress.

BROADBAND SERVICES, ONLINE PRIVACY TOP AeA's 2001 AGENDA

In a report sent to the White House and Congress today, the AeA
(formerly the American Electronics Association) recommends that
federal policymakers take a hands-off approach to regulating
"those sectors of the broadband market" that are served by
multiple providers. AeA's competitive markets include
"residential areas served by cable, DSL [digital subscriber
line], and satellite providers."

AeA calls for more efforts at the federal level to promote
competition in "sectors (such as multitentant buildings) where
there are bottlenecks to competitive entry."  And it says the FCC
should "continue to show regulatory restraint with respect to
emerging services, given the fact that the market for such
services, while still nascent, is functioning in a competition
fashion."

Briefing reporters in Washington today, AeA President and Chief
Executive Officer William T. Archey said the organization's
report reflects the views of AeA member companies that
participated in a series of "town hall meetings" held last year.

In addition to the telecom items, the report urges Congress to
extend the current three-year moratorium on new or
nondiscriminatory Internet taxes and permanently ban the taxation
of Internet access services.  It reiterates AeA's preference for
federal preemption of state privacy laws (TR, Jan. 22).
