WITH ELECTRIC DEREGULATION coming Jan. 1, Ohioans are about to be bombarded 
with information about how to buy their power. Soon, companies will be able 
to compete to sell electricity, although Dayton Power & Light still will 
transmit electricity to area homes and stores. 
Prices, now regulated by state government, will be set by the market. No one 
knows precisely what will happen. What is known: The issues are technical. 
Some who understand them, such as power companies, have neither incentive nor 
obligation to guide consumers to the best deal. 
?


That's why the Ohio General Assembly ordered a five-year, $33 million 
consumer education effort. It was designed by the Public Utilities Commission 
of Ohio; the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the state agency meant to be a liaison 
between utilities and their customers; and the Ohio Electric Utility 
Institute, representing utilities. 
Their "Ohio Electric Choice" campaign includes a 12-page consumer guide, a 
toll-free hot line and, starting Oct. 1, a Web site, www.Ohio 
ElectricChoice.com. 
Any objective help for electric power consumers has to be to the good. But 
here are a few facts also worth remembering: 
* Power companies hope to retain as many residential customers as possible; 
their marketing should be viewed with that in mind. 
* Consumer groups fought to have the new law let people band together to 
negotiate better rates. Local governments are among the most logical 
bargaining agents - but they must get voter approval to assume that role. 
Dayton Power & Light officials have characterized this as "government getting 
involved in private industry," but it remains among individuals' best hope of 
achieving any bargaining power with utilities. Residents should demand that 
their local government officials discuss providing this essential service. 
Change often can be confusing; this is no exception. But at least Ohioans 
have been given a place to start their education as painlessly as possible. 
Now they should remember that while learning to choose may be annoying, it 
still may be preferable to leaving the choice - and the benefits - to someone 
else.
