This is a paper on the recent WSCC price spikes by Sam Van Vactor of
Economic Insight in Portland, Oregon.  Sam presented this to the Oregon PUC
this past Monday.

Since it addresses the supply / demand situation as well as the California
utility underscheduling behavior, I thought you'd like to see it.

Regards,
Fred
