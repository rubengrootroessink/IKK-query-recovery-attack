Subject: Detailed Study due date

Dick,

In my Feb. 8,  2000 letter to Rob Cone and copy to you, I wrote the
following:

"PG&E is ready to proceed with the project on the basis of the results
presented in the Detailed Study as delivered to Enron Energy Services (EES)
and California State University, Fresno (CSUF) on Jan. 12, 2000, pending
acceptance, contact execution and payment.  Please keep in mind that the
contract quality numbers in the Detailed Study are good for 60 days upon
delivery of the study.  That date is March 12, 2000.  This binding cost is
based on the assumptions stated in this report.  If the project design,
scope, or assumptions are changed, or if service has not been contracted for
within 60 days, this study and related costs are subject to review and
revision.  Such additional review may require an additional project
deposit."

We've passed the March 12, 2000 date.

PG&E has graciously extended the March 12, 2000 date to April 28, 2000.
