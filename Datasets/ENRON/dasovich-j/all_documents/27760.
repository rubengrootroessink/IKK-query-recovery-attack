Jim - at Vicki's meeting today, there was general discussion on risks and 
issues surrounding EES new product.  Marcus prepared info below for the 
group.  There may be a meeting in next couple of days about commercial, legal 
and regulatory issues with Dave Delainey.  I drafted up these omments on 
regulatory issues - see attached. - 

Jeff - Jeremy Blachman said he'd like to hear more on the status of 
core/non-core negotiation.    I said it was part of SCE negotiation; one camp 
wants to attach past utility costs to departing customers; large customers 
want switchback option; likely there will be some compromise on these 
issues.  Could you give him latest?
