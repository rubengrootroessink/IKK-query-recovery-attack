Ray Williams relayed to me that you would like to sign the Rule 51 agreement
so you can get our prior Workshop materials.  All you need to do is fill out
the information form, initial (electronically) on the appropriate line, and
e-mail back to me (gjb2@pge.com).

Here is a copy of Rule 51.  Nothing needed on this document.  It is only for
your reference.

Call if you have questions.
