Attached is an article from the San Diego Union-Tribune stating that a good 
solution for the power crisis is energy conservation through the use of 
real-time meters. By using the real time meters, consumers will have better 
knowledge of energy prices and be less likely to use as much power during 
peak times, thus bringing demand into line with current supply. Is there a 
way for EES or the New Energy Company to take advantage of this type of 
opportunity through their energy management products?
