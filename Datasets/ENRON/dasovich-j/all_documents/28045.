Dear Haas Community,

Sunday, June 24th, 2001, between 8:00 AM and noon, several servers will
be shut down for maintenance, for upgrade of the server control switch, and
to relocate some servers in preparation for summer server upgrades.

The  email/web server, haas, will be shut down  and restarted, making email
service and the Haas main web site  unavailable for about an hour.   Also,
one of the servers required for web mail will be moved, taking the pilot
web mail service off-line for about an hour.  In addition, the old research
server, grady, and the new research file server, bear,  will be shutdown
and restarted  during the outage period.

During the outage email will be held for later delivery.  No email will be
lost.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.  Please note that Helpdesk is not manned on
weekends.  Requests for help logged during the weekend will be responded to
Monday morning.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
