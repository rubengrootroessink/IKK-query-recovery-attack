I am helping Bob Frank prepare an oeuvre on DG for several states, and of 
course, the land of fruit and nuts is number one on the list.   I didn't want 
to bother you, but I was not able to get much off the California website, so 
can you look over this attachment and see if you have anything to add.  The 
categories are General Rules and Current Regulatory Activity, Incentives 
(Stacy Bolton got those), Interconnection, Standby Service (Lynette is 
getting), Exit Fees and Siting and Permits.  I would think net metering is 
also relevant, although Bob did not identify that.

I thank you for anything you can give me.
