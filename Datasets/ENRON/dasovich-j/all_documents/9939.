Greetings:

Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.

Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project
on Thursday.  I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to
do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and
merger/valuation analysis.  Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded
again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would
like to do, I can certainly suck it up.  Any thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
