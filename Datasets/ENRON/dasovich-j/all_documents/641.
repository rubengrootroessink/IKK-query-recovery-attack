Jeff,

Following are the categories of "telephony" services that should cover "all 
the bases" in CA. 

Intrastate private lines
local loop 
data transport services
lambdas aka  AFTS 
IP transit
*simple voice re-sale

* If we can get it - because it won't be to long before this included in an 
intermediation deal

Sue and Scott, can you think of anything else?
