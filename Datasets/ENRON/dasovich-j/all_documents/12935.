Thank you again for attending last Thursday's meeting with Ken Lay.  As a 
follow-up to the meeting, I'm attaching a letter that outlines the five-point 
solution Ken discussed.  The governor and legislators need to hear from 
California's business leaders about a comprehensive solution that addresses 
the short- and long-term problems of California's energy crisis.  Please sign 
this letter and send it to the following key legislators -- and to any 
legislators with whom you have a good relationship:
 Governor Gray Davis
 Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg
 Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
 Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley
 Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox
 Senator Debra Bowen

Please send me or Ken Lay a copy of the letter, and keep us updated on any 
feedback you receive from the governor and legislators.  Thank you for your 
assistance in helping advance a solution to California's energy crisis.  If 
you have any questions or need additional information, please call me.

Sincerely,

Karen Denne
