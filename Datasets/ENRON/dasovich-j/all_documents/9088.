As a result of our call regarding Steve's appearance before Congressmen 
Tauzin and Barton on the 21st, the need for current information in the 
following areas was highlighted:

Jeff Dasovich and John Neslage will work to compile a comprehensive 
situational update, and also work to pare it down to essential talking points.

If anyone has any additional comments or additions, please let me know, and I 
will update our list accordingly.


Thanks-
