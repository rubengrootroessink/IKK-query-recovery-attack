Bev, here is the language for 8X.   The first amendment is the narrow
limited one which is strictly in keeping with what we testified about.  The
second one is much broader, to meet Sam's concern that the bill should
somewhere make it clear that the state bureaucracy can't force an operator
to do something stupid to wreck his plant.  They may not want to take the
second amendment, but we would like to get both.  Good luck.  Mike
