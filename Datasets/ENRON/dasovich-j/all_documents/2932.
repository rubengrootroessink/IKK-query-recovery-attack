Jeff - Thanks for hosting the meeting.  PG& still needs to decide what it
really wants out of the gas accord, but I hope you gained some insight into
our thinking. Keep in mind that Enron is still viewed around here with
suspicion - something we all need to get over with.  I would not give up on
going to higher levels in the company to pursue business opportunities.  I'm
told through the grapevine that you made one attempt and got no response.
Take the energizer bunny approach.  Who knows where it may lead.
