Chris:

Here are the slides with your suggested edits incorporated.  Take a look.  
Also, feel free to integrate the portions that you're working on ("deal 
bench," pre-quals, etc.) directly into the presentation, or I'd be happy to 
do it.  I'm at 415.782.7822.

I'm contacting Benevides about putting an illustrative slide together 
representing the base and peak blocks.

Best,
Jeff
