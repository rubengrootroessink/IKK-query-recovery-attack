		 Subject: Interruptible Programs OII

Yesterday, a number of parties to the Interruptible OII c.00-10-002) filed 
their proposals for what changes should be made to the utilities' 
interruptible programs.  A summary of those filings will be distributed later 
this week.  In addition the Energy Producers and Users Coalition filed an 
emergency motion yesterday to make certain "refinements" to the utilities' 
programs.
 
Specifically, the motion requests that the Commission:

1. Order Edison and PG&E to implement Optional Binding Mandatory Curtailment 
(OBMC) programs for all distribution level customers.  The OBMC should 
provide flexible program criteria, recognizing that not all customers have 
the same operational capability to control the manner and extent of 
curtailment as envisioned by the Commission in directing the implementation 
of mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548; 
 
2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally 
suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased 
environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may 
qualify under the "Essential Use" category of customers; and 
 
3. Approve a new service alternative for customers that would experience a 
disproportionate business interruption and economic impact upon interruption. 
 
Let me know if you want to see a copy of the motion.
