Jeff,
It looks like we've shaken PG&E loose on this project.  They have scheduled 
the installations we need for next week, just a few days behind our target 
dates.  I will contact you if there are furter concerns on this project.
I do not feel we have adequate documentation to pursue them (if they don't 
come through next week).  This is clearly something I need to pay closer 
attention to in the future.

Thanks for your assistance and your quick response to my request for support.

Have a great Holiday.  

Geoff
