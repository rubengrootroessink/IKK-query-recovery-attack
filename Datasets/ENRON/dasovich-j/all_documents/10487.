Rick:

My apologies.  The family events here in Mexico have conflicted with the 
calls.  But I will be on the call tomorrow.  (Anything to save $25!)  

One thing. I'm not sure that I can dial into an 800 number here in Mexico.  
Ginger:  Could I possibly call you at 4:30 and have you conference me in to 
the 800 number?

Best,
Jeff

Message from Rick:

The Campaign Leadership Call, which takes place daily at 4:30pm CST, is 
"Mandatory".  If you are unable to attend, it will be necessary for you to 
have someone participate on the call in your behalf.  Please notify Rick or 
myself,  if you are unable to participate and let us know who will be 
participating for you.  A fine of $25.00 will be assessed to those who do not 
participate or have someone participate for them.  The monies collected will 
go to a charity of the group's choice.

Thanks and please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
