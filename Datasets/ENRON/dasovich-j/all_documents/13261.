Gary has been seeing Frank Wolak all over the place on the media scene.  I 
asked him to ask Frank to do something POSITIVE and under the state's own 
control and push DA.  Gary is also speaking to a bunch of CEOs (with Anjali 
of the ISO and Carl Wood) and he said he would carry our message to them as 
well.
