We are working on some data that will add to the discussion of opportunity 
costs.  Those data won't be in final form until tomorrow -- so we will file 
Thursdsy ionstead of today.  I have received comments from Mary and Joe 
Hartsoe.  I don't plan on having a general conference call, but may have 
individual calls with people to resolve any differences.  I will send out a 
new draft by the end of day -- without the data.  For you to review.
