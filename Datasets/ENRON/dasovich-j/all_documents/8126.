Dear                       Amazon  Customer,

Don't                       you love  the feeling of getting in on a great 
deal? Welcome                       to  Amazon.com  Outlet,                   
    where we've conveniently gathered the  biggest bargains 
throughout                       the Amazon.com universe.  (And yes--they're 
going fast!)

                        How do blowouts of up to 50% off toys and electronics 
and                     up to 60% off kitchen essentials sound? (Don't answer 
yet--there's         more!) How about books for less than 5 bucks, CDs for 
less     than $7, and a slew of videos for under $10?                        

[IMAGE]At                        Outlet,  we're                       
stocking the shelves with the best deals  available 
throughout                       the store. But many are limited  to 
quantities on hand, so                       be sure to check early and  
often--everything's priced to                       move!

    
Happy bargain-hunting,  

David                       Risher 
Senior Vice President (As Not Seen on TV)
