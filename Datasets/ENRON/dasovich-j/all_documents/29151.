Can you help me with this?  I can never get Sanders to respond.  Could you 
try to get an answer for me?

Richard, 

Several months ago, I was notified by you that my e-mails were being 
collected.  Therefore, I kept doing what I've been doing all along since I 
joined Enron --  saving those emails I need for my job and deleting others.  
Given this new notice from you, I am confused about what to do. I do not have 
enough guidance.  I get hundreds of emails every day.  I respond to many of 
them.  Do I save all email receipts and responses? Do I save a subset?  What 
is the basis for saving some and deleting others? Can't my trash file and my 
e-mail system just be stored by IT centrally in Houston? Please respond.
