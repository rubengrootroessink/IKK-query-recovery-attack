Thanks for the invite.  I'm still beached. Did a
little shopping yesterday.  Cleaned up a photo albumn.
  I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.  Training
starts next week, and work will start the week after.
Thus all the fun ends.  Hey I got into business law,
and Managing in the Internet Age, and Diverity
Management.  Went from 0 units to 8.  If I can handle
it, I want an early graduation.
I have to drive over to Haas today and pick up my
b-law book so I'm not too buried next week.
It looks like I'll be spending my days in the city for
at least while after next week, perhaps lunch then?
We need to have a happy hour sometime very soon too.
Talk to you soon..Oh-I spotted the chantrelle
mushrooms in the grocery store yesterday and thought
of you mushroom picking.

Courtney
