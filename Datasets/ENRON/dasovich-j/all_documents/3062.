Attached are summaries of two SDG&E advice letters.? 1260-E-A is  being made 
to clarify the disposition of the Energy Rate Ceiling Retroactive  Credit for 
a final or closed account.? 1267-E/1225-G?informs the  Commission of the 
creation of 38 new affiliates in one advice  letter!? SoCalGas has filed its 
own version of this as well, AL 2972.?  That summary is also attached.
?
Also, the numbering of the SDG&E advice letters?made?me  realize that we have 
never received Advice Letters1223-G, 1224-G?or  1266-E.? I have requested 
those from SDG&E and will provide summaries  when they are received.
