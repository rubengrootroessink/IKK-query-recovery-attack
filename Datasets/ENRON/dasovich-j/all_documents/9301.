Jeff - Cynthia  Sandherr said you were once again the person to write to. We 
talked in the fall  of 1999 when I was thinking about bringing the energy 
seminar to San Franciso in  2000. We did manage Alaska  last year after all, 
so now I am trying to resume the regular alternation  between California and 
Houston. I am several shades whiter of head as a result  of bringing the 
Alaska trip to closure.

17 senior military  and civilians in our group this year, who are really 
interested in gas and  electricity matters, especially in CA. 14 students 
including a BGen from  Croatia, and 3 faculty. We would like to call on you 
and hear Enron's thoughts  on gas and electricity matters, both from a 
California perspective and from the  point of date-certain national 
legislation.
?
At this point,  the time that looks best for us would be Monday afternoon, 9 
April. I am hoping  this will be possible for you - it will be just about 3 
years to the day since we last visited your  California offices, in the very 
first moments of electricity deregulation.  
?
Draft schedule  attached for your consideration of where we are in the 
planning  process.
?
Best  regards,
?
