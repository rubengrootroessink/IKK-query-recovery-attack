attached is a word doc of some basic articles from the web re: the coke/oat 
almost deal 
it seems that pepsi took coke by surprise in announcing an offer for oat at 
14.8 billion, which oat rejected thinking it was worth at least 15 billion

then coke put together a deal for 15.75 billion which was nixed at the last 
minute by the coke board (buffet, etc.) although it was not formally voted on

french co. danone also contemplated a bid for oat 
oat accepted a bid by pepsi for 13.4 billion (or more depending on pepsi's 
stock price) but can still walk away if pepsi's stock drops below 40/share

everyone wanted the gatorade brand, which accounts for 1/2 of oat's earnings 
- are going to expand its distribution in both the us and especially overseas

given that there were so many parties bidding on oat over a short period of 
time, perhaps our project could focus on: 
- oats business strategy 
- how we would value oat 
- what advice we would give to one or all of the companies (oat, coke, pepsi 
or danone) 
- how the market reacted to this deal (look at the stock prices of oat, coke, 
pepsi and danone during this time)
