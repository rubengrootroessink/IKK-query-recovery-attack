FYI.  It's ugly and disappointing.  Good luck getting Sempra interested in
making changes to it.

> The Commission has issued ALJ Biren's Proposed Decision in the Natural Gas

> 2) institutes OFO procedures
> 3) establishes Hector Road as a formal receipt point
> 4) provides an OFO forum
> 5) creates pools on SoCalGas' system
> 6) retains 10% balancing with modifications
> 7) maintains winter balancing rules for the core
> 8) allows for some additional unbundled storage options
> 9) unbundles non-reliability storage
> 10) provides for $3.5 MM in IT systems cost recovery
> 11) unbundles to a certain degree core interstate capacity from rates
> 12) eliminates cores 10% ITCS responsibility
> 13) reduces core aggregation threshold
