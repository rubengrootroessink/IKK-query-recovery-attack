Hi all. I'm pleased to be part of this group and to work with each of you
again.

I agree with those who have responded so far that the cons probably outweigh
the pros of having joint business school sponsorship.

I see some resons to narrow down date choices. Not Nov. 2 or 3 because too
much of GSPP will be away at the APPAM conference in Seattle. Nov. 6-10 is
election week, and that would detract from the press coverage we ought to
get. And Thangsgiving week is probably a poor choice. So I suspect best
times after end of Oct. are either Nov. 13-17, maybe Mon. Nov. 20, or the
last week of Nov. 27-Dec. 1. Later than this begins to get into end of
classes, finals, etc.

On format, I'm thinking about how to combine high-visibility players with
academics to make for a productive discussion. Possibly we might want 2-3
people on each panel as "speakers" and 1 other person as a "discussant" to
respond to speaker ideas. Maybe the discussants should be academics, the
speakers high-visibility players (who are known to have opposing views in
some interesting way). Perhaps there should be a brief keynote speaker (e.g.
Feinstein 10-15 mins), then a single academic to give a brief history of the
deregulation movement (20 mins.), then two panels (short-run problems and
solutions, long-run problems and solutions). We might want at least one
speaker who can bring in some non-US experience, like England's since they
are much further down the deregulation road than we are.

Except for the "Feinstein" opening role, I'd like the other speakers to be
really knowlegable about this area (i.e. more than just highly-visible
people). Rich Gilbert from our econ. dept. is another possible academic (he
preceded Borenstein as head of the University's Energy Research shop, and
then did a Washington tour as chief economist of DOJ; he's also a founder of
Law & Economics Consulting), who might be good on the "long-run" panel if we
go that way. Richard (Dick) Bilas is a CPUC commissioner and an economist by
training, and might be a good backup choice (or even preferable) to Lynch.

Coordinating committee,
Here are my notes from the meeting.  The address list above is the current
group
so we can continue by e-mail by replying to this group until people are
ready
for another call.  I don't think the Dean needs to hear all of the back and
forth.  Lee Friedman has kindly agreed to advise and participate.

Open questions:
-do we want to join with the business school for this event?
-should we push the date back?
-what is your top 5 list of speakers?
-any comments on what we agreed on or revisions to the minutes?

This is really moving!  Thanks everyone.
