Jeff -- This is a little rough, but a point you should probably add under
concerns is:
Potential supply interruptions and significantly increased costs that
inhibit the ability to operate a businesses in California, and the potential
negative effect on the state's economy as a whole.

Jeff --

I made a couple changes and saved them to my attached file (I  renamed it
with my initials so you'd know which version had come from me).   I want to
take a closer look at this and maybe offer a few more later this  morning.
All in all, I think everyone's on the right  track.
