Greetings Jeffrey:

I'm pleased to tell you that VentureWire can now be sent
to you every business day in HTML format. This new
edition will save you time, and there are new features
you'll likely find useful.

First, it's easier to navigate--clicking on a headline
that interests you takes you right to the story, then
clicking on the up arrow takes you back to the headlines.

Second, the VentureWire team has added three features
to enable faster scanning--an index of companies, an
index of investors, and a link to the table of contents--so
it's simpler now to use our service to monitor specific
firms or funds, or to find news about new financings,
executive changes, or other topics.

To see the improved VentureWire, visit:
http://venturewire.net/html/daily.htm

Because the new edition is so handy, we'll assume you want
it unless you tell us otherwise. (Of course, you can switch
back to the plain-text version of VentureWire at any time.)


IF YOU WANT HTML MAIL:
Do nothing.  You'll begin receiving the HTML version on
Friday, November 17.

IF YOU DON'T WANT HTML MAIL:
Click on this link:
http://venturewire.net/html/?i=91736

This will let us know you'd prefer to receive plain text.
If you follow this link before Friday, November 17, the
text version of VentureWire will continue arriving in
your e-mail box without interruption.

Undecided?  You'll likely prefer the HTML edition if
you're using an HTML-capable mail client such as
Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express, or Netscape's
Communicator and Messenger.

But there are reasons not to switch.

1) Your desktop mail reader is older and doesn't handle
HTML properly.

2) You read VentureWire out of the office on a Blackberry,
as do many venture capitalists and other frequent travelers.
In this case, the HTML edition is worse, not better.

3) You receive VentureWire via America Online. In our
experience, AOL doesn't always display HTML mail correctly.

4) You've had trouble with HTML mail in the past. For
reasons unknown such mail doesn't always get through
your mail system.

Thanks for your continued interest, and as always, let us
know at venturewire@venturewire.com if you have any other
thoughts, concerns, or suggestions about how we can make
VentureWire more useful to you.
