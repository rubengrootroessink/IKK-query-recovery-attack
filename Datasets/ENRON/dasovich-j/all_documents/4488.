Working with Marathon to develop a PR strategy for December and 1Q01.  Will 
circulate the plan early this week for comments and buy-in.

Jeff -- just a note... the energy situation in CA has already escalated into 
a crisis and is on the front-burner of elected officials, the media, business 
and the public (so if one of our goals was to create a sense of crisis, it's 
been taken care of).  We need to take advantage of this heightened awareness 
with an educational campaign.  It's an opportune time to communicate our 
messages.

Let me know what else you need. 
Thanks!
