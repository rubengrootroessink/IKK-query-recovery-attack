I was wondering if Mark has everything he needs to finalize a good draft of 
the presentation.? Also, I think we need to speak live again before Thursday 
to flush out our comments.? Who is available when?? Perhaps we can do an 
early morning meeting downtown (Wednesday 7am-ish) or that night at Berkeley 
during break and after for those who don't have class?
