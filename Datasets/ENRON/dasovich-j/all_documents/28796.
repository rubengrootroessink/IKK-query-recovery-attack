The 2001 Internal Communications Survey is scheduled for shut down at 5:00 
p.m. on July 18, 2001.

This is just a reminder for you to fill out Enron's Corporate Internal 
Communications survey.  It's short (less than 10 minutes, honest) and 
confidential.  And yes, we will be posting all of the numerical results to 
the corporate intranet for you to see.
