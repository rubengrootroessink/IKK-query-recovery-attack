SD only is fine.  I think we need to get in DeeDee Alpert's hands (Sen SD).  
Can you please get with Jeff Dasovich on how we do that?

ok, but lets just release in San Diego.  If your strategy is the legislature, 
as well as future sales,
lets also say we are announcing our 100th agreement this year or something 
like that.  Peggy 

Max - can we see a draft by Fri at 12:00pm?

Eric - what number customer are they?

Thanks
Peggy

I would like this to be visable (i.e., something we can point to with the 
legislature).  I see your point but more than likely, if we ever source some 
customer's from SDG&E, it will be a select group.  I firmly believe if we 
ever made a decision to source all of the customer's from SDG&E, it would be 
because we have choosen to leave CA.

I am willing to take a chance with this one.  Your thoughts?

As much as I want to do this, I am concerned about making a public statement 
in light of
potential future changes.  How about a customer testimonial that sales could 
use?

We have a fixed price contract for 6 years and 8 months with Helix Water 
District.  

The fixed price contract avoids California price volatility and insures 
budget certainty for Helix.  Helix strongly believes in direct access. 

The contract is for 12 million kilowatt hours per year. 

I will have total annual dollar and total contract value this Thursday.  
There is a new facility being added this summer that will expand the totals.

Helix serves the San Diego suburbs of La Mesa, El Cajon, and Spring Valley.

They are going to announce our agreement at their board meeting this 
Wednesday, March 21st.

After that announcement, the are willing to proactively participate in a 
press release expounding the benefits of our arrangement.
