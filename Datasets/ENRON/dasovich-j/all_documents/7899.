gary, mary, steve,
please prepare a presentation that could be given to the high level people 
trying to solve the california problem.
I would like to see an aggressive solution that shows that we have a more 
expansive view of how to solve the problem with DSM than ever before thought 
of.  
I know you have a good start on that, but I would now like you to:

continue to refine the idea (refine might be expand and add implementation 
details)
contact steve kean and jeff dasovich for feedback and further refinement
schedule meetings to start reviewing our view and listening to their view
refine again
imlement, implement, implement

Please send me the most current vision and a copy of the implementation 
timeline by next Wednesday.  
Thanks

Subject: Summary of Western Gov's Energy Summit

Paul Kaufman phoned with the following brief report from the Western 
Governor's Association  "Energy Summit" that took place today.  Paul will 
follow up with more detail when he gets back to a computer. The governors 
issued the following recommendations:

California should immediately implement FERC's order issued last Friday and 
aggressively pursue all available DSM and conservation opportunties.
The Western region should likewise be much more aggressive in identifying and 
implementing DSM and efficiency opportunities.
Increase supply as soon as possible.
FERC should do an investigation into the potentially negative effects that 
price caps can cause in the industry.
FERC should add to its investigations an investigation into what caused the 
price spikes in the first week of December.
Work with the Bush transition team to make sure that someone from the new 
administration is focused on the issue.

Hoecker said that he is not inclined to impose a region-wide cap until 
California takes the actions it needs to take to help alleviate the situation 
(e.g., reforming regs governing utility forward contracts).
