The RFP provided for our updating prices by noon today.  Here is what I sent 
out just a few minutes ago.  We don't know if they are going to disqualify us 
because we are not keeping our prices open, but we are trying to stay in the 
game.  (Jeff:  please forward tthis to Jim Steffes with a copy to me.  I 
can't find him in the Enron Corp. e-mail.)
