Here's another set -- sorry for the delay, had to take a phone  call.
?
Karen -- John Howard from the Orange County Register called,  and I just=20
tried to call him back.? He's doing a set up story on the  hearing, so you=
=20
may be getting a call from him.

Outside of a wind power facility in California and co-generation plant in =
=20
Nevada, both of which are committed to long-term contracts, Enron is not a =
=20
generator. It is a trading company that seeks to increase efficiency in the=
 =20
marketplace and has no assets that can be used to build a market power=20
position.  It is impossible to argue that sales representing just a few=20
percentage points  of California=01,s power needs equate to "market power."

Enron has consistently worked to bring choice and stable electric rates to =
=20
California consumers, but has largely been thwarted by policy decisions mad=
e=20
by  the Legislature and PUC. It is ironic that we are now portrayed as the=
=20
villains  of a marketplace gone awry. The resources of this committee shoul=
d=20
be used to  find answers to restructuring=01,s problems rather than to shif=
t=20
blame to  politically appealing targets.

Enron is more than willing to participate in a procedure that fairly and =
=20
appropriately examines the true causes of California=01,s energy crisis.=20
However,  we cannot participate in a fishing expedition that broadly asks f=
or=20
confidential  documents =01) whose release would breach agreements with our=
=20
customers =01) yet fails  to provide any sanctions for those who may releas=
e=20
them to the public.=20

While we do not have anything to hide, we must protect our customers=01, =
=20
interests. Without sanctions and protections, it is a foregone conclusion=
=20
that  confidential documents given to the committee will find their way to=
=20
the press  and be distributed in a selective manner that fails to tell the=
=20
whole  story.
