Hi Kim:
Any luck withJackie re: getting together to start the project?  

And if there's anything else I can do re: your meeting on Monday, don't 
hesitate.  Leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes.  I'll 
be in Vancouver with the EBS gang Monday/Tuesday, and if all goes well maybe 
I can chat up some folks while I'm there.

Best,
Jeff
