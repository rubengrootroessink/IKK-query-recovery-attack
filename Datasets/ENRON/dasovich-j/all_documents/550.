Jeff:

Re Global Photon, I forgot to mention that they are also looking to acquire
a terrestrial system serving their key terminals.  Short term to allow them
to get up and running with customers, longer term they want dark fiber if
possible as a backup.  I think there is a lot of room for creative
structuring here.  The need for terrestrial could also be sectional, in that
one segment of the submarine system may be delayed behind others for
environmental purposes.

Hi Jim:

FYI. Lawyer's are taking a look at your proposed edits.  I'll let get in
touch as soon as I hear something.  And I got the Global Photon materials.
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
