Jeanne hasn't been aware of SDG&E's proposal to use overcollections from
on-going CTCs to offset undercollections.  We would probably want to
protest that issue.

Mona -- I know you are going to talk to the ARM members about SDG&E's ATCP,
so I thought you would be interested in this.  If Steve's proposal works,
then ARM could get involved solely in the reasonableness part of SDG&E's
procurement practices, and not have to bother with the rest of their
applications or the other two UDCs' ATCPs.

Subject: Consolidation of Three Utility Applications in 3rd Annual Transit
ion Cost Proceeding ("ATCP")



I'm sending this note on behalf of SDG&E to inquire whether any
parties have any objections to the consolidation of the Transition Cost
Balancing Account ("TCBA") reasonableness portion of SDG&E's 3rd Annual
Transition Cost Proceeding ("ATCP") application with Edison's and PG&E's
3rd
ATCP applications (A.00-09-014 and A.00-09-001) presided over by ALJ
Patrick.

By way of background, some of you may know that SDG&E filed its 3rd
ATCP application one month later this year than Edison and PG&E (10/2/2000
instead of 9/1/2000) because the Commission directed SDG&E to include
testimony on the reasonableness of its energy procurement practices in its
application in addition to testimony on TCBA reasonableness issues (that
have been the subject of the "traditional" ATCP for the last couple of
years).

In ORA's protests to Edison's and PG&E's 3rd ATCP applications, ORA
requested that the Commission consolidate the three utilities' ATCP
applications because "the policy questions raised by these applications are
substantially similar for all three utilities [and] [t]he Commission can
avoid much duplication of effort if the three applications are
consolidated."  SDG&E agrees with ORA's assessment.  Thus, at a prehearing
conference scheduled Monday, November 6 at 2PM and presided over by ALJ
Barnett, we are going to propose to ALJ Barnett that he (1) bifurcate
SDG&E's energy procurement reasonableness case from SDG&E's TCBA
reasonableness case and (2) transfer SDG&E's TCBA reasonableness case to
the
TCBA reasonableness cases of Edison and PG&E presided over by ALJ Patrick
for ALJ Patrick's consideration of the consolidation request.  SDG&E's
energy procurement reasonableness case presumably would continue to be
presided over by ALJ Barnett.  It is SDG&E's understanding that ALJ Patrick
has not yet convened a prehearing conference on Edison's and PG&E's 3rd
ATCP
applications, so parties who wish to participate in the TCBA reasonableness
cases will have the opportunity to do so.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this proposal.  Thanks.  Please
call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 619/699-5136.
