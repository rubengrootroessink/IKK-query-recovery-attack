Subject: Cal-Tax


Reliant has recently joined the California Taxpayers Association and I
attended their Board meeting last week.  I recommend that all CA generators
and market participants join the group.  It is likely that there will be
tax legislation impacting our industry; it would be to our advantage to
have an active, well-respected group on our side during any legislative
battles.  When there was a threat of a windfall profits tax on  the
gasoline companies earlier this year, Cal-Tax responded quickly and helped
stop the effort.

As the legislative rhetoric heats up we need to start thinking about
becoming more proactive.  This membership is one way of getting help on tax
issues.  I encourage others to suggest other proactive steps we might take
individually or as a group.  And while I'm at it ---  I also recommend
membership in Cal. Manufacturers Assoc.

The Cal-Tax membership is very reasonable, $10,000 for a Board position and
5,000 for corporate non-Board level.  The group has very good information
and email services which your tax people would appreciate.  For information
on membership, pls call Joyce Showalter, 530/335-4032.  Currently Duke and
Reliant are board members; I'm not sure if any others are members.  Pls
call if you have questions.
