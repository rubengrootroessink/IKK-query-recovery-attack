Subject: Arrived in London

Hi Guys

How are you all. We arrived about three weeks ago, and I started work about 
two weeks ago - I got plenty to do. 

We are doing good, Milo had trouble with the jet lag initially, which meant 
that we weren't affected by if since he didn't let us sleep. Kate is a bit 
homesick as she is having trouble making friends with the baby and all, but 
we'll work it out. 

We are staying in a temporary place. rents here are just as bad as in SF but 
we will eventually find a place.

London is cool apart from the whether. Its as if someone from every nation is 
living in  this city.

Hope all of you are good.

my phone # here is 44 20 7783 4661

Take care 

Bruno
