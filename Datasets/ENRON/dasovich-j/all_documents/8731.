Jeffrey,
I've found you on the Haas page, and
I have also studied at Berkeley in 1997
(Business comm). Your profile suggested
that you may know some details about
the venture capital industry (I an NOT
looking for money, but a job as an associate).
If you can send me an email to zoltan@egyed.com ,
I would much appreciate it.
Thanks
