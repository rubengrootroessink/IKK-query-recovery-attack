Nice move.  She's a good find.  How much is the finder's fee?

		 Subject: My departure from ETS

As some of you might already have heard, I will move to Enron Corp. 
Government Affairs on April 30.  My primary responsibility will be to advise 
the power traders on regulatory and other matters.  While it will be 
difficult to leave, I know this is a good opportunity for me.  Thank all of 
you for your encouragement, advice and support; this is a great group and I 
will miss working with you.
