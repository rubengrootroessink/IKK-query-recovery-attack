U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

After Thursday's strong session that brought the tech-laden
NASDAQ back above the key 2000 level, a bit of profit-taking
kept the bulls in check early in the session. Various economic
data were released this morning and suggested that the economy
still remains sluggish  and is in the process of bottoming. This
helped bring out a further bit of profit-taking after the
various releases, but the selling was light. Indeed, the NASDAQ
vacillated around the unchanged level, while the Dow slipped
0.5% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY

Europe's main markets rallied sharply by midday on Friday as
German auto maker VW and drug maker Schering posted profits that
were in line with expectations. Indeed, after a number of days
in the red, the major indices were poised for a bounce. The
French CAC-40 rose 1.7%, the London FTSE rallied 1.6% and the
German Dax moved higher by 1.4%. In Japan, earnings concerns,
especially among technology companies, took center stage and
dominated the mood in Tokyo, following poor results from major
players Sony and Fujitsu. The benchmark Nikkei dropped 0.5%
while the broad-based Topix fell about 0.7%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

Initially, the dollar fell sharply versus both the European euro
and Japanese yen as slightly weaker-than-expected economic data
for the U.S. economy impacted negatively on the greenback. But
profit-taking and trader position-squaring ahead of the weekend
and elections in Japan on Sunday helped mitigate much of the
early dollar damage. By midmorning the dollar was trading at
0.874 dollars per euro while the greenback traded at roughly
123.9 yen.

practices. The Justice Department issued a seven-page legal
brief that summarily rejected the software giant's reasons for
letting the court revisit the judgment.
