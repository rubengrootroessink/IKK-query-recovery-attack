Good Morning Energy Committee:

This weeks Energy Committee Meeting has been confirmed for Wednesday, May 30
from 3:00 to 5:00pm.  We will be meeting at Motorola, located at 3041
Orchard Parkway in San Jose.  Please note that this is a new Motorola
location - we will not be meeting at the Kifer Road site.  Orchard Parkway
is very conveniently located off North First Street and is easily accessible
off the 101 or 87 (Guadalupe Parkway).  Orchard runs between Plumeria Drive
and Montague Expressway.  Once you enter the Motorola facility, stop by the
lobby to receive a visitor badge and directions to the meeting room.  Thank
you for your assistance in preparing for this meeting and look forward to an
agenda in a seperate e-mail.
