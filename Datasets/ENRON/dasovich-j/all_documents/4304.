Argus Roundtable, Wednesday, December 13, 7:00 p.m. ET
Watch it via streaming live video!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: "Best Industries for Investment in 2001"

In 1999, Utilities and Energy were not the favored sectors
for performance in 2000, but they have nonetheless topped the
charts for most of the year. Looking ahead to 2001, will
value sectors continue to do well? Can Tech bounce back?
In light of the economy's changes and legislative decisions
in Washington, D.C., we'll have much to deliberate in
the December Argus Roundtable. Come join us and get the
latest on all these exciting topics!
