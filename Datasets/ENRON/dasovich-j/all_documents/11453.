Harry,
Cisco opted out of our effort anticipating that PG&E's OBMC would save them 
from rolling blackouts.  IBM went for the same reason.  I'm sure some of the 
others thought about it as well.  Its a great offer for our clients..... 
unfortunately, we can't offer it.  Could you let me know where this program 
stands and what input we've had in pointing out the uncompetitiveness of it.  
I know it was on your radar screen earlier this year.
thanks,
j
