Yes, we'll be talking about ROI, too.  I'll let Karen know.  Figure that
she'll likely bring a couple of people.  Mind if I ask Trish and John?

Sure.  But, we are also talking about the ROI model.  OK??

Make sure you tell Karen about academy awards.  She left a message on the
machine.  Also, tell David and Nina and anyone Karen wants to bring is
fine.
Just let me know about how many people.
