I see no downside to calling the question on California ISO Governance.  The 
CAISO staff was ready to move forward on a proposal that was not too 
inconsistent with the DStar and RTO West.  As a result, there was a good 
chance that seams issues could be addressed before the other two RTOs start 
up.  At  yesterday's Western Seams Task Force meeting, the California rep had 
to make it clear that everything was on hold until the new political (my 
words not his) board was educated.  In addition, the Governor has hired his 
own consultants.  It was the California's understanding that the legislation 
passed limits the ability of the CA-ISO to agree to any seams solutions 
unless endorsed by California State Government.  The current situation seems 
to guarantee a stalemate and put an enormous drag on all RTO development in 
the West.  It won't get any better if we wait.  It would be better to 
challenge now, before this new board starts making decisions based on 
political expediency.

We can certainly launch if we like, but I believe that WPTF is planning to do 
it as well.  We can let them (I's try to force them to use Bracewell, but 
can't guarantee I'd win) or do our own and have them join with us.  Either 
way, you know me, let's go for it!!

I say we launch on ISO governance soon, preferably through EPSA, but alone if 
necessary. We need to force FERC's hand with a well-thought out pleading on 
why they have to enforce order on independent governance and why a 
politicized CAL ISO is a recipe for disaster. Are we waiting on anything I'm 
not aware of?

Subject: Cal ISO Not Filing CM Proposal at FERC - EPMI Response?

Mary informs me that the Cal ISO has filed (1-30-01) with FERC that it will 
not be filing a new Congestion Management proposal at FERC as required in 
previous Orders.

She thinks now is an opportune time to challenge the legitimacy of the new 
Cal ISO Board (Gov Davis' actions).   I also think that we need to put 
forward our own solution (if we have one).

I would appreciate everyone's opinion as to the (a) likelihood that FERC 
would finally address the matter, (b) end result if FERC does deal with the 
issue, (c) and the politics in Sacramento / CPUC of taking this position.  
Also, who else is going to weigh in on our proposal?

Jim
