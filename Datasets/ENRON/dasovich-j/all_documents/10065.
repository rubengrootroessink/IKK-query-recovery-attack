Comments attached from Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch on events from=20
yesterday.

? Coram Energy, a small QF, will sign an involuntary bankruptcy petition=20
against Southern California Edison. A Coram spokesman stated that the=20
petition is being circulated to five other QFs (which were not named) and=
=20
that it could be filed as soon as next week.  If filed, the utilities would=
=20
have 20 days to respond, perhaps another 30 days to contest the filing.

? California PUC voted to block Edison and PG&E=01,s layoff plans.  The rul=
ing=20
requires the companies to halt planned layoffs and to rescind those already=
=20
made.  Edison had cut 400 jobs, with plans to cut 1,450 more.  PGE had laid=
=20
off 325, with plans to cut a further 675.

? Proposed QF contract legislation (SB-47X) remains stalled in the State=20
Senate Energy Committee.  In a perverse and =01&vicious-circle=018 type twi=

of QF payments to date have forced many off line, reducing supply and drivi=

up prices.

? National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration=01,s spring forecast.  Th=
e=20
NOAA reported that the Pacific Northwest has experienced one of the driest=

e=20
below normal for the end of February and mountain snowpacks in many river=

basins are less than 70% of normal.
