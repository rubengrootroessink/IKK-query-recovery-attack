You are so right about there being room for spontaneity and whimsy in
writing. Often, in fiction, I struggle between Beckett's idea to "Fail. Fail
Again. Fail Better." and Andre Breton's ideas of poetry or Pollock's action
painting. There's a fine line. Check out the article in the New Yorker on
Godard. Like, doing "Breathless" without a script. Etc & etc. That guy
wasn't afraid of spontaneity.

Thanks a lot for your advise. We'll see what happens with it.

See you later,

Scott

PS Next time we'll get Eldon. I promise.
