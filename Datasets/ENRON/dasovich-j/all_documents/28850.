New West is proposing these amendments to the bad bill AB XX 82.  Its view is 
that it wants to start getting Some interest in the PX credit issue to see if 
they can get it into a bill.  They acknowledge that AB XX 82 is a bad bill.  
We will be having a teleconf on this tomorrow with all the ESP consolidated 
billers.  

So far, I've told New West that it would likely be better for them, if Enron 
stays away from formally supporting this, given the target on our face in the 
Legislature.  More important, I need to know if EES would like to see some PX 
credit language in legislation.

I have some questions about the approach New West took in modifying the 
legislation, so, I have a call into them.
