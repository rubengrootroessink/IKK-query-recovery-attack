U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

U.S. equities came under pressure this morning after a downgrade
in the semiconductor sector, along with profit-taking in
networking powerhouse Ciena, overcame a bullish upgrade of Dell
Computer by a major investment bank. Furthermore, rumors that
Republican Senator James Jeffords may become an independent have
also weighed on equities, as such a move would have a significant
impact on the Bush budget proposal that is currently being
debated in the Senate. Indeed, Democrats have been doing their
best to reduce the magnitude of the tax-cut measures contained in
the budget bill, and the defection of a Republican senator would
give the party significant leverage. With the equity market
looking forward to a tax cut and the expected boost to the
economy that such legislation could bring, uncertainty
surrounding the cuts has not been well received.

----------------------------------------------------------------

JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY

The major European stock indexes were all modestly underwater
after the European Central Bank's failure to lower interest rates
fueled traders' ongoing malaise. The ECB, facing potentially
rising inflation pressures and slower growth, decided to leave
short-term rates unchanged. Predictably, technology was the
weakest link as the FTSE shed 1.1%, the French CAC-40 dropped
0.9% and the German Dax slipped 0.8%. Elsewhere, Japanese shares
dropped for the second day as traders remained nervous ahead of
profit results from some major banks. The Nikkei lost a modest
0.2% while the Topix fell a slightly worse 0.3%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The U.S. dollar has continued its divergent ways versus the yen
and the euro, strengthening versus the euro but weakening against
the yen. Yen strength has been fueled by the unwinding of so
called yen carry trades, which is when investors buy back yen
that had been borrowed at a zero interest rate. The borrowed yen
was used to fund higher yielding instruments. Weakness in the
euro has also likely prompted some yen strength, but rhetoric out
of Japan has probably been just as significant a factor.
Overnight, the Japanese economic minister stressed the
government's determination to push through reforms. At the same
time, support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ahead of
the July elections appears to be growing. As for the euro, the
common currency remains under pressure, dropping to 0.859 dollars
as the European Central Bank refrained from dropping interest
rates after today's meeting.
