All:

I just downloaded the attached from the ISO's website.  It is dated 12/1/00=
. =20

To boil it down, the MSC comes down against "soft" caps and recommends the=
=20
"get market-based rates in return for selling forward" proposal that the IS=
O=20
staff is pushing.  Forward contracts would need to at rates that=20
"approximate" competitive prices.  Based on my quick read that does not mea=
n=20
market prices; it means somthing more akin to cost of service.  MSC also=20
wants there to be a penalty on generators for underscheduling.  They also=
=20
claim there proposal will not exacerbate reliability problems.

I would be interested in people's opinion if Enron should be responding to=
=20
this report.  Given the date of the report, I am not sure if/how the ISO=20
would file this at the FERC.

G. Alan Comnes (GAC)

Here's the list of recommendations from the report.

(1) The PX =01&must-buy=018 requirement would become a =01&must-schedule=01=
8 requirement.=20
IOUs
would be required to schedule all forward energy through the PX, but would =
be=20
free to
purchase it from any source.
(2) California generators and entities that sell to any California purchase=
r=20
(not limited to the
PX and ISO) could continue to be eligible for market-based rates (and would=
=20
be free of
refund obligations) only if they offer a substantial portion of their sales=
=20
in the form of
two-year contracts at rates that approximate competitive prices. The detail=
s=20
of such a
proposal are outlined in this report. The volume offered by sellers, in the=
=20
aggregate,
would be sufficient to cover the all three IOUs=01, residential and small=
=20
commercial
customer load using an average load profile for weekdays and weekends for=
=20
each month.
(3) Any market participant that does not offer these two-year=20
market-power-mitigation
forward contracts would be subject to cost-of-service rates for all of thei=
r=20
sales of energy
and ancillary services into the California market for at least the two-year=
=20
market power
mitigation period.
(4) The CPUC would be encouraged to set a default rate for IOU residential=
=20
and small
commercial customers based on projected wholesale energy costs under the=20
2-year
contracts described above.
(5) The under-scheduling penalty should be even-handed. The MSC recommends =
a=20
real-time
trading charge that is applicable both to load and generation and, more=20
important, does
not distinguish between instructed and uninstructed deviations from schedul=
e.
