Nancy, do you know anything about  a Order from CA Governor on I6 rate 
relief?  If the customers are being granted some relief, I need to know so we 
can exempt these charges from the bills.

Thanks.

Diann, per Tom's request I have copied the SR  in an e-mail to you.  Let me 
know if you need additional information.

  SR Customer (Tim Ball) received  January invoice for delivered service 
11/20 -12/20 2000 with interruptible penalty charges. He wants know should he 
pay the full amount or deduct the penalty and pay for the delivered 
services?  This is according to his interpretation of the California 
governor's order on I6 rate relief
