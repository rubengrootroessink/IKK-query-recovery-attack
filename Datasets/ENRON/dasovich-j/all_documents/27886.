Bush may back some price caps


Updated: June 18, 2001 - 6:38 a.m.=20
WASHINGTON -- President Bush, who has argued against price caps on Californ=
ia=20
electricity, plans to support less-stringent price limits expected to be se=
t=20
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today, administration officials=
=20
said Sunday.

FERC will meet today to consider new restraints on the wholesale price of=
=20
electricity in California. An aide to Gov. Gray Davis said the governor=20
considers the commission's leading proposal to be "too little, too late" as=
=20
the state continues its efforts to stave off the threat of rolling blackout=
s.

But with summer officially beginning this week, a statewide heat wave=20
prompted the California Independent System Operator, the agency that manage=
s=20
much of the state's transmission grid, to report that a Stage 2 power alert=
=20
is probable for today and Tuesday and that a Stage 3 alert is possible both=
=20
days. In a Stage 2 alert, consumers are urged to reduce their use of=20
electricity, while rotating blackouts would be instituted between noon and =
8=20
p.m. under Stage 3.

On Sunday, Bush administration officials said they would argue that the=20
president can support new FERC limits that are based on market factors and=
=20
would contend Bush has not changed his position.

Nevertheless, the willingness to embrace new limits should temper the anxie=
ty=20
of some Capitol Hill Republicans, who fear the Bush administration has=20
handled the matter callously.

Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton, said Vice President Dick Cheney had rankled so=
me=20
members of the California delegation during a meeting last week.

"He lectured us about markets," Eshoo said Sunday during a conference call=
=20
organized by Davis' office. "When I reminded him that our market was=20
dysfunctional and that in a healthy market there's competition, he looked a=
t=20
his watch."

FERC, an independent agency with the commissioners appointed by the=20
president, now has limits on wholesale electricity prices in California tha=
t=20
are in effect only during emergency power shortages. FERC sets a target pri=
ce=20
based on the costs of the least-efficient producer, and companies have to=
=20
explain in writing if they exceed that target.

At its special meeting today to deal with California energy issues, the=20
commissioners will consider a proposal from congressional Republicans that=
=20
would extend those restraints around the clock during the next year and to =
10=20
other Western states.

Two recently appointed members of the commission -- Patrick Wood III, forme=
r=20
chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, and Nora Mead Brownell, a=
=20
former member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission -- will=20
participate in their first meeting today.

At their confirmation hearings, Wood and Brownell won praise from Democrati=
c=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., after they said they thought FERC should=
=20
move further than it had so far to rein in high wholesale prices and did no=
t=20
rule out price controls.

Among those most heartened to see the new members was William Massey, a=20
Democrat and frequent dissenter on the five-member panel who strongly favor=
s=20
price controls to head off what he's described as a looming economic=20
catastrophe for the state this summer.

"I never thought I would be so thrilled to see two Republicans coming over=
=20
the horizon," Massey said last week.

While FERC renews its focus on California's power problems, Congress also i=
s=20
feeling heat from constituents over rising energy costs and is seeking ways=
=20
to help. Lawmakers may vote as early as this week on a big budget increase=
=20
for a once-obscure federal program that helps the poor pay their utility=20
bills.

The House measure would appropriate $300 million in current-year emergency=
=20
funding -- twice as much as requested by Bush -- for the Low-Income Home=20
Energy Assistance Program. The Senate is talking about doubling the figure=
=20
again, to $600 million.

Even bigger increases appear probable for 2002. Bush is seeking $1.7 billio=
n=20
for the program, up from $1.4 billion this year. In the Senate, there's tal=
k=20
of a $3.4 billion budget.

"There's been a change in mood," said Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont=20
independent who has joined Democrat Barbara Lee of Oakland and Republican=
=20
John M. McHugh of New York in a campaign to boost the emergency funding bil=
l=20
to $800 million

"People in California, among others, are now concerned about this issue in =
a=20
way that had not been the case. ... Plus the fact that oil prices are going=
=20
up all over this country," Sanders said.

Passage of the emergency appropriation may be Congress' first direct respon=
se=20
to the energy price spikes and supply shortages that have bedeviled=20
California and states.

The assistance program, which arose from the 1970s energy crises, works=20
directly with utilities to help lower low-income households' air-conditioni=
ng=20
and heating bills and avoid utility cutoffs for nonpayment.

The surge of support in Congress for the program is broad and bipartisan,=
=20
even though the program offers nothing to more-affluent Americans who also=
=20
would like relief from higher energy expenses.

Those eligible for assistance include a large number of senior citizens, an=
=20
important political constituency for Republicans and Democrats. And the=20
program is endorsed by utility companies because it helps people pay their=
=20
heating and cooling bills.

TV ads to pin blame on Davis for power woes

Veil is lifted on pacts
The scrutiny begins, but one thing is certain -- prices can go either way
By Carrie Peyton, Dale Kasler and John Hill
Bee Staff Writers=20
(Published June 16, 2001)

The $43 billion California is spending on long-term power contracts is only=
=20
an estimate, state officials acknowledged Friday, and the amount could easi=
ly=20
go higher or lower because about half the supply is tied to fluctuating=20
natural gas prices.=20
The disclosure came as the state released edited versions of the 38=20
electricity contracts it has signed so far, many at prices that exceed the=
=20
newly deflated spot and futures markets.=20
It also unveiled the most detailed portrait yet of $7.6 billion in state=20
spending since January, when California stepped in to buy power on behalf o=
f=20
battered utilities which said they could no longer afford to pay their=20
suppliers. For the first time, the state provided a day-by-day list of mone=
y=20
spent and power bought through March 31, and it promised similar tallies wi=
ll=20
be released each quarter.=20
The power contracts came in for immediate criticism from those who said=20
California picked the worst time to try to lock in long-term deals and now=
=20
will be stuck for a decade or more with above-market electricity costs.=20
But Gov. Gray Davis and his energy advisers contend the recent dip in=20
last-minute or "spot" prices simply proves that their long-term deals have=
=20
helped cool an overheated wholesale market, robbing sellers of some of thei=
r=20
clout.=20
While people can "nit pick" if they choose, Davis said, "On May 10, the sta=
te=20
spent $110 million for power, total cost. Two days ago we spent $29 million=
=20
for total power. So clearly our strategy is beginning to work."=20
The state contracts provide for a dizzying array of deals to purchase power=
=20
-- on-peak, off-peak, around the clock, and even swaps -- many of them=20
intricately priced. They cover about half the power the state will need to=
=20
buy and will cost an average of $69 per megawatt-hour over the next 10 year=
s,=20
state officials have said.=20
Up to 70 percent of the electricity will come from new plants yet to come=
=20
online, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water=20
Resources, which handles the state's power buying.=20
That was one of the few bright spots seen by consumer advocates, who said=
=20
such deals might help finance the building of newer, cleaner power plants.=
=20
It will take analysts days to read through the hundreds of pages of contrac=
ts=20
to determine how good or bad the newly unveiled deals are for California --=
=20
and even then it might be hard to tell, experts said.=20
A contract with power trader Dynegy, for example, "looks to me like an=20
extremely high fixed price," said Robert Michaels, an economics professor a=
t=20
California State University, Fullerton, and a consultant to generators and=
=20
traders.=20
The $119.50 a megawatt-hour for power in 2002 through 2004 is close to twic=
e=20
what it would cost today for delivery in Southern California, but that's no=
t=20
enough information to truly evaluate the contract, he said.=20
The state edited out all references to which plants will supply the power,=
=20
where it will be delivered and what transmission will be used, and without=
=20
that, Michaels said, "essentially you can't see whether the state got rooke=
d=20
really badly or not."=20
State officials, who balked for months at releasing the contracts because=
=20
they said it would tip their negotiating hand, changed their stance just=20
before a hearing in a lawsuit by several news organizations to force the=20
release. A further hearing is scheduled into whether the state will be=20
permitted to keep some details private.=20
Overall, "we're very proud of these contracts," said S. David Freeman, a ke=
y=20
energy adviser to Davis who helped negotiate some of the deals. He said the=
=20
state has no interest in turning its back on any of the contracts, even=20
though they were signed when the state was frantic to escape a blistering=
=20
spot market.=20
Legislators and consumer advocates have already begun talking about whether=
=20
the state can find escape clauses from buying power that now sounds too=20
pricey.=20
But generators said the state got a better deal than the critics realize.=
=20
"It's a lot of fun to pick on the governor, but spot prices go down and spo=
t=20
prices go up," said Pete Cartwright, president and chief executive of San=
=20
Jose-based generator Calpine Corp., which signed billions of dollars worth =
of=20
contracts ranging from $58 to $115 a megawatt-hour.=20
"(Davis) has stabilized prices for a long time, and that's good," he said.=
=20
Among the sellers are affiliates of two of the utilities for which the wate=
r=20
department is buying the electricity: Sempra Energy Resources, whose parent=
=20
company owns San Diego Gas & Electric; and PG&E Energy Trading, whose paren=
t=20
owns Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=20
The Sempra contract pays the seller $189 a megawatt-hour this summer, even=
=20
though summer power was selling for more than $320 back when the contract w=
as=20
signed in early May.=20
"We're trying to be part of the solution," said Michael Niggli, president o=
f=20
Sempra Energy.=20
However, the contract would revert to the May market prices -- $320 and up =
--=20
if the state doesn't complete its multibillion-dollar bond offering by Sept=
.=20
30, and if Sempra backs out of the deal. The bond offering is to raise mone=
y=20
for the power purchases and to spread their cost over many years.=20
The PG&E Energy Trading contract, calling for 66.6 megawatts of capacity=20
through September 2011, will cost the state $58.50 a megawatt-hour.=20
The costliest contract -- in terms of dollars per megawatt -- appears to be=
=20
with Alliance Colton of Littleton, Colo., which has begun delivering power=
=20
from two "peaker plants" that generally operate only during high-demand=20
periods. Alliance will be paid $258 a megawatt-hour beginning Aug. 1 and $2=
78=20
next summer, although the price will vary from year to year. The contract=
=20
runs out in 2010.=20
"It's a peaker, which is usually more expensive," said water department=20
spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.=20
Some of the cheapest power, at about $58 per megawatt-hour, comes from PG&E=
=20
Energy and Calpine.=20
Now that prices have fallen, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley said he=
=20
wants to examine the contracts to see if the state can bail out. Seven=20
Assembly staffers began going through the contracts immediately, and Assemb=

leaders plan to get together Sunday night to discuss what they've found, he=

And, he added, the results reflect that weakness.=20
"The state negotiators have locked in high prices in the years beyond 2004,=

and they haven't solved the short-term problem," said Bohn, who was retaine=
d=20
by The San Diego Union-Tribune to examine the contracts.=20
"To a large extent, we're still at the mercy of generators who have lots of=

market power and still want to stick it to us."=20
Bohn said energy experts he has consulted calculate that the contracts will=
=20
cause the state to pay 33 percent above market rates over the next five=20
years.=20
"Compared to the panic situation we experienced in March, we did as well as=

Energy companies and others insisted the high prices were largely a result =

the state's excessive dependence on day-ahead power purchases. Others warne=

"What we're seeing now is prices that were extorted out of the state when i=

had no bargaining leverage," Shames said. He added that if an array of lega=
l=20
investigations against electricity suppliers result in successful=20
prosecutions, he would expect many of these agreements to be nullified.=20
In the meantime, the state could find itself confronting an array of=20
troubling contractual aspects.=20
Under an agreement with Williams Cos., for example, the Tulsa company has a=
=20
contractual obligation to provide 1,000 megawatts. But the generator could=
=20
reduce the amount far below that level with little penalty, Bohn said.=20
"So basically Williams can sell or not sell to the state depending on price=

he said.=20
The state's contract with Dynegy has a similar weakness, Bohn added.=20
California's agreement with Calpine will have the state shouldering increas=
es=20
in costs from windfall profit taxes or any other source. Bohn said the=20
state's contract with Calpine appears to include what he characterized as a=
=20
very high subsidy for new plant construction.=20
The state's new portfolio of contracts also puts the parent company of San=
=20

sister company of the local utility, now becomes one of the state's key pow=
er=20
suppliers, providing up to 1,900 megawatts of electricity.=20
Bohn said there was an inherent conflict between Sempra's power selling=20
business -- which seeks the highest prices -- and SDG&E, which is charged=

with seeking the lowest prices for consumers.=20
A spokesman for Sempra Energy said the company avoids the conflict because =
it=20
sells its power to the state, not SDG&E.=20
For nearly half the contracted power, meanwhile, information about natural=

gas costs -- the prime fuel for generating electricity -- remains secret.=

Industry experts forecast tightening supplies of natural gas as new gas-fir=

Bohn said he fails to understand the state's continued secrecy surrounding=

SACRAMENTO -- Long-term electricity contracts that were expected to lead=20
California out of its energy crisis depend heavily on unpredictable natural=

Of nearly $43 billion worth of power secured for the next decade, the price=

=20
Gov. Gray Davis' chief energy adviser.=20
Seventy percent of the contracted energy has been promised from power plant=

But Freeman and other state officials said they believe the electricity wil=
l=20
be delivered at an average price of $69 per megawatt-hour.=20
That price, which is 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour in consumer terms, is abou=
t=20
what most utility customers pay now.=20
An energy industry analyst, however, said that predicting electricity price=
s=20
from these deals is problematic because of the link to natural gas costs,=
=20
which can fluctuate almost as wildly as electricity costs.=20
Natural gas prices, which earlier had been below $3 per million British=20
thermal units, stayed above $10 for weeks this winter and spiked to $60 in=

December.=20
"Has the state locked in electricity prices? Probably not," said Andrew=20

"The price of power from all these generators is going down, with the marke=

The threat of rolling blackouts, however, has not been lifted.=20
"No one is declaring victory. No one is saying the crisis is over, but we a=

Several news organizations, including The Copley Press, which publishes The=

The state has struck tentative deals on an additional 23 contracts that cou=

The 6.9 cent average, if it holds up, is more than double what power cost=

"Some of these contracts are very expensive deals," said Michael Shames,=20

He criticized a deal that will pay Dynegy $140 per megawatt-hour -- 14 cent=

Bush Says FERC Plan Is Not Price Controls

?????President Bush said today he did not consider an electricity=20

the plan that FERC was expected to approve for limited wholesale price curb=

for a compromise approach to limit prices on wholesale electricity sold in=

?????That approach would mean expanding a monitoring plan rolled out last=

U.S. May Hike Aid for Poor's Utilities=20
Energy: Congress is likely to boost funds for program that arose from 1970s=

crises. It could be the first direct response to price spikes and supply=20

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--Members of Congress, feeling heat from constituents over=
=20
rising energy costs, are preparing to approve a big budget increase for a=
=20
once-obscure federal program that helps the poor pay their utility bills.
?????California, where an estimated 2.1 million low-income households are=
=20
eligible for assistance, would receive a proportionately larger share of th=
e=20
money than ever before.
?????The House may vote as early as this week to appropriate $300 million i=
n=20
current-year emergency funding--twice as much as requested by President=20
Bush--for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The Senate is=20
talking about doubling the figure again, to $600 million.
?????Even bigger increases appear likely for 2002. The president is seeking=
=20
$1.7 billion, up from $1.4 billion this year. In the Senate, there's talk o=
f=20
a $3.4-billion budget.
?????"There's been a change in mood," said Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont=
=20
independent who has joined Democrat Barbara Lee of Oakland and Republican=
=20
John M. McHugh of New York in a campaign to boost the emergency funding bil=
l=20
to $800 million. "People in California, among others, are now concerned abo=
ut=20
this issue in a way that had not been the case. . . . Plus the fact that oi=
l=20
prices are going up all over this country."
?????Passage of the emergency appropriation may be Congress' first direct=
=20
response to the energy price spikes and supply shortages that have bedevile=
d=20
California and other parts of the country.
?????The assistance program, which arose from the 1970s energy crises, work=
s=20
directly with utilities to help lower low-income households' air-conditioni=
ng=20
and heating bills and avoid utility cutoffs for nonpayment.
?????To be eligible for this assistance in California, a family of four mus=
t=20
earn less than $33,125 a year. Priority is given to low-income families who=
se=20
fuel bills consume a large proportion of their incomes, and to the elderly,=
=20
the disabled and families with young children. The average benefit is $326=
=20
per year.
?????California officials also use about a fourth of the program funds to=
=20
offer free home weatherization services to low-income families, as well as=
=20
providing more energy-efficient appliances.
?????Supporters acknowledge that LIHEAP's surging popularity represents a=
=20
remarkable comeback: Several years ago, lawmakers were talking about killin=
g=20
the program.=20
?????One Senate Democrat, John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, ev=
en=20
wants to expand the concept by creating a federal program to help poor peop=
le=20
buy gasoline for long drives to work, school or medical appointments.
?????Rockefeller has proposed initial funding of $500 million to provide ga=
s=20
subsidies of $25 to $75 a month to low-income workers who must commute more=
=20
than 30 miles a day or 150 miles a week.
?????While Rockefeller's gasoline subsidy appears to be a longshot for now,=
=20
more money is clearly headed toward LIHEAP.
?????"We finally have the attention of the administration on the need for=
=20
some additional funds," said Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the new=20
Democratic chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. Bingaman wants to=20
disentangle the assistance program from the array of other energy policy=20
issues that Congress will be debating this year, so it can boost funding=20
sooner rather than later.
?????Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) said there is "far greater support" for a=
=20
funding increase now than ever before. But he cautioned that more work lies=
=20
ahead "with the fiscal straitjacket imposed by President Bush's=20
budget-busting tax bill."
?????The surge of support for the program is broad and bipartisan, even=20
though the program offers nothing to more affluent Americans who also would=
=20
like relief from higher energy expenses.=20
?????That sentiment appears to be particularly strong in California, where=
=20
big rate hikes approved in response to the power crisis are showing up in=
=20
electricity bills. Southern California Edison's residential customers, for=
=20
example, will pay 21% more on average, with some increases topping 40%.
?????California regulators provided a rate-hike exemption to low-income=20
households that sign up for a state-approved discount program, but so far=
=20
only about 60% of those qualified have done so. And the exemptions have no=
=20
bearing on high natural gas prices, which increased bills in Southern=20
California by an average of 60% last winter.

?????An Inexpensive Way to Show Action on Crisis
?????For members of Congress who find themselves on the hot seat, the feder=
al=20
program is a comparatively cheap way to counter the perception that they ar=
e=20
doing little to help people cope with the energy crisis. Those eligible for=
=20
assistance include a large number of senior citizens, an important politica=
l=20
constituency for Republicans and Democrats alike. And the program is endors=
ed=20
by utility companies because it helps people pay their heating and cooling=
=20
bills.
?????Still, some California Democrats assert that more money for low-income=
=20
energy assistance is no substitute for broad price controls on wholesale=20
electricity, which the Bush administration and many Republican lawmakers ha=
ve=20
opposed.
?????"The problem is if the LIHEAP money is used to pay energy rates that a=
re=20
3,000% higher than they should be, the [money] isn't going to go very far,"=
=20
said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Redondo Beach).
?????Nationally, 29 million households are eligible for this assistance. Bu=
t=20
only about 5 million will receive subsidies this year, said Mark Wolfe,=20
executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Assn. Many=

?????In California, fewer than 10% of the 2.1 million eligible households=

will receive program assistance unless funding is increased, state official=
s=20
say.
?????From the late 1970s through most of the 1990s, the share of the averag=

3.8% to 4.8% of after-tax income, according to federal officials.
?????In California, state officials assisted as many families during the=20

?????Although the program has enjoyed bipartisan support, it received a=20
political boost when Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont abandoned the=20
Republican Party and became an independent, handing the Democrats control o=
f=20
the Senate and Bingaman the chairmanship of the energy committee.
?????Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), the former energy committee=20

the stakes, calling for a $3.4-billion budget and identifying the assistanc=

Power Debate Heats Up as Davis Reveals Contracts=20

20 years and costing an estimated $43 billion, already have slowed the=20
hemorrhaging of state spending on power and sheltered consumers from wild=

electricity price swings in the future.
?????"These provide a major building block for lifting this energy crisis,"=
=20
Davis' top energy advisor, S. David Freeman, said as a 600-page stack of=20
agreements was made public in response to a court order. "That was our=20
longer-term strategy. We implemented it, and it's worked."
?????The governor, questioned after a public appearance at Mather Air Force=
=20
Base, echoed his advisor's optimism, but added: "I'm under no illusions. I=
=20
think the summer is going to be hot and the peak prices will spike up."
?????For months, Davis has publicly vilified the generators with whom his=

administration has now become contractually bound. Asked whether his nemese=

negotiated in good faith, the governor said: "I do not think the generators=

have our best interests at heart. . . . They're laughing all the way to the=
=20
bank. My job is to fight back."
?????Davis has a heavy political investment in the pacts, which the state=

began negotiating in January as blackouts hit, power prices soared and the=
=20
state's large utilities slipped toward insolvency.=20
?????Crediting the contracts, Davis aides noted the state was paying an=20
average of $332 a megawatt hour for power in January, but only $179 this=20
month. The contracts call for an average price of about $85 per megawatt ho=
ur=20
over the next five years and about $69 over the next 10 years.
?????Critics have noted that the state's current average costs under the=20
contracts exceed those now available on the daily market. But Davis contend=
s=20
the current reduced prices are largely a result of his contracting strategy=
.
?????Partly because of the secrecy Davis imposed on the deals, they have=20
become a focal point of suspicion over his handling of the crisis. News=20
organizations--including The Times--and Republican officeholders sued to ge=

them. Consumer groups, meanwhile, complained about being hit with historic=

utility rate increases for deals no one could examine.

out-of-state power marketers who exploited the state's flawed deregulation=
=20
scheme.

?????GOP Leader Attacks 'Sweetheart Deals'
?????Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, whose staff pored ov=
er=20
the documents, attacked the governor for brokering "sweetheart deals for th=
e=20
generators."=20
?????Even a key Democrat, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove), expressed=
=20
serious concerns about a number of provisions in the deals that seem to off=
er=20
special relief to generators.
?????Some lawmakers and consumer groups pointed to provisions that would=20
allow generators to shift the cost of new taxes to the state and possibly=
=20
exempt the firms from a windfall profits tax.
?????"It ups the ante as far as the ultimate burden that the contracts will=
=20
place on the shoulders of California ratepayers and taxpayers," said Dunn,=
=20
who is heading a special committee investigating alleged manipulation of th=
e=20
state's energy market.
?????The senator said he also is concerned about provisions such as one=20
negotiated with GWF Energy, which prevents the state from pressing any futu=
re=20
claims with federal regulators regarding the company's profits.
?????"It is very disconcerting that we would willingly give up the right to=
=20
challenge any of these [prices]," Dunn said.
?????Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called some of the contract terms=
=20
outrageous. Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
=20
Rights in Santa Monica, said it was "bad enough" that the long-term contrac=
ts=20
resulted in "high rates for Californians for a decade." He said Friday's=20
disclosures pointed to other "giveaway" perks.
?????Freeman, who formerly headed Los Angeles' Department of Water and Powe=
r,=20
insisted that generators won no special windfall profit protections. The on=
ly=20
tax increases generators can pass along to the state, he said, are those=20
directly tied to production of the power in the contracts, such as new taxe=
s=20
on natural gas.
?????"I'm not going to say some lawyer won't argue" that the generators wil=
l=20
not claim they are exempt from a windfall profits tax. "But the contract is=
=20
very clear and the law is very clear."
?????Some of the pacts lock in specific prices, such as $58 a megawatt hour=
=20
for around-the-clock power from Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group.=
=20
The Davis administration said those guard against price spikes in future=20
years.
?????Other contracts, officials said, balance the portfolio. They include=
=20
deals such as those with Dynegy Inc., which tie prices to the cost of fuel =
in=20
future years.
?????A number of energy insiders found reason to praise the contracts.
?????"The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great deal,=
=20
it's to reduce risk" from the volatility of spot markets, said Severin=20
Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley.

?????Edison Cites Hedge Against Price Spike
?????The long-term power contracts will be an important factor in limiting=
=20
the state's exposure to future price spikes, said Bob Foster, senior vice=
=20
president of public affairs for Rosemead-based Edison International, the=20
corporate parent of Southern California Edison.
?????"This was California's problem to begin with," Foster said. "You don't=
=20
want to be buying a lot of power traded on the spot market. What we really=
=20
need is a portfolio of contracts that range from one to seven years and tha=
t=20
take out the volatility from a large percentage of the market."
?????Davis advisors stressed that most of the contracted power also is link=
ed=20
to development of new California generating plants, a key part of the=20
governor's drive to free the state from reliance on out-of-state power=20
trading companies.
?????About 60% to 70% of all the power that will be purchased in future yea=

under the contracts will be from new plants. The agreements, Freeman said,=
=20
helped developers obtain bank financing for their proposed plants.
?????By nurturing new plants, the state is signaling energy companies that=
=20
"this gravy train of high [prices] is not going to last forever," said Vikr=
am=20
Budhraja, California's lead consultant in the bargaining.
?????But as analysts pored over the details, some challenged the governor's=

basic premise that the long-term deals were largely responsible for recent=
=20
falling prices. They attribute the softening market to a host of other=20
factors, including cooler weather, falling natural gas prices and more plan=
ts=20
completing spring maintenance.
?????In fact, some scholars say that the current prices simply prove that t=
he=20
state committed to paying the power companies too much for too long.
?????"The governor's spin doctors claim that not entering into the contract=
s=20
would have been gambling," said UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro. He said=
=20
that in the years ahead, odds are are heavily against the contracts being a=

bargain. "That makes those contracts a long shot," he said, "which is=20
gambling in the worst sense of the word."=20

?????Analyst Sees Too Much Uncertainty in Contracts
?????Reviewing contracts Friday, energy economist Robert Michaels of Cal=20
State Fullerton said he was also troubled by the financial risks the state=
=20
appears to be assuming in some contracts for power plant pollution control=
=20
expenses. In some cases, he said, the state could be charged for costly=20
emission control upgrades.
?????"There's such uncertainty about what future state policy is going to b=
e=20
in terms of cost of permits, retrofit requirements and new technology," sai=
d=20
Michaels, who reviewed the contracts at The Times' request. "I am not=20
familiar with any power contracts where I've seen that. It strikes me as=20
unusual."=20
?????Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Thousand Oaks), who independently sued=
=20
Davis to reveal the power contracts, said the public would not have been ab=
le=20
to weigh such trade-offs if the governor had continued the secrecy.
?????Davis relented Tuesday, a day before a San Diego Superior Court judge=
=20
was to hear the public records challenge.
?????Some complained the administration is still withholding key informatio=
n.=20
Attorneys for the news organizations who sued the administration will retur=
n=20
to court later this month to argue for release of the redacted material.
?????The released contracts blacked out the indexes used to set natural gas=
=20
prices, the amount of natural gas needed to fire specific generators and=20
which pipelines are being used to ship the gas. That's important because ga=
s=20
shipped into Southern California is more costly than gas shipped into=20
Northern California.
?????Additionally, the state is withholding information on whether the stat=
e=20
or the generators should pay when there are breakdowns or congestion on the=
=20
transmission system, resulting in a failure to deliver power.

?????Documents' Release Doesn't Stop Dispute
?????Experts said transmission-related provisions can be crucial to such=20
contracts final costs.
?????In arguing for continuing confidentiality, Davis maintained that the=
=20
disclosure of detailed contract information would undercut the state's=20
negotiators by tipping off competing generators. On Friday, however, some=
=20
critics attributed to the move to politics.
?????"If they were great contracts, they would have been released months=20
ago," said Navarro of UC Irvine.
?????But Davis' defenders, including Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los=20
Angeles), chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, said the=20
contracts accomplished exactly what they were intended to do: stabilize the=

price and supply of electricity.
?????"If all of a sudden you dump all these contracts, and all this power=

Ad Will Blame Davis for Crisis
Politics: GOP-linked TV spot says governor and PUC could have saved the sta=
te=20
from soaring prices. Its funding is murky because of campaign law.
By MARK Z. BARABAK, Times Political Writer
?????Acting under cover of a taxpayer group, Republicans are preparing a=20
statewide ad blitz blaming Gov. Gray Davis for California's energy crunch, =
a=20
move certain to escalate partisan tensions.
?????The commercial is credited to an organization called the American=20
Taxpayers Alliance, but it was placed by a GOP consulting firm and apparent=
ly=20
produced by Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist renown for his attack=
=20
advertising.
?????The campaign-style TV ad is set to air Monday, more than 16 months=20
before Davis faces reelection. The spot does not promote a rival candidate.=
=20
Rather, it assails Davis and his appointees on the Public Utilities=20
Commission for failing to sign "long-term, cost-saving contracts" before=20
wholesale prices soared.
?????"That's why newspapers say Davis ignored all the warning signals and=
=20
turned the problem into a crisis," the advertisement states.
?????The source of the ad and its funding have been shielded under the murk=
y=20
laws that govern so-called independent expenditure campaigns. The American=
=20
Taxpayers Alliance paid roughly $350,000 for the first wave of ads.
?????Castellanos has close ties to the White House. Last year he created=20
negative spots that Republicans ran against Vice President Al Gore, includi=
ng=20
a controversial one that flashed the word "RATS" on screen for a split seco=
nd.
?????But Republican officials from the Bush administration on down denied a=
ny=20
connection to the anti-Davis spots, scheduled to air in Los Angeles, San=20
Diego, Fresno, San Francisco and Sacramento.
?????Castellanos declined to comment.
?????"Unlike Gov. Davis, the RNC is not using slick political consultants t=
o=20
spin our way out of this problem," Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the=20
Republican National Committee, said Friday.
?????Representatives of several major out-of-state generators, who have bee=
n=20
warring with Davis for months, also denied any connection to the ads. "We'r=
e=20
not participating in that," said Richard Wheatley, spokesman for power=20
supplier Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston.
?????"We're completely out of the loop on these ads," said Jim Owen,=20
spokesman for Edison Electric Institute, an industry umbrella group in=20
Washington.
?????However, the generators have done extensive public opinion research in=
=20
California over the past several months. Their surveys have found that=20
Californians give Davis poor marks for his handling of the crisis but=20
generally do not blame him for causing the problem.
?????The ad shipped this week to TV stations around California appear=20
designed to convince people that Davis, indeed, is at fault. "He's pointing=
=20
fingers and blaming others," the commercial states. ". . . But who runs the=
=20
PUC? The people Gray Davis appointed."
?????Last year the state's major utilities repeatedly asked for permission =
to=20
enter long-term contracts that could have helped control wholesale prices.=
=20
Regulators turned them away before finally allowing them to negotiate=20
longer-term contracts at rates that ended up higher.
?????However, while Loretta Lynch--who is named in the ad--was head of the=
=20
PUC at the time, Davis had not yet appointed a majority of the commission.
?????The ad campaign comes as the two major parties are moving closer in=20
Washington toward a consensus on wholesale price relief for California and=
=20
other Western states, which face high summer electricity bills and fears of=
=20
spot shortages.
?????Even so, Republicans on Capitol Hill have fretted that Democrats--led =
by=20
Davis and their new Senate majority--are winning the public relations and=
=20
political battles.
?????Last month, senior aides to House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and=

others voiced their concerns to lobbyists from conservative groups and majo=

power firms.
?????"We basically said, 'Are you planning on doing anything to promote you=

D372.DTL=20
WE ARE still a long way from being out of the woods in this energy crisis.=
=20
Yet, we are on a path toward taming a problem that just a few months ago=20
seemed insurmountable.=20
My administration has licensed 16 major new power plants, and we have more=
=20
than 4,000 megawatts of new power generation coming on line this summer.=20
Nearly 40 new contracts for electricity worked out by my negotiators alread=
y=20
are putting strong downward pressure on the prices the state is paying for=
=20
electricity. Some 43 percent of the power we're buying to keep the lights o=
n=20
is now under long-term contract.=20
In addition, conservation is playing a big part in this turnaround.=20
In January, I called the state Legislature into special session to work out=
=20
solutions to our power problems. One result was legislation appropriating=
=20
more than $850 million for conservation projects - the largest such=20
conservation program ever offered by California or any other state. Among i=
ts=20
features are home weatherization assistance, residential air conditioning a=
nd=20
appliance rebates, and peak-load reduction incentives for agriculture and=
=20
industry.=20
In response to these measures and to my call for conservation, Californians=
=20
are dramatically reducing their electricity use, especially during peak hou=
rs=20
when electricity is the most expensive and hardest to come by.=20
Some might believe that we are just sweating in the dark in order to produc=
e=20
these savings. But that is simply not true. Conservation goes hand in hand=
=20
with energy efficiency, and in this regard we in California are a world=20
leader.=20
For instance, we are pioneering the use of light-emitting diodes (LED) in=
=20
traffic signals that use 75 percent less power than conventional traffic=20
lights.=20
Through our Powerwalk program, members of the California Conservation Corps=
=20
are distributing 1.5 million compact fluorescent lightbulbs that use a=20
fraction of the power of similar-sized incandescent bulbs, saving enough=20
electricity to power 100,000 homes.=20
Use of other new technology such as variable-speed motors, high-efficiency=
=20
air conditioners and real-time metering also will produce results.=20
State government also has been at the forefront of this conservation effort=
.=20
On average, state agencies this year have reduced energy consumption in sta=
te=20
office buildings by approximately 20 percent.=20
They are shutting off unnecessary lights, regulating indoor temperatures an=
d=20
turning off computers when they aren't needed. In one simple but effective=
=20
strategy, state building managers have instructed janitors to clean buildin=
gs=20
one floor at a time, allowing the rest of the building to remain dark, and=
=20
thereby cutting lighting use significantly.=20
The state also has adopted the country's most energy-efficient building=20
standards for residential and commercial structures. This effort has won th=
e=20
support of the building industry, and will save California an estimated 200=
=20
megawatts or more a year.=20
One state building project alone - the Capitol Area East End project in=20
Sacramento - will save taxpayers an estimated $400,000 a year in energy=20
costs.=20
Expanding this effort to local government, we've entered into energy=20
conservation partnerships with 225 California counties, cities and special=
=20
districts. And partnerships with businesses and private organizations have=
=20
been central to the state's conservation efforts. Just last week, for=20
example, I issued an executive order offering incentives for businesses tha=
t=20
voluntarily cut their electricity use during peak periods.=20
Businesses are cooperating in other ways, too.=20
McDonald's, for example, has agreed to place energy conservation messages o=
n=20
4 million tray liners in their 1,100 restaurants statewide. Through the=20
California Grocers Association, supermarkets such as Safeway have placed=20
energy conservation tips on grocery bags and in stores.=20
A unique partnership between the state, the Building Owners and Managers=20
Association and the Service Employees International Union has produced a=20
five- point plan to reduce energy use by 10 percent or more in some 300=20
million square feet of commercial office space.=20
Moreover, we know that the cheapest megawatt of power is the one we don't=
=20
have to buy. That is why I have instituted the 20/20 program for customers =
of=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and a similar 15/2=
0=20
program for customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.=20
Those who reduce their summer 2001 use by 20 percent over what they used la=
st=20
summer (a 15 percent reduction for SDG&E customers) will receive a rebate o=
f=20
20 percent on their electric bills. This program has the potential to reduc=
e=20
power use by thousands of megawatt-hours over the summer.=20
Finally, I have reached an agreement with 137 California companies, includi=
ng=20
major banks, manufacturers and technology companies, to reduce their energy=
=20
consumption by 20 percent between June 1 and Sept. 30. I am tremendously=20
encouraged by how enthusiastically Californians have pursued energy=20
conservation.=20
In the long run, there are two truly essential pieces to the solution to ou=
r=20
energy crisis: We must continue to build more power supply and we must=20
continue to dampen demand through improved energy efficiency.=20
Together, these measures will ensure that there is enough power available t=

When Gov. Gray Davis showed his hand last week by releasing details of the=
=20
state's long-term electricity contracts, he claimed California now had=20
leverage in the high-stakes power game that has nearly cost the state its=
=20
shirt.=20
But the state's hand contains a wild card. Some contracts have provisions=
=20
that allow the price of electricity to rise or fall with the price of natur=
al=20
gas, the fuel that runs most electricity generating plants.=20
Those "fuel adjustment" clauses raised alarms for some energy analysts, who=
=20
say the state's promise to cover generator costs if fuel prices rise could =
be=20
an open invitation for gas traders -- some of whom also sell electricity to=
=20
the state -- to hike their rates.=20
Disclosure of the provisions also means that the $43 billion figure that=20
state officials attached to the long-term contracts only represents an=20
estimate of what the state will pay.=20
Davis' chief energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said the price of natural ga=
s=20
can fall just as easily as it can rise -- yielding savings for California=
=20
under the electricity agreements. And the state, he said, has a strategy=20
ready if suppliers claim unreasonable gas costs: Under the contracts, the=
=20
state can serve as a backup buyer if it can deliver natural gas at cheaper=
=20
rates.=20
"The state can go and get our own gas if we don't like producers' prices,"=
=20
Freeman said Friday, signaling for the first time that California is prepar=
ed=20
to greatly expand its controversial role as an energy trader.=20
But the state could be getting into the natural gas game just as critics sa=
y=20
it may have been outplayed by energy giants in the electricity deals.=20
"They're basically playing chess, and the governor is playing checkers," sa=
id=20
University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro. "They're really=
=20
out of their league."=20
Freeman said the state can maintain its own portfolio of natural gas=20
contracts at better-than-market rates. That's a complex task that can invol=
ve=20
out-of-state gas purchases, pipeline transportation contracts and storage=
=20
strategies that would put the state in the same league as Enron Corp.,=20
Dynegy, El Paso Corp. and other masters of global energy markets.=20
Navarro, an expert on energy regulation, said generators had the state over=
 a=20
barrel when they locked in the adjustment clauses, because they forced the=
=20
state to bear the risks of the notoriously volatile natural gas market.=20
Prices for natural gas peaked last winter at 10 times the nationwide averag=
e=20
at the Southern California border.=20
And that market, controlled by a small number of sophisticated players, is=
=20
rife with opportunities for gaming, he said. Natural gas companies could se=
nd=20
all their high-priced gas to California, manage pipeline contracts to=20
maximize gas prices or sell gas to their own power affiliates at favorable=
=20
rates.=20
"The governor negotiated those contracts in a panic, bargaining from=20
weakness," Navarro said.=20
In about half of the 38 long-term contracts, payments for electricity depen=
d=20
on the rise or fall in the price of natural gas, the fuel for the new power=
=20
plants that will contribute 70 percent of the juice lined up by the state.=
=20
Most details of the fuel arrangements were blacked out in the contracts=20
released by the governor, along with other undisclosed provisions that=20
experts say make it impossible to fully assess what the state will pay in=
=20
future months and years.=20
A crucial question is what number the generators can use to claim increased=
=20
gas costs, said energy consultant Tom Beach of Cross Border Energy in=20
Berkeley. Will they have to demonstrate their actual cost by producing thei=
r=20
signed gas contracts, Beach wonders, or do the state deals peg electricity=
=20
payments to a commonly used market index -- the spot price of gas at the=20
Southern California border?=20
"That particular price has caused a lot of problems in the past," said Beac=
h.=20
Beach and other analysts say California has already been through an expensi=
ve=20
exercise with power contracts pegged to the spot cost of gas when it arrive=
s=20
in the state on interstate pipelines from gas producing basins in the=20
Southwest, Canada and elsewhere.=20
A host of state and federal investigators are still trying to determine why=
=20
natural gas spot prices went through the roof when the fuel passed over the=
=20
California border -- particularly near Topock, Ariz. The state Public=20
Utilities Commission has accused El Paso Corp. of restricting the flow of g=
as=20
in its pipeline through Topock, making gas scarcer in California and thus=
=20
more expensive on the spot market.=20
Whatever the cause of the spot price spikes, investor-owned utilities were =

ed=20
electricity prices with the utilities pegged to the natural gas border pric=
e.=20
Some of those generators were owned or controlled by El Paso -- the same=20
company accused of engineering the border price hike.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this month expanded its probe of t=

allegations of market manipulation against El Paso. Freeman said recent=20
regulatory commission actions have raised hopes that federal regulators wil=

monitor California's gas market more closely to ensure competition that cou=

The risk of market gaming could apply to any new state contracts with "fuel=

adjustment" clauses, Beach said.=20
"That can be a problem," he said. "(The cost of gas) is just a complete=20
pass-through."=20
Navarro said the danger is heightened in an energy economy like California'=
s,=20
where the same firms that sell electricity to the state may also be the gas=
=20
suppliers for their own generating plants. The natural gas affiliates could=
=20
make "sweetheart deals" to sell gas to their sister power plants at prices=
=20
higher than market rates. The power affiliate would bear no risk from the=

high-priced sale, because its gas costs could be covered by the state, he=
=20
said.=20
Companies like Enron, El Paso and Williams, which control both pipelines an=
d=20
power generated for the state, could also work together to prop up gas=20
prices, Navarro said.=20
"The general concern here is when you have fuel adjustment clauses you need=

to worry about the possibility of manipulation of the gas price," Navarro=
=20
said.=20
Representatives of Dynegy, which has state contracts pegged to gas costs, d=

not respond to requests for comment.=20
Tom Murnane, a spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, said the "fuel=20
adjustment" provisions for Sempra and other companies will not lead to gas=
=20
price manipulation.=20
"It's highly unlikely," Murnane said.=20
To have an impact on gas prices, he said, a company would have to control=
=20
very large volumes of gas.=20
El Paso now shares with other gas shippers the huge block of capacity on it=
s=20
pipeline to Southern California that used to be controlled by an El Paso=20
marketing affiliate. El Paso has one of the new state power contracts, but =
it=20
only covers 100 megawatts, said El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn.=20
Murnane said state utility regulations would prevent Sempra Energy Resource=

Gas, a regulated utility.=20
Larry Foster, a natural gas expert for Platts energy news services, said th=

state contracts are unlikely to become a driver boosting natural gas costs.=

He said ordinary market forces such as the balance of supply and demand are=
=20
the main factors that will set the rates.=20
Foster said state officials hold a lot of power to improve gas supplies=20
flowing into California by encouraging the construction of badly needed=20
pipeline capacity. Doing that could actually drop gas prices, and lead to=

lower power prices under the state electricity contracts.=20
"I think it's pretty clear to a number of officials in California that the=

The "solution" to California's energy crisis proposed by so many -- includi=
ng=20
Gov. Davis, members of the California Legislature, and Democratic as well a=
s=20
some Republican lawmakers in Washington -- has a success rate of precisely=
=20
zero.=20
The object of their affection is popularly called "price caps." They hope=
=20
that, perhaps as early as tomorrow, the feds will impose caps, or something=
=20
like them, on wholesale electricity rates in the West.=20
But price caps have never worked, and they never will.=20
So why are politicians and a healthy proportion of our citizenry jazzed abo=
ut=20
a blunt policy tool that, if anything, will make matters worse?=20
Because people are frustrated. They are tired of feeling victimized by a=20
deregulation law, passed in 1996, that was fatally flawed. They are angry=
=20
about footing the bill. They are fed up with endless legislative "fixes" th=
at=20

So, as in any desperate situation, people are tempted to turn to ideas that=
=20
have no chance -- like victims stranded on an open sea with nothing but sea=
=20
water to slake their thirst.=20
Previous attempts to impose price caps didn't work either.=20
In the 1950s, the federal government chose to regulate natural gas prices=
=20
based on "cost." As natural gas usage increased for home heating and=20
industrial processes, the scheme proved impossible to administer. Prices we=
re=20
set too low to prompt energy entrepreneurs to explore and produce more. The=
=20
result two decades later was a natural gas shortage so severe that, by=20
February 1977, some 4,000 manufacturing plants were idled, 1 million worker=
s=20
laid off and hundreds of schools closed for lack of heating.=20
Congress responded in 1978 with the Natural Gas Policy Act, establishing a=
=20
program for phased deregulation of natural gas. Since then, natural gas=20
shortages have never reappeared.=20
It happened again in 1979. Crude oil prices were surging while the nation w=
as=20
saddled with a system of oil price controls inherited from the Nixon=20
administration. Despite the urging of Energy Secretary James Schlesinger,=
=20
President Jimmy Carter refused to eliminate federal price controls on=20
domestic petroleum. The result: long lines at the gas pump.=20
The current energy crisis in California can be laid directly at the door of=
=20
the misguided belief that price caps not only work but benefit consumers.=
=20
While freeing up wholesale prices, the 1996 deregulation act (AB 1890) froz=
e=20
retail electric rates. The result: the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
and the near financial ruin of Southern California Edison.=20
Perhaps the strongest impetus for price caps on wholesale prices is the fea=
r=20
of rolling blackouts this summer. But caps won't keep the lights on. Cappin=
g=20
prices reduces both the incentive to produce and the urge to conserve, maki=
ng=20
blackouts even more likely.=20
Responding to prevailing political winds, however, federal regulators, --=
=20
according to press reports -- are set to announce some sort of "price=20
mitigation" program, beyond the current scheme that imposes limits when pow=
er=20
reserves fall below 7.5 percent.=20
Various plans have been reported, including one that would peg the price to=
 a=20
previous day's price -- presumably the highest -- charged by the "least=20
efficient" generator. That sounds simple, but in practice would be=20
unworkable. "Least efficient" and highest price don't always go hand in han=
d.=20
Especially in a region that spans 13 western states, and where fuel prices=
=20
vary all over the regional map.=20
Such a scheme sounds similar to the natural gas price caps of the 1950s. It=
=20
won't work any better now than it did then, and for the same reasons:=20
Producing and bringing electricity to market has more variations and=20
complexities than almost any other commodity.=20
And supporters of price caps are in for big disappointment: Many of the=20
largest producers in the region's power sector -- municipal utilities,=20
irrigation districts, public utility districts and Canadian producers -- ar=
e=20
not regulated by the feds and will not be subject to these new rules.=20
A final irony: The power market has demonstrated over the last few weeks th=

wholesale electricity market is working, which must be something of a=20

Sacramento -- Under court order, Gov. Gray Davis released details yesterday=
=20
of long-term power contracts that lock in $43 billion in power for Californ=
ia=20
over the next 20 years, most of it coming from plants now under development=
.=20
The average price of $69 per megawatt hour is much cheaper than the price t=
he=20
state has been paying in the spot market. Critics warned, however, that it=
=20
may leave the state paying far too much for power in just a few years. The=
=20
price is also twice the average cost charged just a year ago.=20
But S. David Freeman, Davis' chief negotiator on the contracts, said the=20
state got a good deal despite being in a weak bargaining position when it w=
as=20
suddenly plunged into the power-buying business as rolling blackouts swept=
=20
the state in January. Nailing down the long-term contracts, he said, forced=
=20
down the price of electricity on the spot market.=20
"These are a major building block for licking this energy crisis," he said.=
=20
This month, energy prices dropped to their lowest in nearly a year. Critics=
=20
of the long-term contracts say they believe generators took advantage of th=
e=20
state, and they say other factors -- including milder weather and changing=
=20
political winds that may force federal regulators to rein in wholesale pric=
es=20
-- led to price drops.=20
"The problem with the contracts is that the governor adopted a long-run=20
strategy for a short-term crisis," said Peter Navarro, a University of=20
California at Irvine economics professor. "The generators wanted these --=
=20
they locked in lucrative long-term contracts knowing full well that the pri=
ce=20
will drop."=20
Davis -- who released portions of the 38 contracts only after Republican=20
lawmakers and media organizations, including The Chronicle, sued to make th=
em=20
public -- defended his energy-buying strategy.=20
"What matters is the total price of power, and on May 10 the state had to p=
ay=20
$110 million for power. Two days ago we spent $29 million," Davis said. ". =
.=20
. The combination of building new plants, record conservation, long-term=20
contracts are all working to bring the total price of power down in=20
California."=20
Davis officials say the contracts for 600 million megawatt hours help ensur=
e=20
that supply will increase over the next several years because 70 percent of=
=20
the electricity is contracted to come from plants either under construction=
=20
or on the drawing board in California.=20
Some of the agreements contain several clauses, however, that allow prices =
to=20
fluctuate with the price of natural gas and require that the state pay for=
=20
new taxes levied on power producers.=20
Generators also can walk away from the contracts if the state does not issu=
e=20
$12.5 billion in revenue bonds to cover the cost buying electricity on beha=
lf=20
of California's cash-strapped utilities by July 1.=20
Although the state treasurer does not expect to issue the bonds until early=
=20
September, state power negotiators say they are working with generators to=
=20
revise those parts of the contracts. They say generators now have little=20
incentive to abandon the contracts in light of lower wholesale costs.=20
The average price of power on the day-ahead market has dropped from $275 pe=
r=20
megawatt hour in January to just $121 for the first part of June. One=20
megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes for one hour.=20
The contracts are all of different lengths, prices and conditions. They tot=
al=20
about 50 percent of the state's needs over the next decade. The state still=
=20
has 23 agreements with generators that have not been turned into signed=20
contracts.=20
Freeman said generators drove a hard bargain. Asked if any of them requeste=
d=20
that various state investigations into allegations of price gouging be=20
dropped as part of the deals, he responded, "People attempted everything, b=
ut=20
we resisted."=20
Although ratepayers will ultimately foot the bill for the power, Freeman sa=
id=20
he doesn't believe any new rate increases will be needed as a result of the=
=20
contracts.=20
Nettie Hoge, director of The Utility Reform Network, said her staff attorne=
ys=20
are still analyzing the contracts, but, so far, they seem to offer a mixed=
=20
bag.=20
"These are fairly steep contracts," Hoge said. "They're costly. I think we=
=20
paid too much for stability. But to put that all on the governor would be a=
=20
mistake. Had FERC acted more rapidly (to cap prices), this wouldn't be=20
necessary."=20
One contract with Dynegy is fixed at $119.50 per megawatt hour for 1200=20
megawatts through the end of this year. The contract then extends through t=
he=20
end of 2004 for 800 megawatts of peak and off-peak power.=20
One of the highest prices paid is $249 per megawatt hour for a contract wit=
h=20
Coral Power, L.L.C. of Houston. The contract for 100 to 325 megawatt hours=
=20
runs from June 1 to Oct 31 of this year.=20
Vikram Budhraja of the Electric Power Group, a consultant to the state=20
Department of Water Resources, said many new power plants in the works woul=
d=20
not have been built without the contracts.=20
"These contracts fundamentally alter the supply and demand balance," he sai=
d.=20
Mike Wilczek, a senior energy market analyst for the energy industry=20
publication Platts, reviewed the contracts yesterday and said they seemed=
=20
appropriate for the time they were written.=20
"They were basically negotiating a lot of these deals at the peak of the=20
market," he said, "when the fears were the worst and when nobody knew what=
=20
was going to happen and when everyone was holding onto the power they had."=
=20
Wilczek said the state ultimately may have made the right decisions.=20
"It was a risk to wait," he said. "The smart thing was to lock in something=
,=20
and a lot of people did just that, not just the state. The utilities=20
throughout the West were buying on the forward market."=20
Freeman also defended the contracts that include a clause that allows the=
=20
price to fluctuate with the price of natural gas. Some of the companies und=
er=20
contract also have natural gas divisions. Natural gas costs account for abo=

California energy market strategy criticized=20
Posted at 11:19 p.m. PDT Sunday, June 17, 2001=20
BY BRANDON BAILEY=20

Mercury News=20


As temperatures climbed in California last July, one power generator offere=
d=20
to sell electricity at $500 per megawatt hour -- almost five times what sta=
te=20
officials believe it cost to produce.=20
When the state's power demand rose to peak levels on five consecutive days,=
=20
utilities couldn't find enough electricity for sale at a lower cost. On eac=
h=20
day, officials who manage the power grid reluctantly accepted the company's=
=20
offer and paid what they considered an excessive price.=20
Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets to consider limits on=
=20
the wholesale price of electricity. As they seek Washington's help in fixin=
g=20
the energy market, state officials say that what happened last July is=20
evidence that federal regulators were mistaken when they concluded that=20
competitive forces in California would keep power companies from setting=20
their prices too high.=20
In order to sell electricity in California's newly deregulated market, each=
=20
of the state's power suppliers had to win permission from FERC to charge=20
whatever price the market would bear. To do that, each company had to=20
demonstrate it would not have ``market power'' -- the ability to drive up=
=20
prices and keep them high.=20
State officials now contend that FERC used a faulty economic premise to=20
evaluate those claims: The commission assumed that if a company controlled=
=20
less than 20 percent of the electricity supply, it would be unable to=20
exercise significant market power.=20
``This was a really bad rule of thumb,'' said Severin Borenstein of the=20
University of California Energy Institute. ``The FERC has been using=20
antiquated methods that really don't help in diagnosing market power in=20
electricity markets.''=20
Each of the state's five big commercial power suppliers controls between 5=
=20
and 10 percent of California's electrical generating capacity. But critics=
=20
say that gives the companies more than enough leverage to charge excessive=
=20
rates.=20
``If demand is high, even a 5 percent market share could be pivotal in=20
setting the price,'' said Anjali Sheffrin, an economist for the California=
=20
Independent System Operator, the state's grid manager.=20
The ISO has formally petitioned FERC to revoke the big generators' permissi=
on=20
to charge unregulated rates, essentially returning to a system where rates=
=20
are based on the cost of production plus a reasonable profit.=20
A complex market=20
Suppliers insist they aren't manipulating prices. But one industry consulta=
nt=20
agreed that FERC's 20 percent rule fails to recognize the complexity of the=
=20
market.=20
The stakes are high: The grid operator has charged that power suppliers=20
reaped nearly $7 billion in excess revenues last year. And the argument may=
=20
ultimately determine how energy is bought and sold in California.=20
Other state agencies are investigating whether power suppliers illegally=20
manipulated power supplies or prices. But experts say that's hard to prove.=
=20
The ISO petitions simply argue that the companies should no longer be allow=
ed=20
to set their own rates, because the market isn't competitive.=20
Indications are that FERC, which meets today to consider limits on the=20
wholesale price of electricity, will impose new controls. The Washington Po=
st=20
reported Sunday that administration officials said President Bush plans to=
=20
support less stringent price controls, provided they are based on market=20
factors.=20
Still, most experts are predicting the commission will stop short of the=20
sweeping changes that state officials want. They said it's likely the state=
=20
will continue challenging FERC's standard.=20
FERC officials declined comment, but a spokeswoman provided documents=20
confirming the commission has used the 20 percent rule in deciding to let=
=20
companies charge unregulated rates.=20
The rule's origin=20
The rule is derived from a more complicated formula originally adopted by t=
he=20
U.S. Department of Justice to use in gauging whether corporate mergers in=
=20
other industries would violate anti-trust law, according to economists=20
familiar with the standard.=20
But critics say it makes no sense to apply this rule to electricity.=20
Unlike other products, electricity can't be stored in large volumes, so=20
consumers can't buy power when prices are low and use it later when prices=
=20
get high.=20
Conservation can help cut demand, but electricity is so essential that the=
=20
state has kept buying even when the cost has soared.=20
On a hot day when the state needs plenty of power, for example, demand migh=
t=20
reach 38,000 megawatts.=20
If there are only 40,000 megawatts available, and one company controls 3,00=
0=20
megawatts, the state will be forced to buy at least 1,000 megawatts from th=
at=20
company. Because the company knows that, the ISO has argued to FERC, the fi=
rm=20
can effectively set the price.=20
The ISO estimated what prices the companies should be able to charge under=
=20
competitive conditions, based on such factors as fuel prices, operating cos=
ts=20
and a reasonable profit. If one company charges higher rates, the theory=20
goes, there should be competing suppliers who will sell for less.=20
No fear of underbids=20
Sheffrin said her studies show the major power suppliers have been able to=
=20
charge essentially whatever price they wanted, without fear that competitor=
s=20
would underbid them. The studies are based on detailed analyses of power=20
sales by the five major companies and other suppliers.=20
Industry spokesmen say the ISO's economists used flawed assumptions to make=
=20
normal behavior seem sinister.=20
``We stand by the fact that we've operated ethically and legally,'' said=20
Richard Wheatley of Reliant Energy Inc. He said the ISO failed to consider=
=20
all the costs of producing power, including the need to recover long-term=
=20
investments in buying or building plants.=20
Without seeing the ISO's confidential data, University of Southern Californ=
ia=20
economics Professor Charles Cicchetti said he's not convinced the power=20
companies are doing anything wrong.=20
But Cicchetti, who advised Duke Energy when it won FERC's permission to=20

California ISO Unveils Outage Notification Plan; Meets Deadline for=20

FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation -=
=20
The California Independent System Operator (ISO) unveiled a plan today,=20
Friday June 15, 2001, aimed at giving Californians as much notice as possib=
le=20
about the likelihood of rotating outages. The notification plan is in=20
response to a June 1st Executive Order by Governor Gray Davis, and a=20
corresponding directive by the ISO Board of Governors.=20
ISO Board of Governors Chair Michael Kahn said the plan will help people co=
pe=20
with rotating outages. "Along with giving customers, business and public=20
safety officials adequate time to prepare for possible outages, the warning=
s=20
are also expected to spur conservation," said Kahn. "Conservation may even=
=20
obviate the need for the outage."=20
As of today, the California ISO has in place a system for issuing a public=
=20
warning two days before the possibility of rotating blackouts, which will b=
e=20
refined 24 hours ahead of time based on dynamic factors such as weather,=20
power plant and transmission line outages, and conservation. If rotating=20
outages appear imminent, the ISO will notify local utilities and the=20
Governor's Office of Emergency Services 90 minutes ahead. That will give=20
utilities time to provide a one-hour's notice to the news media, the public=
=20
and other agencies about where the outages will occur and how many customer=
s=20
will be affected.=20
Matching the supply and demand of electricity in California is a constant=
=20
balancing act. The weather, the flow of imported power and conservation=20
efforts and overall demand can fluctuate hour by hour. California ISO=20
President and CEO Terry Winter said people need information about the=20
possibility of blackouts. "Our goal is to give people the information they=
=20
need to plan their lives, run their businesses, and reduce the impact of=20
rotating outages. We will be fine tuning this system through the summer to=
=20
make sure we're achieving that goal."=20
Electronic notices will be issued 48 and 24 hours ahead of challenging days=
=20
when the grid operators forecast possible rotating blackouts. These notices=
=20
are an extension of the ISO's current electrical emergency notifications=20
issued via its Alerts, Warnings and Emergencies System, which are e-mailed=
=20
and e-paged to key governmental agencies, utilities and media.=20
The ISO's unique System Conditions section of its website www.caiso.com,=20
which currently features AWE notices, demand forecasts and other informatio=

The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along t=

BPA and California Ink Summer Assistance Plan=20

PORTLAND, Ore., June 15 /PRNewswire/ via NewsEdge Corporation -=20
The Bonneville Power Administration, the California Department of Water=20
Resources and the California Independent System Operator have reached=20
agreement on a plan that outlines when and how BPA may be able to help=20
California during this summer's anticipated energy shortages.=20
"The principles on which the plan is based," said Steve Wright, BPA's actin=
g=20
administrator, "will ensure that all transactions will benefit both the=20
Pacific Northwest and California and that reliability problems will not be=
=20
shifted from one region to the other. This agreement protects and benefits=
=20
the Northwest while helping California when it is possible."=20
According to the plan, BPA and the California Department of Water Resources=
=20
will share information on each power supply situation. If California is in=
=20
imminent danger of rolling blackouts, CDWR will alert BPA and the agency wi=
ll=20
determine what, if anything, it can do to help. Because of the drought in t=
he=20
Northwest, there may be times when BPA may not be able to help. If the agen=
cy=20
can help, CDWR and BPA will agree on the terms.=20
The transactions are expected to be in the form of energy exchanges with th=
e=20
exchange ratios and the timing of the returns to be mutually agreed upon at=
=20
the time of the transaction. Instead of the fixed 2-to-1 exchange ratios BP=
A=20
and California used earlier this year, the ratios will depend on market=20
conditions, the shape of BPA's system and the nature of the request. The=20
ratios will always be better than 1 to 1 for BPA. The exchange energy would=
=20
be returned to BPA in 24 hours, in seven days or next fall depending on BPA=
's=20
energy needs.=20
"We want California to know that we're prepared to help them if we can as=
=20
long as it does no harm to the Pacific Northwest," said Wright. BPA would=
=20
only alter the way it operates the hydro system to benefit fish listed as=
=20
threatened and endangered if California authorities assert that blackouts=
=20
sufficient to threaten human health and safety are imminent.=20
Changes to fish operations are possible under the National Marine Fisheries=

environmental remediation. This would, for example, change a 1.5 to 1=20

BPA and California officials will continue discussions to arrive at a=20
