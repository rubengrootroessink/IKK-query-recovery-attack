Beth Bentivoglio just called. She is sending the last two books in the Narnia
Chronicles.

Other ideas:

CD's by the group "Bewitched"  I think there may be 2 or 3 (according to
Katie). Her first choice is "Bewitched", the first CD.

A "blow pen" set. It would be in the artwork area of toy stores--they are
pens that you blow the ink out of onto stencils to make pictures.

Picked the names yet?  Missed you at Nancy's.

And, we would be delighted to host Christmas here.  Looking forward to it.

Debbie
