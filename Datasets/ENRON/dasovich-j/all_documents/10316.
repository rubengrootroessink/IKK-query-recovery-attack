Mike Smith is all right with it.  Preference is to have Gov Affairs do it.  
Please check with Jeff D to see if he or someone in their group can do.  We 
will be back-up.

What do you want me to tell these guys?  I don't mind telling them because of 
the lawsuit we are not interested.

This is a request for Enron to participate in an educational program for
the California Society  for Healthcare Engineering (CSHE).  CSHE is a
nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting the  healthcare
professionals in California by providing educational opportunities,
interdisciplinary awareness, code review and is affiliated with the
American Society for Healthcare Engineering and the California Hospital
Association.  Our membership roll averages about 1000 members representing
over 150 hospitals and hundreds of  architects and engineering firms.

Each year CSHE hosts a 2-3 day Institute featuring topics of current
interest presented by professional, qualified, expert speakers and
panelists.  This year the Institute will be held on May 10 & 11th in
Monterey.   We expect about 200 attendees.

On Friday, the 11th, we will have a panel discussion on the topic of
energy.  It is scheduled from 9 am to noon and consist of 3 panel speakers.
Each speaker will make a 20-30 minute presentation which will be followed
by a Q&A period.  We currently have 2 of the 3 speakers signed up: an
energy engineering firm speaking on energy conservation, A VP from the
California Hospital Association speaking on the legislative/regulatory
issues that could impact healthcare facilities energy programs.

The 3rd speaker will be someone who can talk about the current energy
market conditions (gas & electricity) and the possible future market
conditions.  We hope Enron will agree to be the energy market speaker.

I would like to emphasis the educational nature of our program.  The
audience will be knowledgeable and will expect professional presentations.
Each of our facility members are dealing with the energy crisis daily and
will be eager to learn.  Enron can be very helpful with creating a better
understanding of  the variables and options available to hospitals.

I am the CSHE State Vice Chair and will become the State Chair at the
Institute this year.
I hope Enron will act favorable upon this request.  We are preparing our
program for printing now and a timely response would be appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance,

Anthony S. Moddesette
