Hi Everyone,

If you would like to make an appointment for academic advising or program
planning, please feel free to contact me or Shawn.  We prefer to do this
either in person or by phone because advising via e-mail is very
cumbersome.  So please call Shawn at 643-0435 or me at 642-1406 if you'd
like to talk with us.

Cheers,

Diane
