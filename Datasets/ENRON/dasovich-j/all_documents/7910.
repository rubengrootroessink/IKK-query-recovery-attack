Jeff,

You might want to keep this in mind when you're up at the Dome after X-mas.
Go on over to Anchor Bay on Tuesday and check out how big it is. The surf's
coming in! Now all I have to do is find out what San Diego will be like. So
far, they're predicting 7"+. Not as big as up here, but fun nevertheless,
and a lot better than getting hit on by daughter Hopkins.

LATE!

>As the writing of this forecast 8:00 AM Wednesday, the NW buoy in Hawaii

>
>   All models are in agreement with open ocean swell heights of between
>  30-40' even after they leave the Hawaiian chain. There are three major
>  swells tracking across the Pacific. The first will begin to show on our
>   coast mid day on Friday, with most beaches seeing long period surf at
>the NW facing beaches in the 15'+ range, with bigger sets possible. Deep
>  water spots coupled with the long swell period (up to 20+ seconds) will
>   see double that size at least. The meat of the first system will hit
>    more towards Crescent City, with plenty of energy left for northern
>  California. The swell direction looks excellent at 280-295 degrees. It
>      will become steeper as the swell tracks to the east on Sunday.
>
>   Look for this first system to provide huge surf all day on Saturday,
>with still solid surf on Sunday, though backing down through the day. By
>   late Sunday, a second solid swell will move in with surf heights not
>      quite as big as the first one, but still in the 10-12' range is
>  expected. Look for continued solid surf through Monday, lingering into
>  Tuesday. Then....are you ready for this????? Yet another macker is due
>   on Tuesday with surf heights again reaching the solid double overhead
>  range, however, this one is still a ways off, but the charts show some
>                 impressive size and long swell periods.
