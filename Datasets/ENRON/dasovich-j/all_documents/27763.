Attached is an Assigned Commissioner's Ruling establishing a prehearing
conference in the baseline proceeding and calling for optional PHC
statements.  The prehearing conference is scheduled for Friday, June 21st. I
will be unable to attend as I will be out of town, but can get someone else
to cover it, if Enron is interested in participating in the proceeding. Let
me know as soon as possible.

Jeanne
