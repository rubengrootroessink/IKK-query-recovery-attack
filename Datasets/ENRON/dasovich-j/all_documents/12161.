Energy Systems Update for Tuesday May 8, 2001 at 8:15 AM:
The California Independent System Operator has declared a Stage 1 Emergency
for the hours of 0815 to 2359 due to forecasted high loads throughout the
control area.

Consumers are requested to voluntarily curtail nonessential electric load to
avoid more severe conditions including involuntary curtailments.

ISO may be required to call a  Stage 2 including nonfirm by mid-morning.
The ISO indicated a  Stage 3 emergency and firm load shedding is  likely
today.

If outages occur they will include the remainder of Block 14 and portions or
all of Block 1 and beyond depending upon system conditions.

Conditions are expected to be similar to yesterday.  Any further specific
changes in operating conditions will be communicated with additional Grid
Updates.
