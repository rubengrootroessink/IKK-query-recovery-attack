> Power Struggle:
> The Campaign Behind the Bush Energy Plan
>
> By Holly Bailey
>
> As Congress this week moves to take up major elements of President
> Bush's embattled energy policy, members of the administration,
> including Vice President Dick Cheney and Environmental Protection
> Agency chief Gail Norton, fanned out across the country yesterday
> in hopes of increasing national support for the plan.
>
> But public officials aren't the only ones waging a public relations
> battle over what has been described as a policy key not only
> to Bush's success but also to that of congressional Republicans
> in the upcoming 2002 elections.
>
> Corporate America, namely energy companies and trade associations
> representing everything from manufacturing companies to timber
> interests, also have invested plenty of time and money in the
> push for Bush's energy plan.
>
> At least three separate coalitions have launched TV, radio and
> print ads in recent weeks pushing for a new national energy policy,
> one that emphasizes the need to expand domestic oil and gas production,
> pipelines and power grids. Few of the groups mention the White
> House or Bush by name, but their policy wish list includes all
> the major elements proposed by the president.
>
> Perhaps the most prominent group is the Alliance for Energy and
> Economic Growth, a coalition of more than 400 groups including
> chambers of commerce, trade associations, energy companies and
> various other interest groups. Formed in mid-May, the Alliance's
> founding members include the American Gas Association ($630,025
> in soft money, PAC and individual contributions during 1999-2000;
> 55 percent to Republicans); the Edison Electric Institute ($739,378;
> 60 percent to Republicans); the National Mining Association ($508,650;
> 83 percent to Republicans); the Nuclear Energy Institute ($334,716;
> 71 percent to Republicans) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($515,499;
> 94 percent to Republicans).
>
> The group's ads, which feature soft-focus photography shots including
> young children standing with their parents and sailors saluting
> a waving American flag, emphasize that our national security
> could be at risk without a new energy policy. The price tag for
> the Alliance's current ad campaign: at least $1 million, according
> to the Washington Post.
>
> Former Bush campaign advisers are the principals behind two other
> groups. The American Taxpayers Alliance, headed by GOP consultant
> Scott Reed, spent a reported $2 million last month running ads
> pinning blame for the California energy crisis on the state's
> Democratic governor Gray Davis. Reed, who also chaired Bob Dole's
> 1996 presidential race, won't disclose the donors or members
> of his group, but, according to Time magazine, one donor is Reliant
> Energy ($584,606; 87 percent to Republicans). Reliant is one
> of the companies accused by California officials of price gouging.
>
> Meanwhile, Ed Gillespie, a Bush adviser and Washington lobbyist
> whose clients include the energy giant Enron, heads the 21st
> Century Energy Project, a coalition formed to counter "enviro-leftist
> propaganda," according to a press release. The group's nine members
> include mainly conservative groups, led by the American Conservative
> Union ($112,500; all to the GOP). This week, the group reportedly
> is spending at least $500,000 on TV ads promoting the Bush energy
> plan.
