FRIDAY THE 13TH SURPRISE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES=20

The budget impasse will keep lawmakers working over the weekend. In additio=
n,=20
a deadline looms for a vote on the Governor=01,s Memorandum of Understandin=
g=20
(MOU) to keep Southern California Edison (SCE) out of bankruptcy. The=20
Assembly and Senate Democrats are making a final run at their own versions =
of=20
the plan. A Senate version is still in the works, while the Assembly Energy=
=20
Costs and Availability will hold an informational hearing Saturday afternoo=
n=20
on ABX2 82 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek). ABX2 82 currently allocates the SCE=20
undercollection almost entirely to noncore customers (above 20kw), pays SCE=
=20
two times net book value for transmission, and leaves open the possibility =
of=20
a contribution from SCE above the $400 million tax refund provided in the=
=20
Governors MOU. The sketchy outline of a Senate plan would impose all=20
undercollections to noncore customers, impose a $300 million haircut to=20
generators and an additional $800 million from SCE.=20
Direct access rights would be suspended under ABX2 82 until 2003 and a stud=
y=20
would be authorized by March 31, 2002, on how to expeditiously phase in=20
direct access for customers over 20kw (and green direct access under 20kw).=

Some of California's largest businesses have already been hit with rate=20
increases over 100%.? CMTA supports an equitable sharing of the costs of th=
e=20
SCE undercollection (as well as DWR contract costs) among all customer=20
groups, and will oppose a solution to the SCE problem that unfairly shifts=

these costs to California businesses.=20

MORE OR LESS ENERGY

There seems to be no shortage of bad business bills making their way throug=
h=20
the Legislature.? Issues range from imposing strict liability on generators=
=20
that reduce or discontinue electricity generation, to subjecting generators=
=20
to felony criminal penalties for making basic cost/benefit business=20
decisions.=20

Generator Liability
A measure, ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno), that makes an electricity generator=20
strictly liable for any damages that are proximately caused when the=20
generator reduces or stops generating electricity for economic reasons,=20
passed (7-0) from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July 3, 2001.=20

Since negligence and intent need not be proven in order to establish strict=
=20
liability, under ABX2 51, a generator could be held strictly liable for=20
damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the=20
generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance,=20
unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors.? ABX2 51=
=20
also would make it difficult for a generator to permanently close a facilit=
y,=20
even if the facility was not operating profitably.=20

Despite the fact that electricity shortages are driven by any number of=20
factors within and beyond their control, ABX2 51 would result in generators=
=20
shouldering all liability and responsibility for electricity shortages.=20

CMTA will be actively advocating against this measure before it is heard on=
=20
the Assembly Floor.=20

Felony Fuel Shortages=20
ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) is a vaguely worded measure that does not=20
explicitly identify what types of activities would be considered felonious.=
?=20
The measure allows an individual or entity to be prosecuted for =01&creatin=
g a=20

l=20

consumer demand;=20
(2) Restricting output or withholding capacity from bidding into the market=
;=20

(3) Economic withholding by submitting bids at prices above the producers=
=01,=20
marginal cost.Fluctuations of in-state and out-of-state generation;=20
maintenance of facilities; weather; customer demand; and drought are just a=
=20
few of the many components that converge to impact day-to-day energy=20
supplies. ABX2 65 does not allow for the natural swings in supply and deman=
d=20
which are common in a market economy, and add one more unpredictable=20
component to the market, thus further complicating price and supply=20
fluctuations.

In addition, the bill provides that producers only should receive marginal=
=20
costs for their products.? This precept flies in the face of a free market=
=20
economy.? Businesses should be able to receive a reasonable return on the=
=20
products they produce and supply.? Limiting a business=01, profits to margi=
nal=20
costs only further discourages investment in the State=01,s energy=20
infrastructure.

Second, entities already may be prosecuted for illegal business practices,=
=20
conspiracy, collusion and intentional market manipulation under the State=
=01,s=20
Cartwright Act and the Federal Sherman Anti-Trust Act, among others.?=20
Enforcement of existing state and federal laws is sufficient to address the=
=20
alleged illegal business practices the bill purports to remedy.=20

Third, the measure establishes that a person or entity who violates=20
provisions of the bill is =01&guilty of a felony and may be punished in sta=
te=20
prison and a fine not to exceed 10 percent of the corporation=01,s gross=20
corporate assets.=018? These fines and penalties are excessively punitive.=
=20

Fourth, the bounty-hunter provisions of the bill provide an incentive for=
=20
employees and interest groups to investigate businesses for profit.? Other=
=20
bounty-hunter legislation passed by the Legislature has resulted in many=20
frivolous lawsuits.? Some of the costs associated with these suits are=20
absorbed by businesses and some of the costs are passed on to consumers in=
=20
the form of higher prices.? In any event, the bounty-hunter provisions have=
=20
the potential to unnecessarily increase energy costs.? The regulatory branc=
h=20
of our government already has the authority to investigate alleged unfair=
=20
business practices.? This authority should not be passed on to employees an=
d=20
interest groups.=20

ABX2 65 establishes a terrible precedent and has the very real potential to=
=20
reduce existing energy supplies and to discourage future energy=20
infrastructure investment within the State.=20

Office of Ratepayer Advocate=20
Following the charge of Pacific Bell, CMTA and other business lobby groups=
=20
have successfully slowed the progress of SB 201 (Speier D-Hillsborough) whi=
ch=20
repeals the sunset of the Office of Ratepayer Advocate (ORA).? CMTA does no=
t=20
oppose the continued existence of the ORA, but is advocating against langua=
ge=20
inserted into the measure that significantly expands the ORA's authority.=
=20

The ORA has exercised broad authority to supervise and regulate utilities,=
=20
arguably beyond the authority it was granted when it became a stand-alone=
=20
office. While there is ample legislative history in Public Utilities Code=
=20
Section 309.5 indicating that the ORA should be independent of the=20
Commission, the PUC=01,s full authority was not automatically extended to t=
he=20
ORA.=20

CMTA joined Pacific Bell in proposing amendments to limit the ORA=01,s auth=
ority=20
and to require the PUC to issue written orders when ruling on the ORA's=20
discovery requests.? Written rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or=20
Commissioner would provide additional information to the ORA, utilities and=
=20
the public explaining the basis for decisions.=20

In addition, CMTA supports requiring the ORA to pursue alternative dispute=
=20
resolution prior to filing a complaint.? Many courts today utilize=20
alternative dispute resolution because it often leads to a more efficient=
=20
disposition of cases.=20

CMTA also is supportive of extending, for five more years, the sunset in th=
e=20
bill that the author seeks? to repeal.? Extending the sunset will allow the=
=20
Legislature to assess whether or not the original intent of the legislation=
=20
has achieved its purpose.=20

SB 201 failed passage in Utilities and Commerce on July 9, 2001 when the=20
author resisted? amendments to narrow and clarify provisions in the bill.?=
=20
Reconsideration was granted and the measure received a necessary rule waive=
r=20

?=20

ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE PASSES UI BENEFITS BILL=20

SB 40 by Senator Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) passed out of the Assembly=20
Insurance Committee on July 11 on a 10-5 partisan vote.? The bill would=20
increase the cost of unemployment insurance (UI) to employers by more than=
=20
$3.2 billion over four years and provides no systemic changes to help offse=
t=20
the cost.? CMTA and other employer representatives opposed the bill.=20

An increase in unemployment benefits is a direct payroll tax that would be=
=20
funded entirely by employers.? According to the Employment Development=20
Department's (EDD) projections, SB 40 as proposed would raise employer=20
contributions over and above the existing rates by $160 million by 2004,=20
given there are no changes in the unemployment rate.? Further, it is=20
estimated that by 2005, the total employer UI tax increase would jump to $7=
82=20
million, a 32 percent tax increase.? SB 40 would increase the maximum weekl=
y=20
benefit from the current level of $230 to $325 in 2002, to $373 in 2003, to=
=20
$384 in 2004 based on state average weekly wage estimates.=20

The bill contains several other provisions that add costs to employers such=
=20
as an alternate base period using the most recent 52 weeks of the benefit=
=20
year that will allow six to eight percent more applicants to qualify for UI=
=20
benefits.? This would be a new system in addition to the current quarterly=
=20
reporting system and would impose a new burden on employers who would have =
to=20
manually report alternate base period wage information to EDD within ten da=
ys=20
or pay a $250 civil penalty.? It would also entitle employees who leave the=
ir=20
job during a trade dispute caused by a reduction in wages and employees=20
locked-out of work by the employer during a collective bargaining dispute t=
o=20
receive UI benefits anyway.=20

The federal Worker Adjustment and Renotification and Training Act (WARN)=20
requires an employer of 100 or more employees to give at least a 60-day=20
notice in plant closings or mass layoffs affecting 50 or more employees.? I=
f=20
the employer fails to provide a WARN notice, they are liable for civil=20
damages in the amount of 60 days of back pay and benefits to each affected=
=20
worker.? Some employers elect to not give the advance notice and pay the 60=
=20
days and benefits in order to avoid possible problems with product quality,=
=20
equipment sabotage, poor attendance, injuries and etc.? However, the upside=
=20
to this decision is that employees get 60 days in which to look for work fu=
ll=20
time with full pay and benefits.? SB 40 would allow these employees to=20
collect UI benefits during the same 60 days.=20

California=01,s UI maximum weekly benefit of $230 is the fifth lowest in th=
e=20
nation and has not been increased since 1992.? However, California has the=
=20
most liberal eligibility requirement of any state by almost any measure and=
=20
in order to maintain any reasonable control on UI cost, the historical=20
trade-off has been workers receiving lower benefits. The above provisions a=
re=20
good examples of how the system can be abused and must be resisted by=20
employers.=20

CMTA along with other employer representatives are in serious discussion wi=
th=20
the proponents of SB 40 to determine how to increase the benefit level and=
=20
make some modest systemic changes that will help avoid placing an undue=20
hardship on employers.? Further discussions are being scheduled.=20
?=20

STORMWATER BILL PUT OVER=20

Late last week, Senator Kuehl=01,s office circulated a negotiated compromis=
e on=20
the stormwater monitoring bill, SB 72 (Kuehl D-Santa Monica).? Based on tha=
t=20
version, the business community and the municipalities were prepared to=20
remove their opposition earlier this week in the Assembly Environmental=20
Safety and Toxic Materials Committee.? However, the evening before the=20
hearing, the bill=01,s sponsor, Heal the Bay, circulated a new set of amend=
ments=20
to Committee members.? Their version deletes several sections of the bill,=
=20
including carefully crafted language intended to preserve and strengthen=20
group monitoring programs.? It also creates the potential for expanded=20
monitoring requirements for industrial facilities.=20

Heal the Bay=01,s action created an atmosphere of confusion and frustration=
 that=20

=20
in committee.? In all probability, a rule waiver will be secured for an=20
August hearing in Assembly Toxics.? In the meantime, discussions will resum=

CMTA ADVOCATES FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING=20

CMTA has formally urged that $100 million dollars be allocated in the State=
=20
Budget for Career and Technical Education (CTE, also known as vocational=20
education). At the outset of this session, legislative leaders stated that=

CTE was one of the highest education priorities for the year.? Unfortunatel=

UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY

A recent report from the California Department of Finance confirms that the=
