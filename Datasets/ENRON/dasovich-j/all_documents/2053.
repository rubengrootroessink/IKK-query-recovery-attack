Dad/Eldon is going to get some Acacia Chardonnay for $5 per bottle.? We had 
some at Hopkins last night and it was really very good.? It is unlabeled but 
it is Acacia chard.? I know you don't drink a lot of white wine - but you 
might want some around.? Let us know - he needs to order it before he goes 
and he is going to try to go tomorrow.

Cameron - I need a few days to make any arrangements you want me to do in 
Italy - so please let me know.?  

I will be out of the office the rest of the day.? Home around 6 or 7.
