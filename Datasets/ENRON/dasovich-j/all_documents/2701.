The following is a summary of the attached Edison prehearing conference =20
statement filed this afternoon in the proceeding dealing with its Petition=
=20
for  Modification of the end-of-the-rate-freeze decisions:
?
Edison says there are There are four key elements to managing the  situatio=
n:

Support market reform, including providing greater freedom for  utilities
to contract for longer term supplies of power, completing review  of SCE=01=
,s
bilateral contract proposals, and urging other agencies to help  rectify th=
e
market structure problems that have become apparent.
Confirm that the utilities will be permitted to recover their  reasonable
procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers.
Protect customers by implementing a post-freeze rate stabilization  plan
instead of the current plan which directs immediate pass through  of
volatile wholesale power costs. This should include a modest  near-term
energy rate increase of around 10% in the interest of avoiding a  much larg=
er=20
rate
increase in 2002 and thereafter.
Promptly decide whether the Commission is going to permit the sale  of
the utilities=01, remaining generation assets. If the answer is =01&no,=018=
  then
fundamental changes in the implementation of electric  restructuring
would have to be considered. Either way, all parties need  the
Commission=01,s answer to this key question as soon as possible.

our hydro facilities, Palo Verde, Mohave and Four Corners (no one has argue=

that these valuations are too high), our stranded costs (for the purpose of=
