Exchange.

The show will be introduced by Dean Laura Tyson and moderated by CNN's Jeff

the end of the program. A raffle and a reception will follow the taping of
the show.

AT Kearney, the exclusive sponsor of CEO Exchange, will raffle off two Pen
Cam Trios by AIPTEK to the students at the end of the taping. The Pen Cam
is a three-in-one camera: it's a PC camera, a digital camera, and a digital
camcorder. You can view it at http://www.aiptek.com/Products_PenCam-Trio.htm.

HOLD ON TO YOUR TICKETS! You will need them for admission to the show, for
the raffle, and for admission to the catered reception with the speakers
and special guests that takes place after the show at the new Haas Pavilion.
