Dear Schwab e.Bulletin Subscriber,

In the February 2001 edition of the e.Bulletin sent
on 2/13/2001, there is an error in the section
titled "Redesigned for Your Needs: Schwab
by Phone for Signature Services."

The reference to $14.95 pricing for up to 1,000 shares on
automated equity phone trades is incorrect.

Equity commissions on Schwab by Phone for Signature Services
are $29.95 for trades up to 1,000 shares and 3 cents per share
for trades over 1,000 shares, unless you qualify
for Active Trader Tiered Pricing: $19.95 for 31-60 trades per
quarter and $14.95 for 61+ trades per quarter, for qualifying
equity trades on automated channels up to 1,000 shares.


To learn more about Active Trader Tiered Pricing, just click

As a result, for any equity trades you may have placed on Schwab
by Phone that were executed today only, we will honor the $14.95
price for the first 1,000 shares. We apologize for any inconvenience
and appreciate your understanding.

Sincerely,


Schwab e.Bulletin Team
