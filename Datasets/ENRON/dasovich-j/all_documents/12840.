On Friday, May 11, the BAAQMD hosted a workshop to review the proposed
changes to the emergency generator regulations.  This public workshop
provided the BAAQMD an opportunity to describe in detail the proposed
regulation and the regulated community an opportunity to ask questions and
provide feedback.

The new reqruiements will include:
* Simple permit requirement for any emergency generator engine larger than
50hp
* 100 annual run hours for test, maintanance and reliability
* Unlimited run hours for "emergency" power generation
* Record keeping requirements

There are exeptions and other details.  For more information, please see the
attachments, the BAAQMD staff report and other information items referenced
below.

Steve Motzko of Solectron has created a short Power Point presentation that
summarizes the BAAQMD regulation.  (see the third attachment)

I have included my notes from the workshop as well (fourth
attachment"May11Notes")

The final draft regulation is scheduled to be presented to the BAAQMD board
for approval on June 20 and if approved will be effective July 1.  Please

Roll Your Own Blackout

DATE: Thursday, June 21, the first day of summer, 7-10 p.m.
LOCATION: in your home (worldwide)


California is experiencing a serious energy crisis and has been
subject to involuntary blackouts
throughout much of this year.  The blackouts are expected to increase
this summer. Your participation in this event would be a nice way to
show support for increased conservation in the US.

As an alternative to George W. Bush's energy policies and lack of
emphasis on efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels, there
will be a voluntary rolling blackout on the first day of summer, June
21 at 7pm - 10pm in any time zone (this will roll it across the
planet).

Its a simple and symbolic act to promote conservation. Turn out your
lights from 7pm-10pm on June 21. Unplug whatever you can unplug in
your house. Light a candle, kiss and tell or not, take a stroll in
the dark, invent ghost stories, anything that's not electric - have
fun in the dark.
This is an international effort spearheaded by citizens in California.
