Blackouts at baseball games are bad- play ceases and people get angry...in 
the dark.

Importance: High


April 12, 2001

To:        ORC Western Occupational Safety and Health Group

From:    Elizabeth A. Treanor

Subject:    Consultants on Power Outages

This is a little out of our realm, but ORC received a call from a
strategic planner with the Public Utilities Commission, who
informed us that because of the energy shortage in California,
there will be rolling blackouts this summer.  The PUC is looking
for consultants who can provide information in the following
areas:

1.    Impact of power outages on chemical processes
2.      Impact of power outages on biomedical processes.

3.    Impact of power outages at public events (and who
understands current regulations with regard to ballparks).

The PUC is seeking to bypass the state contracting procedures and
finalize contracts within the next few weeks.  They asked ORC for
names of consultants with expertise in the above areas.  When ORC
volunteered that power outages can have a significant impact on
manufacturing operations as well, they thanked us for sharing but
they are interested in direct impacts on health or safety.

If you have any suggestions for the PUC, please provide them to
me ASAP; the PUC requested a response by April 16, 2001.

Thank you.
