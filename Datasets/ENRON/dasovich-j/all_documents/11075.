I'd love to talk but I never see you.  I assume you are doing the big
catholic thing for easter (not).  I, of course, will be in San Diego.

Just give me some nights that work for you in the next couple weeks...

Have a good weekend!!

I would love for you to meet our new VP of Professional Services (who is,
incidentally, now for all intents and purposes running our company).  I
think you will love him.  He is very interested in the idea of working with
Enron and I want you to meet him.  Can we set up a dinner for the three of
us sometime in the next couple weeks?  I know your schedule is busy with
school, so why don't you tell me a couple nights that work (other than
Mondays) and I will make it work on our end.  Please oh please.

Love,

Your Pal Cameron

P.S.  Going to Colleen's new (to me) place for some wine tonight.  I'll
tell
her hello for you?
