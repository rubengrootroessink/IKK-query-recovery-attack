KEY MESSAGES

Generators have been operating under the rules California established for i=

rules. ?In fact, the "big five" generators did not come to California until
AB 1890 invited them into the state, where they?ve since invested billions =

dollars buying, building and modernizing power plants.

=01. Energy companies, independent financial analysts and IEP warned that t=

PUC was failing to implement AB 1890 properly, and that the market was bein=

We?re an important part of the solution.
