Energy Committee Members:
Please find the agenda for tomorrow's energy committee meeting attached.
This is a critical time on the energy front.  We find ourselves both excited
and discouraged and have a number of things to share with you.

There have been some encouraging developments - the ISO approved the SVMG
proposal for an early notification system and are working on implementation,
which is expected by June 13.  This is something our committee plainly
expressed as necessary for business to survive through this crisis and is
something the SVMG advocated for on behalf of its members for the past month
or so.  Also, the first SVMG-NRDC joint energy webcast conducted last week
was a success.  Leslie Hummel will be available to provide feedback and
discuss next steps.

There are also a few things that make us very concerned.  Such as a proposal
from Speaker Hertzberg that has potential to severely raise rates for the
business class.  We need your help in devising an energy plan and a strategy
by which we can adress proposals such as this one.  We also need to hear
from you in devising a long range plan for the energy committee as we
re-tool the focus and tactics of the SVMG on energy.  Please review the
agenda.  If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to adress them by
responding to this e-mail or at tomorrow's committee meeting.  Thanks!
