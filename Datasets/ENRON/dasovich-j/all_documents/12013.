Joseph,

Have you been able to confirm a meeting for me on Friday AM, 11 May in your 
offices in San Francisco with Jeff Dasovich and Sandi McCubbin.  I would like 
to discuss with them our west coast LNG concepts and get their input 
regarding regulatory and legislative issues that we should consider.

Thanks,

Kurt Lindahl
