I turned the spreadsheet into charts - one for 5 years and one for 10.  I'm
not sure what story they tell exactly, except that the two move in tandem
with beverages appearing more volatile.  Also attached are new stock price
reaction charts for 5 and 10 years still including the S&P 500 index.  I
could not put all 6 on one chart - would have been too confusing anyhow I
think.

As promised, I've attached a spreadsheet that offers monthly industry
returns
(incl. dividends) for the beverage and food industries.  There is no
consolidated food & beverage sector.
