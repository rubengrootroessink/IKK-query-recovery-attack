Title: California's Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2241


California=01,s Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase

On February 1, 2001, the California Assembly approved and the California=20
governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California.=
=20
The=20
legislature has been meeting since early January in a =01&special extraordi=
nary=20
session=018 to address the power market crisis in the state, and the new la=
w=20
represents their first significant piece of legislation. The bill, AB 1,=20
establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state=01,s busines=
ses=20
and=20
consumers. Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the=
=20
limited revenue source used to pay for the power=01*collected by the state=
=01,s=20
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) under current retail rates=01*will cover=20
wholesale=20
power market costs incurred by the state. The law reflects the obsession by=
=20
California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on=
=20
the=20
underlying flaws in California=01,s market structure.=20

AB 1 ushers in several important changes to the California market structure=
.=20
It=20
also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the=
=20
state. Highlights of the bill include

* Power buying authority transferred. The responsibility for purchasing pow=
er=20
for the customers of California=01,s IOUs has been transferred to the Calif=
ornia=20
Department of Water Resources (CDWR). The California utilities will continu=
e=20
to=20
operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts. T=
he=20
difference between the utilities=01, total load and the sum of their resour=
ces=20
(referred to as the utilities=01, =01&net short=018 amount) will be supplie=
d by CDWR,=20
an=20
amount of energy that varies between 5,000 and 25,000 megawatts (MW),=20
depending=20
on the time of year, time of day, and utility plant availability. The=20
utilities=20
most recently performed this function themselves, buying energy from the=20
California Power Exchange (PX). However, CDWR has been buying electricity o=
n=20
behalf of the IOUs since mid-January, when the near-bankruptcy of Southern=
=20
California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) threatened to=20
disrupt=20
supplies to their customers. CDWR is a state agency that manages water=20
reservoirs and transportation systems in the state. CDWR uses an enormous=
=20
amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides=20
critical load-shedding capability to the independent system operator (ISO).=
=20
In=20
addition, CDWR=01,s reservoirs generate power. The CDWR is thus well integr=
ated=20
in=20
the state=01,s electric grid but in the past has not executed large, compli=
cated=20
energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of California=01,s=20
utilities.=20

* Portfolio of transactions. The intent of AB 1 is to allow CDWR to execute=
 a=20
portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and=
=20
their customers. CDWR has until January 2, 2003, to execute contracts. CDWR=
=20
will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse.=
=20
It=20
has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms, including=20
monthly,=20
annual, two-year, three-year, and longer. CDWR may also enter into options.=
=20
Thus, although CDWR=01,s role is intended to be temporary, the contracts th=
at it=20
executes could extend many years.

* Power for munis. CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California=20
municipal utilities at the municipal utilities=01, election.

* New payment scheme. CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit=
y=20
rates to pay for the cost of purchased power, interest on bonds, and=20
administrative expenses. This payment stream will be equal to the differenc=
e=20
between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates=
=20
(averaging about $0.07 per kilowatt-hour &#91;kWh&#93;) and the utilities=
=01,=20
costs to run=20
their own generation plants, costs of bilateral and qualifying facility=20
contracts, and the costs of ancillary services. The CDWR share of retail=20
rates=20
is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment (CPA). It is not clear=
=20
whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs. Current prices for=
=20
multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA. In addition, if investors=
=20
believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs, the entire program may b=
e=20
abandoned.=20

* New bonds. Bonds will be issued to secure power. The total amount of bond=
s=20
issued may not exceed four times the CPA. The state will transfer $500=20
million=20
from the general fund to jump-start the program, which begins immediately.=
=20
This=20
seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the=20
California=20
utilities=01, customers (and municipal utilities if they opt in).

* New residential rate freeze. The California Public Utilities Commission=
=20
(CPUC) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha=
s=20
completed paying all outstanding obligations. This locks in the recent 9=20
percent residential rate increase indefinitely. Governor Gray Davis thus=20
keeps=20
his pledge not to increase rates further.

* Retail competition. To help secure a stable payment stream for the new=20
bonds,=20
AB 1 enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities=01, retail customers from=
=20
choosing=20
an alternative electricity provider until CDWR=01,s obligations are paid.=
=20
Although=20
the CPUC has yet to act on this, the action would effectively halt the=20
competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra=
m.=20

* Taxpayer protection. AB 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state =01&&#=
91;
n&#93;either=20
the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is=20
pledged=20
to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond.=018 Thus, the =
bonds=20
are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates.

*No assets affected. The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of=
=20
utility assets.

Ironically, the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had=
=20
essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity=
=20
prices by executing a portfolio of transactions. The utilities were never=
=20
provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts. In addition, the=
=20
utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR.=20

Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices,=20
California=20
has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing=
=20
function. SCE and PG&E are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro=
m=20
past energy purchases, although they will no longer incur costs associated=
=20
with=20
buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail=
=20
rates. The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved.=20

It is not clear whether the law=01,s prohibition on rate increases for=20
residential=20
customers can be achieved. The law is silent on rate increases for commerci=
al=20
and industrial customers, providing a potential path for recovering=20
higher-than-
expected costs. Alternatively, CDWR could conceivably find contracts of=20
sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met. These=
=20
contracts would lock in today=01,s retail rates for a long period of time.=
=20

AB 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the=20
power=20
system in California to a more stable footing. Key tasks remain.

* California=01,s wholesale market structure, which helped cause the supply=
=20
crisis=20
by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in=
=20
California, remains unchanged. The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi=
ll=20
provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will=
=20
not=20
be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities. In=20
addition,=20
California=01,s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged.

* The state must still address the need to expedite the development of new=
=20
power plants.

* AB 1 does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener=
gy=20
costs of California=01,s utilities. The state has been negotiating a deal w=
ith=20
the=20
utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset=
s=20
to=20
the state. However, the utilities have achieved recent court victories that=
=20
may=20
pave the way to a court-directed recovery of these costs. Recent audits=20
indicate that SCE and PG&E recovered their stranded costs early in 2000,=20
which=20
should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes. A legal=20
showdown=20
between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable.
