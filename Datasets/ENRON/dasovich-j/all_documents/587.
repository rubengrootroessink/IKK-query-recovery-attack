Jeff:
Great! Give me just a couple of days to confirm the exact date. Go ahead and
write Lari to see when she is available as she'll probably be the hardest
person to juggle around.

Now here is a question for you....Rob has been wanting to go up to RRR and
check it out but he'd probably be 1/2 day on the beach as other non-riders
have been with us in the past. Would this be ok with you or shall I schedule
with him for another time? I'm easy either way. Besides Rob the only other
people could possibly be Jeff or Alice as the girls (Nora, Kari, Pat) are hot
on the summer show circuit. I could always ask, just let me know.

Would you like me to call the B&B we stayed at and get their availability?
What is the name?

Madeleine
