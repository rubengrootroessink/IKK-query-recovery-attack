Electric Utilities Ask U.S. Agency for Help

Consolidated Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities urged federal energy 
regulators yesterday to reform New York State's wholesale electricity market 
to reduce energy prices.

The utility companies, blamed by  many of their customers for this summer's 
high electricity bills, contended that they were not responsible for the 
higher charges, which they called the result of excessively high wholesale 
energy costs in the state's deregulated electricity market. 

The utilities' request came in papers filed with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission in a proceeding involving the New York State 
Independent System Operator, which administrates the wholesale energy market 
in the state.

Among the changes the two utilities urged was revision of Independent System 
Operator ''market rules and procedures that discourage economically efficient 
imports'' of electricity from other regions, like New England. They also 
called for changes in rules power generators must follow, to avoid severe 
day-to-day fluctuation in electricity prices. Joseph P. Fried
