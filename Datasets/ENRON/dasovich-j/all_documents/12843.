Jeff -- Thanks for your phone message.  I'm stuck and need your help.  My 
Microsoft Word isn't working, and I want to send something out to the ceos 
asap tuesday.  Can you clean up the letter?  I'm fine w/ your edits (for the 
signature line, add "name, title")  Pls send me the final letter so I can 
detach.  i've left a message for steve and will wait to send until i hear 
from him.   

I'm didn't collect biz cards from everyone at the CEO meetings, and I need 
email and/or fax numbers for:

Tony Ridder
Steve Kirsch
Ken Oshman
Fred Anderson
Dan Scheinman
Vivek Ranadive
John Doerr
Ray Irani

Can you send me the info from their cards?  Call me if you have any 
questions.  THANK YOU!!!
