Yesterday (5/31) Jim Steffes, John Shelk,  and I met with Jeff Duncan, a 
staffer for Congressman Markey (D-MA).  Unfortunately, Markey's  80% forward 
contracting requirement seems to be alive and well.  He seems commited to the 
belief that forcing more 18-month deals will help customers in the current 
"sellers" market.  He specifically asked for information on the amount of 
forward contracting currently in place.

Please review attached slides (the word slides are very rough) and give me 
feedback as to whether the current market information would effective in 
either our DC or Califronia legislative.

Note that the forward price information is confidential and we need to get 
clearance before we release.
