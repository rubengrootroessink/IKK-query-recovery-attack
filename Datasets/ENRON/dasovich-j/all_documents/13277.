Prime Olympics seats up for auction

The Salt Lake Organizing Committee is selling tickets to the 2002
Winter Olympics through an online auction that's raising far more
than the face value of the seats. The committee said it raised
$113,702, seven times the face value of the tickets, from its
first group of eBay auctions. One pair of front-row seats for
men's figure skating sold for $11,100. The face value for the two
was $750. Three sets of women's skating tickets, also with a face
value of $750 per pair, went for $10,100 each.

"Our original plan was likely to take a break after the first 100
tickets and to continue in the fall,"  SLOC Chief Operating
Officer Fraser Bullock told the Associated Press. "Given the
response we've received, we will continue to add events and will
continue this auction for the foreseeable future ... to the
extent we have front-row, best seats in the house still
available."

Consumers Union to study Web credibility

The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine said Walt Disney Co.'s
ABCNews.com veteran Beau Brendler will head up an effort to set
up credibility standards for the Web. The Consumers Union's Web
Credibility Project will evaluate the information on Web sites
and report what it finds.

"This project has enormously ambitious goals," Brendler said in a
statement, "and now more than ever, with Web ventures shutting
down every week, consumers need to know that the sites they are
relying on for news, vital information and business transactions
aren't hiding anything and are doing their jobs in an honest,
credible way."

Consumers Union said the project grew out of  a 1998 conference
at which print and new media journalists agreed there was a need
to create effective standards to measure editorial quality and
the separation between editorial and advertising content on the
Web.

Office Depot buys Officesupplies.com

Office Depot said Thursday it bought online retailer
Officesupplies.com. Bruce Nelson, Office Depot's CEO, said in a
statement, "This business combination allows us to increase our
market position and leverage our existing infrastructure. We have
high praise for the officesupplies.com management team and are
pleased that they have agreed to join us during the transition
period." Nelson said the company is also considering other
acquisitions. Office Depot said Officesupplies.com's Web site
will remain up for 90 days and current customers will be offered
the chance to move their accounts to Office Depot's Web site.
Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
