Jeff: I have updated the Summary spreadsheet to include the two items we 
discussed.  

Changes
1.  I have included a toggle switch that changes between the 500kW and above 
view and the 20kW and above view for the non-core (sophisticated) customers.
2.  I have also included the change in the financing of the Past Utility 
costs to spread them between both core and non-core customers to approach a 
.31 cents per kW price for SCE. (this can also toggle between the previous 
scenario of all Past Utility to non-core and this new scenario).

Let me know if you have any questions and we can review in the morning.  
Thanks.

Kortney
