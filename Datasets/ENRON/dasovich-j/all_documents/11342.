Here is the revised stipulation.  Be advised that Dan Douglas is still
trying to modify it further to ensure we are paid on the basis of recorded
ISO settlements numbers instead of forecasts.  Mike

Jeanne:  here is a revised stip that incorporates your requested language
regarding parties' rights to contest the advice filing.  I couldn't get the
track changes to work accurately so I will just tell you there are not
changes except for your paragraph which is the fourth from the last in the
document.  Let me know if this is now acceptable to Enron for filing.  (I am
still waiting to get APS' sign-off as well.)
