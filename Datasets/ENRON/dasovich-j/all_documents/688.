Let's discuss this soon to at least agree on a set of desirable candidates.
Obviously we won't be able to get invitations and accepted invitations within
the next week or two, but we can jointly determine a set of candidates that 
are
acceptable.  I leave today for Portland so maybe we can talk on Monday.
