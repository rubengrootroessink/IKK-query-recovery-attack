Dear classmates,

My wife, Eve, is co-chairing this year's Oakland
Ballet Gala, which will be held at the newly renovated
Rotunda Building in Oakland on May 5.  She would like
to know if any of my classmates would be interested in
attending this year's Gala.  She has promised me that
it will be THE event of the year!  If you are
interested, please e-mail me your address and she will
put you on the invitation list.  If you have any
questions, please feel free to call her (510-627-1635)
or e-mail her (egrossma@portoakland.com) at her
office.

Hope you have a great semester!

Pat Bukowski
