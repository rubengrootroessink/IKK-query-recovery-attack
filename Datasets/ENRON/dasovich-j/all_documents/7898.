Better Late than Never

There's still time for some of you to order from our collection of=20
Champagnes and sparkling wines for New Year's, or to score that=20
perfect last-minute choice from our selection of red wines, white=20
wines, and dessert wines. If you happen to be hosting a party, go for=20
our mixed case of house reds, or create your own -- we offer a 10=20
percent discount on case orders, and a 5 percent discount on=20
half-case orders. Most importantly, when it comes to the fruit of the=20
vine, December 25 is hardly a drop-dead date for enjoying -- or even=20
gift-giving, for that matter. In the aftermath of the holidays, many=20
people appreciate wine even more.=20

Great Wine and Gifts

Dom. J. Laurens Cremant de Limoux Brut Blanc de Blancs,=20
France, $11.00
This bubbly was made by Michel Dervin, a young, dynamic winemaker who=20
also makes wine under his own name in the Champagne region farther=20
north. Whether you're looking for bubbly for a crowd or a dry=20
sparkling wine that won't break the bank, this is a great choice.=20

Vino Tre Colore, $34.00
This Italian three-pack includes a white wine from Umbria, a red=20
Chianti Classico from Tuscany, and an Alto Adige sparkler so brisk=20
and refreshing that (to complete the match with the national flag) it=20
could almost be called green. Comes in a handsome wine.com gift box.=20

Skagen Brushed Steel Wine Tool Set, $48.00
Clean, contemporary Danish design, top-notch technical craftsmanship,=20
and an elegant presentation box enhance these fabulous and functional=20
"showoff" tools. The set includes a corkscrew, an opener, and a=20
bottle stopper.=20

1998 Weinstock Chenin Blanc Contour, Clarksburg, California, $11.00
A kosher wine appropriate for Passover, but whether or not that=20
designation is important to you, you'll find it a crisp and pretty=20
white marked by stone fruit, green pear, and floral notes. It will=20
pair nicely with a variety of dishes or soft cheeses and fresh fruit,=20
or you can serve it chilled as an aperitif.=20

Melange a Trois, $42.00
Zee French have a way with zee wine. This three-pack includes a crisp=20
Muscadet from the Atlantic coast, a luscious Syrah blend from the=20
sunny Mediterranean south, and a supple Cabernet blend from Bordeaux.=20
Comes in a handsome wine.com gift box.=20

1998 Yering Station Cabernet Sauvignon, Yarra Valley, Victoria,=20
Australia, $13.99
An easy-to-drink Cabernet with bright, refreshing texture and ripe=20
flavors of cassis, plum, and sweet vanilla oak. Minimal tannins make=20

OK, Time to Get Serious

With the Big Ones almost upon us, it's time to quit fooling around.=20
When it comes to food and wine for Christmas and/or New Year's Eve,=20
"special" is the name of the game. We think a perfect menu for either=20
occasion is Louise Fiszer's Putting on the Ritz -- a sublime=20
progression on the palate:=20

=01=07?Oysters on the Half Shell with Horseradish Cream=20

Since this menu sets a standard for elegant indulgence (or indulgent=20
elegance), it's a perfect showcase for quality sparkling wines. Any=20
of these will go nicely with the seafood and shellfish dishes:=20

With the beef tenderloin, however, a special red is in order -- for=20
example, the 1997 Chateau Leoville-Barton St. Julien, Bordeaux,=20
France, $49.95.=20

Bear in mind that a built-in aspect of any great wine is its ability=20
to age; so, even if you miss our shipping deadlines for the holidays=20
in question, don't despair. These bottles will be even better this=20
time next year.=20

Happy Holidays!=20
