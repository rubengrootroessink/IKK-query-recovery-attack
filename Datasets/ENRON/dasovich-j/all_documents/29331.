I think you're absolutely right.  I wonder what happens if the SEC lodges
complaints and the FPPC determines there was a conflict of interest in terms
of the long term contracts?

Thank you for the head's up on the lawsuit.

By the way, did Enron just hire McNally?  If so, what are they doing?

Scott

Thanks.  Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.  I don't
think Maviglio will be able to stay.  Your thoughts?  I'm glad he made some
money off of Enron stock.  (What a jerk.)

Also, we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash
will be filed today.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Following up on yesterday's conversation, SBX1 31 did contain some
expedited
review provisions for CPUC and DWR decisions and was chaptered into law on
May 10.  The first special session ended on or about May 15 which means the
expedited provisions take effect on or about August 15.  The intent of the
budget language was to have that take effect even sooner.

Scott
