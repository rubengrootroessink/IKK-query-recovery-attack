Good quick stats on demand

F. What Caused the Electricity Price Increases in California?
The simplistic story of why California=01,s electricity prices skyrocketed =
over=20
the past year is that demand for electricity had grown equal to, and even=

beyond, the supplies of electricity available in the state. Between 1996 an=

1999, California=01,s electricity demand grew by 5,500 MW (14 percent), eig=
ht=20
times the 672 MW (2 percent) increase in electricity generation capacity=20
added over the same period. Of course, these numbers do not explain why new=

electricity capacity was not added as demand grew, or why demand did not=20
shrink as supplies ran short.
Even detailed studies of the California electricity market oversimplify the=

prices. In fact, as Figure 2 shows, a tangled web of factors led to price=

Many of the price influences in Figure 2 (the un-shaded ones) came about du=

little that policy makers can do to influence them. But many other price=20
influences (the shaded ones) are shaped, and even created, by state policy=

decisions, most of them part of the restructuring plan. Policy alternatives=
