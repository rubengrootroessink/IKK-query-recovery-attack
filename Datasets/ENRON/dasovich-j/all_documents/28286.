Tricon works extremely close with Retailer's Association.  Tricon suggested 
we contact the President of the CA Retailer's Association for assistance.

Michelle,
We have not been called to testify. We work with Bill Dombrowski, President
of
California Retailer's Assoc. Your California govt. relations person could
reach
Bill at 916-443-1975 to see if other commercial customers were called.
Joe

The California Chamber of Commerce received a call from someone at the
CPUC who requested that they send as many customers as possible to
testify at Tuesday's hearing in favor of direct access.   The Chamber
has requested the same thing of Enron.
