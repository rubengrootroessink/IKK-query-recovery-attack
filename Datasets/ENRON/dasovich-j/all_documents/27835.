A Rock and a Hard  Place
?
Today, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted  3-0 to appro=
ve=20
a settlement=01*proposed by FirstEnergy, GPU, the Office of Consumer  Advoc=
ate,=20
the Industrial Intervenor groups and PennFuture=01*to resolve the =20
FirstEnergy/GPU merger and provider of last resort rate increase requests.=
=20
The  PUC was faced with a seemingly intractable choice: grant a rate increa=

=20
stranded  cost recovery decision in Pennsylvania, or just saying =01&no=018=
 and=20

tility.=20
In approving the  settlement, the PUC resolved the thorny issues raised by=
=20
the cases without  excusing GPU=01,s failure to adequately plan its provide=
r of=20
last resort service.  Considering the circumstances, the result is good for=
=20
consumers, the companies  and the environment.=20

But while Pennsylvania PUC approval was a major hurdle,  the New Jersey Boa=
rd=20
of Public Utilities must still approve the merger as well,  and such approv=
al=20
is anything but a sure thing.=20

Now that the PUC has made its decision, let=01,s break  through the rhetori=
c,=20
assess the real issues in the proceeding and see how the  settlement=20
addresses them.

The Problem
No matter who you are, how  you look at it, or who you might blame, the=20
fundamental problem in this case is  that GPU divested its generating asset=
s=20
in 1998 and failed to protect its  shareholders and customers from the=20
possibility of rising wholesale prices. In  fact, wholesale prices did rise=
,=20
the retail generation rate caps remained  intact, no competitive default=20
service was established, and GPU had insufficient  long-term or lower-price=
d=20
generation contracts in place. Alone among  Pennsylvania=01,s major utiliti=
es,=20
GPU was spending much more to buy wholesale  generation than it was paid to=
=20
sell that generation to its native load  customers.=20

The real problem then was that GPU was running out of cash  or credit to bu=
y=20
wholesale generation to meet its obligations. Although the  company as a=20
whole continued to fare well financially, it became clear only  towards the=
=20
end of the proceedings that the Commission and the public interest  require=
d=20
a solution which would enable GPU to continue to deliver provider of  last=
=20
resort generation service, and to do so without breaking the rate caps. If =
=20
the Commission didn=01,t find a solution by June 15, GPU could have been fr=
ozen=20
out  of the capital markets and would have come back to the Commission for=
=20
emergency  rate relief=01*requiring a whole new set of proceedings concerni=
ng=20
the same facts. =20

The Solution=20
The preferred solution  was to merge GPU and FirstEnergy and to establish a=
n=20
accounting deferral for GPU  energy costs. The merger is a good solution in=
=20
part because it overcomes the  cash flow necessary to buy generation on the=
=20
market. Any cash generated by a  modest rate increase trickles in over time=
=20
and is of secondary importance, so  any modest rate increase wasn=01,t goin=
g to=20
solve the problem.  FirstEnergy, a huge generation owner, can provide some =
of=20
the needed  generation=01*even at market prices=01*without requiring the GP=
U=20
utilities to pay cash  on time. With a merged company, there is plenty of=
=20
room for internal accounting  flexibility. And, as a huge wholesale=20
generation player, FirstEnergy can also  better manage wholesale purchasing=
.

The deferral is a good solution, too, because the rate  caps remain 100%=20
intact. Consumers won=01,t pay more for electricity. Finally, GPU  will be =
able=20
to re-enter the capital markets, and although they are given a  lifeline, G=
PU=20
shareholders are not taken off the hook for the company=01,s past  performa=
nce.

Thus, on May 24, 2001, the Commission approved the merger  itself and allow=
ed=20
GPU to establish deferral of generation expenses for  accounting purposes.=

=20
expenses for the company and all consumers; and committing the company to =
=20

invest  another $10 million in renewable energy projects.=20

How the Deferral Accounting Works=20
The  deferral provisions allow GPU to retain unrecovered generation costs o=
n=20
its  books until 2010 but doesn=01,t require GPU consumers to pay more as a=
=20
result. The  rate caps are left 100% intact. Some excess generation costs=
=20
will be reduced on  the company=01,s books if future energy prices decrease=
=20
sufficiently.=20

The settlement also increases the shopping credit  modestly, while=20
correspondingly reducing the Competitive Transition Charge  (CTC), so some =
of=20
the possible excess generation costs also may be recovered  from existing C=
TC=20
revenue, which otherwise would have been applied against  company stranded=
=20
costs. Doing so does not increase consumer payments, however,  because the=
=20
1998 GPU Restructuring Settlement allowed CTC collection to continue  as lo=
ng=20
as 2020, in order to take into account the unknown level of non-utility =20
generation (NUG) costs and divestiture proceeds that were a major portion o=
f =20
total GPU stranded costs.=20

The settlement cuts off CTC collection for GPU in 2015,  rather than=20
permitting CTC collection from Met Ed customers to continue until as  long =
as=20
2020. (Best current estimates are that the Met Ed CTC would have  continued=
=20
to about 2018.) Now, any stranded costs not recovered by 2015 must be =20
written off, reducing consumer payment of stranded costs. This will provide=
=20
a  modest improvement in the opportunity to shop and for a competitive mark=
et=20
to  develop. Any remaining excess generation costs must be written off by=
=20
2010. =20

The settlement also redefines the way that NUG stranded  costs are=20
calculated. Under the 1998 Restructuring Settlement, the amount by  which N=
UG=20
payments exceed the market value capped rate are stranded costs. As  change=
d,=20
only the portion of a NUG payment that exceeds the higher of the capped  ra=
te=20
or the market price is recoverable as stranded costs. This change corrects =
=20
what turned out to be an inaccurate assumption that the market price of =20
generation would always be below the capped rate, but it does not affect NU=
G =20
contracts in any way. The NUGs still get whatever they are entitled to unde=
r =20
their contracts without changes, and even benefit because their payor will =
=20
become the financially stronger merged FirstEnergy instead of GPU.=20

The Benefits
The primary, and crucial,  benefit to the consumer is that provider of last=
=20
resort generation service will  continue within capped rates. The primary=
=20
benefit to the company is that the  deferral accounting allows the company=
=20
maximum flexibility to recover costs and  to write off unrecovered costs.

But perhaps the most important aspect of the settlement is  that it=20
establishes a firm commitment and mechanism for FirstEnergy to address  the=
=20
underlying problem by reducing its exposure to high energy costs with a =20
comprehensive demand side response program. While the details of the progra=
m =20
remain to be developed, the company commitment includes an effort to=20
=01&maximize  the cost-effective reduction of peak load=018 through interva=
l and=20
time-of-use  metering, appliance control technologies and open architecture=
.=20
Its goals are to  include participation by all customer classes and=20
competitive suppliers and to  be available by next summer. If no program=20
agreement is reached, all parties may  address the issues in a future=20
Commission proceeding.=20

The other environmental benefits are real, if not as  comprehensive as one=
=20
might have preferred. FirstEnergy will give $5 million in  company money to=
=20
the GPU Sustainable Development Funds within 60 days. This  contribution is=
=20
in addition to those already made by GPU, but replaces the .01  cents/kwh o=
f=20
GPU ratepayer money that might have been provided between 2005 and  2008 IF=
=20
the Commission did not change distribution rates by that time. =20

FirstEnergy, in consultation with PennFuture, will also  invest an addition=
al=20
$10 million in renewable energy. Like all provisions of the  settlement, th=
e=20
environmental provisions are subject to PUC oversight. =20

What the Settlement Does Not Do
First,  the settlement does not really resolve what would happen in the eve=
nt=20
that the  merger falls through=01*if, for example, the New Jersey BPU rejec=
ts=20
the merger. All  of the agreements would be tossed except the agreement to=
=20
deal with the deferral  account for generation costs authorized by the=20
Commission on May 24. GPU would  write off all generation costs prior to Ju=
ne=20
1, 2001, while it would recover the  costs incurred after June 1, 2001 in a=
=20
manner and at a time to be determined in  Commission proceedings. Nothing i=
n=20
this provision assumes a rate increase or  breaking the rate caps. For=20
example, the costs could be recovered in a manner  comparable to the deferr=
al=20
accounting in the event that the merger is completed. =20

The settlement also does not allow FirstEnergy to raid any  pension funds.=
=20
Federal law and union contracts govern pension plan funding and  tolerate=
=20
some withdrawals with major tax penalties. GPU unions support the =20
settlement.=20

The settlement does not shut down or clean up all of  FirstEnergy=01,s foss=
il=20
generation plants, or figure out how to safely eliminate  FirstEnergy=01,s=
=20
nuclear waste.=20

Finally, the settlement does not establish lower  competitive wholesale and=
=20
retail market prices in the FirstEnergy and GPU  territories or jump start=
=20
the competitive market.=20

Yeah, that would have been nice, too. =20
