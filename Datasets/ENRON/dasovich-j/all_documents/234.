Will you change the world today?

On May 20 this year, we announced our intention to develop a liquid market =
to=20
trade bandwidth globally, allowing transactions to close in seconds, not=20
months.  That statement involved several challenges.  Technically, none of=
=20
the hardware or software was in place to allow such unprecedented=20
efficiency.  Culturally, the industry viewed the =01&network=018 as the fib=
er that=20
they owned and =01&prices=018 as something that they controlled or numbers =
on an=20
approved tariff sheet.  Respected consulting firms charged their clients fo=
r=20
lists of reasons the market would never develop.  The industry=01,s leading=
=20
market research group published an article about our proposal entitled Grea=
t=20
Idea, Wrong Company.  One of our major competitors=01*an experienced tradin=
g=20
firm=01*proclaimed that they knew markets, and that telecom capacity would =
never=20
be a commodity market, as if that were something bad. =20

We love it when people say it can=01,t be done.

Today, Enron transacted the first commodity bandwidth trade.  This is Day O=
ne=20
of a potential trillion-dollar-a-year market.  Global Crossing was the=20
counterparty to this first trade, and we expect to close a few more deals=
=20
with other companies before the end of the year.

This is an outstanding accomplishment for a team and a firm that just seems=
=20
to keep producing unbelievable innovations.

Can you think of any other firm that could have pulled this off?  I can=01,=
t. =20
The range of talent required for such an accomplishment is mind boggling=01=

hardware engineering, software engineering, provisioning, property, legal,=
=20
regulatory, trading, sales, credit, tax, accounting, risk controls--the lis=
t=20
goes on and on.

We did it first because we were the only ones who could do it at all.  As a=
=20
result, we will be able to offer our clients unique services that our=20
competitors have not even dreamed of yet.  We will attract first a whole ne=
w=20
generation of talent from top schools looking to work with the industry=20
leader, not some dinosaur firm pointing to the way things have always been=

network with =01&infinite route miles=018 without burdening our balance she=
et.  We=20
will implement first an efficient means to manage the perishable bandwidth=
=20
that we own and operate, limiting the =01&spoilage=018 of our physical asse=

Will you change the world today?  ECI=01,s response:  Been there.  Done tha=

Congratulations and thanks to the team for a job well done.  Again.
