                         IN SUPPORT OF
            THE COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

     My name is R. Thomas Beach. I am principal consultant with the firm=20
Crossborder
Energy. My business address is 2560 Ninth Street, Suite 316, Berkeley,=20
California 94710.  My
experience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB-1 to the dire=
ct=20
testimony that I
served in this proceeding on May 4, 2000.


I.   INTRODUCTION

     This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe=
rn=20
California
Generation Coalition (SCGC) and The Utility Reform Network (TURN) in suppor=
t=20
of their "Post-
Interim Settlement Agreement" (PISA), which was submitted to the Commission=
=20
on April 3,
2000.  The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past, present, and=
=20
future electric generation
customers of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego G=
as=20
and Electric
(SDG&E).  The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and=20
supporters of the
Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that over 20 parties filed on April 17,=
=20
2000.  For the
reasons set forth below, the sponsors of this testimony do not support the=
=20
SCGC / TURN PISA
to the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission, a step tha=
t=20
is one of "the most
promising options" that the Commission has identified for the restructuring=
=20
of the SoCalGas
system.  I recommend, instead, that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive=
=20
Settlement
Agreement, which moves forward on all of the Commission's "most promising=
=20
options," including
unbundling intrastate transmission.  The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement=
=20
enjoys broad
support from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern=20
California gas market.


II.  SCGC / TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PG&E
     AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS.

     In D. 99-07-015, at page 14, the Commission identified the creation of=
 a=20
system of firm,
tradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its "most promising=20
options" for the further
restructuring of the SoCalGas system.  A significant element in that=20
determination was the
Commission's desire to follow the model of the PG&E Gas Accord, and thus to=
=20
encourage
statewide consistency in its gas restructuring program.  The SCGC / TURN PI=
SA=20
now asks the
Commission to re-consider that finding, and to defer any further unbundling=
=20
of intrastate
transmission service on the SoCalGas system.  In support of that aspect of=
=20
the PISA, the
witnesses for SCGC / TURN testify (1) that the unbundled transmission syste=
m=20
adopted for
PG&E under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n=
ot=20
been present in
southern California, (2) that there are significant structural and=20
operational differences between
the PG&E and SoCalGas systems, and (3) that the Gas Accord structure has no=
t=20
benefitted end-
use customers in northern California.  None of these assertions are correct=
.

     A.   The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide, Consistent Structure=
=20
for the
          Gas Utilities Moving Forward, Not on Whether PG&E and SoCalGas Ha=
ve
          Had Similar Problems in the Past.

     SCGC / TURN witness Mr. Florio describes at length the problems that l=
ed=20
to the
adoption on transmission unbundling for PG&E in the Gas Accord settlement. =
=20
He views PG&E's
difficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces, thus=
=20
justifying more
"extreme measures" such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission.  SCGC=
 /=20
TURN Testimony,
at Section 2.1.1.2.

     In my view, both PG&E and SoCalGas have faced the same types of=20
problems, even if the
economic distortions on the PG&E system have been greater.  On both systems=
,=20
shippers have not
had a system of firm capacity rights, allocated by non-discriminatory, open=
=20
access procedures, to
govern who had access to what receipt point.  On the PG&E system, the attem=
pt=20
to discriminate
against PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PG&E's Line 400 resulted i=
n=20
the "crossover"
problems at Malin.  Similarly, SoCalGas' "windowing" procedures have not=20
provided firm, non-
discriminatory access at SoCalGas' receipt points.  "Windowing" has=20
restricted the access of
competitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge, just as t=
he=20
"crossover ban"
limited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PG&E's Line 400.

     Furthermore, SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of "conflict of=20
interest" charges as
PG&E.  SoCalGas' core procurement department has been criticized for=20
monopolizing the Hector
Road receipt point, to the benefit of SoCalGas' shareholders through the Ga=
s=20
Cost Incentive
Mechanism.  See D. 99-07-015, at pages 15 - 18.

     However, the Commission should not decide the future structure for=20
California's gas
industry on the basis of whether SoCalGas' past problems have resembled=20
PG&E's past
difficulties. For electric generators, what is important is that the=20
structures that the Commission
adopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be=
=20
consistent on a
statewide basis.  The new electric market is a statewide market.  There are=
=20
already at least two
merchant electric generators (Dynegy and Duke) and a number of QF projects=
=20
under common
ownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory. =20
Another merchant plant
developer (Calpine) has made no secret of its intent to operate plants=20
statewide.  This trend
promises to increase competition in the electric market.  To encourage this=
=20
trend, the Commission
should focus on carrying through on D. 99-07-015's promise to increase the=
=20
statewide consistency
of California's natural gas restructuring program.  The unbundling of=20
intrastate transmission was a
key element of the PG&E Gas Accord, and should be a foundation of the furth=
er=20
restructuring of
the SoCalGas system, as well.

     B.   SoCalGas' Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PG&E's, and=
=20
Can
          Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PG&E Gas Accord.

     Mr. Florio claims that the "network" nature of the SoCalGas system=20
argues against
following the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service=
=20
for SoCalGas.
Yet Mr. Florio concedes that SoCalGas' mainline facilities that extend from=
=20
the Los Angeles basin
to the interstate pipelines on the California / Arizona border do resemble=
=20
interstate pipelines.
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.1.1.3. SoCalGas' lines running north from the L.A=
.=20
Basin to the
Wheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to=
=20
PG&E's.  With respect
to local transmission, SoCalGas' network of local transmission lines inside=
=20
the L.A. Basin is
similar to PG&E's network of local transmission lines in its load centers i=
n=20
the Bay Area and
Central Valley.  Indeed, both the PG&E and SoCalGas systems can be consider=
ed=20
to be "spokes"
of backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt=20
points to "hubs" of
networked local transmission facilities.  The two systems differ in the=20
length and number of the
"spokes" (SoCalGas' are shorter and more numerous), but operationally these=
=20
components serve
the same function.  In my view, there is just as strong an operational basi=
s=20
for unbundling
SoCalGas' backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there=
=20
was for unbundling
PG&E's.

     C.   The Benefits of the Gas Accord's City-Gate Market Have Been=20
Substantial
          for Electric Generators.

     Mr. Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu=
gh=20
competition
among suppliers in the PG&E city-gate market that the Gas Accord created. =
=20
First, he appears to
cite the existing data as showing "average benefits of around 2 cents or mo=
re=20
per MMcf/d."
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.2. As cited in my direct testimony, the actual=
=20
benefits have been
more than 2 cents per mmcf/d   $0.03 to $0.08 per Dth.  Mr. Weil opines tha=
t=20
such savings are
not significant for core customers.  Ibid., at Section 2.2.2. Regardless of=
=20
whether one agrees with
him, such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important=
=20
for electric
generators, whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly $0.35 p=
er=20
Dth, and who, as Ms.
Yap states, "sell into a highly competitive PX market."  SCGC / TURN, at=20
Section 2.4.1. For an
electric generator, a 10 to 20% reduction in gas transportation charges is=
=20
well worth pursuing, as
shown by SCGC's active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low=
er=20
SoCalGas'
EG rates by far smaller amounts.

     D.   Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to
          Realize These Benefits.

     Mr. Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use=20
customers hold backbone
transmission capacity on the PG&E system shows that unbundling under the Ga=
s=20
Accord has not
benefitted customers.  He opines that this is due to the high transaction=
=20
costs associated with
holding capacity.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.3. Ms. Yap also describes at=
=20
length how the
transaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to=
=20
force end users to buy
from marketers.  Ibid., Section 2.3.1. She concludes that unbundling has be=
en=20
"great for
marketers" but "not good for customers."  Ibid., at Section 2.3.1.

     This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen=
t=20
of their customers.
If a marketer's services do not add value for the customer, then that=20
marketer will not remain in
business for long. Under the Gas Accord, most noncore end users in northern=
=20
California have
been buying gas from marketers in the PG&E city-gate market.  However, the=
=20
available data on
PG&E city-gate gas prices   discussed above   show that end users have=20
realized significant
savings from these purchases, compared to the option of buying gas at the=
=20
California border and
managing their own transportation to the city-gate.  These city-gate=20
purchases have not involved
paying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi=
ng=20
capacity.
Competition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from=20
marketers' efficiencies in
managing transportation costs.



III. SCGC'S AND TURN'S COST / BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION
     UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS.

     SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost / benefit analysis of=20
transmission unbundling,
largely through the testimony of Ms. Yap, in an effort to show that the cos=
ts=20
outweigh the
benefits.  Ms. Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling,=20
greatly exaggerates the
possible costs, and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o=
f=20
unbundling on
generators in the Los Angeles basin.

     A.   SCGC / TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission=20
Unbundling.

          1.   Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the city-gat=
e=20
market.

     The experience with transmission unbundling under the PG&E Gas Accord =
has
demonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the=
=20
creation of a city-gate
market.  The city-gate market moves gas-to-gas competition between supplier=
s=20
closer to the
customer, and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying=20
demand charges or
managing backbone transportation. Those customers who believe they can=20
achieve greater profits
by managing their own transportation have that option, and since not all=20
transportation rights on
the PG&E system are held by marketers, it is obvious that such customers do=
=20
exist.

     Mr. Weil doubts that the city-gate benefits seen on the PG&E system wi=
ll=20
materialize, due
to "Southwest supply dominance" at SoCalGas receipt points.  SCGC / TURN, a=
t=20
Section 2.2.2. Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to=
=20
trade within a narrow range of a few
cents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system.  Ibid.=
,=20
at Section 2.3.1. The
price differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the=
=20
significant price
differentials that have existed between Topock, Arizona, and Malin, Oregon,=
=20
the two major
receipt points into the PG&E system.  However, recently the Malin / Topock=
=20
price difference has
been due almost entirely to the $0.10 to $0.12 per Dth transportation rate=
=20
differential between
PG&E's Redwood and Baja paths.  Over the most recent year for which data is=
=20
available, Malin
prices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices, when adjusted for=
=20
the downstream
transportation rate differences.  This integration of the Malin and Topock=
=20
markets has been the
result of rising Canadian prices relative to U.S. markets, which has produc=
ed=20
a competitive
equilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern=20
California.  Yet over this
year the benefits of PG&E city-gate purchases has actually increased, even=
=20
though there was very
little difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user=
. =20
From May 1999
through April 2000, PG&E city-gate prices have been $0.05 per Dth to $0.11=
=20
per Dth lower than
the comparable cost of border purchases plus PG&E's full backbone=20
transportation rates.  This
data is summarized in my Table 1.  Contrary to the SCGC / TURN testimony,=
=20
this recent
experience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new=20
SoCalGas city-gate may be
just as large as those actually observed on the PG&E system.

              2.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG=20
customers.

          Transmission unbundling, as proposed in the Comprehensive=20
Settlement, will result in a
modest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators.  My direc=
t=20
testimony discussed
how transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce =
EG=20
rates by $3
million per year in 2002, or about $0.01 per Dth, compared to the SoCalGas=
=20
rates adopted in the
recent BCAP decision, D. 00-04-060.  In addition, the Comprehensive=20
Settlement unbundles
transmission rates on an embedded cost basis, removing roughly half of the =
EG=20
rate from
SoCalGas' complex, contentious long-run marginal cost rate design.  This wi=
ll=20
enhance the
certainty and stability of SoCalGas' EG rate   a particularly important=20
factor to EG customers
that may seek to build new gas-fired capacity on the SoCalGas system.

              3.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG=20
customers.

          Ms. Yap comments at length on how "if a generator's fundamental=
=20
risk increases, investors
demand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that=20
increased level of risk."
SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.3.  In my view, the Comprehensive Settlement=20
reduces a number
of important risks for electric generators, compared to the SCGC / TURN PIS=
A,=20
as follows:

=0F0         SoCalGas shareholders will assume 100% risk for the recovery o=
f=20
unbundled backbone
          transmission costs.  This protects electric generation customers=
=20
from bearing higher
          backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates =
or=20
if declining
          throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a=
n=20
embedded cost basis
          through August, 2006.  This removes the calculation and allocatio=
n=20
of marginal transmission
          costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined 79% load factor to=
=20
price backbone
          transmission service through the term of the settlement.  This=20
removes the risk that declining
          throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi=
on=20
rates in the next
          SoCalGas BCAP case.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers' risk for reven=
ues=20
from unbundled
          storage services to 25% in the second year (beginning in April,=
=20
2002), while the SCGC /
          TURN PISA maintains the 50% risk adopted in D. 00-04-060 through=
=20
2002.

=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas' transmission,=
=20
storage, and balancing
          services.  This will offer electric generators a number of new=20
opportunities to reduce their
          costs, including (1) city-gate gas purchases, (2) self-balancing =
or=20
competitive balancing
          services, and (3) new, competitive storage services.  In my=20
opinion, these opportunities
          reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be=
=20
caught in a "price squeeze"
          between their gas costs and their electric revenues, because they=
=20
will have more ways in
          which to reduce their gas costs.

          B.  SCGC / TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges.

          The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea=
rs=20
to be the focal point
of SCGC / TURN's opposition to transmission unbundling.  Throughout their=
=20
testimony, SCGC /
TURN overstate the impact of demand charges:

=0F0         Ms. Yap's Figure 1, showing the impact of a customer's load fa=
ctor=20
on its average
          transportation rate, assumes that the customer's entire rate is=
=20
collected in a demand charge.
          SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.1. She fails to note that the demand=
=20
charge for firm backbone
          transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou=
t=20
22% of the total EG
          rate under the SFV rate option, and just 12% of the rate under th=
e=20
alternative backbone rate
          with a 50% demand component.

=0F0         Ms. Yap presents the results of "a study of more than half of =
the=20
generators in the Los
          Angeles basin" that purports to show that "SFV-style" demand=20
charges could increase
          annual fixed costs by "as much as 20 percent."  SCGC / TURN, at=
=20
Section 2.4.2. I have
          examined the workpapers for this study, obtained in by Southern=
=20
California Edison in
          discovery, and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for=
=20
how generators will buy gas
          under the Comprehensive Settlement.  First, the study assumes tha=
t=20
each generator will
          contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement=
=20
for a quantity of firm
          backbone capacity based on the generator's theoretical maximum ga=
s=20
use in a day (that
          is, its generating capacity in MW, times its average heat rate,=
=20
times 24 hours).  Apparently,
          this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has=20
actually ever used that much gas
          in a single day.  The plants studied are mostly intermediate-load=
=20
or peaking units, and almost
          certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for=
=20
all 24 hours of a day.  As a
          result of this assumption, the plants studied are assumed to=20
contract for 1,426 MDth per day
          of backbone capacity.  According to the study, these units=20
represent 43% (i.e. less than one-
          half) of the gas-fired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin.  If all=
=20
generators in the basin
          contracted for capacity in this way, electric generators alone=20
would demand 3,316 MDth per
          day of capacity, or 93% of SoCalGas' total receipt point capacity=
! =20
There is obviously no
          such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the=
=20
SoCalGas system.  Second,
          the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to=20
broker, release, or sell the
          massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will=
=20
derive no revenues from
          such off-peak capacity sales.

          Thus, the study's dire picture of the impact of demand charges on=
=20
low-load factor
     generators assumes that such generators massively over-contract for=20
capacity, and fail to
     take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive=
=20
Settlement to
     reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks:

          The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit=
h=20
a 50% demand
          charge that almost halves the demand charge risk, but offers the=
=20
same firm priority as the
          SFV demand charge.

          Under the comprehensive settlement, interruptible service at=20
volumetric rates is always
          available at no more than a 20% premium over firm backbone rates,=
=20
and may even be
          available at less than the firm backbone rates, particularly duri=
ng=20
low-demand periods.
          With a backbone rate of $0.0719 per Dth, this premium is no more=
=20
than $0.0144 per Dth.
          Ms. Yap observes (in Section 2.3.1) that the interstate pipelines=
=20
supplying SoCalGas have
          at least 1,000 MMcf/d (or 30%) more capacity than SoCalGas'=20
intrastate system.  She
          does not recognize that SoCalGas' backbone system also has more=
=20
than 900 MMcf/d of
          excess capacity, plus substantial excess storage capacity.  Due t=
o=20
this excess intrastate
          capacity, it is difficult to imagine a scenario, for the=20
foreseeable future, in which a low-
          load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu=
m=20
interruptible rate
          for "virtually firm" backbone service.

          I have re-calculated the results of the SCGC / TURN study, under=
=20
the assumption that
          generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service, i=
n=20
order to avoid demand
          charges, at the full $0.0144 per Dth premium for interruptible=20
service.  In this case, the
          generators' annual fixed costs increase by just six-tenths of one=
=20
percent (0.6%).  In
          reality, I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil=
l=20
be available for much of the
          year at all-volumetric rates that are much less than the maximum=
=20
interruptible rate.

          The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for=
=20
the trading of
          backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system.  This will provide a=20
means for electric
          generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity,=
=20
and may be a source of firm
          capacity at volumetric rates.  Again, the SCGC / TURN study of th=
e=20
impact of demand
          charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market.

          Ms. Yap fails to recognize that low-load factor generators will b=
e=20
able to avoid paying
          demand charges (and save money on intrastate transportation, as=
=20
well) by buying gas in
          the city-gate market.  Ms. Yap's primary concern with the city-ga=
te=20
market appears to
          be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant=
=20
premium for city-gate sales
          during periods of capacity constraints.  SCGC / TURN, at Section=
=20
2.3.1. Ms. Yap's
          testimony fails to explain her assertion that the city-gate marke=
t=20
could become a
          "bottleneck" on the SoCalGas system.  Upstream of the city-gate=
=20
market, SoCalGas will
          have over 900 MMcf/d of excess backbone capacity, plus significan=
t=20
amounts of unused
          storage capacity.

          Ms. Yap's "bottlenecks" and marketer-manipulated high prices have=
=20
not materialized in
          two years' of experience with the PG&E city-gate market, even=20
though PG&E has less
          excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than=
=20
SoCalGas.   PG&E city-
          gate prices did experience one brief spike, due to very high dema=
nd=20
during the cold snap
          just prior to Christmas in 1998, but on average PG&E city-gate=20
prices have provided
          significant benefits to end users, compared to purchases at the=
=20
California border.  In
          addition, the data that Mr. Weil cites on the parties holding=20
capacity on the PG&E system
          shows that 75 parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone, an=
d=20
does not suggest any
          undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PG&E backbone=20
system.  Ibid., Table 1,
          Section 2.2.3.

          Furthermore, the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions=
=20
to ensure that any
          one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of=
=20
capacity to the SoCalGas
          city-gate market.  First, noncore end use customers will have the=
=20
initial two open seasons
          in which to subscribe to up to 50% of the available backbone=20
capacity, without
          competition from marketers.  This should ensure that end users th=
at=20
are interested in
          holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they=
=20
desire, and is likely to lead
          to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr=
om=20
the Gas Accord open
          season, in which end users and marketers competed together. =20
Second, the Comprehensive
          Settlement limits any one party from holding, at the end of the=
=20
open season process, more
          than 40% of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas=
=20
receipt point.  Third, if
          any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity, in an=20
effort to drive up prices, that
          capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible=
=20
service, and SoCalGas will
          have a strong incentive to market such capacity, because it is 10=
0%=20
at risk for the
          recovery of backbone transmission costs.

     The SCGC / TURN testimony tries to portray low-load factor generators =
as=20
caught in a
"price squeeze" between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost=
s=20
due to the
imposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission.  SCGC / TURN,=20
Section 2.4.3.  The
testimony paints a grim picture of plants closing, and jobs lost, in the Lo=
s=20
Angeles Basin.
However, there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not=
=20
add up:

=0F0    The testimony appears to assume that low-load factor generators pay=
 the=20
SFV demand
     charges, and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or=20
eliminate the impact of
     demand charges.

=0F0    The testimony does not recognize that there will be a $3 million do=
llar=20
reduction in rates to
     the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement.

=0F0    The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re=
sult=20
of demand charges will
     be serious enough to force plants to close.  Even accepting SCGC /=20
TURN's inflated figure
     of a 20% increase in fixed costs, SCGC / TURN provide no financial dat=
a=20
that substantiates
     their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force =
a=20
significant number of
     plants to close.

=0F0    SCGC / TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the "price=
=20
squeeze" that they so
     fear: buy gas in the SoCalGas city-gate market.  City-gate buyers will=
=20
avoid paying demand
     charges, so their fixed operating costs will not increase.  In additio=
n,=20
the SoCalGas city-gate
     market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to=
=20
electric prices in southern
     California, because it will be the closest market to the generators'=
=20
point of consumption and
     because almost 60% of noncore loads on the SoCalGas / SDG&E system are=
=20
electric
     generators.  As a result, generators buying gas in the SoCalGas=20
city-gate market will have
     the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte=
d=20
in changes in electric
     prices, thus reducing the risk of a "price squeeze between gas and=20
electric prices.  This has
     certainly been the case in northern California.  Straightforward=20
statistical analyses that I have
     performed show that the PG&E city-gate gas price is more highly=20
correlated to PX electric
     prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state, presumabl=
y=20
because electric
     generators in northern California use that market and because it is th=
e=20
closest market to the
     generators' burner tips.

=0F0    SCGC / TURN attempt to argue that the closure of low-load factor pl=
ants=20
in the Los
     Angeles Basin, due to the imposition of demand charges, will have=20
serious implications for
     electric reliability.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.5. At the same time=
,=20
SCGC / TURN argue
     that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les=
s=20
than 20% of the
     capacity in the basin is under Reliability Must-Run (RMR) contracts an=
d=20
that there is
     "intense competition" for available RMR contracts.  Yet the lack of RM=
R=20
contracts in the
     basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to=
=20
provide more-than-
     adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise=20
local market power.  If
     some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to=20
demand charges, a more
     likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern=
=20
California, the ISO will
     make available more RMR contracts in the basin, and those contracts wi=
ll=20
provide a higher
     level of cost recovery, thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg=
es.

     This completes my rebuttal testimony.
