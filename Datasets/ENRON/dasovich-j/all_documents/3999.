Dear Jeff:

I am writing to ask Enron to become a sponsor of the annual POWER research
conference on electricity restructuring, which will take place this year
on March 16, 2001 in Berkeley.  This will be POWER's sixth annual
electricity research conference.  Last year's conference was quite
successful, with attendance of nearly 150 and a number of papers that were
discussed widely and were influential in electricity policy. Information
on past programs and the plans for this year at our website:
http://www.ucei.org/power_conf.html . We already have received submissions
from top researchers for this year's conference.  We anticipate another
very strong program of active electricity restructuring researchers and
practitioners.

As in the past, we plan to include about 8 papers on the program.  The
presentations will be organized by topic and the papers will be discussed
by both researchers and practitioner.  Past programs have been very
successful in stimulating discussion that included both researchers and
practitioners.

The cost to Enron to become a sponsor would be $10,000. As a sponsor,
Enron would be listed on the front of the conference program and in the
pre-conference mailing.  In addition, Enron could send up to 5 people to
the conference at no additional cost.

The annual POWER conferences on electricity restructuring have been very
well received by industry, policy, and academic participants.  With the
broad and growing interest in deregulation of electricity markets, we have
every reason to anticipate that this year's conference will be just as
successful. We hope that Enron will decide to become a sponsor of the
conference.

I can be contacted by phone at 510-642-5145, by fax at 510-643-5180, or by
e-mail at borenste@haas.berkeley.edu.  I look forward to talking with you
soon about this.

Sincerely,

Severin
