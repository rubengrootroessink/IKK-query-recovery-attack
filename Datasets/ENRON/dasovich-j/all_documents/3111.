Sorry for the spam.

If you are interested in taking a student-organized  speaker-series class, 
"Doing Business in Asia", please hit reply.
?
I would like to see if there is sufficient demand -  this class will most 
likely be held on Tuesday nights, 6-8, all speakers on  topics related to 
doing business in China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, etc. and will  not conflict 
with the Asia IT class.? 
?
Will be a 1unit, minimum requirement, fun  class.? If there is enough demand, 
we will announce officially very soon  and you can still enroll when you get 
back from your winter break  destinations!
?
Thanks,
?
Tomoko
?
P.S.
If you are interested in helping organize the  class, please let me know as 
well.
