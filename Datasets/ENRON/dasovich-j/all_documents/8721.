As you might know, EES is preparing to send a letter to the C&I customers in 
PG&E's territory that they are sending back to the utility for physical 
delivery.  The letter, per the disclosure rules, will inform the customers 
that EES will no longer be providing them with the Bizmix (first 5,000 KWhs 
per month of renewable energy) product.  Two customers, Patagonia and Fetzer 
wine, are on premium renewable products (100% renewable energy) and I'm 
working w/ the EES desk to come up with a potential solution (green tag only 
product).  I wanted to give you a heads up because the letters should go out 
in the next couple of days.   EES will be circulating a draft before 
sending.
