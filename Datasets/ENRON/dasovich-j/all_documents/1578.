What do I do if eHRonline has incorrect information that I don't have access 
to correct?
 Please send an e-mail to the Lead Generalist or the generalist admin. 
support for your group describing all of the information that is incorrect 
and what the  correct information should be.  The generalist will then be the

understanding your needs and getting a feel for the type of person who will 
be  perfect for your position.  Then he will go out and get you the person

the  position on the data system ....  so please have a description of what

What should I do if one of my employee's resigns?
 Please contact your lead generalist or the generalist admin. support for 
your group.  The generalist will need a copy of the resignation letter from 
the  employee.  We will then schedule an exit interview for about 20 minutes 
on the employee's last day so that we can explain the benefits, stock option 
and  final payment situations to the employee.  Also, we'll collect the badge 
and amex cards that belong to corporate.  You will need to collect up any 
company  equipment that you have purchased for that employee.

new cost center and supervisor if you know it.  If not, then just tell us as 
much as  you know.  Thanks!

partner with you to find a solution that fits your group and makes your   
organization work for you!

What do I do if my mailstop is wrong?

specifying the new, correct mailstop.  They will submit an e-mail form to 
Sunny  Rodgers who will correct it.  They will copy you so that you're in on 
the loop.

listed vacation balance and then the vacation balance you feel is correct.

payroll helpline at x55555 and they can research it and assist you in 
resolving the  variance.

waters to a SOLUTION!
