Jeff,

By the time you return from vacation, I will be on vacation and only 
returning on Sept. 5th.  As a result, I thought it would be best to e-mail 
this request to you.  

Rick will be moderating a panel as part of an electricity roundtable 
sponsored by the American Antitrust Institute on Sept. 7th in DC.  His panel 
concerns vertical market power issues related to wholesale and retail 
electric markets; his panel consists of Nora Brownell, John Hangar and Bob 
Fleishman.  I would appreciate it if you would please suggest a few issues 
and/or thought-provoking questions for Rick to consider when addressing his 
panel.  The following paragraph is a description of Rick's panel that 
invitees to the roundtable received:

VERTICAL MARKET POWER ISSUES: Wholesaling and Retailing
This segment will examine possible abuses in and between wholesale and retail
markets; preferences afforded to investor-owned utilities and how those
preferences manifest themselves; regulatory, legislative and judicially
driven solutions; and the role of antitrust and regulators to remedy
discrimination in these markets.


Thank you in advance for your assistance.  I hope you had a wonderful 
vacation.

Regards,

Lara
