=09=09 Subject: Briefing on FERC CA Natural Gas Infrastructure conference

This memo by Nancy Bagot, ETS, and Donna Fulton, Enron Corp, summarizes wha=
t=20
we heard at yesterday's FERC conference and gets to the heart of the issue =
in=20
California on the gas side.

The FERC Technical Conference yesterday was held by FERC staff and was kept=
=20
to very technical, facility and service issues.  Staff did not allow any=20
discussion of pricing, because that would be handled in other forums.=20
Commissioners did not make an appearance at the conference, though some of=
=20
their staffers were in attendance.

Like many FERC Technical Conferences, the May 24th conference on California=
=20
Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure boiled down to parties blaming=20
other parties for the situation in the California market.  Generally, (1)=
=20
interstate pipelines and others believe more infrastructure is needed, both=
=20
to California and within California   (and some blame SoCalGas=01, lack of=
=20
adequate take-away capacity, failure to provide open access transmission, a=
nd=20
allocation procedures), (2) SoCalGas blames the CPUC and believes that,=20
although this is a tight year, service commitments will be met and things a=
re=20
fine, and (3) the CPUC and CEC believe things are not out of control going=
=20
forward, that their own open proceedings are adequate to handle any gas=20
issues in California, and  that CPUC =01&decisions are coming.=018 =20

For FERC Staff, there are two issues at hand: is the problem the mismatch=
=20
between interstate and intrastate capacity (and what amount of infrastructu=
re=20
should be added into and within California), and/or is it the allocation=20
methodology at a few highly-constrained delivery points into the state. =20
Overall, there is basic agreement that there are problems with both.

The State

Both the CPUC and the CEC described the intrastate pipeline system as=20
adequate with just minor changes and enhancements, certainly to serve core=
=20
customers and likely to serve non-core customers.  Like the LDCs, the state=
=20
representatives are concerned that building to develop a cushion in a=20
difficult year may not bode well for facilities in =01&normal=018 years in =
the=20
future, leaving intrastate capacity stranded.  Also, both agencies ticked o=
ff=20
a laundry list of proposed LDC enhancement projects and regulatory changes=
=20
that are designed to improve the delivery system.  According to the CPUC an=
d=20
CEC, demand in the state is not going to explode =01) getting LDC storage b=
ack=20
up to normal levels should make the difference.

FERC Staff questioned  the CPUC and CEC speakers at length on the operation=
s=20
of the state LDC systems, allocation methods, and the availability of firm=
=20
capacity on SoCalGas in particular.  There was great concern among Staff=20
about the inability for a non-core customer to contract for specific capaci=
ty=20
for primary firm service on SoCal.  The CPUC noted that there is a=20
comprehensive settlement before the Commission to unbundle SoCal capacity a=
nd=20
allow for tradable primary capacity on an open access system, but the=20
Commission has not yet acted on that settlement.  When asked why the CPUC h=
as=20
not acted on the settlement that has been pending for a year, the witness=
=20
said that there were not three votes.

The LDCs

Only PG&E and SoCalGas appeared before FERC.  Both were adamant that there=
=20
was adequate capacity for current demand, as proven by the lack of =20
curtailments over the past year.  They also agree that a primary question i=
s=20
how to agree on the adequate amount of capacity =01) though it=01,s general=
ly held=20
there should be a 15-20% excess, is that for a normal weather year or a dry=
=20
hydro year? =20

For SoCal in particular, Lad Lorenz claimed that demand would drop in the=
=20
next five years, with normal weather and a reduction of EG load which would=
=20
bypass their system (being built directly along interstates pipelines).  If=
=20
capacity were built to match an excess reserve margin, he wanted to know wh=
o=20
would pay for the capacity.  The central policy question for SoCal comes do=
wn=20
to defining excess capacity and modeling for excess based either on matchin=
g=20
interstate capacity or customer demand (based on contracts).  SoCal believe=
s=20
it should respond to the latter.  However, the LDC cites the CPUC as an=20
obstacle for responding to customers, and is looking to the CPUC to accept=
=20
its comprehensive settlement which will unbundle its capacity and allow for=
=20
tradable primary capacity rights.

For PG&E, the situation is different because it functions very much like an=
=20
open access interstate pipeline. It does not have the allocation and=20
scheduling issues that are on the SoCal system; however, there is still a=
=20
mismatch between interstate and intrastate capacity.  PG&E, like SoCal,=20
claims that its system is adequate to meet current demand, though they are=
=20
planning some enhancements. They do agree with SoCal on the difficulty in=
=20
planning for uncertainty, but in general the northern California LDC is not=
=20
facing the difficulties of its southern counterpart.

Staff questions underscore the more difficult situation on the SoCal system=
,=20
as nearly all questions focused on SoCal=01,s allocation method, firm capac=
ity=20
availability for non-core customers (which include industrials and electric=
=20
generation) and possible disconnects between its local and backbone systems=
. =20
FERC also queried about interstate and intrastate mismatches at Topock and=
=20
Wheeler Ridge, and whether these would be worsened with the addition of mor=
e=20
interstate capacity.  SoCal consistently answered that its proposed=20
comprehensive settlement on unbundling would resolve most issues, but the=
=20
CPUC will not act on it.

Interstate Pipelines

With every interstate pipeline serving California planning expansions and=
=20
four entirely new pipelines on the drafting table, the pipelines call to ar=
ms=20
was for more capacity into the state.  Demand projections by the pipeline=
=20
representatives were vast and optimistic, an example being the Sonoran=20
Pipeline prediction of a 3 =01) 4 Bcf shortfall.  And each pipe can point t=
o=20
booming open season results as proof of the need for more infrastructure. =
=20
Posing an obstacle to this infrastructure development is SoCalGas=01, lack =
of=20
capacity and the major problem of allocation =01) SoCal currently can only =
offer=20
secondary capacity to any new interstate capacity. =20

FERC Staff agreed that the SoCal allocation is a problem and further proof=
=20
that there is a mismatch between intra and interstate capacity.  SoCal=20
responded that any new interstate capacity at certain desirable points will=
=20
only degrade existing service and again blamed the CPUC and the pipes=01,=
=20
allocations.  The other concern expressed by Staff is the divergent demand=
=20
forecasts of the LDCs, CPUC & CEC, and the pipelines.

Others

The financial community (Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch) pointed to a=20
dysfunctional market in California and told FERC that pipelines must be giv=
en=20
certainty on returns and the regulatory structure.  The message was for FER=
C=20
to stay the course, without price caps or changes to the marketing affiliat=
e=20
rules, and for California to fix itself, especially the CPUC (the weakest=
=20
link).

Producers and End Users are concerned that existing shippers=01, rights are=
=20
protected and rates remain unaffected by expansions that may later be=20
stranded.  There is concern over additional capacity into constrained=20
delivery points that are already pro rationed, especially in light of the=
=20
recent nomination gaming debacle at Wheeler Ridge. =20

The California Generators claimed that they were not convinced that SoCal=
=20
will be unloaded by bypassing EG.  They claimed that there are disincentive=
s=20
in California regulation to SoCal's building capacity - specifically the=20
Performance-based Rate mechanism and the Gas Cost Incentive mechanism.  Und=
er=20
these programs, SoCal gets to keep 50% of peaking service revenues, thus=20
giving SoCal incentive to advantage their own storage services.  SoCal gets=
=20
to keep tens of millions annually under these mechanisms.=20

Closing Staff Concerns

To wrap up, FERC Staff asked why it is Topock in particular that is always=
=20
discussed, and it was explained that access to multiple pipelines at Topock=
=20
has set it up as the preferred delivery point into California.  However, wi=
th=20
allocation changes at Topock kicking in, the problems are moving to Wheeler=
=20
Ridge.

There was also a debate over which is the real problem =01) intrastate capa=
city=20
or intrastate scheduling.  SoCal again emphasized that it is not a capacity=
=20
issue but the mechanism (blame the CPUC for not approving the unbundling=20
settlement), California Generators believe it=01,s all about capacity (blam=
e=20
SoCalGas).

Future Comments

Comments can be filed in this proceeding by June 25.  Since the SoCal=20
settlement received so much attention and continues to await action by the=
=20
CPUC, should we get supporters of that settlment to file with the FERC=20
stating that this was a fix to some of the problems on SoCal's  system and=
=20
the CPUC has sat on it? =20

We should find out who is planning to file comments.  Though much was said =
at=20
the technical conference, many speakers brought slides, and there was a Cou=
rt=20
Reporter, Commissioners and their staffers will not likely read the whole=
=20
transcript.  We could file to emphasize the points that are made in=20
Jennifer's gas talking points. =20
