Dear Haas Students,

We still have many unclaimed tickets left for the Secretary Summers
Research Dialogue Program "Keeping the Economy Growing" at 1:45 on Tuesday,
December 6 in the Andersen Auditorium.

The deadline for Haas students to pick up tickets for this event is this
Friday, December 1 at 2pm.

After the Friday deadline, we will offer all of the unclaimed tickets to
other Cal students who have been clamoring for these tickets.

The Dean's Office is open from 9am to 5pm daily and Evening MBA students
can pick up their tickets at the EMBA Office after 5pm.

Thanks for your cooperation!

The Dean's Staff
