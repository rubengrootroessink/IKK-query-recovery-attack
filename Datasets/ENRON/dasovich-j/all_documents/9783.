Wine and Cheese: A Match Made in Biochemistry

While it's a rule of civilized and culinary thumb that wine and 
cheese go together, there are more reasons for it than meet the eye. 
Both, for example, are products of fermentation -- wine is fermented 
grape juice and cheese is made from fermented milk. Both can express 
terroir, or the taste of the place from which they come -- wine 
through the roots of grapevines, cheese through the milk of animals 
(cows, goats, sheep, water buffalo, even horses and camels) that feed 
on local plants. Add their shared ease of preparation, and wine and 
cheese indeed go hand in hand -- glass in the right, cheese in the 
left, grateful mouth in the middle. 

That said, every wine doesn't go with every cheese. No matter how you 
slice it, each artisan cheese is unique, and aged Vermont cheddar is 
as different from fresh French chevre as Zinfandel is from Champagne. 
Exploring this range of sensations and combinations is more than an 
excuse to drink wine; it's a veritable (read: delightful) education 
for the palate. 

Some oenophiles consider Sauvignon Blanc the cheese-friendliest wine 
of all. Among reds, the easiest wines to pair with cheese are those 
that are light and fruity. Beyond that, terroir-inspired combinations 
of wine and cheese from the same region or village are almost 
always winners. 

When matching wine and cheese, keep a few general rules in mind: 

-The whiter and fresher the cheese, the crisper and fruitier 
the wine. 
-A smooth, fatty cheese can take on a rich wine, but may also provide 
a nice backdrop for one that's light and zesty. 
-Sweet wine offers a satisfying counterpoint to tart or salty cheese. 
(Port and Stilton is a classic). Salty cheeses also sing when 
partnered with high-acid wines. 
-Fruity red wines suit soft cheeses. Try a Beaujolais with 
your chevre. 
-Dry sparkling wine is brilliant with a bloomy white rind. Champagne 
and brie, anyone?

hosting a wine-and-cheese party.

Wine Team Picks: Maire Murphy on Wines to Broaden Your Merlot-Loving 
Friends' Horizons

Okay, I understand that, for people new to red wine (and, all right, 
even some people who aren't), Merlot can taste darn yummy -- soft, 
caressing, sensuous, even sweet. Still, I get a kick out of 
introducing certain friends, for whom Merlot is the only reliable 
red, to the exotic world of Spain and Italy and obscure grapes they 
never would have thought to try. As these people slowly wean 
themselves from their habitual red to exciting new wines that deliver 
many of the same rewards as Merlot (but often at much less expense), 
my experience mimics that of subversive instigators throughout 
history: initially considered a nuisance, suddenly I find myself 
a hero. 

1998 Friggiali Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy, $17.99
1997 Icardi Barbera d'Alba Suri di Mu, Piedmont, Italy, $15.99
1998 Domaine de la Noblaie Chinon, Loire Valley, France, $9.99
1999 Altos de las Hormigas Malbec, Mendoza, Argentina, $8.49
1995 Bodegas Primicia Rioja Reserva Vina Diezmo, Spain, $19.95
