Gentlemen--thought you guys might be interested in this exchange on Gray 
Davis's visit to Mayor Daley.  EES has been trying to do a deal with the City 
of Chicago for quite a while now, and they are getting down to the wire in 
deciding whether to go ahead as the deal is going to have to go before the 
City Council next month for approval.

Roy and Ed,
Actually, this is a non-event for us.  Davis was in town to review the City's 
emergency action plan in the event of massive or rolling blackouts.  Steve 
Walter met with him to brief him of the City's extremely thorough emergency 
plan which was a result of the power outages a few summers ago.  The City is 
looked to across the country as having a state-of-the-art plan that 
encompasses over 1,600 critical facilities classified with an A-C rating.  
Each of these City, County or State facitlities had a "hook-up" plate 
installed on the outside of the building so a portable generator could be 
moved into place in an emergency.  The plan also covers procedures, planning, 
operations support center set up, etc.  Very comprehensive.  I suppose Mr. 
Davis may just be thinking ahead....
Mike

PS.  If the conversation actually did extend into what else the City is doing 
about electricity and Enron's name also came up, I doubt that we would be 
viewed negatively at all, in fact, the exact opposite.  We are part of 
Daley's plan to lessen his reliance on the terrible utility.  We are the 
hammer and our long-term contract reinforces our relationship.  You can rest 
assured, if California could do it all over again, long-term contracts would 
be a key component of a successful move to deregulation...not spot market 
purchases through a PX!  Ah yes, Chicago, the apple of Gov. Davis' eye...

Ed -- I don't think that this would change what we are trying to do nor the 
way we're doing it.  Daley is not afraid to take non-liberal positions when 
it best fits his ends ( e.g., he has made statements supporting the 
President's energy policy because he has more faith in increasing supply 
rather than in demand reductions) but since this is politics one can never be 
entirely sure.  I'm sure that Daley knows Enron very well and especially 
where Mr. Lay placed his support during the last election.  My read on this 
algnment is that Daley will do what it takes to keep the energy issue from 
becoming a "snow storm" type of issue -- for non-Chicagoans that refers to 
the ability for administrations to change over how well the City clears 
neighborhood streets during the previous winter's snow days.

The bold highlight appears in Sunday gossip column of the Chicago Suntimes - 
does this meeting change the political 
dynamics of the deal - Davis adversial relationship with Enron - is this 
something we should be worried about

               Scoopsville . . .

               Watch for California Gov. Gray Davis, who has been hit by his 
state's energy
               crisis, to visit Mayor Daley this week and ask for pointers. 
Daley is the fella who
               successfully hammered ComEd into submission.

               A blues whisper . . .

               Pssst! Mayor Daley has been asking questions about the status 
of Gerri's Palm
               Tavern, a legendary blues tavern at 446 E. 47th, whose future 
is the center of an
               ongoing South Side neighborhood debate.

               Ol' Man River . . .

               There wasn't a dry eye in the house.

               Actor/singer/professor William Warfield, 82, who was presented 
with the Chicago
               Historical Society's Making History Award Thursday night, 
stunned the audience
               when he repeated history.

               * To wit: Warfield, a Grammy winner, opera singer and 
professor of music at the
               University of Illinois and Northwestern University, sang . . . 
the song he made
               famous in the 1951 hit movie "Show Boat," starring Ava 
Gardner, Kathryn
               Grayson and Howard Keel: "Ol' Man River."

               Tips & twaddle . . .

               * Wonder when Tom Cruise, who is divorcing Nicole Kidman, is 
going to rename
               his plane? It's called: "Sweet Nic."

               * Presidential daughter Jenna Bush, who just pleaded no 
contest to a charge of
               underage drinking, reportedly wears a toe ring.

               * Former Veep Al Gore may have gained 30 pounds, but the 
Washington Post is
               reporting former President Bill Clinton has dropped almost 20 
pounds.

               * Attorney General John Ashcroft reportedly holds daily prayer 
sessions with
               Justice Department employees.

               * Harvey Mayor Nickolas Graves tells Sneed that World 
Changers, a Southern
               Baptist volunteer organization, hits Harvey next month--at his 
invitation--to restore
               and rehabilitate homes, including two historical homes on 
154th Street.

               Celluloid chat . . .

               The chapel at McInerney Funeral Home will be filled today, but 
not with people
               attending a funeral.

               * Translation: The 128-year-old Canaryville funeral home is 
the site of filming for
               "Stolen Summer," the Miramax film written by Chicago native 
Pete Jones, who
               won the Project Greenlight contest organized by Matt Damon and 
Ben Affleck.
               The film stars actors Aidan Quinn, Kevin Pollak and Brian 
Dennehy. According
               to Celine McInerney, this is the first time the funeral home 
has been used for
               anything but . . . funerals.
