Dear Evening MBA Students,

I will present an overview of a couple of primary business databases that
are available to you at Long Business Library on the following evenings in
Room S300T  - that's the teaching classroom in the Haas computer center:

Monday, October 30:  7:40 to 8:10pm
Tuesday, October 31: 7:40 to 8:10pm

This is an opportunity for you to learn focused search techniques and
explore the strengths and weaknesses of Dow Jones Interactive, Nexis/Lexis,
Business & Industry, and Statistical Universe.

Please email me if you would like to attend one of these sessions.
