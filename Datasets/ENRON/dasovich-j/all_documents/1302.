Hello fellow E220 mates,

Attached are my attempts at Q1 and Q3.  I will not be in class Mon or Tues.

Jeff, can you hand the case in?

I am happy to take a crack at the other questions, let me know if you would
like me to help out there.

The xcel file is a little messy, it was really just a work sheet to play
around with the numbers, but you are welcome to it.  In terms of format,
since there is no guidance, I say we do it however we want.  We could
answer the questions in prose style, for example.  The write up should be
no more than a page and a half - but that is just my humble opinion.

Cheers,
