Congratulations to two of our EvMBA students who placed in the recent
business plan competitions:

Peter Fiske and his team, of RAPT Industries, advanced on to the finals of
the UC Berkeley Business Plan Competition along with five other
teams.  RAPT Industries developed Reactive Atom Plasma (RAP) processing,  a
proprietary technology for etching and polishing optical and semiconductor
materials.  The final round will be held April 25 and is open to the
public.  We'll keep you posted on time and place.

Tom McVey and his team, of Aprotea, also advanced to the finals of the UC
Berkeley Business Plan Competition.  Aprotea has developed a patent-pending
biochip for parallel analysis of 100 to 10,000 protein samples.  The chip
provides a rapid and easy-to-use protein measurement system to enhance drug
discovery.

Aprotea also took second prize ($2,000) for Best Management Team in the
Haas Social Venture Competition.

Congratulations to both Peter and Tom!

Cheers,

Diane
