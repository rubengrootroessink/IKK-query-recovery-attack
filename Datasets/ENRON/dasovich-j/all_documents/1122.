FYI, the Arter & Hadden office is all of 2.9 miles from the airport, so  it's 
a very short cab ride.? If anyone is driving and needs directions,  please 
let me know.? Our office has a small conference room which might not  be 
large enough for all the Board attendees, so we are meeting a few floors  
down, in a larger room which the building makes available to tenants.? As  
Gary noted, it is called the Boardroom, and is located on the fourth  floor.? 
We'll bring in some sandwich menus and order out for a late  lunch.? Look 
forward to seeing you.

Folks,

We have a venue and location for our new Board  meeting.? Arter & Hadden
has offered their office space.

Dan  wrote me:

"Gary, our office is at 402 West Broadway.? Phone is  (619) 238-0001 and
fax is (619) 238-8333.? The room is called "The  Boardroom" and it's on
the 4th floor.? Arter & Hadden will pick  up the charge, in thanks for
all the work which comes our direction from  WPTF.? Do you want to start
with a lunch?? Or would you prefer to  assume people will have lunched
and just have snacks and  drinks?"

I told Dan we would appreciate a late lunch, at 2 pm.?  The meeting will
start at 1 pm.

The dial-in number is  712-257-3178
PC 39908

Okay, That's  it.
