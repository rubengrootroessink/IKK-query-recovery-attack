Here it is darlin'.  It's an attachment to the main text of the document. If 
you have any questions, or need anything else.  Don't hesitate.

Best,

JEff--I was just on the phone with Kaufman and he asked if you could send me 
a great document that you put together on a demand buy down program (and he 
said it was the one you put together for Hertberg).  Could you send either 
via e mail or fax?  612-339-4392
