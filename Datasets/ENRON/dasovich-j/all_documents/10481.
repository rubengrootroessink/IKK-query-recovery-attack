			Peter Granoff on Wines for Easter and Passover
			
			Easter and Passover are just around the corner, raising the question of what 
wines best accompany these two holidays. Nobody is better qualified to 
discuss this topic than wine.com founder Peter Granoff. Not only is he a 
Master Sommelier, he was also raised in a Jewish-Catholic household. 
			
			Peter's earliest experience of wine was Manischewitz and Mogen David, when he 
was seven or eight years old. "My (Catholic) mother was very active in 
celebrating Jewish holidays," he recalls. "We were all given a sip of wine, 
though it would have been heavily diluted with water." 
			
			Traditionally (or perhaps habitually), kosher wines were simple and sweet -- 
not the sort of beverage that appeals to grownup connoisseurs like Granoff. 
"When kosher wine was first made in this country, most of it came from the 
Concord grape, which has a lot of acid and bitter phenolics in the skin," 
Peter explains. "It was desirable to preserve some sweetness in the wine in 
order to make it palatable. Today, though, modern winemaking technology has 
proven beyond any doubt that kosher wine can pass muster as fine wine in 
every respect. And I believe that kosher wine should be good before it's 
anything else -- the fact that it's kosher should be an added benefit." 
			
			Granoff says that all kosher wines on wine.com fit this criterion. For 
special mention, he singles out the products of Hagafen, which he describes 
as "classic Napa Valley wines -- a full-bodied Merlot, a bright and elegant 
Chardonnay, a crisp Sauvignon Blanc, and an off-dry Riesling." 
			
			There's also the 1996 Barkan Cabernet Sauvignon from the Galil region of 
Israel -- a ripe and concentrated Cabernet that's beginning to show some 
bottle age -- and some top-of-the-line Laurent Perrier Champagnes, both Brut 
and Ros,. Perhaps the ultimate all-around wine for this time of year is the 
sparkling, slightly sweet, kosher Bartenura Asti Spumante from Piedmont, 
Italy. 
			
			"It's unusual to find an Italian kosher wine, but they're out there," Granoff 
observes. "Jewish holiday meals often involve an extended family, and with 
three generations at the table you're likely to encounter disparate 
preferences in wine. The older generation might have a bias toward something 
sweet, but a wonderful wine like the Bartenura will also satisfy wine nuts. 
Better yet, it's only 7 percent alcohol, so you can enjoy it without getting 
hammered." 
			
			For Easter brunch, Peter recommends refreshing white wines like Riesling and 
young, fruity Beaujolais-style reds. Then again, since sparkling wine is a 
lovely and customary accompaniment to brunch, why not bring out the Bartenura 
Asti Spumante here, too? 
			
			"A kosher Italian sparkling wine for Easter," Peter reflects. "I like that 
idea."
