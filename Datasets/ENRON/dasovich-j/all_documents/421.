Greetings Matt and Tom:

The Government Affairs (GA) group has established a "Commercial 
Opportunities" task force.  Dan Allegretti is heading-up the task force; it 
consists of about 7 of us in GA.  Its goal is to build upon and expand GA's 
role in helping commercial units to identify/originate opportunities.  Thus 
far the group has met with EES and ENA to mine ideas.  Schedules permitting 
we'd like to try to meet with you in Houston on April 5,6,12,or 13.  Hope one 
of these dates works.

Best,
Jeff
