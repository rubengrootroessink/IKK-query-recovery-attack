> But what I will excite you with is the opportunity to make a real

> But you must vote between Monday, 9am and Wednesday, 5pm, when the polls
> close so we can tabulate the results!!!  The polls are open now!!!

> Let's face it, in the national presidential election, your vote isn't

> who gets to stay alive in the most exciting contest on the Haas campus
> since the last contest that was held on the Haas campus!  (Last I checked,
> only one person had voted so far!)  So get online and vote before
> Wednesday at 5:00pm!!!

> A link to the voting survey will also be available at www.haasweek.net
> each week.  In order to avoid excessive spam abuse, I will post all future
> voting reminders and updates about exciting HaasWeek Survivor Contest
> "Immunity Challenges" to mba_social and evmba_social only.  Keep an eye
