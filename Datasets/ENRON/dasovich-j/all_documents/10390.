Here is a note from Mike Florio of the ISO Board.  This is encouraging, he
wants to talk further about how the ISO programs can be changed to
accomplish what we want.  What would be most helpful is an item by item
analysis by EES (read: Harry and his people) as to why the existing or
proposed ISO programs are inadequate (or why we need to have 31X amended to
have the ISO do programs for direct access customers parallel to the utility
programs in 31X.)  I need this information soon in order to keep the
dialogue going with Florio.  Thanks for your help.  Mike Day

Just to show how up to speed I am, I thought that the ISO was already
planning to do this.  Their presentation on demand programs at the last
board meeting showed a scheduling coordinator option and a UDC option, with
different billing and settlement provisions for each.  But it's hard for me
to judge what is adequate (and user-friendly) and what is not absent some
expert help.  I'm definitely interested in the concept and have no great
faith in utility management of programs of this nature.  Let's pursue.

P.S.  In his own inimitable way, Dan Richard "offered" me the ORA job way
back when.  I said: "Gee, Dan, I thought we were friends!"   When he acted
all surprised and hurt in that way of his, I reminded him that Marty Lyons
and Mark Loy come with the turf.  End of discussion.
