Subject:??????? re:? photos

Dear Aunty Nancy,

It was nice to hear your voice yesterday.? My mom and dad bought me a special 
hammock for me to take my morning sunbaths.? I can look out of the window and 
watch the quail and squirrels.? Mom thought you would like to see some photos 
of me.

She also told me to tell you that she is going to look into that "stuff" you 
told her about.

Bye for now......Love, Sammy? (meow)<<SAAMMY2.ZIP>>
