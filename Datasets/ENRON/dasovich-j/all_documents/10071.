Thanks Jeff.  Sorry for the delay.  Lots of internal conversations have
been required to get everyone lined up.

David:
Thanks so much.  I'd almost given up hope.  I will be distributing the
proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across
the nation.  Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard
to try to bring people together.  I'll be in touch soon.  Don't hesitate to
contact me to discuss it further.  415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
