Final letter.  We will hear from our customer service team as soon as we 
receive the first customer call.
I will keep you all in the loop.
Thanks!

Diann received the word from Marty to begin the de-dasr-ing process within 
the next few weeks.  Thus, we changed the last sentence of the second 
paragraph to reflect that.  For everyone's records, this is the final, final 
copy that received the necessary approvals and that our customers will 
receive in the mail.  Thank you.
