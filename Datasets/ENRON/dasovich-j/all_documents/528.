Gentlemen, 

Attached is my draft of several sections of Rick's testimony. Since we are 
moving here from an outline to prose, I thought that a "marked" copy showing 
changes would be more confusing than helpful. So my sections are in blue 
text, if you just want to read what I wrote. 

I leaned heavily on the outlines from Rick and from John Leslie, which I 
believe everyone will be able to do to save a lot of drafting time.

I look forward to receiving the other pieces, and comments or questions on my 
work, soon. 

The testimony has to be filed by Friday. John Leslie needs, I suspect, a full 
day to format, proof, print, and ship the document. So we have a real 
deadline of, say, noon on Thursday. If we want to give SoCal a peek, then we 
need to wrap this up by Wed. morning.
