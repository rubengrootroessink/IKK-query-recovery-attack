J -- I just talked to our team at Marathon and they're really jazzed about 
next Tuesday's meeting.  They're really looking to identify ways that they 
can add to our strategy -- politically and publicly -- so they'll likely come 
up with a plan with some recommendations after the meeting.

One thing we were supposed to send to them (which I forgot) was the Luntz 
survey.  I don't think I ever saw it.  Do you have a copy?  Could you forward 
to me and I'll send on?

Thanks -- you're the best!
