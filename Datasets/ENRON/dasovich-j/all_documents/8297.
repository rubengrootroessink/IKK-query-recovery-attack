1997 Adella Zinfandel, Napa Valley, California, $14.99

that hits the palate right in the bull's-eye.=20

Port and Chocolate Cigars, $30.00
This soothing tawny port from Tuke Holdsworth is a great way to take=20
the chill out of a cool winter evening. Paired with luscious=20

Two Weeks to ZAP Mania

Now is a time of year when Zinfandel lovers find themselves=20
salivating even more profusely than usual. Such Pavlovian symptoms=20
are observable with the approach of January 27, the date of the=20
upcoming ZAP tasting in San Francisco.=20

ZAP (Zinfandel Advocates and Producers) was formed by a group of=20
impassioned wine producers in 1992 to raise awareness of Zinfandel=20
and promote it as America's "native" wine. Like other members of the=20
Vitis vinifera family, Zinfandel's origins lie somewhere in Europe,=20
but nobody has been able to determine exactly where; DNA testing has=20
shown the grape to be identical to the Primitivo of southern Italy,=20
but it's documented in the United States earlier than it can be=20
traced to Italy. Zinfandel has been grown and vinified in California=20
since the mid-19th century, establishing it as America's contribution=20
to the world of fine wine.=20

While Zinfandel's fortunes have risen and fallen since its arrival in=20
the New World 150 years ago, it's always been a grape and wine that=20
inspired feverish loyalty. Now, as the 21st century commences, Zin=20
seems to have it both ways: It's enjoying an unprecedented level of=20
popularity and prestige, but its adherents still have the=20
warm-and-cozy feeling of cult membership.=20

This phenomenon is on lavish display at the annual ZAP tasting, a=20
boisterous party that traditionally takes place on the Saturday=20
before the Super Bowl. Certified in the Guinness Book of World=20
Records as the world's biggest one-varietal wine tasting, the event=20
attracted more than 200 wineries and 6,000 wine lovers last year.=20
This time, for its 10th anniversary, it's being conducted in two=20
different buildings at San Francisco's Fort Mason Center. Advance=20
tickets cost $35 for ZAP members and $45 for non-members, with a=20
limited amount available at the door for $50 on the day of the event.=20

If you can't make it to the tasting, another easy way to sample the=20
state of Zin is wine.com's selection of Zinfandel in all its forms=20
and guises.=20
