Hi Jeff,

Here are my votes:

If we have the documents in hand, great.  
If we don't have them in hand, asking Bowen to produce samples probably would 
do quite a bit to speed the process.   I assume he probably has a good idea 
of what they should look like.
A short call to be sure we're all on the same page is a good idea.

Best regards,

Sue

Greetings:

As part of our final tariff filing, we need to submit "sample" forms for 
things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill and New Service Orders.? Do we 
have any?  Have we had to file any elsewhere?  If not, do we want Bowen & Co. 
to "create" some for us to review, or do we prefer to find the right folks 
internal to EBS and create them internally?  Make sense to arrange a 15-30 
minute call to discuss how to execute?  All opinions, views, etc. are 
encouraged and welcome.

Best,
Jeff
