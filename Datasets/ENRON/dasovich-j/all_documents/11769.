Energy Committee Members:

Below and attached you will find information regarding DOE's software, which
allows network-based activation of sleep mode on computer monitors.  Terry
O'Sullivan observed the last meeting of the Energy Committee and believes
this to be valuable information for many of our member companies.  If you
would like additional information about this or other program elements,
please contact Terry O'Sullivan (510-482-4421 x223;
terry@energy-solution.com) and he will be happy to talk with you further.

The EPA is preparing a nationwide campaign to enable the Energy Star sleep
mode function on computer monitors.  This campaign will feature DOE's new
public domain software, which allows a system administrator to enable the
sleep mode on computer monitors via the network.  The programs author was
very interested in meeting with our group, unfortunately time does not allow
with the increasing urgency of many issues that demand our committee's
attention.  However, I did not want you to miss out on this opportunity.
Please take a moment to review the attached information.

Again, please feel free to contact Terry for more information.

Thanks
