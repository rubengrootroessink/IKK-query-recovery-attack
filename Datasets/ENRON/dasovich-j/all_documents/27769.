eProcurement

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit eProcurement is coming to Corporate on 
July 2, and you have been identified as a future user.

The purpose of this e-mail is to announce the Corporate implementation of 
iBuyit eProcurement and to encourage you to prepare yourself to use this new 
tool.

From pens to computers, eProcurement will enable you to order and approve 
purchases online.  Special features include:
*  eCatalog (Corporate Express and more!) to help you shop for the items that 
you need
*  Easy repeat purchases
*  Automatic routing of shopping carts for approval   

Over the coming weeks, the iBuyit team will provide you with the following 
information to help you transition to the new system:
*  How iBuyit eProcurement will impact your purchase activities
*  Training information
*  Where to get help

I encourage you to review this information carefully and to take advantage of 
the training opportunities.

If you have any questions about the Corporate implementation of iBuyit 
eProcurement please contact the iBuyit project team by sending an e-mail to <
<mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>>.
