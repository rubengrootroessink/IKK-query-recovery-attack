PISMO BEACH, Calif., Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Utilagent, a California based 
utility services company, announced that it now provides a 20% electricity 
savings for all PG&E, Edison, and SDG&E residential accounts throughout 
California. The savings come directly from the actual cost of the electricity 
and is deducted from the "electric energy" charges as shown on one's utility 
bill. 
"California residents have seen their electricity bills skyrocket instead of 
decline and view this deregulation process as a confusing, dismal failure", 
says Robert Kramb, manager of Utilagent. "In addition, except for microscopic 
print found on electricity bills, regarding alternative suppliers, little has 
been done by the Public Utilities Commission and utility companies to educate 
Californian's about their purchase options. Utilagent has simply decided to 
take the guesswork out of the process." 
?


Utilagent provides Californian's with an on-line approach for the 20% 
savings. Their web site http://www.electricityderegulation.com uses a 
one-page, one-minute, sign-up form where a resident enters their utility 
information and payment option. The entire process is done on-line, and there 
are no fees (either switching or cancellation), no deposits, and no long-term 
contracts. 
"Utilagent scours the utility market place for the best programs that provide 
the best utility savings for the most people, and we are pleased to promote 
Utility.com as the ESP (electric service provider) in California. Those 
signing up through Utilagent receive their same electricity and utility 
services as they have in the past, but pay 20% less for their electric 
energy, the way electricity deregulation is meant to be", claims Kramb.
