Jeff,

A couple of presentations attached which give you some quick info comparing 
the Nordic market to others, notably UK.  The first is a presentation 
prepared for our Mexcian colleagues 18 months ago, drawing out key features 
and success factors in selected liberalised markets, including Nord Pool.  
The second overlaps a little with the first in terms of Nordic content and 
compares the NP arrangements to the existing and proposed new UK 
arrangements.  This one is over 2 years old now.  I would urge caution in 
using both of them to the extent that they are (particularly the latter) a 
little dated now.

One very good non-Enron comparative source (although again not completely up 
to date), (sorted by market design issue rather than by market but including 
plenty on Nord Pool) can be found at 
http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/elarch/aback.htm.    Open the document dated Feb 98, 
comparing trading arrangements in "other countries" (than UK).   This was 
prepared by the regulator in the early phase of the redesign of the UK market.

Let us know if you need more help.

Regards
Philip Davies
