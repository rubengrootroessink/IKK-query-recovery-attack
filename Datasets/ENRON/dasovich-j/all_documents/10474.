YOU CAN GROW INVESTMENTS FASTER WITH A TAX-DEFERRED IRA


Dear Valued Investor,

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is one of the best ways 
to help build assets for your future. Because this investment 
account is tax-advantaged, it not only can COMPOUND FASTER 
than a brokerage account, but also defers payment of taxes.

YOUR SCHWAB IRA IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR RETIREMENT PLAN

IRAs are more flexible than ever:

*  As long as you have earned income, you can contribute to 
your IRA*
*  You can invest your IRA in bonds, stocks, mutual funds and 
money market funds, and trade as frequently as you like 
*  A tax-deferred IRA DELAYS ALL TAXES on income, not just 
capital gains, allowing your money to compound faster
*  You can make contributions to your IRA EVEN if you 
contribute to a 401(k)
*  Withdrawals can be made without penalty from your IRA for 
education financing, first-time home purchase or certain 
medical expenses

WE'VE MADE IT EASY TO OPEN YOUR IRA ONLINE TODAY**
