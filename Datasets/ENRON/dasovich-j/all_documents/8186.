In response to the question by Enron, the state PUC will accept partnership 
tax return information for a LLC.  The state PUC follows whatever the 
Department of Revenue requires to be utilized.  Accordingly, where an LLC is 
treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership are tax classified 
as a partnership for Pennsylvania purposes under the normal Personal Income 
Tax provisions but are still treated as a corporation for Capital 
Stock/Franchise Tax purposes.  The LLC partnership would therefore be able to 
file a PA-65 form which is based on the Federal 1065 partnership return with 
the Department of Revenue and the PUC.
