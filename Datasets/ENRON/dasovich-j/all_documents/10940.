Paul et al--in addition to the comments that I made specific to California on 
the previous e mail, there were a few other observations that might be of 
interest. 

Governor Kempthorne made opening comments and used fairly strong comments 
against price caps.  

US Senator Larry Craig made opening comments, including the statement "price 
caps ......an easy political decision to make, once it's made, it's 
impossible to change".  He stayed for the entire meeting, and I got the 
impression that he was traveling with Hebert.  

The Chairman from Colorado (Raymond Gifford)  was particularly strong in his 
advocacy against price caps as were the 2 participants from Arizona.

The Chairman from Nevada asked that Walt Higgins (CEO of Sierra Pacific?) be 
able to make comments on the record.  Mr Higgins' testimony was vrey good for 
our cause, both in substance and "message" wise.  He basically said that if 
price caps were put in place, he would be punished for having hedged and put 
together a balanced portfolio to be able serve his customers effectively.  
Breathitt seemed to have a relationship with him so he might be a another 
good sounding board for her?

As stated in the article that Dasovich sent around, Hebert tallied the votes 
at the end of the meeting.  Although all of the republican governors are 
against price caps, three of the commissioners from those states were open to 
considering some type of "price mitigation plan"  (this is apparently the new 
word for price caps because all of the proponents of price caps kept using 
it) with lots of caveats.  Those commissioners were Schafer from New Mexico, 
White from Utah, and Smith from Idaho.

Lastly, Commissioner Breathitt was accurately protrayed in the article.  She 
seemed increasingly angst ridden as the meeting went on and at the end of the 
meeting stated that she really wanted the FERC to consider a price mitigation 
plan and the she "had a lot of thinking to do".
