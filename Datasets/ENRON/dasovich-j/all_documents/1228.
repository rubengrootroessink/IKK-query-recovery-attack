Here's the latest info. about the FERC meeting.  Only Commissioners and their
Staffs will be attending, no additional FERC Staff (no one from the Office of
Markets and Tariff Rates).  The Meeting is mostly an opportunity for customers
to blow off steam.  Presentations will be made by the three IOUs, one 
generator,
one marketer (Enron) and one ESP, UCAN, and various politicians.  When I get 
the
list I'll forward it.  Each presenter will have about five minutes with no
questions from the audience.  Panelists should expect questions and discussion
among panelists or in response to Commissioner's questions.

Attached is the latest FERC notice about the California meeting.  It 
recognizes
that there may be discussions about pending FERC cases.  This does not mean 
FERC
will be grilling our panelist about these cases.  Rather, FERC has to issue 
this
notice so if someone talks about an issue pending in one of those cases, the
Commissioners don't violate the government in the sunshine rules.
