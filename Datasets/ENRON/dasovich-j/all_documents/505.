Dear E204-1 and E204-2 students,
Erik Magner has informed me that the academic version of Crystal Ball
that you received does not have the decision variable function that we
discussed in class.  I was under the distinct impression that your version
would have the decision variable function but limited to two choices for
cells that could operate as decisions.  I would suggest that you try
Tools - Crystal Ball Decision and see if your software permits access.
If not, you may have to try several decision choices in separate simulations
(a little more tedious but this is essentially what Crystal Ball would do).
I spoke with the same person at Decisioneering, and she indicated the
student version of Crystal Ball should be able to set up the decision cells
and function correctly (as long as you go through the Tools - CB Decision
steps, not just the simulation (triangular) start icon.  You can test your
software with the attached simulation for airline reservations.
