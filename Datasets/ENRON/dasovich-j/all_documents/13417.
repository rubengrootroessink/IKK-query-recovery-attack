Jeff,

These are all PX guys.  We could probably get a group together, but clearly
it would not include all of the earlier group.  We may be better to wait
for an opportunity to speak with unanimity.
David

PS - Any progress on the other proposal?

Subject:  Economists letter on FERC and California


Greetings:
Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who
think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response
to this letter?

P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of
this, but I wasn't altogether successful.

Best,
Jeff
