Some of you had asked about this filing which would appear to be related to 
PG&E's conduct regarding Fresno State. FYI only. Dirk

Hello and happy new year.    Since this is you neck o' the woods, I thought I
let you see this.   I have no idea of its location vis a vis CSUF.   Didn't 
know
if you might be able to take advantage of this in some way.  ttfn
