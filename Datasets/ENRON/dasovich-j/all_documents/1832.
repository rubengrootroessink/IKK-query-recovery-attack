The Senate Energy Committee will conduct an oversight hearing on the 
Northwest Price Spike Situation on Thursday, October 5th here in D.C. at 9:30 
a.m. with Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) Chairing.  The focus will be how to 
prevent future price spikes with only Northwest witnesses invited to testify, 
including the four Northwest governors who likely will not be able to accept 
on such short notice.

As you know, we have been working with Senator Gorton's counsel to discuss a 
possible role for the Senator in our FERC strategy.  After our meeting 
tomorrow with Senator Bingaman's counsel regarding the FERC strategy, we plan 
to debrief Senator Gorton's counsel also and refine their possible roles in 
the strategy.   

As such, since we are not truly a "Northwest" witness, rather than ask to 
testify; we can achieve our same goals by continuing to work with Senator 
Gorton's counsel to suggest questions plus statements for the hearing.

Allison will get you the testimony when it becomes available.
