Dear Jeffrey,

Since you asked us to keep you informed about
WineShopper.com, we have a merry announcement to make:
On the verge of the holiday season, WineShopper.com
has merged with wine.com.

Our combined site will be the ultimate online wine
destination, featuring an increased selection of
wonderful wines from around the world, professional
tips on selection and serving, and feature stories
that will expand your everyday enjoyment of wine. In
the interest of simplicity, the joint company will be
called wine.com.

Hark! 15 percent off
Excited as we are about this scenario, we think the
ultimate winner will be you. Help us celebrate with
15 percent off your next order. To take advantage of
this festive offer, visit us at the link below:

Oh, one other thing: Our newsletters are merging too.
Very shortly, you'll be receiving a free weekly e-mail
from wine.com, in which you'll find special offers, a
constantly changing selection of wine recommendations,
and entertaining articles on topics from the vast,
varied, and sometimes confounding world of wine.

If you'd prefer not to get the newsletter, you can
unsubscribe by following the instructions below. But
if you give the first one a look, we doubt you'll want
to do that.

In any case, please join us in raising a glass to the
exciting prospects around the corner. Buying wine
online has just gotten easier.

Sincerely,
WineShopper.com & wine.com
