> NE>) announced today the launch of EnronOnline, a global Internet-based
> transaction system for wholesale energy and other commodities. EnronOnline
> will allow participants to not only view commodity prices in real-time but
> also to directly transact with Enron over the Internet free of commission.
> The transaction system will go live on Nov. 29, 1999, with the launch of
> North America natural gas to be followed by all other products over the
> next six weeks.
> "EnronOnline offers customers the next level of wholesale energy
> transaction service by having easy and simple access to Enron's prices and
> products," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, president and COO of Enron. "This
> Internet system complements Enron's extensive marketing capabilities and
> gives our counterparties the choice of transacting over the telephone or
> instantly through our website."
> Enron's customers across the world will be able to access several hundred
> traded products through EnronOnline. The company will leverage its
> wholesale market expertise to publish real-time prices for power, natural
> gas, coal, weather products, liquids, petrochemicals, pulp and paper,
> emission credits and other commodities in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
> It will continue expanding web-based commodity and product offerings
> globally.
> "Unlike other Internet commodity service providers, EnronOnline doesn't
> match buyers with sellers," said Skilling. "Customers will be able to
> instantaneously conduct transactions directly with an Enron company as a
> principal."
> Real-time capabilities in the United States will be delivered wherever
> possible through Enron Communication, Inc.'s intelligent fiber optic
> network. This system is designed to combat web latency and create a true
> real-time environment online for Enron's customers.
> A preview of the system is currently available at www.EnronOnline.com
> <http://www.EnronOnline.com>.
> Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and
> communications companies. The company, which owns approximately $34
> billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and
> natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy facilities
> worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management
> services to customers around the world, and is developing an intelligent
> network platform to facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address
> is www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com> and the stock is traded under the
