Jeff,

I am compiling a compliance memo for Sue Nord and need your help.  Do you 
have lists of compliance requirements for EBS from the states that you 
cover?  We have asked local counsel in a good majority of our states to 
research this for us.

If you have such information, I would appreciate it if you could forward it 
to me as soon as possible.

Thanks very much.
