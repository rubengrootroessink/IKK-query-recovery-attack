Thanks very much for following up on this, Margo.  I'm now scheduled to meet 
with Kristina Mordaunt on Tuesday to talk about compliance.

All,

With Dick Anderson's assistance, we've tracked down the appropriate person to 
handle the filing of the CA Quarterly Fee Statement that Jeff sent to me last 
week.  I have forwarded a copy of the form to Steve Batchelder (see e-mail 
from Dick below) via interoffice mail and left him a voicemail message 
indicating that the form is on its way and that Dick indicated Steve is the 
appropriate person to handle it.  I have asked Steve to call me when he 
receives the form.  

Thanks!

Margo,

The attached form is in regards to an assessment by the California PUC on all 
entities regulated by the PUC to recover the costs of running the PUC.  The 
concept is that the regulated utilities, rather than the taxpayers, should 
pay for the operation of the PUC.  This fee is only assessed on intrastate 
revenues, thus, we should only report the California intrastate receipts of 
Enron Telecommunications, Inc.  Since this fee is not a tax, Accounting is 
responsible for completing this report, according to the July 2000 agreement 
between Jim Ginty (Tax), Scott Bolton (Regulatory Affairs), Steve McCarrel 
(Legal) and Carolyn Barrett (Accounting).  It is my understanding that Steven 
Batchelder is the person in Accounting  tasked with completing these reports.

Thank you for asking,
