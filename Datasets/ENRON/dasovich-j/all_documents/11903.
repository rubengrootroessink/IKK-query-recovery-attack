River's Power Aids California and Enriches the Northwest

By BLAINE HARDEN

GEORGE, Wash. =02=05 Doing something nice for California has never been a p=
riority=20
here in the Columbia River Basin, where high-voltage power lines lope acros=
s=20
irrigated fields of alfalfa, potatoes and wheat.

Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain at great=
=20
length, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the basin's cheap=20
electricity and water.

Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of late.=20
Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from Sunday, they are=20
skidding into the summer air-conditioning season desperately short of power=
.=20
In the last year, much of their salvation has come from the Columbia River,=
=20
whose monstrous dams are the largest hydroelectricity machines in North=20
America.

All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia, utility=20
companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help save California =
=02=05=20
but at a staggering price. Charging whatever California's dysfunctional pow=
er=20
market will bear, people in this narrow stretch of the Northwest have creat=
ed=20
a kind of Kuwait along the Columbia.

With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the emptiness o=
f=20
Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel generators to make stil=
l=20
more power and paying Wall Street-style wages to electricity traders =02=05=
 while=20
making sure that their electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North=
=20
America. Just north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utilit=
y=20
luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks to 1.6=
=20
million customers.

Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of ambivalence and may=
=20
well be short-lived. A severe drought is already hurting farmers across the=
=20
region. If it continues, utilities along the river will have to buy power a=
nd=20
may be punished by the same market forces that gave them a windfall.

"This is not nice money," said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who heads a=
=20
group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. "It is something that=
=20
is offered to us not to use water so Californians can run their=20
air-conditioners."

Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia Basin.

North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly owned utility=
=20
that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as much money last year=
=20
than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local customers, the utility last=
=20
year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid its two top power traders $285,000=
=20
each, an astonishing income in a county where per capita income is less tha=
n=20
$25,000 a year. The utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear=
=20
their children might be kidnapped.

The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility District=20
acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were "huge" and "obscene."=
=20
But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added, "We would be imprudent if we d=
id=20
not maximize this market for our customer owners."

Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that also owns t=
wo=20
dams on the Columbia has made even more money maximizing the market. It had=
 a=20
record $88.8 million in profits last year =02=05 more than double its best=
=20
previous year.

Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000 retail customer=
s,=20
is using its windfall to help build a $70 million fiber optic network for=
=20
local residents. It has also bought 20 diesel generators to guard against=
=20
power shortages and, if possible, exploit the power gold-rush. The utility=
=20
estimates that those generators could add $50 million to profits in the=20
coming year.

Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought insurance to=
=20
insulate its customers from high market prices for electricity, when, as no=
w,=20
local needs exceed generating capacity in the river. Power rates in Grant a=
nd=20
Chelan Counties are about one-fifth as much as in New York City.

Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea of giving=
 a=20
share of its profits to its customers.

"How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so many people=
=20
are paying more for electricity?" asked Lon Topaz, director of resource=20
management for the utility. "It would be lousy politics."

An Upside-Down Economy

The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin has combined=
=20
with California's deregulation mess to further distort the energy market.=
=20
Drought has not only helped increase the price at which electricity can be=
=20
sold on the spot market =02=05 10 to 20 times as much as last year's price =
=02=05 it=20
has strengthened a compelling bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every=
=20
megawatt not purchased and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long-=
=20
term prices that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent sou=
th=20
to California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings and a=
=20
long-distance bonanza.

As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap hydropower=
=20
has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are being paid up to $4=
40=20
an acre not to farm.

Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion this year b=
y=20
not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoa have earned profits that delight=
=20
Wall Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by=20
reselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a cheap=20
long-term contract.

Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a few dollars=
=20
from the power crunch. Avista Utilities has announced that it will pay its=
=20
customers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do not us=
e,=20
if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last year's level.

For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from California'=
s=20
electricity crisis have been secured in British Columbia. A number of priva=
te=20
American utilities have also benefited from California's troubles.

BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the Columbia and=
=20
Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history of the province to=20
exceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in Canadian currency ($712 millio=
n=20
in United States currency).

To celebrate, the provincial government ordered BC Hydro to do something it=
=20
had never done before. The utility mailed each of its customers a check for=
=20
$130. BC Hydro also guaranteed them no increases in electricity rates, whic=
h=20
have not gone up for seven years.

"We are just happy to be lucky that we have reservoirs and dams that were=
=20
built by people of great foresight," said Brian R. D. Smith, chairman of BC=
=20
Hydro.

When reminded that a March study by the California Independent System=20
Operator, which runs that state's power grid, accused BC Hydro of market=20
manipulation and profit gouging, Mr. Smith was less happy.

"All they do is scream and shout and they won't pay you the money they owe=
=20
you," he said, arguing that his company has gone out of its way to help=20
California in its hour of need. Gouging has nothing to do with it, he said,=
=20
adding that it was California's "awful mess" in deregulating power markets=
=20
that fueled BC Hydro's record profits.

A Good Deal for Farmers

In the beginning, that is to say when federal money began transforming the=
=20
Columbia from the world's premier salmon highway into a chain of adjustable=
=20
lakes, no one paid much attention to electricity. The river possessed a thi=
rd=20
of America's hydroelectric potential, but there were not enough people in t=
he=20
Northwest to use more than a fraction of it, and long-distance high- voltag=
e=20
transmission lines did not exist.

The main intention, when New Deal dollars began raining on the Northwest in=
=20
the 1930's, was to create family farms. Grand Coulee Dam, the biggest dam i=
n=20
North America and the largest hydroelectric plant, was primarily designed a=
s=20
a water-delivery device for farmers.

Since then, as 6,000 miles of tunnels and concrete canals were built to=20
shuttle water around in sagebrush country, each 960-acre farm in the Columb=
ia=20
Basin Federal Irrigation Project was blessed with at least $2.1 million in=
=20
federal infrastructure subsidies, according to the Bureau of Reclamation,=
=20
which built it.

In addition, farmers are guaranteed access to cheap water from the Columbia=
=20
and the right to buy all the electricity they needed to pump that water out=
=20
of the river =02=05 at $1.50 a megawatt. A megawatt of electricity currentl=
y sells=20
for $375 to $400 on the spot market. As Paul Pitzer, a Columbia Basin=20
historian, has written, farmers here have always felt that "no price is too=
=20
high to pay for their water so long as someone else is paying the bill."

This year, though, the price finally became unbearably high for the=20
Bonneville Power Administration, a nonprofit agency that markets electricit=
y=20
from 29 federal dams on river. The agency calculated that if it could=20
persuade farmers in the project not to irrigate 90,000 acres of land, water=
=20
left in the Columbia would produce electricity worth as much as $129 millio=
n=20
(if it had to be purchased at current market prices).

In a buyout that is without precedent in the Pacific Northwest, Bonneville =
is=20
paying 800 farmers a total of $30 million. The farmers receive $330 for eac=
h=20
acre they do not farm. On top of that, Grant County's public utility is=20
paying many of the same farmers about $100 an acre not to farm their land.

On April 13, about 20 irrigators gathered for lunch at the Martha Inn Cafe=
=20
here in George to discuss the buyout. Since farm prices are low this year,=
=20
they agreed that it was a good deal.

Still, the farmers, who do not like to be reminded of the federal subsidies=
=20
that keep their irrigation system afloat, said they worried about the=20
precedent they set when they traded water for cash.

"This has to be a temporary deal," said Tom Flynt, 52, who normally farms 9=
00=20
acres but has taken 150 acres out of production because of the buyout. "If=
=20
anybody thought this would affect their water rights, there would be no=20
takers."

Several farmers said they did not like the idea of their water supporting t=
he=20
lifestyles of urban people, especially Californians, who, those who were=20
interviewed said, do not appreciate the food that the farmers put on their=
=20
table.

"We feel that Americans are making decisions with their mouths full," said=
=20
Tricia C. Lubach, a marketing consultant whose husband is an irrigation=20
farmer. "Not too long ago they didn't worry about where the power comes fro=
m.=20
Someday they may think about where the food comes from."

A `Wonderful Energy Fit'

A couple of hundred miles northwest of George, in a penthouse conference ro=
om=20
that overlooks Vancouver harbor, Mr. Smith, the chairman of British=20
Columbia's most profitable company, explained in mid- April what a pain it=
=20
was selling electricity to Californians.

"People say to me what are you doing selling power to those ungrateful=20
Californians," he said. It does not help, he added, that the state is behin=
d=20
on its bills by about $300 million.

Still, neither BC Hydro nor the provincial government can afford to lose=20
California's money. The utility has become a cash cow for the provincial=20
budget, which in the last decade has received more than $3.7 billion from B=
C=20
Hydro.

"We have a wonderful energy fit," Mr. Smith said, referring to BC Hydro's=
=20
power-trading relationship with California, if not to Californians=20
themselves. "We have oversupply in the summer when they have got high deman=
d,=20
and we have got undersupply in the winter when they have got stuff to give =
to=20
us."

BC Hydro has acknowledged that it massages its hydropower system to sell=20
power when it is most needed =02=05 and most expensive =02=05 in California=
. The=20
utility closes the faucets on its dams at night during the summer, storing=
=20
water while meeting local electricity needs with cheap off-peak power broug=
ht=20
from across the West. In the morning, when prices peak, it opens the faucet=
s=20
and zaps electricity off to California.

"We spill water during the day," Mr. Smith said. "Why? Is it because we can=
=20
make more money? No. It's because that is when everybody wants electricity,=
=20
for God's sake."

Questions about profit gouging on the part of dam-dependent utilities in th=
e=20
Northwest may soon be moot. Drought has reduced the Columbia River runoff s=
o=20
far this year to about half of what is considered normal.

The shortfall dovetails with higher costs for natural-gas-fired power plant=
s=20
and a growing gap on the West Coast between demand for electricity and=20
capacity to generate it.

"Absent being successful in getting loads down, we could be looking at=20
quadrupling of the power rates," said Paul Norman, head of power operations=
=20
at the Bonneville Power Administration.

Unless conservation increases or the drought eases, Mr. Norman warned that =
by=20
late summer, the Northwest's era of cheap power could come to a sudden and=
=20
painfully expensive end.
