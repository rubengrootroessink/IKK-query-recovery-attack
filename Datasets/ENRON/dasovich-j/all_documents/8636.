If we are still open to changes I would suggest adding a sentence (in
brackets below) to the paragraph about retail competition that supports a
reasonable proposal by the ISO  market survailence committee. We all hope
that the market will do it anyway but in a disfunctional market certain
things need to be mandated.


".....Second, California should not abandon its goal of fostering retail
competition.  New competitors need the ample, stable and reliable
electricity supplies that a reformed market system will promote.  Retail
competition can help bring new types of contracts and metering systems, and
better awareness of environmental effects as entrants introduce "green"
packages, and demand-side innovations.  This is another reason why consumers
must pay the real cost of electricity, as retail competition cannot thrive
in an environment in which supply companies lack retail pricing freedom.  As
a consequence, companies involved in retail supply, including the California
utilities, should be allowed to pass-through their energy costs in a
competitive environment. [At the same time retail customers should be
guaranteed the option of locking in a fixed fair price by the default
supplier and not be exposed to market volatility should they choose to do
so.]

Finally, oversight of the electricity business will always be needed.  The
cornerstones of electricity regulation must be oversight of the distribution
function, and ensuring that any anticompetitive behavior by suppliers is
circumscribed. "
