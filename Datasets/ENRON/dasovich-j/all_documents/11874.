UK: UPDATE 1-Scot Power in talks to buy Portland-sources
By Andrew Callus
04/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Scottish Power Plc has held talks with Enron 
Corp about buying its Portland, Oregon-based power utility Portland General, 
a good geographic fit for the British group's existing U.S. arm PacifiCorp, 
industry sources said on Monday. 
"It's an obvious one and, yes, there have been discussions," said one source 
speaking after the official breakdown last week of energy trader Enron's 
talks to sell Portland to Nevada-based utility Sierra Pacific Resources Corp .
PacifiCorp operates in six U.S. states including Oregon, and has its 
headquarters in Portland, the state capital. 
Utility holding company Sierra had been preparing to pay about $2 billion for 
Portland and assume $1 billion in debt. 
But the deal ran into trouble as the U.S. West Coast power crisis unfolded 
earlier this year, and talks were officially called off last Thursday. 
Reports that Britain's biggest utility may step in for Portland's 700,000 
customer base and 2,000 megawatts of generating capacity surfaced at the 
weekend in Britain's Observer newspaper. 
PacifiCorp faces its own power crisis fallout, including $1 million a day 
buying-in costs resulting from the failure of one of its generators. The 
problems have helped depress Scottish Power's share price to a point where it 
now registers five percent UK sector underperformance over the past two 
years. 
And analysts said Portland has a significant exposure to current high U.S. 
power prices, with only about 2,000 megawatts of its own generating capacity 
but 3,700 megawatts of peak demand to satisfy. 
U.S. utility acquisitions are always fraught with regulatory difficulties and 
in this case an additional regulatory complication is that Portland owns a 
decommissioning nuclear power station. 
COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES 
Nevertheless, Scottish Power has said it intends to expand further in the 
U.S. to exploit opportunities for merger cost savings in a highly fragmented 
market - The group's English rival National Grid Group was able to take out 
40 percent of New England utility EUA's cost base by merging it with 
neighbouring power group NEES last year. Its current weak share price and 
lack of cash after the PacifiCorp buy has hindered development, but in March 
it made clear it might sell its UK water business, Southern Water. 
The proceeds are earmarked for acquisition purposes, and industry sources 
have put the price sought at 1.7-1.8 billion pounds ($2.4-2.6 billion). Enel 
of Italy has confirmed an interest. 
On Monday, Scottish Power was tightlipped. "We do not comment on market 
speculation," said a spokesman. 
But analysts said Portland was an obvious choice, given that it serves mainly 
the city of Portland and its surrounding area, in the middle of one of 
PacifiCorp's key markets. 
"It's hard to see them finding a better company to buy in terms of geographic 
fit and potential cost savings," said Peter Atherton of Schroder Salomon 
Smith Barney, who released a note last week pointing out the opportunity. 
But he is wary of the move. 
"On the surface selling Southern Water and acquiring PGE (Portland)... would 
appear attractive for SPW," said the research note. "However the loss of 
Southern Water's predictable earnings profile would, at least short term, put 
pressure on earnings and dividend cover." 
Scottish Power will face questions about Portland and Southern Water at its 
annual results presentations on Thursday this week. 
Analysts predict pretax profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional 
items of 612-643 million pounds for the year to March 2001 down from 736 
million a year earlier. 
Lower wholesale prices and regulatory price cuts on retail and distribution 
in the UK will more than offset the effect of a complete full year 
contribution from PacifiCorp, which only fed into Scottish Power's profits 
for four months in the previous year. 
A change to accounting practices which alters the way deferred taxation is 
treated will also account for about 40 million pounds of the profit fall, 
analysts said, with higher telecoms losses also a factor.



India State Panel Set Up To Rework Dahbol Power Pact

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government Monday appointed 
a nine-member committee to
renegotiate the controversial power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy 
major Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit
Dabhol Power Co., the Press Trust of India reported Monday. 
The government has asked the committee, headed by former federal Home 
Secretary Madhav Godbole, to attempt to negotiate a revised agreement within 
a month, the PTI said.
The committee's goals are to bring down the power tariff and allow the sale 
of excess power to the federal government or its utilities, the PTI said. A 
restructure of Dabhol's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. 
The $3 billion, 2,184-megawatt Dabhol project has been mired in financial 
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, 
failed to pay several bills. The project has the largest single foreign 
investment in India. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in Dabhol Power, and is the project's 
largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15% and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

	SURVEY - ENERGY & UTILITY REVIEW: US edges closer to new energy policy: 
	The recent power crisis in California has raised American awareness of the 
situation and the Bush administration seems to be more committed to the 
problem, writes David Buchan
	Financial Times, Apr 30, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN
	The US is striving towards some kind of energy policy. When it eventually 
gets one, the impact on the rest of the world will be considerable. 
	The long-term health of the world's biggest economy, depends on resolution of 
its domestic energy problems. It also has an impact on the market and climate 
generally as the world's biggest importer of oil and emitter of greenhouse 
gases. 
	The US is also home to the world's largest private energy sector, but also 
has a government prone to use energy as a weapon of foreign policy. Through 
sanctions, Washington has kept its own companies out of certain oil-producing 
countries and tried to keep others out too. 
	The only absolutely clear thing about the Bush administration's national 
energy policy is that it wants one. That itself is a change. Like governments 
in other industrialised countries, Washington has steadily retreated from the 
energy sector. 
	It has moved from tight administration (fixing natural gas prices, for 
example) to loose regulation (shared, in electricity, with states and local 
governments). 
	The US has a Strategic Petroleum Reserve, created after the 1970s oil shocks, 
and actually used it last year. In extremis, the US is also willing to go to 
war for oil, as it showed in the Gulf conflict 10 years ago. 
	But the general sentiment was that the marketplace would provide a solution, 
and that energy problems, like bad weather and economic cycles to which they 
are related, could be relied on to fade away. 
	This complacency has been blown away by the California power crisis, last 
year's run-up in world oil prices (partly due to US gasoline and heating oil 
shortages) and the arrival in the White House of a president and 
vice-president with a background in Texan oil. 
	The Texas-based oil and gas industry tends to see the crisis as primarily one 
of supply. In the past 20 years, according to the American Petroleum 
Institute, US oil output has fallen from 8.57m barrels a day to 5.84m b/d. 
	This is despite the fact that companies now drill deeper (to an average of 
6,105 feet, compared to 4,512 feet in 1981), cheaper (average well cost of 
Dollars 769,000, compared with Dollars 855,000 in real terms in 1981) and 
better (a 80.3 per cent success ratio, compared with 69.6 per cent in 1981). 
	During the same period, imports, both crude and refined product, have risen 
from 6m b/d to just over 11m b/d. 
	Natural gas output has not fallen off to the same degree. But nor, in a 
sense, can it. Environmental factors have driven up demand for gas faster 
than for oil. Unlike oil, it cannot be imported by sea, except in the 
liquefied form that still accounts for only 1 per cent of US gas consumption. 
	After the 1998-99 trough in activity, companies, spurred on by higher gas 
prices, are now pressing every available rig into service for drilling in the 
US and Canada. But they are having to run hard just to stay in place. 
	Mark Pappa, Houston-based chief executive of EOG, formerly Enron Oil and Gas 
and now one of the most active drillers in North America, explains why. "We 
are now getting gas out of the ground faster than we can find it, because 
technology in accelerated extraction is advancing faster than in seismology," 
he says. 
	As a result, the rate at which production declines as a share of the base is 
rising - from an average annual decline rate of 16 per cent in 1990 to 23 per 
cent in 1999. "In the Gulf of Mexico, decline rates can go up to 40 per cent 
a year," says Mr Pappa. 
	So the industry is eyeing federal land. The federal government owns one-third 
of US land, but where, 20 years ago, 75 per cent of this was available for 
drilling leases, now only 17 per cent is. 
	The industry hopes, with reason, that the Bush administration will reverse 
this trend. However, this will not be easy. 
	The administration's plan to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge (ANWR) to drilling has stirred strong opposition. There are obstacles 
elsewhere, too. 
	While the federal government owns and could, in theory, lease the entire 
outer continental shelf for drilling, in practice California blocks 
exploitation of the Pacific, while Florida, even under Governor Jeb Bush, the 
president's brother, insists on keeping the drillers away from both its 
coasts. 
	Companies would also like to make fuller use of what leases they have, says 
John Seitz, president of Anadarko. His company, currently North America's 
most active driller on 21m acres, is doubling operations in the Rockies, but 
often has to dismantle rigs temporarily during the wildlife breeding and 
tourist seasons. 
	If access to resources is a problem, so is the infrastructure to get it to 
market. 
	A new report, produced jointly by the Baker Institute in Houston and the 
Council on Foreign Relations in New York, points out how deregulation was 
initially smoothed by "surplus capacities along the entire energy chain, 
accumulated in the days of government-subsidised industry and falling 
demand". 
	The excess capacity existed in refineries, tankers, pipelines, rigs, and, of 
course, in power generation. It allowed "expansion of energy use without 
significantly affecting underlying costs," says the report. 
	The surplus capacity has largely vanished under the impact of deregulation, 
the accompanying price volatility that has made new investment risky and 
quite separate pressures from environmental regulation. 
	Take oil refineries. Twenty years ago, the US had 315 of them with a combined 
capacity of 18.6m b/d and overall utilisation of 68.6 per cent. Last year, 
the country had 155 refineries with a 16.5m 
	b/d capacity that was 92.6 per cent used. 
	It is the same story with the nuclear reactors that provide 20 per cent of US 
electricity. Not a single new nuclear plant permit has been issued since 
1979, the year of the Three Mile Island accident. 
	But re-regulation is to blame for another handicap: the proliferation of 
regional gasoline standards, complicating refining and logistic problems and 
frequently causing local shortages and prices spikes. 
	A single standard was never going to suffice in so large a country with, for 
instance, mile-high Denver requiring a less volatile fuel than low-lying 
Houston. 
	But states and cities have increasingly used the 1990 Clean Air Act and the 
replacement of lead in fuel to demand that the oil companies provide them 
with differing cocktails of gasoline and diesel to suit their environmental 
needs. The upshot is that the oil companies are now asked to provide more 
than 100 different fuels. 
	California, the north-east and the upper mid-west require gasoline 
reformulated to be more oxygenated and less smelly; Atlanta demands a lower 
sulphur and less evaporative fuel than the rest of Georgia; and garages in 
the two halves of the city of St Louis (because they are in two different 
states) have to sell different types of gasoline. 
	The standards are unenforceable in the sense that drivers cannot be confined 
to a certain zone simply by virtue of what they carry in their tank. But this 
has not lessened local authorities' enthusiasm for them. 
	In this area, as in that of electricity infrastructure, it is hard to see 
what the Bush administration can do to prevent such balkanisation without 
riding rough-shod over states' rights. 
	Equally difficult, but even more pressing is to forge a single electricity 
transmission network to carry the huge amounts of power that are being traded 
across the country by commodity energy brokers, such as Enron and Dynegy. The 
federal authorities have slender means at their disposal. 
	While it has sole authority over the natural gas trade and network, the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) has to share supervision of 
electricity trade with states which themselves have sole power to rule on the 
siting of power plants and lines. 
	Deregulation has made the latter task harder. In the days of local 
monopolies, people knew that at least a power plant - however ugly - in their 
backyard would be serving their needs. But in today's world of competitive 
long-distance power trading, the plant could be lighting, cooling or heating 
the other end of the country. 
	Nonetheless, Ferc realises it has to be more of a bully to preach the right 
model for US power, even if that means treading on state sensibilities. "We 
were overly deferential to California's rules and market design," says one 
Ferc official. 
	US companies hope President Bush will give them a freer run at foreign as 
well as domestic oil. The US has trade and investment bans on eight countries 
- of which Iraq, Iran and Libya are Opec members, and a fourth, Sudan, a 
growing oil producer. The upshot, according to Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, may be to reduce the production capacity of the three sanctioned 
Opec producers by 1.5-2m b/d. 
	That, in turn, makes the world market tighter than it would otherwise have 
been, to the obvious detriment of such a big oil importer as the US. 
	US companies clearly fret more at the unilateral sanctions on Iran and Libya 
than the multilateral United Nations embargo on Iraq, which also restricts 
their competitors. 
	It may also be time for the US to recognise not only how outdated the notion 
of energy independence at home is, but also the wisdom of cloaking its 
foreign energy policy in a more multilateral guise. 
	The Baker Institute-Council on Foreign Relations report suggests ways this 
might be done. 
	The US could take a less confrontational line towards Opec on prices, set 
Russia an example by signing the European energy charter treaty that governs 
energy trade and transit, and adopt a hemispheric approach to energy 
relations with Canada and Mexico. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited 



	SURVEY - ENERGY & UTILITY REVIEW: Move to build a stronger base on 
alternative cleaner power: ECONOMICS OF ENERGY SUPPLY: RENEWABLE POWER by 
Matthew Jones: Recent figures indicate that, up to 1999, there was more than 
13,000MW of installed windpower capacity around the world, the majority of 
which was in Europe and mainly in Germany, Denmark and Spain
	Financial Times, Apr 30, 2001
By MATTHEW JONES
	Earlier this year, Shea Homes, the tenth largest house builder in the US, 
struck a deal with solar cell manufacturer AstroPower to make solar power a 
standard feature in 100 new homes in San Diego, California. 
	With a shortage of electricity in California and rolling blackouts sweeping 
the state, Shea had spotted a market for environmentally friendly homes in 
which the owners could take control of their own power generation. 
	This relatively modest move, which Shea hopes to extend to a further 100 
homes in the next 18 months, is one indication of the way in which new energy 
technologies are becoming more mainstream. 
	In the US, Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia, manufacturers of solar 
cells, wind turbines, fuel cells and microturbines are reporting booming 
sales. AstroPower has already sold all of the cells it can make for this 
year. 
	Robin Batchelor, manager of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers' new energy 
technology fund, says the growth is being driven by environmental pressure to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and concerns about power quality and 
reliability from centralised generation systems in some parts of the world. 
	"The California power crisis has raised awareness of some of these 
technologies and, at the same time, has allowed manufacturers to demonstrate 
that they work. On top of this, many countries around the world are offering 
fiscal incentives to build green power plants and improvements in the 
technology are bringing the costs more into line with conventional power 
generation." 
	Windpower is leading the way so far. The most up-to-date industry figures 
show more than 13,000MW of installed capacity around the world at the end of 
1999. Of this, 70 per cent was installed in Europe - mainly in Germany, 
Denmark and Spain, 20 per cent in North America and the remaining 10 per cent 
largely in the Asia-Pacific region. 
	Photovoltaic, or solar, cells are further behind because of relatively higher 
equipment costs. About 520MW of capacity had been installed at the end of 
1999 in countries belonging to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development. 
	A recent report by Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the German banking group, 
forecasts that both wind and solar power generating capacity will grow by 25 
per cent a year in the next five years to 67,000MW and 4,600MW respectively. 
Longer term figures produced by Royal Dutch/Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group, 
show solar power overtaking wind in 2040 and becoming the world's overall 
largest source of electricity by 2050. 
	Fuel cells, which convert hydrogen to electricity, heat and water vapour 
through an electro-chemical reaction, are still at a relatively embryonic 
stage but are developing rapidly. Manufacturers, such as Ballard Power 
Systems of Canada and Fuel Cell Energy (FCE) of the US, have, in recent 
months, begun to make the transition from pilot projects to first commercial 
sales. 
	Ballard, which specialises in fuel cells for the transportation market, has 
signed an agreement to supply cells for 30 public buses in 10 European 
cities. FCE produces larger fuel cells for the stationary power market. It is 
expected this summer to win a contract to supply 12 fuel cells to Connecticut 
under an agreement with Enron, the US energy group. 
	The pace of deployment of fuel cells into the transport market is currently 
uncertain and will depend on the motor and oil industries agreeing what fuel 
to use as a source of hydrogen. The ideal solution is to use pure hydrogen 
gas, but oil companies argue that this requires a lot of storage capacity and 
would mean building a new fuel infrastructure around the world at vast 
expense. 
	Other solutions are being developed, including the use of methanol or 
ordinary petrol, from which hydrogen can be produced onboard the vehicle via 
a reformer. 
	Industry observers are more confident about the market for stationary fuel 
cells. According to a study published in March by Allied Business 
Intelligence, an independent US researcher, global electricity generating 
capacity from fuel cells will grow from just 75MW in 2001 to 15,000MW by 
2010. The countries expected to take the lead are the US, Germany and Japan. 
	Microturbines are seen as an intermediary step towards fuel cells, allowing 
efficient small-scale generation of electricity from a variety of more 
traditional fuels, including natural gas, propane, diesel, kerosene and 
methane-based gases sourced from landfill or wastewater sites. 
	Growth in sales has accelerated in the last year, driven, in large part, by 
the California energy crisis. Capstone, one of the leading manufacturers, saw 
its microturbine sales more than triple last year and has a backlog of orders 
for 2001. 
	Some in the energy industry believe the surge in the use of new energy 
technologies may now be under threat following the refusal by the US to 
ratify the Kyoto agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
	Recent policy statements by the new Bush administration indicate it is more 
focused on developing fossil fuels and solving the immediate energy shortages 
than increasing the use of alternative energy forms. 
	However, the European Union appears to be gathering enough support to push 
ahead with the agreement without the US. In spite of his stand against Kyoto, 
president Bush has also agreed to extend fiscal incentives for electricity 
generated from wind power and biomass for another three years, a move that 
has been greeted favourably by the markets.

BRAZIL: UPDATE 1-Petrobras to buy Enron stakes in Brazil gas firms

04/30/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
	RIO DE JANEIRO, April 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian state oil company Petrobras 
said on Monday it had signed a deal with U.S. energy giant Enron Corp to 
acquire Enron's stakes in two Rio de Janeiro natural gas distributors. 
	Petrobras said in a statement the agreement signed on Sunday in Houston 
called for Petrobras "along with other investors" to buy Enron's 25.38 
percent stake in Cia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro (CEG) that 
distributes gas in the city of Rio, and 33.75 percent in CEG-Rio that 
services the state.
	The deal is expected to close within 90 days, Petrobras said. 
	It did not provide the value of the deal, saying only that completion of the 
deal still depended on "certain conditions" and had to be approved by the 
authorities. 
	The market had expected Petrobras, jointly with its Petros pension fund, to 
pay up to $200 million for CEG stakes. Officials with none of the companies 
involved were available for comment. 
	Market sources have said that Petrobras was likely to split the acquired 
stakes evenly with Petros, to avoid technical nationalization of both CEG and 
CEG-Rio, privatized in 1997. 
	The government's BNDES development bank already has a 34.5 percent stake in 
CEG, while Petrobras' distribution arm BR Distribuidora owns 25 percent of 
CEG-Rio. 
	Spain's Gas Natural which has 18.89 in CEG and 25.12 percent in CEG-Rio 
operates both distributors. 
	Despite the sale of the two stakes, Enron, which is the world's largest 
marketer of electricity and natural gas, still has major gas holdings in 
Brazil via its subsidiary Gaspart, which controls gas distributors in seven 
Brazilian states, including rich southern states of Santa Catarina and 
Parana. 
	Local media has speculated the company is preparing to sell Gaspart, too. 
	Enron's recent global strategy of redirecting resources to its growing energy 
trading and bandwidth trading businesses, has been leading it away from some 
of the power generation and power and gas distribution businesses that 
constitute its Brazilian portfolio worth around $2 billion. 
	The deal between Petrobras and Enron may signal an improvement in relations 
between the two companies who in the past year have clashed over Enron's 
access to Petrobras-administrated Bolivia-Brazil natural gas pipeline.

Petrobras to Buy Enron's Stake in CEG, CEG-Rio Gas Distributors

Petrobras to Buy Enron's Stake in CEG, CEG-Rio Gas Distributors

     Rio de Janeiro, April 30 (Bloomberg) -- Petroleo Brasileiro
SA said it agreed to buy Enron Corp.'s stakes in Rio de Janeiro's
largest natural gas distributor, as Brazil's state-controlled oil
company seeks outlets to sell more gas where demand may surge.
     Petrobras said it, and other unnamed investors, reached an
agreement over the weekend to buy a 25.4 percent stake in CEG and
a 33.8 percent stake in its sister company CEG-Rio. Terms of the
transaction weren't given. Government officials earlier said the
acquisition was likely to be worth more than $200 million.
     The oil company plans to boost its stakes in gas distribution
as demand surges, led by increased use of gas in Rio's
metalworking industry and new thermo-electric generating plants
coming on line in the next half-decade. Enron seeks to concentrate
on power generation in Brazil. Petrobras estimated it will take 90
days for the transaction to be completed.
     Petrobras said earlier it wants to boost its stake in 13
different Brazilian gas distributors. It seeks outlets to sell
about 30 million cubic meters of gas that it plans to transport
daily through its $2 billion Bolivia-Brazil pipeline by 2005.
     CEG accounts for almost 17 percent of Brazil's natural gas
distribution market, analysts said. The distributor is operated by
Spain's No. 1 natural gas company, Gas Natural SDG SA, which owns
about 19 percent of CEG.

Brazil Petrobras Seen Paying $240M For CEG Stake

04/30/2001
Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
1901GMT
RIO DE JANEIRO (Dow Jones)--Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) will likely 
pay $240 million for the stake Enron Corp (ENE) owns in local gas distributor 
Companhia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro (E.CDR), or CEG, a Petrobras 
official close to the negotiation said Monday. 
Petrobras, as the federally-owned oil group is locally known, said early 
Monday it had singed an agreement with Enron to buy the 25.38% stake the U.S. 
energy group owns in CEG as well as the 33.75% stake Enron has in local unit 
CEG-Rio. 
"We still have 90 days to seal this acquisition, but the total amount will 
probably be $240 million if no more adjustments are made," the official said. 
Market observers had said Enron's interest in CEG carried a price tag of 
about $200 million. 
The acquisition is part of Petrobras' strategy to participate in gas 
distribution companies serving Brazil's most-industrialized states of Sao 
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, thus finding buyers for its 
natural-gas output. 
CEG serves the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area, and CEG-Rio supplies 
industrial towns in the greater Rio de Janeiro region and the interior of the 
state. 
Formerly a state-run company, CEG was privatized in 1997. Its shareholders 
are Spain's Gas Natural SDG SA (E.GSN) and Iberdrola SA (E.IBR), Argentina's 
Pluspetrol and Brazil's BNDESPar, the investment arm of the national 
development bank, BNDES. 
At 03:20 p.m. EDT (190 GMT), Petrobras preferred shares had slipped 0.8% to 
53.00 reals ($1=BRR2.2) in thin trade, while CEG's fell 3.1% to BRR9.50 after 
only two trades.

RIO DE JANEIRO --- State-owned oil concern Petroleo Brasileiro SA has agreed 
to acquire Enron Corp.'s stakes in Rio de Janeiro's largest natural gas 
distributor, Companhia Distribuidora de Gas do Rio de Janeiro, or CEG. 
Petrobras (PBR) said Monday that it will buy the 25.38% stake Enron (ENE) 
owns in CEG and the U.S. company's 33.75% stake in CEG's sister firm, CEG-Rio.
Petrobas, Brazil's largest company, didn't disclose the value of the deal. 
Market observers have said Enron's interest in CEG carries a price tag of 
about $200 million. 
CEG, formerly a state-run company, was privatized in 1997. Its shareholders 
are Spain's Gas Natural SDG SA and Iberdrola SA, Argentina's Pluspetrol and 
Brazil's BNDESPar, the investment arm of the national development bank, 
BNDES. 
Petrobras officials had already shown interest in a stake in CEG, which 
serves the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area, and CEG-Rio, which supplies 
industrial towns in the greater Rio de Janeiro region and the interior of the 
state. 
Delcidio do Amaral Gomez, energy and gas director at Petrobas, said earlier 
this year that the interest in CEG was part of the group's strategy to 
participate in gas distribution companies serving Brazil's 
most-industrialized states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.

Foreign bids for Saudi gas projects passed on to Fahd's petroleum council

04/30/2001
Agence France-Presse 
(Copyright 2001) 
RIYADH, April 30 (AFP) - Bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three Saudi gas 
projects worth tens of billions of dollars have been referred to the Supreme 
Petroleum Council (SPC) headed by King Fahd, a newspaper reported Monday. 
A committee that has been negotiating the offers with the companies passed on 
the bids along with detailed recommendations for the council to make a final 
decision, Al-Iqtissadiya business daily said.
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The three gas projects are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in 
the kingdom's Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter of southeast 
Saudi Arabia, and the northern Red Sea. 
They cover an area of 440,000 square kilometers (176,000 square miles), 
making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
Oil Minister Ali al-Nuaimi said in mid-April that the study of the bids was 
still in its preliminary stages, but foreign oil executives expected a 
decision with a few weeks. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conoco, 
ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi 
projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch 
Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The projects involve gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical 
industries and power and water desalination plants. 
Al-Iqtissadiya said a number of bids had been excluded by the negotiating 
committee, but at least half of the companies would be picked. 
The projects are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to 
three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, the 
newspaper said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
This will boost supplies for industrial use to Riyadh, eastern and western 
regions. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres). 




UK: FACTBOX-LME membership changes over last 15 years

04/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas said on Monday it had 
become a member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's largest 
non-ferrous metals market. 
Paribas said that its subsidiary BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Ltd had had 
been accepted as an LME Associate Broker Clearing Member (ABCM). It bought 
250,000 shares in LME Holdings, the company created when the LME demutualised 
in 2000.
BNP's membership takes the number of ABCMs up to 25. These firms are the 
second tier of LME membership - ABCMs have all the rights and privileges of 
LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. 
There are 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs), who alone are entitled to trade on 
the open-outcry floor. 
The following chronology details the notable changes on the LME since the 
high water-mark of the mid-1980s, when there were around 30 firms trading on 
the exchange floor. 
APRIL 2001 - ING Baring Futures & Options (UK) Ltd relinquishes its ABCM 
membership. 
JANUARY 2001 - Brandeis (Brokers) Limited relinquishishes ABCM status, 
selling its 2.5 percent equity stake to fellow RDM Metdist. 
OCTOBER 2000 - Natexis Banques Populaires buys 80 percent of Sogemin Metals 
Ltd from Belgian metals producer Union Miniere. 
JULY 2000 - Ring dealer Enron Metals Ltd (formerly known as MG Plc) buys 
fellow ring dealer Rudolf Wolff Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian 
metals producer Noranda Inc , for six million pounds. Wolff was one of the 
founding members of the 123-year old LME. 
JUNE 2000 - Ring dealer Sogemin Metals Ltd announces it is in talks over a 
link-up with France's Natexis Banques Populaires. 
MAY 2000 - MG agrees to a 300 pence per share cash offer from U.S. energy and 
communications group Enron. EnronOnline trades around 840 products in some 13 
countries in 11 currencies. 
APRIL 2000 - Brandeis (Brokers) Ltd leaves the floor to become an associate 
member. 
JANUARY 2000 - Standard Bank London, part of Standard Bank of South Africa 
buys most of the trading accounts and customer positions of ring-trader 
Brandeis from Pechiney . 
OCTOBER 1998 - Metallgesellschaft purchases ring dealer Billiton Metals Ltd, 
trading arm of producer Billiton . Billiton ceases to be a ring trader. 
APRIL 1998 - ED & F Man purchases the brokerage accounts and assets of Gerald 
Metals, and assumes its ring-dealing status. 
SEPTEMBER 1997 - Bank of Nova Scotia purchases ring dealer Mocatta. Company 
changes name to ScotiaMocatta. 
JUNE 1997 - Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, part of Deutsche Bank AG , withdraws 
from the floor. It is hit by worsening trade conditions in the wake of the 
copper crisis. 
NOVEMBER 1996 - Lehman Brothers Commodities, the trading arm of Lehman Bros 
Holdings Inc , withdraws from the floor. Trading conditions hurt after the 
July copper crisis, when Japanese brokerage Sumitomo Corp announces losses of 
$2.6 billion run up in 10 years of unauthorised trading by head trader Yasuo 
Hamanaka. 
SEPTEMBER 1996 - Fimat Metals, a subsidiary of Fimat International Banque, 
buys ring dealer Brody White. 
NOVEMBER 1994 - Ring trader Metdist buys fellow ring trader Metchim, which 
withdraws from the floor. 
MAY 1994 - Sucden UK, a subsidiary of French commodity trader Sucres et 
Denrees, wins ring dealer status. 
NOVEMBER 1992 - Credit Lyonnais Rouse, a subsidiary of French bank Credit 
Lyonnais , is elected as a ring-dealer. 
OCTOBER 1992 - Metallgesellschaft buys ring dealer Charles Davis from Glynwed 
International. Charles Davis leaves the ring. 
JANUARY 1991 - Metchim Ltd, part of European copper refiner Hofibel, is 
elected as a ring dealer. 
OCTOBER 1990 - Barclays Bank buys LME ring dealer Deak International from New 
Zealand-based Jarden Morgan. It will trade on ring as Barclays Metals. Deak 
itself had bought the ring operation from Johnson Matthey Bankers in the 
mid-1980s. 
SEPTEMBER 1990 - Entores, part of the Minemet Group, withdraws from the ring. 
Cost pressures cited. 
FEBRUARY 1990 - Drexel Burnham Lambert ceases to be a ring trader when parent 
company goes bankrupt after junk bond crisis. 
LATE 1980s - Metallgesellschaft purchases ring dealer and warehouser Henry 
Bath and Co. 
OCTOBER 1985 onwards - During this period Lazmet, Anglo Chemical, Philip and 
Lion, Cominco, J.H. Raynor, Lonconex and Continental Ore relinquish ring 
dealer status in wake of 1985 tin crisis, when International Tin Council 
defaulted on LME to the tune of some 800 million pounds.

Follow-up announcement Media release: Billion dollar magnesium industry dawns 
GOLDEN TRIANGLE RESOURCES NL 2001-04-30 ASX-SIGNAL-G
HOMEX - Melbourne 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++ MEDIA RELEASE CONTINUED 
3. WOODSREEF REFINERY PROJECT AND ASSOCIATED THIRD PARTY POWER STATION 
The Board is well aware that a major factor limiting the growth of the 
magnesium market has been attitudes of users, competing products such as 
plastics and other metals and the lack of a large sustainable quality supply. 
Environmental imperatives and the need to reduce fuel usage globally is 
deemed to be the strongest imperative as evidenced by Ford's extension of the 
contract for take out with AMC. 
If we are to aspire to become a major supplier of value added products, then 
we must have our own independent source of supply and be able to guarantee 
its quality and continuity. 
Underpinning our offer of strategic reliability, cost and quality regimes, is 
the Company's parallel strategy to offer additional long-term security of 
supply for companies that choose to work with us. 
GTL's wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Magnesium Pty Ltd, plans to build a 
magnesium refinery in northern New South Wales, Australia and is now engaged 
in initial elements of the definitive and bankable stages of feasibility. The 
cost of this activity is estimated at $25M. 
It has been the practice of the Board to seek to raise funds as needed to 
meet set goals. 
We have sufficient funds available, to continue with our R&D program and 
refinery evaluation work (having just completed a site evaluation study) and 
we are in the process of creating a feedstock protocol. 
It is apparent to us that the development of the alloying technology has more 
immediate prospects for revenue generation and alliance participation when 
compared to the longer lead time, and costs, for the apparatus pilot and the 
refinery bankable feasibility, design and construction. 
A key driver in our strategic positioning is our environmental advantage and 
we are informing governments, industry and commerce across of the globe of 
this, now. 
Using serpentinite as the feedstock, this production facility would be 
designed to capture the "green environmental label" since, unlike magnesite, 
there is "no carbon dioxide" in our feedstock. 
Additionally the Company will undertake no mining to gain access to it's 
feedstock unlike the magnesite mines in Queensland, Northern Territory, South 
Australia and Tasmania. 
GTL also proposes to remove and neutralise environmentally harmful tailings 
that are currently the responsibility of the NSW government. This will 
potentially save the taxpayers millions of dollars. 
This refinery, once completed, has the potential to provide, from its planned 
completion date in 2006 and beyond, security of supply of high quality metal 
and alloys. If the apparatus is ready we propose to use it. 
AN OFFER TO GOVERNMENT TO CO-JOINTLY DEVELOP THE VALUE ADDING TECHNOLOGIES IN 
AUSTRALIA 
GTL has made an offer to the Federal, Victorian and NSW governments seeking 
their interest in establishing an R&D laboratory here in Australia to focus 
on the alloying and the electrolyser research and development and 
commercialisation. 
The necessary prototypes could be built here in association with industry, 
government and academia from a major university working with our research 
venture at Bell Gurion University in Israel. The proposed activities could 
include design, construction and testing of: 
* multifunctional technological plants for the production of magnesium and 
its alloys; 
* electrical furnaces for the production of magnesium alloys, with components 
of highly different densities including alloys with special characteristics; 
* facilities for the continuous casting of thin sheets or bands of magnesium 
alloys. 
A THIRD PARTY POWER STATION 
We have all seen the debate on the critical state of energy supply here in 
Australia and recently in the USA. The price and availability of reliable 
energy is critical to our proposal. 
There is no power station near Woodsreef. There is a low-level availability 
to Barraba. We have held extensive discussions with suppliers, governments 
(State and Federal) and with industry experts. 
The refinery requires an electricity supply of between 140MW and 200MW base 
load and the Board has determined that experienced energy corporations will 
be invited to propose a "build, own and operate" scenario with GTR as the 
base contract. Any surplus would be offered in the growing Australian 
national electricity market. Local businesses and local government shires in 
the region have been canvassed with a view to creating a supply regime. 
GTR has received a written offer from Enron Australia, one of the world's 
largest energy traders and producers, to act as the trader of both 
electricity and a magnesium metal hedge. We have had positive discussions on 
this and will move towards a more defined outcome as a part of our planned 
bankable feasibility study. 
TARGETED REVENUE STREAMS 
At this early stage of assessment and given the immaturity of the current 
global market, unknown growth cycle and competitive response from plastics 
and other substitutes, it is very difficult to assess the revenue streams and 
associated costs. We are, therefore, refraining from making definitive 
claims. Our assembled investigation and discussions with industry 
participants indicates a potential revenue stream in the hundreds of millions 
of dollars per annum. 
In support of this we have focused on the history of the aluminium industry 
as a major pointer of the possible future values. Magnesium metal and its 
alloying properties indicate a high potential for application in the industry 
sectors described in the opening paragraphs of this document. This coupled 
with the impetus of environmental regulatory frameworks across the globe 
demanding reductions in weight and greenhouse emissions, underlies our 
confidence in GTL's vision outlined above. 
Published material including that of the Light Metals Action Agenda 
(background paper on aluminium, magnesium and titanium issues) published by 
the Department of Industry, Science and Resources of the Australian 
Government, values the revenue generation for the Australian aluminium 
industry at over AUD $9 billion annually. Among other things this publication 
says: 
"the (magnesium) industry is at a stage of development where key players are 
represented by a number of magnesium metal projects ... as with aluminium end 
users are likely to become key players as increased demand for light metals 
drives growth." (Nov, 2000:3). 
Further the publication says, 
"according to one analyst rising demand for light weight automotive 
components could see world magnesium production increase from its current 
level of 450 thousand tonnes to 1 million tonnes by 2010." (Nov, 2000:6).

magnesium proponent:

Reason for Report: What's Happening This Week In Utilities

Issue To Watch: Puhca Repeal
o    Tuesday's decision by the US Senate's Banking Committee to repeal.

o    PUHCA is the first stage in a lengthy process, which could take well into
the autumn or longer to complete.

o    The political commitment to change is much stronger than previously - the
Committee voted 19-1, underlining the bi-partisan support. The risks lie in 
the
repeal legislation getting bogged down, especially with measures designed to
resolve the California supply crisis.

o    The Public Utilities Holding Companies Act dates back to 1935, and has
been the utility industry's equivalent of Glass-Stegall in imposing rigorous
restrictions on corporate activity involving US utilities.

o    PUHCA's narrow definition of a utility has acted as a deterrent. Even
water utility assets are classified as non-utility in its criteria of fit and
proper ownership of US electric and gas utilities. Thus Scottish Power's entry
into the USA was via the non-PUHCA registered PacifiCorp. Now it's being 
linked
with Enron's Portland General.

o    Indeed, E.on has clearly stated that PUHCA has increasingly shaped its
attitude towards investing in European water assets. In particular, it's
waiting with interest to see how Scottish Power's petition fares.

The Week Past:

Scottish Power - PacifiCorp Incentives

PacifiCorp has asked regulators for permission to reward residential customers
who reduce their use of electricity by 20% over last summer's levels. 
Customers
supplied by Pacific Power and Utah Power in Utah, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming
and Idaho would receive a 20% credit on their next four quarterly bills for
each month they reduce electricity use by 20% or more. PacifiCorp is seeking 
to
minimise the extent to which it has to satisfy peak requirements by purchasing
in the wholesale market.

Suez - Raising Cash At Vinci

On Tuesday, Suez sold 16% of Vinci at an average price of e63 per share. A
total of 9.5m shares were sold through a private placement and 3m more shares
via an exchangeable bond. Thus Suez raised ce780m. It now holds just 1% of
Vinci and thus abandons its position as core shareholder. This move was
expected (Suez had already stated that it did not regard the stake as
strategic), although it has come sooner than we anticipated.

Verbund - Better Trading But Strategy Deficit

With a 5% increase to e77.6m Verbund reported Q1 EBIT above ML expectations
(e76m); cost savings were the key - particularly in personnel (-13%) and other
operating expense (-28%). However, the sharp improvement in the finance costs
(e21m vs e52m) appears to be in large part due to an accounting restatement of
foreign currency-denominated liabilities.

Whilst it's no longer possible to follow the underlying end customer pricing
developments based on the data Verbund provides, it's clear that, so far, the
ever-increasing proportion of trading is having little beneficial impact on
EBIT. Electricity sales revenues rose e62m, whereas electricity market
purchases rose e88m year-on-year.

The Week In Prospect:

Dwr Cymru - The Final Hurdle

Financing of the Glas Cymru bid closes on Wednesday 2(**nd). All the
indications are that the multi-tranche exercise has gone well, notwithstanding
the recent move upwards in bond yields. Once the full terms are known we
believe it will be clear that East Surrey's early March L100m index linked 
long
dated bond was very opportunely timed - its terms are likely unrepeatable.

Completion of both the outsourcing in late March (principally to United
Utilities) and now the financing should enable quick closure of the L1.8bn
purchase of Dwr Cymru from WPD.

London Underground - A Green Light?

Having been pulled this way and that by the politicians, the consortia bidding
to maintain the London Underground are hopeful that this week's promised
decision will materialise. awg is a member of LINC and RWE has inherited 
Thames
Water's position in Metronet. Final bids were submitted before Christmas. Each
contract will be worth cL100m pa.

The political wrangling led to the DETR conceding in February more fundamental
changes, including London Underground's greater involvement. Now with the
formal General Election campaign expected within 10 days, the DETR is very 
keen
to deliver its London Underground promises. However, with the Mayor's legal
challenge still to be resolved, the target 1(**st) July start date looks
increasingly improbable.

Powergen - Discount Appropriate

First quarter figures, due on Thursday 3(**rd), have been made less important
by the agreed bid from E.on. There are no comparable figures for 2000, but we
anticipate recently acquired LG&E to contribute L85m out of forecast pre-
goodwill pre-tax profits of L123m. A first quarterly dividend of 9.05p (25% of
the 2000 total) is looked for; this would be covered by 17.5p of earnings
(again pre-goodwill). Given that the E.on deal could take a year or more to
complete (even if PUHCA is repealed) we think the current 7%/50p discount to
the 763p NPV of the bid and Powergen's 2000 dividends is appropriate.

Scottish Power - Annus Horribilis

On Thursday 3(**rd), we expect pretax profits before goodwill and exceptionals
to be 16% lower at L620m. On the same basis, EPS are expected to have fallen 
by
32% to 28.1p - although this will have been exaggerated by early adoption of
FRS19 on deferred accounting. An unchanged quarterly dividend of 6.51p would
give full year DPS of 26.04p.

Rising electricity prices in the Western US states, exacerbated by a failure 
at
a power plant in Utah made a sizeable dent in Scottish Power's profits. The
problems at 51% owned telecom subsidiary Thus (both profitability and share
price performance) have not helped, and the abandonment of the JV with Royal
Bank of Scotland has hit sentiment.

Thursday's announcement will also focus attention on Scottish Power's future
corporate profile. What conclusions have been reached in the strategic review
of Southern Water? Is its sale - quite possibly to Enel for close to L2bn - a
precursor to a $3bn move for Oregon-based Portland General?

Last week long term sale negotiations between Enron, owner of this PacifiCorp
neighbour, and Sierra Pacific broke down, but we believe Portland General's
short power position would increase rather than decrease the company's risk
profile.

With these uncertainties, and the Californian situation set to remain a drag 
on
profits for some time, the shares are likely to be held back.

Vivendi Environnement - 1Q Data

Even though 63% shareholder Vivendi Universal has already released 1Q data,
Vivendi Environnement's 1Q isn't due until the end of the week or even Monday
next. For the three months to end March we look for sales of e6.45bn and 
EBITDA
of e0.85bn.

There will have been further benefit on consolidation from e weakness; 1Q e/$
was 8% more favourable than a year earlier. So far, the US operations do not
appear to be affected overall by the economic slowdown: the water business has
benefited from a surge in demand from the oil & power industries, which has
offset slack demand from steel and forest products.
