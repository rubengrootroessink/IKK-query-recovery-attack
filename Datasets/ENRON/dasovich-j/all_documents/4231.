In order to have Davis' policy director get excited about this, I think we 
need to:

1.)  Make it a  Cisco/Enron/Powertek proposal.
2.)  Talk up the environmental and reliability values.

I think we need to present this as the "greatest thing for the environment 
since sliced bread" approach as well as giving Davis a platform to 
pontificate on how he is "inventing" clean generation for California.

Call me on my cell to discuss.  925-200-2358.

Doug, take a look at this.  I did it this weekend, but after looking at what 
our consultant wanted for Wed. I might need to make adjustments to it.  Any 
thoughts big marketing guy?
