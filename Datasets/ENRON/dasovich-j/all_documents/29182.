Please use the following instructions for the four Outlook emails.

1-URGENT: Please read (Do not delete emails, because of the lawsuit)
2-URGENT: Please read
3-URGENT: Click the Save My Data button
4- URGENT: Please read, but you do not have to fill in this info (All this 
info has already been submitted to Wilma Bleshman, 
                          who will be here next week for our conversions) 


Important Note:  Due to the lawsuit we should not be deleting any emails.  
When our lotus notes are transferred to outlook we will still 
                                             have access to read all of our 
old notes.  Eventually notes will go away, but because of the lawsuit nothing 
can be deleted
               until a later date.  Also, I know everyone has concerns about 
the size restriction, and purge process in outlook.  (Please remain
               calm; breath in through the nose, out through the mouth.)  
Until the lawsuit is cleared up the SF office will not be bound by Enron's
               Outlook rules.  However, there will come a day when we will 
have to adhere to the policies.  

Extra Cool Note: In outlook you can save an entire email, headings & 
attachments too, as a word document.  It is very, very exciting.  This will 
be the 
                                              feature that helps us keep our 
in-boxes, and outlook folders fairly empty.  I will show everyone how easy it 
is once we have been
                                              completely converted. 

 
I think everyone is going to like outlook.  Please give it a chance.  I 
promise Wilma and I will address all of your concerns.

Thanks,
April Hrach
