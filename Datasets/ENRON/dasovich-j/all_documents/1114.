Jessie Knight, the CEO of the S.D. Chamber of Commerce recommends:

Stay at the hotel right here where the Chamber is located.  It is one
of the best and a 5 minute taxi away for you.  It is called the Whyndham (on
Broadway).

Steve Kean will be in San Diego for the electricity hearing on the 11th.  Can 
either of you suggest a hotel in close proximity to the hearing site?  It 
will be held at the County Adminstration Center Building, 1600 Pacific 
Highway in San Diego.  Thanks.
