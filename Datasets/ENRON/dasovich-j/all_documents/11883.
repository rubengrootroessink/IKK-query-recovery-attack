I just heard from Matt Back in Assemblyman John Campbell's office.  Ken has 
an appointment at 2:00 - 3:00 following the meeting with Hertzberg.  

Jim Brulte is scheduled at 10:30  that morning, but they would only give me 
30 minutes.  I am trying to schedule John Burton at 11:00 as they will be in 
the same building.  I have left another message for David Cox's scheduler.

Governor Davis' office was incredulous that no one from Enron was attending 
his meeting.  But, she said she would call me back to try to schedule 
something.
