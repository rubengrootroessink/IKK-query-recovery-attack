=09=09Dear Economist.com reader
=09=09
=09=09Economist.com's Country Briefings is the essential insider's tool for=
=20
researching  countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the world's=
=20
leading provider  of country analysis, and The Economist have teamed up to=
=20
create a service  which is:

orld's=20
GDP. For each country we have  brought together succinct forecasts, economi=
c=20
and political profiles, core statistics,  essential recent articles and=20
in-depth surveys from The Economist. We also  bring you headlines from arou=
nd=20
the web and links to relevant websites. If you  could only use one countrie=
