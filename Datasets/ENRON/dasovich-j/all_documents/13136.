U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

Technology shares continued to bear the brunt of investor scorn
after a duo of technology downgrades from investment bank Goldman
Sachs smacked the tech sector. The NASDAQ consolidated its
initial losses at the low end of its intraday range before
heading down again. Sectors under-performing read like a who's
who of technology with software makers, networkers, storage and
semiconductor manufacturers all under-performing. Defensive areas
such as chemicals, metals and papers were outperforming.
Elsewhere, the Dow continued to resist the downdraft and held in
the green, though the selloff in the tech index dropped the Dow
off higher levels. By midday, the Dow hovered just to the plus
side of unchanged while the NASDAQ skidded 2.7% and the S&P 500
lost 0.6%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY

The bond moved off its highs of the session by midday in a mild
bout of profit-taking. Economic data released earlier in the
session supported the view that another weak employment report is
coming on Friday. Not only did the bond get a boost on the
anticipation of further evidence of economic weakness, but the
contract benefited from the view that the door remains open for
further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Indeed, despite
profit-taking, the long bond was outperforming the shorter-dated
issues, which were slightly in the red by midday.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The euro has stabilized around the 0.854 dollar per euro level
after dropping sharply overnight. Ongoing concerns that rising
inflation and slowing growth will hamstring the European Central
Bank have pulled the euro lower in recent weeks. After
strengthening overnight and this morning, the yen has settled
around the 120 yen per dollar level.
