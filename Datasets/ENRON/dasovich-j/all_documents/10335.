Jeff's phone interview next Wednesday, and these are what he sent -- gives 
you an idea of where he's headed...  Let's talk about any concerns you may 
have, and we can certainly prep Jeff for this one.  thx. kd

Here's the gist of my questions: 
??????? - You were opposing the "Poolco" model of deregulation as far back as 
June 94, when you testified at a PUC hearing in LA. Why do you think you 
weren't able to convince them? Do you think, as Nymex's Bob Levin believes, 
that their minds were already made up?

??????? - Enron is this big influential company, on the cutting edge of 
energy deregulation; why weren't you able to get California to go along with 
your idea of direct access?

??????? - In some of Enron's testimony, the company was warning that the 
Poolco was ripe for manipulation by the investor-owned utilities. In 
retrospect, given the utilities' financial state, that's clearly not the 
case. But explain what your company was thinking at the time.

??????? - Did Enron get PG&E to accept the big Edison-sponsored memorandum of 
understanding in fall 95? Steve Peace says so.

??????? - I'm told that Enron was among those pushing for divestiture of 
plants by the IOUs. Why didn't you then buy any of them?

??????? - Did Enron lose the debate (over poolco vs. direct access) but end 
up winning anyway, because it did fairly well in the direct retail market, 
and made money trading in the wholesale market in California?

???????  
??????? I have a few more, but that should get us started. 
??????? Thanks.

I'll place the call from Skilling's office.? Do you have specific questions 
I can pass along to Jeff ahead of time?? It's probably a good idea since 
you'll be talking about events 8 years ago, and he'll need some time to 
think about it.? thx. kd
