If you had not seen this, it looks like the utilities are now trying to 
"help" FERC find the guilty.  

What do people thin about beginning to quietly discuss with members of the 
California state house that the damages of the summer are not (or don't need 
to) being charged to end use customers.  The utilities are doing a really 
good job of wrapping themselves with little households.  In fact, TURN signed 
on to this pleading.

While San Diego customers are harmed, other consumers in California are just 
fine.  Utility shareholders are taking it on the chin.  We need to make sure 
that policymakers (especially FERC) recognize that in making any kind of 
refund the real choice is between Power Marketer shareholders and Utility 
shareholders.

Mary and Jim:

Did you see in the PG&E/SCE filing that the two companies have kindly
volunteered (p. 32) to "assist the Commission in developing a full record
and in undertaking the rigorous analysis needed to fix the problems in the
California markets and determine refund responsibility". How kind and
public-spirited of them. More seriously, I would expect that they already
have a full economic analysis going on prices, damages, etc.
