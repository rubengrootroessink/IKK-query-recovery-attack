Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction
?
An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania=
 =20
Public Utility Commission (PUC) over which company has won the right to=20
provide  default generation service to 300,000 customers of PECO Energy, an=
=20
Exelon  Company. This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is t=
he=20
fruit of  the 1998 PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement, a landma=
rk=20
document  that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed=
=20
it.=20
?
The =01&peace treaty=018 includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out de=
fault =20
service for 20% of its customers, and PECO has done so. Green Mountain=20
Energy  Company is now challenging PECO Energy=01,s decision that New Power=
 won=20
the auction  to provide the settlement=01,s mandated default service.=20
?
Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those 300,000 consumers  sma=
ll=20
rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO, =
=20
and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources.=20
Specifically,  New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service=
=20
to Rate R  residential customers for approximately 5.54 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. That offer  is 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour less than PECO=
=20
Energy=01,s unbundled generation and  transmission rate of 8.65 cents per=
=20
kilowatt-hour and 0.11 cents per  kilowatt-hour less than the shopping cred=
it=20
of 5.65.=20
?
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by  t=
he=20
stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy. Indeed, were it=
 =20
not for stranded cost payments, the New Power and Green Mountain offers=20
would  reduce total bills by about 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 20%.=20
?
The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it =
=20
proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if=
 =20
shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels. It=
=20
also  shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met=20
economically.  Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers =
to=20
competitive  suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in=20
California over a  period of nearly three years.=20
?
When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner, if all =20
299,300 consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider, the total number of =
=20
customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier wil=
l =20
jump to more than 850,000. Of this total, 504,000 will be residential=20
customers  of PECO, a number equal to 37% of the PECO residential class.
?
CDS Background: In Pennsylvania, there must always be a =01&default=018 sup=
plier =20
or =01&provider of last resort=018 to assure that service is always availab=
le to=20
all  customers. The incumbent utility is the default supplier, unless the P=
UC=20
decides  otherwise. The default supplier must provide generation service to=
=20
customers who  do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose=
=20
not to shop or did  not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price. The=
=20
PECO Restructuring Case  Settlement initially defined CDS service in=20
paragraph 38:
?
=01&On January 1, 2001, 20% of all of PECO=01,s residential customers -- =
=20

=20
customers, and without regard to whether such customers are obtaining=20
generation  service from an EGS -- shall be assigned to a provider of last=
=20

=20
of a  Commission-approved energy and capacity market price bidding process.=
=20
This  service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service (=01&CDS=
=018).=018
?
The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS=
 =20
restructuring cases. CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at leas=
t=20
one  other large competitor in each market. CDS also has a renewable=20
portfolio  standard (RPS), even though there is no RPS for regulated=20
utilities in  Pennsylvania. The winning bidder must supply:=20
?
=01&=01(2.0% of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable  r=
esources=20

=20
incineration of Municipal Solid Waste), geothermal or ocean power. The =20
renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of 0.5% =20
thereafter.=018
?
This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely, meaning that =
=20
in year four of the CDS there will be a 3.5% renewable requirement, 4% in=
=20
year  five and so on. This is significant, as each extra percent of renewab=
le=20

fossil fuel  burning power plants.
?
PECO=01,s CDS RFP: Importantly, the PECO/Unicom merger case modified the CD=
S =20
bidding process as established by the 1998 settlement. Of particular note,=
=20
the  revisions eliminated the =01&customer care=018 functions from CDS, mad=
e the=20

=20
instituted  several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts=20
yielded no  successful CDS contract.=20
?
PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April 6, 2000, and Shell Energy =20
Services submitted the only bid. However, the PUC rejected the bid as =20
non-conforming and denied Shell=01,s Petition for Reconsideration of its=20
decision.  Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement, PECO=20
entered into  bilateral negotiations based on an August 24, 2000 RFP.=20
?
Three suppliers submitted conforming bids, and PECO selected New Power as =
=20
the winner on October 18, 2000. New Power is the new competitive supplier =
=20
actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO =
=20
service territory and is backed by Enron, AOL, and IBM.=20
?
PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC  f=
or=20
approval on November 9, 2000. Under the proposal, PECO and New Power =20
expanded the size of the CDS requirement to include 22% (299,300) of =20
non-shopping residential customers instead of 20% of all residential=20
customers,  whether shopping or not. This change was designed to implement=
=20
paragraph 39 of  the Restructuring Settlement, requiring adjustments to the=
=20
numbers assigned to  CDS in order to have 35% of all PECO residential and=
=20
commercial customers  obtaining competitive generation as of January 1, 200=
1.=20
There also will be a  second round of assignment of non-shopping customers =
as=20
of October 15, 2002 if  New Power is providing CDS to fewer than 20% of all=
=20
PECO residential  customers
?
New Power electricity will be 2% renewable in 2001, 2.5% renewable in 2002,=
 =20
and 3% renewable in 2003 as required, but does not include a commitment to =
=20
exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the non-renewable=20
portion  of the product.=20
?
The price for New Power=01,s CDS for Rate R customers would be 2.02% below =
the =20
shopping credit, while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay=
=20
1.02%  less than their shopping credit. For a Rate R customer, this would=
=20
mean that  overall rates would fall .8% (as energy and transmission falls=
=20
from 5.65 to  5.54); for Rate RH rates would fall .44%. Customers assigned =
to=20
CDS may still  choose any competitive supplier, or opt out and retain defau=
lt=20
service from PECO  without penalty or charge. New Power will be able to off=

?
Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECO/New Power contract is =01&=
not =20
in the public interest,=018 arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountain=01,s o=
ffer=20
that  included CDS pricing 2% below the shopping credit for all residential=
=20
customers,  including those on residential heating or off-peak service. Lik=
e=20
the New Power  proposal, the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and=
=20
RH rates .8% and  .44%, respectively. Green Mountain asserts that the New=
=20
Power rate cut for Rate  R is only 1.83%, and not 2% and argues that its=20
product is better for the  environment because the non-renewable portion of=
=20
the product would come from  natural gas and hydro instead of system power=
=20
generated primarily from coal and  nuclear fuels. If not declared the winni=
ng=20
bidder, Green Mountain proposes in  the alternative that both they and New=
=20
Power receive CDS contracts.
?
In response, PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to =20
submit revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not=20
submitted  until October 12, 2000, 13 days after the deadline and nine days=
=20
after the  selection of New Power as the winning bidder.=20

The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November 9. Some think  th=
