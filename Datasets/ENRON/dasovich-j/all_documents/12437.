Here's the email address that Steve meant to send to you.           
emoses@mayor.lacity.org

 I also attached what Steve sent to him.   Steve said to mention that he took 
out the part about "here's what the skeptics would say and here's what to 
say".

I will also copy you on Karen Denne's email.
