Dear Economist.com Reader,

The world is moving faster and so are we.

Economist.com is delighted to introduce a major new feature --
Global Agenda. For the first time in its 157-year history, The
Economist is able to offer you analysis of the most important
issues and events every day.

Global Agenda, located in the centre of Economist.com=01,s home
page (http://www.economist.com), complements The Economist
magazine by providing timely updates as major issues and events
unfold.

Global Agenda provides rolling coverage and analysis on six to
eight of the most important business and political topics each
day. A dedicated staff of Economist writers selects topics of
international significance to provide up-to-date and concise
analysis of how these events are affecting industry, governments
and individuals around the world.

This content is available only on Economist.com. The full-length
text of each story, along with pictures and charts, is available
by clicking on the link. The article is accompanied by links to
related Economist stories and relevant newswires and websites.
As world events and priorities change, articles will be updated
and new articles will appear. You can tell that a story has been
updated or changed by looking at the date following it. Major
changes to stories or new stories are noted in red.

As always, the entire print edition of The Economist
(http://www.economist.com/printedition)  and our weekly
e-mailings (http://www.economist.com/members/registration) are
still available online at midnight GMT every Thursday.

If you have any comments or feedback regarding the changes to
our website, or any suggestions for future development, please
contact us on dotcommarketing@Economist.com.

Thank you,

Andrew Rashbass
Managing Director, Economist.com
