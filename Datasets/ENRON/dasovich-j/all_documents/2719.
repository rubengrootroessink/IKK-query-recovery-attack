Subject: CAISO Notice - ISO response to CPUC and AG subpoenas in the inves 
tigations of the wholesale electric market and impacts on retail rates


To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

Attached please find a letter from the California Attorney General (AG)
indicating the confidential treatment that will be provided for confidential
data produced by the CA ISO in response to the AG subpoena (circulated to
Market Participants on October 6 and attached herein for your convenience).

Further, the CA ISO is in receipt of an interim order from the California
Public Utilities Commission in its OII 00-08-002, providing for additional
protection for confidential information, including information subject to
the subpoena issued to the CA ISO (circulated to Market Participants on
September 25 and attached herein for your convenience).

Finally, the EOB has requested copies of the ISO operator logs and morning
reports that are responsive to the CPUC subpoena.  These documents would be
subject to the agreement as to confidentiality for confidential information
produced to the EOB that was arrived at this summer (see letter circulated
to Market Participants on September 25 and attached herein for your
convenience)

The CA ISO will proceed with production in response to the AG and CPUC
subpoenas (and provision of responsive logs and morning reports to the EOB)
unless we are informed, no later than noon on Monday October 30, by a Market
Participant that it is taking formal action to seek further protection for
confidential material from the CPUC, the AG or the EOB.
