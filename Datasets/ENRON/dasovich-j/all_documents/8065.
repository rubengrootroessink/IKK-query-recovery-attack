3rd set of suggestions

We have missed the opportunity to make our points to i) share existing 
generation, ii) treat all customers the same

Could we include the following:
Customers are continuously making decision related to who should provide them 
with service and whether they should relocate in California.
The current uncertainty around solvency of utilities and market price 
exposure makes it difficult for customers to plan for the future.
Governor Davis is committed to:
No customer will incur rate increases above 10%.
All customers will have access to utility owned generation.
All customers, whether they be served by the utility or other supplier will 
have equal opportunity to this commitment. 
AB1890 will continue in place until the end of 2001, until and if some other 
better plan is put in place.

We are also missing the opportunity to suggest auctioning of default 
provider.:
The California Public Utility Commission, should immediately seek bids, in 
the form of bids to take on portions of customers, to be selected on a random 
basis, for standard offer, with commitments that such rates will not increase 
by more than 10% and will be available to all customers without notice or 
penalty.

2nd Comments:

 We are missing in Increasing Supply section
running of existing older generation combined with mitigating reductions in 
emissions.  
missing Concrete suggestions: 
California Energy Commission sponsored process to determine and implement 
actions that will:
result in 10,000 MW of new energy efficient generation being built within 
California within 2002; and 
running of existing older generation combined with mitigating reductions in 
emissions

 We are missing in decreasing load section
missing concrete suggestions: 
The California Public Utility Commission, will immediately seek bids, in the 
form of rate changes and regulatory commitments that would result in 2,000 MW 
of reduced on peak load by June 1, 2001
The California Public Utility Commission, will immediately seek bids, in the 
form of rate changes and regulatory commitments that would result in 5,000 MW 
of reduced overall load by January 1, 2002.

1st Comments from Scott

We are missing:

Positive spin at front
Governor Davis is committed to solving the California energy crisis by:
Developing consumer driven solutions
Protecting customers from short term market aberrations
Continuing to expand the consumers ability to choose
We are missing thoughtful Orderly Process
Maintain 1890 in interim
All customers treated the same
Would replace "maintain a reliable distribution network" with "assure 
investment community"
Assurances around forward purchases
Assurances around prudent purchases to keep lights
Assurances, if needed through increases, via tax refundable.
Maintain AB1890 until orderly process arrives with better solution
Would drop specifics arount rate increase. 

More to come......
