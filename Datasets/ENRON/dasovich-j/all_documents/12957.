New views emerging on power: More elected officials support the concept of=
=20
planned blackouts.
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 23, 2001)=20
If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when =
to=20
break out the candles or send the workers home.=20
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and=
=20
giving businesses and residents ample warning.=20
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer=20
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the Californ=
ia=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.=20
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a=
=20
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the=20
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light=
s=20
would stay on.=20
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "ever=
y=20
day is a potential blackout day."=20
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a=20
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the=
=20
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask=20
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."=20
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state woul=
d=20
gut it out with planned blackouts.=20
"Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of t=
he=20
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utiliti=
es=20
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for=
=20
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes.=20
"Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel=
=20
could work," Shames said.=20
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about th=
e=20
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power=20
blackouts, with definite notice right before.=20
"There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i=
s=20
likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said =
he=20
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea=
=20
of a system like Chicago's.=20
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at=
=20
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the=20
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will g=
o=20
beyond ISO's.=20
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking=
=20
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts=
=20
might increase the number of outages.=20
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute=20
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to=20
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the=
=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibl=
y=20
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.=20
"Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said.=20
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f=
or=20
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in=
=20
recent months.=20
"It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush,=
=20
we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove=
.=20
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo=
ne=20
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.=
=20
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food=
=20
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go.=20
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day th=
at=20
their electronic gates might be closed.=20
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange fo=
r=20
backup power generators, he said.=20
"We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president o=
f=20
the California League of Food Processors.=20
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring so=
me=20
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day=
.=20
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, h=
e=20
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food.=
=20
"It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult=20
situation," he said.=20
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two=
=20
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have =
to=20
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went abo=
ve=20
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.=
=20
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when=
=20
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora=
ry=20
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a=
=20
sick relative to be moved.=20
"If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult=
=20
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departmen=
ts=20
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.=20
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed t=
he=20
idea yet, but say it's worth a look.=20
"It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.=20

Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Pol=

By Dan Smith

(Published May 23, 2001)=20
Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis: build=

s=20
power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis=
=20
created by power companies to make money.=20
But on one longstanding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear=
=20
preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion.=20
In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since befor=
e=20
the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, 59 percent say they favor more=20

Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and three-fourths =

Republicans and 55 percent of others agree.=20
"The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue,"=
=20
Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said.=20
Californians' support for nuclear power reached nearly 70 percent in the=20
mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis. But it plummeted =
to=20
37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile=

=20
the question.=20
In 1989, voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's=
=20
Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down. The utility complied and has spent=
=20
more than $200 million decommissioning it during the past 12 years.=20
Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent=
ly=20
by nuclear-energy advocates, opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be=

.=20
Only two operate in California -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo=
=20

"When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about=
=20
that much lately, you do get some aberrant results," said Bill Magavern, a=
=20
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned abo=
ut=20
electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like to=
=20

The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national=
=20
energy plan recently released by President Bush, who called for more nuclea=
r=20
power plants nationwide.=20
But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy=20

=20
opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of all=

adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bush'=

fellow Republicans -- support the price controls.=20
"It really does expose the Bush administration to long-term serious problem=

=20
regard," DiCamillo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be=
=20

Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and=
=20
Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to=20

=20
Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin.=20
Californians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy=

By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll respondents say they would=20

support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59 percent said they'd=

Utility seeks OK of diesel use to avoid outages

(Published May 23, 2001)=20
Desperately seeking megawatts, San Diego Gas & Electric Co. wants to pay=20
local industries to fire up their high-polluting emergency diesel generator=
s=20
this summer to relieve the electricity grid and avoid rolling blackouts.=20
If approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, the proposal could=20
increase the region's generating capacity by up to 50 megawatts, enough to=

"Customer willingness to participate has been quite strong, if the proper=

3 million consumers in San Diego and southern Orange counties.=20
The utility estimates the program would cost $15 million.=20
Environmental opposition to date has come mainly from the state's chief=20
air-pollution enforcer, the California Air Resources Board, which can=20

The board contends that the San Diego region, which already suffers some of=

if the notoriously dirty diesel generators are deployed en masse.=20
Most diesel generators have few or no pollution controls and, megawatt for=

"The SDG&E proposal would expend ratepayer dollars on extremely polluting a=

Kenny said in a letter of opposition.=20
The utilities commission is scheduled to vote on the proposed "rolling=20
blackout reduction program" Thursday in San Francisco.=20
Many utilities have offered similar financial incentives to get businesses=

however, would take power-shedding where it has not gone before by explicit=

Lawsuit wants to cap cost of power=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 23, 2001)=20
Key lawmakers touted their lawsuit filed Tuesday against federal energy=20
regulators as a last-ditch maneuver to relieve California from summer=20
blackouts and high electricity costs.=20
Filed on behalf of the Legislature and the city of Oakland, the suit charge=
s=20
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to fulfill its leg=
al=20
duties by allowing generators to charge unreasonable rates for power in=20
California.=20
The lawsuit, filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Assembly=20
Speaker Robert Hertzberg, seeks immediate caps on wholesale energy rates an=
d=20
refunds from past purchases.=20
The two Democrats noted that power prices shot up from $33 a megawatt in 19=
99=20
to as high as $1,900 earlier this year. Burton suggested a $200 cap is=20
reasonable.=20
"The people of California need some relief, some protection from these=20
outrageous prices," Hertzberg said. "In our judgment, the law is clear -- i=
t=20
is clear that the federal regulators are ignoring the law."=20
Under the Federal Power Act, FERC is charged with setting "just and=20
reasonable" wholesale energy prices.=20
The commission adopted a plan in late April that would cap rates once=20
reserves fall below 7.5 percent, in what is called a Stage 1 power emergenc=
y.=20
But California officials denounced that plan as ineffective, noting that th=
e=20
state needs relief before emergencies strike.=20
High energy costs have helped drain more than $6 billion from the state's=
=20
general fund since California began purchasing electricity for utilities in=
=20
January.=20
In addition, the state faces at least 260 hours of power blackouts this=20
summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Council. Those=
=20
outages are a health threat to California's most vulnerable residents, Burt=
on=20
said.=20
But Jan Smutny-Jones, who represents wholesale generators as executive=20
director of the Independent Energy Producers Association, said a suit would=
=20
solve none of California's problems.=20
"We need to tone down the political rhetoric and fix problems rather than t=
ry=20
to litigate this," he said. "This lawsuit will not add one megawatt of=20
generation to the system nor will it decrease demand in California."=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who has attacked the Bush administration for not capping=
=20
energy prices, said he supports the lawsuit.=20
"I support all efforts to recoup the windfall profits that these generators=

All spin, no juice: Energy debate shifts from policy to politics


(Published May 23, 2001)=20

If the spin machines of the Davis and Bush administrations generated=20
electricity, California wouldn't have to worry about blackouts.=20
Unfortunately, political hot air won't drive a turbine.=20
Both Gov. Gray Davis and Vice President Dick Cheney have stepped up their=
=20
finger-pointing campaigns, with the governor blaming Bush for abandoning=20
California, and Cheney blaming Davis for ignoring the problem until it blew=
=20
into a crisis.=20
But while the governor and the White House play blame games, some of the re=
al=20
policy work sits uncompleted. As temperatures soar and June approaches, the=
re=20
is nothing close to a consensus on the three unresolved challenges of the=
=20
power crisis: returning the state's investor-owned utilities to solvency;=
=20
preventing independent generators from exploiting a broken wholesale power=
=20
market; and keeping alternative generators producing power at reasonable=20
rates.=20
For the somewhat distant future, some policy pieces have fallen into place.=
=20
The need for more power will be met by plants under construction and in the=
=20
approval process. The state's $800 million investment in new conservation a=
nd=20
efficiency initiatives will dampen demand for power. The creation of a stat=
e=20
public power authority gives California a tool to deal with imbalances in t=
he=20
electricity marketplace.=20
But the immediate crisis offers only unpleasant and controversial choices,=
=20
all of them heavily freighted with political risk. Decisions about rescuing=
=20
the utilities or controlling wholesale prices hinge on different ideologica=
l=20
views of the proper role of government in the marketplace and the causes of=
=20
the electricity mess. And the stakes are extraordinary, both for California=
's=20
economy and for political positioning in the national battle over energy=20
policy and future elections.=20
In the absence of quick policy action, though, all of the finger-pointers=
=20
stand to lose. Cheney is right about Davis' dilatory approach to the power=
=20
crisis, but dead wrong in shirking federal responsibility for what comes=20
next. The federal government alone has authority to restrict the wholesale=
=20
price of power to what is just and reasonable. This is the law, and the Bus=
h=20
administration refuses to enforce it.=20
As long as the sky is the potential limit on wholesale electricity prices,=
=20
both for purchases past and present, it's harder for the political system t=
o=20
resolve the past debts of the utilities and the contractual relationships=
=20
with alternative generators. If the Bush administration wants to turn the=
=20
political heat on Davis and Sacramento, it must do its own job first. The=
=20
only thing preventing that is a near fanatical belief that with electricity=

the free market can do no wrong.

In a startling shift from views held consistently for more than a generatio=
n,=20
energy-strapped Californians now strongly favor nuclear power as a means of=
=20
providing more electricity, a Field Poll shows.=20
The statewide poll released today shows that 59 percent of those surveyed=
=20
support building new nuclear power plants in the state -- compared with 36=
=20
percent who oppose the idea and 5 percent undecided.=20
The breakdown is even more dramatic for registered voters who were among th=
e=20
1,015 Californians polled -- 61 percent in favor and 33 percent opposed, wi=
th=20
6 percent undecided.=20
That represents the first time since 1978 -- a year before the nuclear=20
accident at Three Mile Island -- that Californians have approved of more=20
nuclear power. And it is a complete reversal from the last time Field polle=
d=20
on the issue in 1984, when Californians rejected more nuclear power by a=20
2-to- 1 ratio.=20
"This is a big deal. . . . The state's current energy crisis has just set o=
ff=20
a chain reaction of public support for nuclear power," said Mark DiCamillo,=
=20
director of the Field Poll. "The public's fear of nuclear power is being=20
mitigated by the long-term experience with nuclear power in other states, .=
 .=20
.=20
and it is letting down its fears."=20
At the same time, the poll shows a majority of Californians want air=20
pollution controls to remain in place and reject offshore oil drilling and=
=20
greater use of coal-fired power plants to provide more energy.=20
Significantly, although once the subject of passionate "no nukes" protests=
=20
and controversial initiatives in California, nuclear power now has a majori=
ty=20
of support among Democrats, Republicans and independent voters alike, the=
=20
poll showed.=20
While Californians gave thumbs up to a power source being pushed by the Bus=
h=20
administration for the long term, they also backed federal price ceilings o=
n=20
energy -- a short-term measure rejected repeatedly by the administration.=
=20
Seven in 10 Californians surveyed say a federal price limit on energy would=
=20
be a good thing -- echoing Gov. Gray Davis' adamant call for such action=20
since the energy crunch became apparent last winter.=20
Despite the opposition from Bush and Republican leaders, 57 percent of=20
registered Republican voters in California support price limits as do an=20
overwhelming 79 percent of Democrats.=20
DiCamillo says the findings clearly dramatize that "the consequences of not=
=20
having federal price caps will be quite severe for the Bush administration =
as=20
we go into the summer and have blackouts."=20
California voters see the price limit proposal as the "one way out . . . fo=
r=20
the state to continue to buy (power)," he said. "The one proposal the publi=
c=20
really wants is something that the state itself cannot do. . . . It require=
s=20
the assistance of the federal government."=20
The poll, underscoring the shifting political landscape created by=20
California's deepening energy woes, came even as Vice President Dick Cheney=
=20
was making another high-profile plea for more nuclear energy.=20
"We want to assess the potential for nuclear energy to make a major=20
contribution in terms of improving air quality," said Cheney, speaking in=
=20
Washington, D.C., before the Nuclear Energy Institute. He called nuclear=20
power "a very important part of our energy policy today in the United=20
States."=20
The Field Poll findings on nuclear energy were met with enthusiasm by the=
=20
nuclear industry -- and harsh criticism from environmentalists.=20
"It's not surprising," said Mitch Singer, spokesman for the group that Chen=
ey=20
addressed yesterday. "People are seeing an industry running efficiently,=20
running safely, pumping out a lot of electricity and with no emissions into=
=20
the atmosphere. What's happening here is the growing consensus and=20
recognition that nuclear energy needs to be part of a diverse portfolio for=
=20
the country."=20
Singer said California's nuclear power plants -- in San Onofre and in Diabl=
o=20
Canyon -- provide California with 17.8 percent of its electricity needs,=20
at an average production cost of 1.83 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
NUCLEAR'S TV ADS
But Ann Mesnikoff, spokeswoman for the national offices of the Sierra Club,=
=20
said voters have been inundated by expensive TV ads by the nuclear industry=
=20
-- which fail to mention the dangers.=20
"When people start seeing truck or rail shipments running through the cente=
r=20

"Nuclear power should not be part of our 21st century energy plan," she sai=
d.=20
"It's expensive, it's slow, it's dangerous. It's not a plan that will provi=

The Field Poll generally asked for the views of Californians on the propose=

revenue bonds to help the state purchase power over the next two years.=20
CYNICISM ABOUNDS
"They think it's very expensive," DiCamillo said. "They're very cynical abo=

CONSUMPTION, CONSERVATION
In what may be the first such tally of statewide conservation efforts,=20
California residents said they reduced their power consumption by an averag=
e=20
of 8 percent -- an effort motivated by the energy crisis.=20
The new poll results also dramatized that Californians are "very attentive"=

themselves for the effects of increased rates and power outages.=20
But so far, it is not the politicians who are the object of their wrath -- =

"They're the bad guys," he said. "But (in the public's view) no one has bee=

The findings of the latest Field poll:=20
-- Three quarters of the Californians polled deemed the energy crisis "very=

Conroy, however, said the company is considering posting the group numbers=

Energy Shortages, Price Caps and Windfall Profit Taxes Lessons Never Learne=
d



WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 22, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -=20



By Craig G. Goodman, President of the National Energy Marketers
Association and former Director of Oil and Energy Tax Policy in the


Reagan and Bush Administrations


In the last year, we have experienced an energy crisis in
California, unprecedented prices for natural gas and high oil prices
on top of six interest rate increases, and four trillion dollars of
lost wealth in the stock market.


History has taught us many lessons about energy policy,
particularly about making new laws and regulations in response to a
"crisis." One thing our country, indeed the global economy, cannot
afford is to repeat the energy policy mistakes of our past.


During the Oil Embargo of the 1970s, OPEC withheld oil supplies
for a short time as a political gesture causing an oil price spike. In
response, the U.S. instituted the most complex scheme of energy price
and allocation controls since World War II.


Energy price caps and their aftermath caused more than ten years
of economic stagflation, rising oil imports, historic trade deficits,
massive wealth transfers in petrodollars to OPEC nations, gasoline
lines, unprecedented interest rates and declining U.S. energy
production.


At the very time we needed more U.S. energy supplies, our energy
price caps permitted oil produced everywhere else in the world to sell
on world markets for as high as $42 per barrel, while U.S. producers
were forced to accept $6-$11 per barrel.


Once prices were deregulated, prices fell to a low of $9 per
barrel, yet at the same time, the government taxed away approximately
$88 billion in capital needed to develop new energy supplies under the
name of "Windfall Profit Taxes." As a result, today we are nearly
twice as dependent on imported oil than when the Embargo began.


Politicians live for the next election, corporations live for the
next quarter's earnings and most of the rest of us live from paycheck
to paycheck. So how do we deal with the immediate political and the
financial pain of energy price spikes, shortages, blackouts,
environmental sensitivities, and its disproportionate impact on the
poorest Americans?


Price Caps and "Windfall" taxes are political salves that feels
good today and hurt tomorrow. These are bad policies that sound great,
help politicians get elected and hurts the average consumer after the
next election.


Are there any choices? Must we repeat the failed policies of the
1970s that ruined our economy for a decade? No we don't. There are
quick, effective and low cost policies to deal with our "energy
crisis." Indeed, there are numerous energy policy options that can
yield very significant short and long-term paybacks to U.S. Society.


Electricity represents the last vestige of 60 years of the most
complicated price and allocation controls known to man. The retail
U.S. energy business is one of the largest single businesses in the
world. It represents nearly a trillion dollars a year, of which,
energy is only about $300 billion.


Currently, however, utility bills include all manner of products,
services, information and technologies which are truly separate and
very competitive businesses.


In the U.S., there are very few true supply monopolies or demand
monopsonies. But between competitive sources of supply and demand
there are two, full-blown, government sanctioned monopolies.


One is an interstate transmission monopoly, and one is a local
distribution monopoly. Current rules governing these monopolies are
incredibly complex, hard to audit and impose enormously unnecessary
costs on consumers in many different ways.


To help consumers and lower energy prices quickly, monopoly
barriers to new energy supplies must be repealed, and aggressive
conservation and load reduction incentives must be implemented
immediately.


At the same time, both state and federal policies must squeeze the
monopoly profits out of the two monopolies between supply and demand
so that more competitive supplies can meet demand at lower prices.


States must also stop granting utilities a monopoly or competitive
advantages to provide competitive products, services, information and
technologies. Utilities should perform solely natural monopoly
functions. Regulated utilities should sell transportation services on
a "no frills" cost of service basis. Needed infrastructure investments
should be given targeted, performance-based incentives.


Regulations, tariff structures, interconnection rules, back up
rates and operational protocols should be uniform and designed to
permit competitive suppliers to provide all other energy-related
products, services, information and technologies at competitive, not
monopoly, prices.


Today we are witnessing the largest industrial restructuring in
the history of this country, possibly the world. Every other industry
that has deregulated has experienced 40 to 50 percent savings.


The U.S. market for energy and related products, services,
information and technology is nearly a trillion dollars a year. Even a
10 percent saving can save consumers as much as $100 billion a year,
every year, in perpetuity, without one penny lost in government
services.

California Religious Leaders Set Bush Energy Plan Against "Biblical Standar=
ds=20
of Stewardship, Justice" at Federal Building Rally



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 22, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -=20

Religious Activists From Across California Sign "Let There Be Light:
An Open Letter to the President, Congress, and American People,"
Launching Grassroots Campaign to Promote Climate Justice, Conservation


Capping three days of strategic planning, representatives of major
American faith groups gathered today at an emergency interfaith rally
for energy conservation and climate justice at the Federal Building in
Westwood.


Faith leadership, including the Right Rev. Frederick H. Borsch of
the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles; the Rev. Albert G. Cohen,
director of the Southern California Ecumenical Council and executive
board member of California Interfaith Power and Light; Lee H. Wallach,
executive board member of the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish
Life of Southern California (COEJL/SC); and Barry A. Smedberg,
executive director of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council,
joined other faith leadership to sign and present "Let There Be Light:
An Open Letter to the President, Congress, and American People," at
the Westwood Federal Building in coordination with a Washington, D.C.,
interfaith rally on the steps of the Capitol.


Rabbi Harvey Fields, of Wilshire Boulevard Temple and co-founder
of the Los Angeles Interfaith Environment Council, who endorsed the
letter, stated: "Across America, we are not only seeing the rise in
energy consumption and costs of production, but also the threatening
results of rolling blackouts and dangerous policies which continue the
pollution and poisoning of our precious environment.


"Our religious traditions teach us that we are responsible not
only for the present care and conservation of the earth, but that we
owe to future generations of our children the gift of a sustainable
environment."


The open letter, signed by heads of denominations and senior
leaders across the spectrum of religious life, questioned whether the
administration's energy plan meets "biblical standards of stewardship
of God's creation, intergenerational equity, and social and economic
justice ... by depleting energy sources, causing global warming,
fouling the air with pollution, and poisoning the land with
radioactive waste."


Stated the Right Rev. Frederick Borsch, of the Episcopal Diocese
of Los Angeles and co-founder of the Los Angeles Interfaith
Environmental Council, "We, the people, must see -- and must help our
government leaders see -- that the core of our natural world and
conservation of fossil fuel energy are not just private matters but
things we must do together."


An endorsement of renewable and green energy programs, and a call
to action stressing that energy conservation is a morally responsible
choice that Americans and the administration must make, the rally was
assembled by the Los Angeles Interfaith Environmental Council (LAIEC)
and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life of Southern
California (COEJL/SC), and co-sponsored by California Interfaith Power
and Light (CIPL) and the Bay Area Coalition on the Environment and
Jewish Life (BAY COEJL).


Local activists and faith leadership who have already signed the
letter include: Rabbi Harvey J. Fields, Wilshire Boulevard Temple,
co-founder, Los Angeles Interfaith Environmental Council; Steven Koff,
executive director of B'nai B'rith, Southern California; Daniel
Sokatch, executive director of the Progressive Jewish Alliance; the
Rev. Paul A. Lance, Seaside Community Church; the Rev. Bill Miller,
United Methodist Federation for Social Action; the Rev. Peter
Moore-Kochlacs, Environmental Ministries; Rabbi Alan Henkin, director
of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Pacific Southwest
Council; the Rev. Susan Halcomb Craig, pastor, United University
Church, Los Angeles; the Rev. Bear Ride, director, Peace Center,
United University Church, Los Angeles; the Rev. Amy Aitken, Knollwood
United Methodist Church; Rhetta Alexander, Reseda First United
Methodist Church; and Rheva Nickols, Reseda First United Methodist
Church.

Boulevard Temple, the Right Rev. Frederick H. Borsch of the Episcopal
Diocese of Los Angeles, and other religious leadership in Southern
California. The council co-chairs are Michael Cunningham and Lee H.
Wallach.

A 'sleeping disaster'

"This is a sleeping disaster," said Jonathan Gottlieb, partner in the North=

D.C., and former FERC attorney. "Granted, you need additional supply, you=

and which cannot support demand."=20

The president's energy policy report found that investment in new=20

$1.2 billion. In addition, over the next decade, only 7,000 miles of new=20

"From the economics side, this idea [eminent domain] makes sense," said Cra=
ig=20
Pirrong, finance professor at the Olin School of Business at Washington=20
University, St. Louis. "It makes sense, but it's not necessarily going to=
=20
happen."=20

Coalitions of groups that normally would cross to the other side of the=20
street to avoid each other suddenly are locking arms and singing "Kumbaya."=
=20

Pirrong said there are three groups that certainly will look with disdain a=
t=20
giving FERC the power to seize. These are vertically integrated utilities,=
=20
state public utility commissions and environmentalists. One could add to th=
at=20
trio conservative western Republicans=01*members of Bush's own party=01*who=
 never=20
have liked taking orders from those far-away Easterners.=20

"Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an=20
encroachment on their territories," Pirrong said. "It's similar to the Baby=
=20
Bell telephone companies: opening the last mile of their service territorie=
s=20
to competition has been extremely difficult. The state commissions generall=
y=20
are very responsive to the local utilities and, of course, you have the=20
environmental interests."=20

NARUC is 'troubled'
The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) has=20
registered its concern regarding expanded eminent domain power for FERC.=20

"We are very troubled with the President's position," said Chris Mele,=20
NARUC's legislative director. "We've consistently held that the siting of=
=20
transmission or generation belongs with the states. We are adequately=20
equipped to do it, and all the infrastructure there we put in place."

But "all that infrastructure" was built pre-deregulation, when each little=
=20
utility constructed its state- and federally-approved monopoly-fiefdom and=
=20
lived in peaceful coexistence with its neighboring utility. Those days=01*
excluding the effects of the California debacle=01*are over in about half t=
he=20
states, with the remainder eventually to follow the same deregulation path.

Traditional vertically integrated utilities look upon this as an encroachme=

Proponents say just as the development of the automobile led to the need fo=

And, just as was the case when Ike conceived and started the ball rolling=
=20
concerning the interstate highway system, private property also has been=20
seized for energy-related projects. Baker & McKenzie's Gottlieb pointed out=
=20
that the development beginning in the 1930s of the nation's interstate=20
pipeline system was looked at from the broader perspective of national=20
security.=20

"Transmission developed as a local function, with a disconnected system,"=
=20
Gottlieb said.=20

Just having eminent domain in its quiver of powers makes it easier for FERC=
=20
to site pipelines; the threat of its use is a powerful stimulus, Washington=
=20
University's Pirrong said.=20

Many industry watchers point to the greater good scenario: If a new=20
transmission line is needed for the greater good of many, then the federal=
=20
government should have the power to move things off center, away from the=
=20
parochial.

"If you need interstate power, the companies involved cannot buy the=20
property, and the project is for the greater good, then sometimes the=20
government has to use eminent domain," said Jake Haulk, an economist and=20
managing director of the conservative think tank Allegheny Institute for=20
Public Policy in Pittsburgh, Pa. "We wouldn't think twice about taking=20
property for an interstate highway."=20

"Someone has to be able to step in to override purely local, parochial=20
feelings," said Jerry Pfeffer, energy industries advisor in the Washington,=

"It's a real test of Tip O'Neil's famous saying that all politics is local,=

according to Pfeffer. "If the western Republicans vote as their constituent=

classic case of local vs. presidential politics."
