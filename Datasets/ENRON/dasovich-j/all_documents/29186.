The Suits Tell the Tale
Gov. Davis deceived Californians about the energy crisis.
By Jerry Taylor & Peter VanDoren. Jerry Taylor is director of=20

s=20
editor of Cato=01,s Regulation.
July 27, 2001 8:25 a.m.
or at least nine months now, California Gov. Gray Davis has been screaming=
=20
bloody murder about how corporate power pirates out of Houston have=20
economically raped and pillaged the state of California, creating an=20
artificial electricity crisis out of thin deregulated air. The story didn't=
=20
appear to add up. But because the governor's office refused to release=20
information about how much the state paid to whom for electricity over the=
=20
past several months, who was to say?=20
Lawsuits finally pried that information out of Davis last week and =01* lo =
and=20
behold! =01* "the biggest snakes on the planet" (Davis's words) were chargi=
ng=20
less than the publicly owned utilities of California itself and even less=
=20
than the price charged by his right-hand man, David Freeman, head of the L.=
A.=20
Department of Water & Power. And Davis turns out to have known it all along=
.
Until Davis coughed-up the data, the Left was in hog heaven, scoring point=
=20
after point about how socialism =01* at least in the electricity business =
=01* was=20
far preferable to capitalism. Alan Richardson, president of the American=20
Public Power Association, recently told an audience that, "California is a=
=20
great example of municipal utilities that have =01( taken care of their=20
customers while investor-owned utilities have taken care of their=20
shareholders =01( Every customer of a private utility is seen as a profit=
=20
center. With public power, every customer is seen as our owner and neighbor=
."=20
Anti-utility activist Harvey Wasserman wrote in The Nation that, "dereg=20
apologists are having a hard time explaining why two California power=20
companies were immune to the crisis: the Los Angeles Department of Water &=
=20
Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Both are owned by the=
=20
public =01( during the crisis, rates charged by both companies have been st=
able."
It turns out, however, that publicly owned utilities charged the state an=
=20
average of $344 for a megawatt of electricity during the first three months=
=20
of the year. Private companies were meanwhile charging less than an average=
=20
of $250 per megawatt. And those Houston-based "snakes" =01* Reliant, Dynerg=
y,=20
and Enron =01* were charging less than the publicly owned utilities, less t=
han=20
the sainted and celebrated L.A. Department of Water & Power ($292 per=20
megawatt), less than the Sacramento Municipal Utility District ($330 per=20
megawatt), less than other investor-owned California-based power marketers,=
=20
and less than the overall market average. Other more ambitious sellers=20
include those municipal "good neighbors" at Seattle's City Light Department=
=20
($634 per megawatt), BC Hydro ($498), and virtually every other socialist=
=20
power entity that bellied up to the California wholesale power market.
But that's not to say that the municipals did anything wrong. They had an=
=20
obligation to local taxpayers to maximize their revenues. Moreover, it turn=
s=20
out that the markups weren't all that great. The cost of producing=20
electricity at the margin was so high because of the run-up of natural gas=
=20
costs; most of the asking price reflected the cost of spinning electrons ba=
ck=20
at the plant. "It's insulting to ask for any money back. We weren't part of=
=20
the problem, and we helped the state in a crisis," Peter Fletcher of the=20
Sacramento Municipal Utility District told theSan Francisco Chronicle. "And=
=20
it's not like we're doing well."
Another interesting revelation is how inept California state agents were wh=
en=20
they tried to run a power system previously managed satisfactorily by the=
=20
utilities. The state "called us and said, 'we're looking for power at $500 =
a=20
megawatt hour for a seven-hour period,'" Kate Hora of the Modesto Irrigatio=
n=20
District told the Chronicle. "There was no negotiation. We just helped them=
=20
out at the price they named." These are the business wizards that Davis wan=
ts=20
to take over the whole system?
It should go without saying that this doesn't help the governor's=20
price-gouging argument. The story Hora tells of how the state behaved with=
=20
her utility is consistent with the stories related by the private marketers=
.=20
The state asks for power and names a price. The company agrees. And several=
=20
weeks later, Davis & Co. scream about "the gougers." The story Fletcher tel=
ls=20
=01* of prices mostly reflecting costs =01* likewise belies Davis's content=
ion that=20
greed explains all. If Sacramento's municipal utility found it hard to make=
=20
any money even with sales of emergency power at $330 a megawatt, what makes=
=20
anyone think it was easier for Enron et al.?
The Left's entire California story, it turns out, was built upon a=20
breathtaking series of gubernatorial falsehoods and demagoguery. If Davis a=
nd=20
his duplicitous henchman, David Freeman, have an ounce of credibility left,=
=20
it's only because the nation is too riveted on the Chandra Levy matter to p=
ay=20
any attention to the bomb that went off in Sacramento last week.

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update2)

Enron Wants India to Buy Dabhol, Still Eyeing Options (Update2)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's top
energy trader, wants the Indian government to buy out its 65
percent stake in the Dabhol Power Co. project, but it's still
looking at other options, a spokesman said.
     ``We do believe the best solution to this problem would be to
have the government or some related body buy us out of the
project,'' spokesman John Ambler said. ``We're still pursuing
other remedies, in case the buyout doesn't come through on
acceptable terms.''
     Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's
sole customer, are in a seven-month dispute over $64 million in
unpaid bills. The board stopped buying Dabhol's power in May,
saying it's too expensive. The move came days after Dabhol
announced it was beginning a six-month notice period to end its
contract with Maharashtra. Dabhol halted production after the
board stopped buying power.
     The Financial Times reported earlier today that Enron is
interested in selling the stake, quoting Enron Chairman Ken Lay,
who was in India earlier this month. Lay told the newspaper that
partners General Electric Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.,
and closely held Bechtel Group might also want to exit the
project.
     GE Capital spokesman Ken Koprowski said the company ``would
give serious consideration to credible offers which would enable
us to realize our financial objectives for this investment.'' In
general terms, he said, GE has a ``long-term commitment to doing
business in India.''
     Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was quoted in the
Business Standard last week saying he wants to resolve the Dabhol
dispute before he visits the U.S. in September.
     Madhav Godbole, the chief negotiator on the Indian side of
the payment dispute, said earlier today that eight Indian states
would be interested in buying power from Dabhol, but not at
``anywhere close'' to the rates the utility charged under the
Maharashtra contract. Dabhol rejected the proposal as
``unrealistic.''
     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 74 cents to $46.10.

price at which various state electricity boards were prepared to buy power=

from DPC.=20
On Thursday, the Godbole panel had met the representatives of four state=20

INDIA: Enron's Dabhol rejects Indian offer on tariffs.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

BOMBAY, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's Indian unit, whi=

is locked in a bitter battle with a local utility, on Friday rejected offer=
s=20
from other utilities to buy power if it lowered its tariff.=20
Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is 65 percent owned by the Houston-based=
=20
Enron, said the new proposals put forward by four Indian states were=20
"unrealistic and unattainable".
DPC had signed a contract to supply power to a state-owned utility, the=20
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, from its gas-based plant on the state'=
s=20
west coast.=20
But the future of the $2.9 billion project, the largest single direct=20
investment in the country, turned uncertain after the utility defaulted on=
=20
payments and stopped buying power, which it says is too expensive. Enron sa=
ys=20
the Board is going back on its contractual commitments.=20
Several alternatives have been suggested to end the dispute. The latest one=
=20
was suggested at a meeting on Thursday.=20
Four other Indian states said they would buy power from Dabhol if it sold t=
he=20
electricity at between 1.65-2.25 rupees per unit, instead of the 7.0 rupees=
=20
charged at some levels of utilisation.=20
"These are totally unrealistic proposals, unattainable by new-generation=20
liquid plants, including those set up by the public sector," a Dabhol=20
spokesman told Reuters.=20
"Talks with DPC have reached a stalemate, similar to a chicken-and-egg=20
situation, wherein interested states had quoted lower prices than the U.S.=
=20
energy major's expectation," M. Godbole, the chairman of a committee set up=
=20
to resolve the dispute, told the Press Trust of India.=20
TARIFF, STUMBLING BLOCK=20
One of the main problems is the state's ability to buy all the power DPC ca=
n=20
supply. The contract has been structured in such a way that the utility pay=
s=20
more per unit of power the less it uses.=20
DPC's power plant is being built in two phases. The first phase of 740 MW i=
s=20
up and running and the second phase of 1,444 MW is 97 percent complete.=20
Since the MSEB has said it cannot buy power, one alternative is to sell the=
=20
power to other states.=20
Though the four states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Delhi ha=
d=20
indicated interest, they also stipulated they would not be able to buy the=
=20
entire output of 1,444 MW. "The states have made it clear there was certain=
ly=20
a demand for DPC power, but only at a particular price. The higher the pric=
e,=20
the lower the demand," Godbole told the PTI.=20
TEST CASE=20
Some analysts say India's attempts to resolve the Enron dispute is a test=
=20
case of its ability to attract more foreign investment.=20
The power project is India's largest foreign direct investment.=20
Last week U.S. assistant secretary of state on South Asian affairs, Christi=
na=20

"I have to emphasise that it will be difficult for international investors =

e=20
manner," she told a meeting in New Delhi.=20
The dispute was triggered off last year when MSEB defaulted on payments.=20
This prompted Dabhol to issue a preliminary notice to cancel its contract a=

Unamerican Activity? California Power Probe Gets Rough

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Think 1929, price fixing, cement companies.=20
That was the scenario the last time California lawmakers used a weapon=20
they're now wielding against a pair of Texas energy companies as part of an=
=20
electricity market investigation.
Lawmakers are also weighing whether to take strong action against Wall Stre=
et=20
firm Morgan Stanley, and they are using a method to corral witnesses that i=
s=20
so unusual it may never have been used by the California Legislature before=
.=20
The actions -- bringing contempt charges and deposing witnesses -- are rare=
=20
for legislatures anywhere in the U.S. They could result in large fines for=
=20
some companies, but earlier reports that corporate executives might be jail=
ed=20
as a result of the investigation are probably overblown.=20
"I wouldn't be surprised to see this go to the California Supreme Court and=
=20
even the U.S. Supreme Court," said state Senator Joe Dunn, (D-Santa Ana),=
=20
chairman of the California Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market=20
Manipulation, which is conducting the investigation.=20
In June, the committee subpoenaed electricity trading documents and financi=
al=20
records from Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Dynegy Inc. (DYN)=
,=20
Williams Cos. (WMB), AES Corp. (AES), NRG Energy (NRG), Enron Corp. (ENE) a=
nd=20
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI). It was looking for evidence that the companies=
=20
knew years ago they could take unfair advantage once the state deregulated=
=20
its power markets, Dunn said.=20
Enron and Reliant, two big companies headquartered in Texas, have still not=
=20
complied with the subpoenas, though Mirant did soon after the committee=20
started a contempt proceeding against it, Dunn said.=20
"This is real defiance of the Legislature's power to issue subpoenas," said=
=20
Clark Kelso, a professor of law at University of the Pacific McGeorge Law=
=20
School in Sacramento. "When somebody openly defies the court's power it the=
n=20
has to make a decision about how best to coerce compliance."=20
The committee has cited Enron and Reliant for contempt, and recommended to=
=20
the full Senate that Enron be charged fines in increments that increase dai=
ly=20
until it complies with the subpoenas. The company may be liable if the full=
=20
Senate upholds the finding when it returns from a recess in August.=20
Enron sued California this month in a federal court in an effort to stop th=
e=20
state from subpoenaing its documents. The suit is still pending.=20
"This is clearly a witch hunt, it's scapegoating and demagoguery," said Mar=
k=20
Palmer, a spokesman for Enron.=20
State legislatures rarely issue subpoenas, and even more infrequently find=
=20
entities in contempt, according to Brenda Erickson, a senior research analy=
st=20
at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Most of the time, "people=
=20
are willing to come in and open records and talk to a committee," she said.=
=20
Sometimes companies hesitate because of confidentiality issues, but=20
legislative committees can go into a closed session to address that concern=
,=20
she added.=20
Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley, which advises some power generating=20
companies, has also come under fire by Dunn for failing to give the committ=
ee=20
documents it used to prepare power plant prospectuses, the senator said. Th=
e=20
papers could provide evidence that companies knew certain plants would give=
=20
them an unfair advantage in electricity markets, according to Dunn.=20
"We're trying to determine what we can do about the fact that Morgan Stanle=
y=20
has destroyed documents, but a contempt finding is not an option at this=20
point," Dunn said. That's because the committee didn't initially subpoena t=
he=20
documents.=20
Morgan Stanley said through a spokesperson that it disposed of documents ma=
ny=20
years before, in accordance with the firm's document retention policy. "We=
=20
assured the Senator that no documents had been disposed of since he issued=
=20
his request," the spokesperson said.=20
The firm has become more cooperative after a period of not communicating=20
clearly with the committee, Dunn said, and added that "in the past 24 hours=
,=20
we have had significant progress in resolving our dispute with Morgan=20
Stanley."=20
Enron's Palmer said Dunn's committee is putting energy companies at the mer=
cy=20
of their competitors by not providing adequate confidentiality regarding=20
sensitive market data.=20
"Just give us the level of protection that any court in the U.S. would give=
=20
us," Palmer said. "We're happy to cooperate so that they can have a=20
fact-finding mission instead of a witch-hunt."=20
Enron also objects to the fact that some entities, including the Los Angele=
s=20
Department of Water and Power and energy company Calpine Corp. (CPN), aren'=
t=20
part of the investigation, according to Palmer. Calpine has very lucrative=
=20
long-term power supply contracts with the state, and LADWP has charged the=
=20
state high prices for surplus power. Enron's profits from power sales to=20
California are only a fraction of some other companies', according to Palme=
r.=20
The California state Senate has allowed the committee to depose witnesses i=
n=20
the investigation, a move never before taken by the Legislature, according =
to=20
Kelso and Dunn. The state can take testimony from several witnesses at once=
=20
behind closed doors in various locations, instead of having them present al=
l=20
testimony directly to the committee, as a result.=20
"From our perspective in the Legislature, it is a return to the time period=
=20
when legislative investigations were pursued vigorously with the full tools=
=20
available to lawmakers," said Dunn. "In the past decades, there's been a=20
reluctance to move in an aggressive manner."=20

Buenos Aires Invents `Patacon' Currency to Pay Bills (Update1)

Buenos Aires Invents `Patacon' Currency to Pay Bills (Update1)

     (Adds patacon to begin circulating Aug. 3 in ninth
paragraph. Adds other possible origins of word patacon to 15th
paragraph.)

     Buenos Aires, July 27 (Bloomberg) -- Buenos Aires,
Argentina's most populated province, has resorted to printing its
own currency to settle its bills.
     Governor Carlos Ruckauf has ordered the provincial mint to
print a new bill to pay part of his workers' paychecks. The $500
million of new notes will also pay interest of 7 percent when the
government redeems them in a year's time.
     For those who want to spend them ``they'll be accepted just
like pesos,'' he said.
     Not everyone shares Ruckauf's optimism. Grocery stores such
as Coto Cicsa, Argentina's No. 3 supermarket chain, and electric
utility Edenor SA said they haven't committed to accepting the
patacon, as the new currency is called.
     ``We'd like to think we'll be able to spend these,'' said
Juan Cosino, a worker at the Buenos Aires legislature who next
month will receive $500 of his $1,400 monthly wage in patacones.
``Nobody knows exactly what they'll be good for.''
     Paying its workers with patacones helps Buenos Aires comply
with a central government demand for provinces to reduce spending,
while avoiding the political cost of wage cuts. Argentina needs to
slash public spending to avoid defaulting on $153 billion in debt
that national and regional governments owe.
     The plan may also erode trust in the Argentine peso, whose
one-to-one peg to the dollar has helped maintain confidence among
international and local investors in the country for the past
decade, said economists.

                           `Quasi-Money'

     ``There are uncomfortable implications to having a new stock
of quasi-money,'' said Ernest ``Chip'' Brown, chief Latin America
economist for Banco Santander Central Hispano SA in New York.
``It's deficit spending.''
     The Patacon will begin circulating August 3, when the
province pays workers. One patacon is worth one peso, the
government said.
     Buenos Aires opted to print money as its coffers were hit by
the same realities that have squeezed the central government: a
budget deficit and a limited ability to raise new funds. The
province is projected to run a $1 billion deficit in the second
half of the year. With its bonds yielding 37 percent, few
investors are willing to lend the province fresh cash.
     ``I wish we didn't have to pay our workers this way,'' Anibal
Fernandez, Buenos Aires Labor Minister, said in an interview.
``Frankly, we didn't have a choice.''
     In creating the patacon, Buenos Aires is doing something the
Federal government cannot: Argentina's currency regime forbids the
central bank from printing pesos unless the increase in money
supply is matched by a rise in foreign currency reserves.

                            Precedents

     Buenos Aires, home to 40 percent of Argentina's 37 million
population, isn't the first Argentine province to create its own
currency. Local bonds can be used to pay at restaurants and
supermarkets in some less populated provinces, particularly in the
poverty-stricken north.
     Nor are local currencies unique to Argentina. Ithaca, New
York, issued the ``Hour'' in 1991 to help the town get through a
recession. During the Great Depression in the 1930's, hundreds of
such currencies were created in the U.S.
     By some accounts, Patacones are named after South American
Indians who resided in Argentina's desolate Southern Patagonia
region. Others say the name derives from the patacoon, a Spanish
silver coin that circulated in the 18th century. The new bills
look like pesos and come in denominations of as little as $5.
     Ruckauf said patacones will be paid to the 30 percent of
provincial workers who earn more than 740 pesos ($740) a month.
They will receive as much as 600 pesos worth of the new bills for
part of their salary that exceeds 740 pesos.

                        Limited Acceptance

     The government has limited success in persuading companies to
accept as legal tender notes that Alberto Bernal, Latin American
economist at IDEAglobal dubbed ``funny money.''
     Water utilities such as Azurix SA and Aguas Argentinas SA,
and phone companies Telefonica SA and Telecom Argentina Stet-
France Telecom SA have said they'll accept Patacones as partial
payment, though some were less than enthusiastic about the change.
     ``We'll take only as many patacones as we need to pay our
obligations to the provincial government,'' said Azurix spokesman
Gustavo Pedace.
     Carlos Serrano, a spokesman for the utility Edenor, said his
company wasn't convinced.
     ``The Governor talked about the grave situation in the
province and said the only way to avoid ceasing payments was with
this patacon bond,'' said Serrano. ``We didn't sign on. We want to
help but we need more information.''
     Since it's unclear whether the bills will be widely accepted,
analysts said some workers may sell them at a discount for pesos
or dollars.
     ``If it's hard to spend this money people will create a black
market if history is any guide,'' said Dustin Reid, a currency
strategist at UBS Warburg Llc in Stamford, Connecticut. ``They
will still want dollars under their mattresses.''
