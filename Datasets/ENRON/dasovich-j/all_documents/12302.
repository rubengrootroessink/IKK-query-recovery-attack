The PUC issued two draft decisions yesterday on PG&E and SCE rates.  The
drafts, along with appendices that have the proposed rates for the
utilities, can be found at:

For those unwilling to read long regulatory documents, a three page summary
of the RTP issues prepared by CEC staff is attached.

Comments on the PUC drafts are due today.  Both drafts propose having a
workshop on RTP on May 21.  So we will be busy.
