I thought it would be a good idea to tag on to our weekly call on Monday to 
discuss the status of our state/local research concerning broadband access 
for every home and business.  Please let me know if you have a problem with 
that timeframe (approximately noon CST).  Thanks very much.  My apologies 
again for having to postpone the call.  

Regards,

Lara
