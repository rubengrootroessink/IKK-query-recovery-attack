Dear RealMoney.com Subscriber,



Biotech, hey, you know I am a skeptic. I have railed against it, called it a 
bubble, thought it was way overvalued. But the sector has come down to where 
their might be values. Won't you join me in finding out?

Perhaps more than any other financial sector, Biotechnology is a
testament to human ingenuity & financial rewards.  I have received
numerous emails asking my advice on how to invest profitably
in this sector.

As an answer to your needs, TheStreet.com has teamed up with The
Wall Street Transcript to create, "Investing in the Second
Biotechnology Revolution" conference, June 7th, in New York
City at the University Club.

We have assembled a star line-up of biotech experts, professional
investors & leading Wall Street analysts who will show you how to:
-- Choose Biotech stocks that are poised for dramatic growth
-- Select companies positioned to exploit & quickly profit
the new therapeutic technologies
-- Utilize investment techniques on how to hedge & manage
investments in this volatile sector
-- Keep tabs on who could be the next Biogen or Amgen

You will be guided through the ever changing biotechnology investment
landscape & have networking opportunities to interact with
the panelists. In short, after attending this 1-day event, you
will have gained the tools and techniques to invest profitably in
the Biotechnology industry -- today. Also, if you book before
May 1st, you will receive $100 off the registration price!

Register today by calling Customer Service at (800) 562-9571
