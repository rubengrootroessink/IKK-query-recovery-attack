Jeff:

About a month ago Ken received a reply from a small business owner in CA to 
his business outreach letter.  In it, the business man expresses concern 
about high natural gas prices and asks if owning part of a pipeline is a 
solution.  I have drafted the attached, and it has gone through Janel.  

Could you please do a quick review, and then I will pass on to Steve?  We 
hope to get this out ASAP as Ken received the letter nearly one month ago.

Thanks, 

Jennifer
