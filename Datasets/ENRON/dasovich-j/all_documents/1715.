Thanks to all who will be attending the 2nd Annual Napa Valley Wine Tour this 
coming Saturday!

There are still about 8 spots open, so get 'em while they last.

I will be forwarding a complete itinerary in the next several days, but our 
trip will include a private tasting and gourmet deli stop at V. Sattui 
Winery, one of the Valley's most beautiful stops!

Please plan on being at the North Berkeley BART Station no later than 9:50 am 
on Saturday.  The bus will leave at 10 am sharp and return to the same 
location by about 5:30 pm.

Feel free to address other questions to me at mike@ziprealty.com.

See you Saturday!!

Mike
