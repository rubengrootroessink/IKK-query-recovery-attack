Ron,

Thanks for forwarding the DJ article.

I believe that the proposed DSTAR delay is neither surprising nor
unreasonable.  It was always ridiculous to think that the DSTAR Board
would be able to put togethers a complete FERC filing by 12/29/00, so
the 3-month delay on the tariff filing is OK.  The Board seems VERY
committed to making that filing.

As to the start-up date: it was always ridiciulous to believe that the
entire software and hardware system (new EMS, all market software, etc.)
could be put into place by 12/01.  The 12/02 date is, in my opinion,
both aggressive and achievable.

One thing to keep in mind as to the FERC filing: DSTAR already exists.
DSTAR is operated by an independent Board, not by the transmission
owners. That's already a big improvement over the other would-be RTOs.
(On the other hand, the transmission owners have not yet agreed to sign
onto DSTAR by signing a TCA... but I believe that this will happen.
What is CRITICAL is for FERC to respond to the 10/16/99 RTO filings by
DEMANDING that the final RTO filings include RTO authority over ALL
FERC-jurisdictional sevices, including interconnection at every voltage
level.  If FERC does this, the utilities will fall in line.  On the
other hand, if FERC doesn't take a hard line, there will be big debates
and we may end up with sham RTOs.)

Another thing to keep in mind (as to implementation): DSTAR's plan is to
consolidate control areas (from about six down to one).  This requires
more in the way of implementation effort than those RTOs which propose
to allow existing control areas to continue to exist.

Carl
