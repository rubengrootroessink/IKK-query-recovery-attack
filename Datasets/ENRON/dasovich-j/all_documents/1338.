Hoecker is in San Diego today and tomorrow (congressional hearings followed
by a FERC conference Tuesday). I will touch base with his staff on Tuesday
and ask him on Thursday after the regular D.C. FERC Meeting. I'll also get
started with Markey. Note that Markey, Barton, and Hoecker as well may not
want to sit on a Panel - they may demand speaking positions.

FYI - NARUC has some overlap with a couple of our potential second tier
speakers.  I got the names on background and can't list them until Chuck
Gray at NARUC has confirmed that they've been invited. Will follow up on
that in a couple days.  NARUC has its Electricity Committee meetings on
Monday, with plenary sessions on electricity on Tuesday morning (lessons
from California on state restructuring policy; Order 2000; consumer
wlelfare/response issues) and Wednesday morning (supply side responses to
price spikes, if my notes are correct).

One balance issue we haven't discussed that may help Bill - Gary Neale of
NiSource is current chairman of the NERC (North American Electric
Reliability Council Board of Trustees). Do we want a speaker who will
provide a focus on reliability issues - I think its a missing piece in our
plan (akin to leaving out NTSB and FAA out of a conference on airline
restructuring). See http://www.nerc.com/about/chairman.html
