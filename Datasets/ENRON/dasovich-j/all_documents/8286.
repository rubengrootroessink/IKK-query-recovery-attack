Subject: Non payment by PG&E for Negative Charges


As you are aware, PG&E has stopped paying all ESPs (who do consolidated
billing) as well as all Direct Access customers who are billed by PG&E the
amounts owed as a result of negative charges accumulating due to high PX
prices.  We have spoken with the representatives of a number of ESPs --
Green Mountain, NewWest, APS Energy -- who are highly concerned about this
and are considering action in the form of a complaint filed at the CPUC. We
do not know, however, whether/when they will do such, and whether any relief
afforded would be sufficient to cover other ESPs not named as complainants.
Recognizing that Enron has relationships with PG&E on may different fronts,
we realize that it may not be in its best interest to file a complaint
against PG&E at this time.  We will not proceed on any form of official
complaint against PG&E, until we hear differently from you
