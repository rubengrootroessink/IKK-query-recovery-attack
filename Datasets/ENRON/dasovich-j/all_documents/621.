This is SDG&E's facilitation proposal.  Comments are due tomorrow, 8/1.  The 
only thing that looks concerning to me is the attachment to the advise 
letter, page 4, paragraph f, which talks about an obligation to serve any 
customer within the designated group that is willing to post a 3-month 
security deposit.  As our group is now defined in the advice letter as 20 kW 
and above, we may want to either suggest further segmentation of the group or 
other criterion for our acceptance.

Subject: SDG&E AL 1242-E - Customer Choice Facilitation Program


Attached to this letter is an advice letter filed on behalf of SDG&E last
Thursday seeking authority to implement a "Customer Choice Facilitation
Program." The intent of this filing is to educate customers as to specific
electricity commodity procurement options that are available to them from
third parties which may help them better manage their energy costs, and to
make it easier for ESPs to make these options available to customers. A
brief description of this program is set forth below, but if you are
interested, we urge you to review the program details, which are set forth
in the attached advice letter.
As you will note, the proposed Customer Choice Facilitation Program will be
initiated by SDG&E notifying ESPs registered with the Commission as well as
ESPs with signed contracts with SDG&E of this program by informational
letter. This notification will be provided within approximately one week
after the filing of this Advice Letter to maximize the ability of ESPs to
qualify for participation in this program. Through this notification, ESPs
will be advised that, should this program be authorized by the Commission,
in order to participate they will need to: (1) demonstrate compliance with
the service establishment requirements of SDG&E electric Rule 25 (D)
including EDI compliance in the areas of DASR processing/consolidated
billing options, (2) agree to participate in the payment of program costs,
and (3) have a contract with a certified scheduling coordinator.
ESPs who desire to participate in the program will be required to send
written confirmation of their intent to participate and proof of compliance
with the participation criteria within four weeks after the informational
letter is mailed. At the end of the four week period, SDG&E will send to
participating ESPs a letter requesting that they: (1) describe in writing,
in reasonable detail, energy procurement or service offers they desire to
make to SDG&E customers, sign a program participation agreement, and pay
their share of program costs. ESPs will have two weeks to provide SDG&E with
the foregoing. SDG&E will then facilitate the compilation and communication
of these offers to customers through bill inserts for small customers and
direct mail to large commercial customers, supported by various types of
media advertising. Customer elections to switch energy procurement to ESPs,
and the switch itself, will be streamlined to the extent permissible without
compromising established consumer protections.
We hope that this program will be beneficial to both customers and ESPs that
offer customers attractive electricity procurement options. It is important
that customers be empowered to exercise control over their energy costs and
that ESPs have an opportunity to inform customers of the services they are
willing to offer.
If you have any questions concerning the advice letter or the program,
please do not hesitate to contact Dawn Osborne at 858 654-1275 or Lora Clay
at 858 654-1787.
