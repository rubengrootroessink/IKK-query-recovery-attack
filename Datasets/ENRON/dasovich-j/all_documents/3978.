NEW MEXICO
Business group supports temporary franchise fee moratorium
The Association of Commerce and Industry of New Mexico has said it supports a 
temporary moratorium on telecom franchise fee increases, in-kind services, 
and requirements beyond those currently imposed by municipalities and 
counties. The association says the Legislature should ensure that fees for 
use of rights-of-way, franchises, and other authorizations to place telecom 
infrastructure in rights-of-way are cost-based.
The group also urges the Legislature to continue to monitor the Public 
Regulation Commission's activities to ensure timely implementation of SB 123 
and HB 400, which were signed into law by Gov. Gary Johnson (R.) earlier this 
year. The new laws require the PRC to move Qwest Corp. (formerly U S WEST 
Communications, Inc.) to an alternate form of regulation. The association 
also urges "appropriate funding" for the PRC to accomplish the move.
The association's recommendations were included in a 2001 legislative agenda 
released late last week.
