Hi Jeff.  I'm here in Orlando with the family (going to Disney World 
tomorrow!!!) and am panicked about not getting all of my work and obligations 
taken care of...must be like every day for you!  There is nothing out of the 
ordinary in this document--just wanted you to be in the know on what I'm 
saying out there.
