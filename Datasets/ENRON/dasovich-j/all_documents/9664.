IEP Response:


Contact:  Jean Munoz                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
         916-447-8186                March 5, 2001

Statement by Jan Smutny-Jones,
Executive Director of Independent Energy Providers,
in Response to Today?s News Conference by Governor Davis

"We support the Governor?s efforts to secure power for California through
long-term contracts =01. a solution that we?ve been advocating for months t=
o
help stabilize energy prices and bring down the cost of electricity.

"Many of our companies were offering long-term contracts to the utilities
last summer that would have dramatically reduced the cost of power and
helped prevent the current crisis.  Likewise, many of our companies signed
or are negotiating long-term contracts with the California Department
of Water Resources.

"Long-term contracts are a very important first step in the long process
of increasing California?s generating capacity and securing reliable and
affordable power for the state?s homes and businesses.  As the people who
generate the power, we?re an  important part of the solution and pledge to
continue doing all we can to help keep the lights on.

"Another equally important step that must be taken quickly is to approve
SBx1 47 which will save ratepayers billions of dollars while protecting a
vital source of California?s electricity supply =01. the QF operators who
provide 30% of the state?s power using clean and renewable technologies lik=
e
solar, wind, geothermal and cogeneration.  Most of these generators are
small, independent businesses that have been providing power for months
without being paid.  SBx1 47 will be an important step to ensure their
ability to serve California customers."
