Hi Everyone,

You may have received an e-mail from Professor Jim Lincoln announcing a 1-
or 2-unit course he's offering called "International Business and Japan",
held one night each week (6:00 - 8:00 pm).

Evening MBA students may take this as a one-unit course only, and it can be
counted as an "academic" one-unit course as opposed to a "professional
skills" one-unit course.

Cheers,

Diane
