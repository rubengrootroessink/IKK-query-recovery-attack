Watchdogs Take a Hit in State's Power Ills
Energy: Ex-federal officials say oversight of California's deregulation=20
suffered due to a push for free-market competition.
By JUDY PASTERNAK and ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writers
?????WASHINGTON--California was the first test, and right from the start=20
economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission saw trouble coming.=
=20
Their bosses were worried too. In hindsight, some admit they could have don=
e=20
better.
?????But five years ago, when California officials were rushing to deregula=
te=20
electricity, the federal watchdog charged by law with overseeing the proces=
s=20
and guarding against runaway prices decided not to bark.
?????In their zeal for free-market competition and their ideological=20
commitment to shifting authority away from Washington to the states, FERC's=
=20
commissioners brushed aside their qualms and let the process roll forward.
?????"There were a lot of issues that got swept under the rug," said=20
economist Carolyn A. Berry, who headed FERC's analysis of the California=20
plan. "We were trying to point out the ugly warts, but it wasn't our job to=
=20
set policy."
?????Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, who presided over the approval,=
=20
said the agency "should have been far less deferential." John Rozsa, a stat=
e=20
legislative analyst who played a key role in the deregulation law, laughed=
=20
when he heard that. "FERC wanted it badly," he said.
?????Today, FERC stands accused of failing to exercise its oversight,=20
enforcement and political muscle just when they were needed most. The agenc=
y,=20
critics on the inside and outside agree, helped launch a radical economics=
=20
experiment without sufficient preparation, adequate staff or a clear sense =
of=20
how to carry out its mission.
?????With fully half the states considering deregulation, the story of what=
 a=20
previously obscure federal agency did not do has become more than a case=20
study in regulatory shortcomings. It has become a warning shot across the b=
ow=20
of the whole country.
?????FERC has approved deregulation plans in New England, New York and the=
=20
mid-Atlantic states. At stake is a reliable supply of a commodity that fuel=
s=20
virtually every home and workplace in America. California's example is hard=
ly=20
encouraging: months of blackouts and an electric bill that has rocketed fro=
m=20
$7 billion in 1999 to as much as $50 billion this year.
?????Now the commission is caught in what some see as an identity crisis,=
=20
divided and uncertain as politicians in California and Washington call for=
=20
mutually contradictory action.
?????"I think the commission needs to decide what it wants to do when it=20
grows up," said Hoecker, who headed the agency during a critical period=20
ending in January. His own leadership, he concedes, was not always all it=
=20
might have been.
?????Without question, there is ample blame for everyone, not just FERC.=20
Certainly in California, state officials devised a flawed deregulation sche=
me=20
and then insisted on carrying it out. Some power company executives have=20
extracted windfall profits. Politicians have wilted when things went awry.
?????And, as FERC officials continually point out, its authority is limited=
=20
to wholesale markets. State officials are responsible for the local utiliti=
es=20
and other retailers selling power to consumers.
?????Nonetheless, it is FERC that Congress charged with overseeing=20
electricity markets and assuring "just and reasonable" prices.
?????How did FERC choose the course it took? What factors influenced its=20
decisions?
?????Certainly energy companies, consumer advocates, lawmakers and others=
=20
lobbied the agency.
?????Yet even FERC critics say such influence was not dominant. FERC is not=
=20
insulated from lobbying, but David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Sa=
ve=20
Energy, a coalition of business, consumer and environmental leaders, said:=
=20
"They are less sensitive to those forces than a lot of other players."
?????Rather, this seems to have been a case of government decisions driven =
by=20
ideology. The commissioners, both Republicans and Democrats, were wedded to=
=20
the idea that deregulation at the wholesale level would lead to lower retai=
l=20
bills. The market, they believed, would inexorably produce greater=20
competition, greater efficiency and falling prices.
?????To Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America, the primary=20
problem was "their excessive faith in the market."
?????Even after price spikes occurred across the Midwest and in California =
as=20
early as 1998, FERC officials dismissed suggestions the surges might reflec=
t=20
market instability or manipulation.
?????And as California's situation worsened, FERC's response was shaped by =
a=20
continuing commitment to market forces with a minimum of government=20
intervention--witness its April order allowing temporary price caps but onl=
y=20
in narrowly defined emergencies.
?????In the last few months, under enormous pressure, FERC has ordered a=20
dozen companies to justify high prices or refund $124.5 million to Californ=
ia=20
utilities for January and February. It won an $8-million settlement from=20
Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., which it had accused of shutting power plant=
s=20
last spring to drive up prices. Williams did not admit guilt.
?????Detractors, including California officials, howl that FERC's actions a=
re=20
too little too late. They have called for a range of solutions, from flat-o=
ut=20
price caps, as in the old days of full regulation, to much higher rebates=
=20
from generators caught price-gouging, to retractions of individual firms'=
=20
permission to charge market-based rates.
?????If the agency chose to wield all of its authority, it also could force=
=20
witnesses to testify under oath and subpoena tapes of phone calls among pow=
er=20
traders, and even force the state to change the way the market operates.
?????Curtis L. Hebert Jr., the free-market champion who succeeded Hoecker a=
s=20
chairman, insisted "FERC is being vigilant in its efforts to ensure just an=
d=20
reasonable rates, while at the same time ensuring" that it fosters new ener=
gy=20
supplies.
?????"I would vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise," he added=
,=20
noting he transferred 75 attorneys--half of the agency's litigators--into=
=20
market oversight.
?????Still, a consensus that it's time for aggressive action seems to be=20
forming among commissioners, including two nominees confirmed by the Senate=
=20
last month: Patrick H. Wood III and Nora M. Brownell.
?????Wood, a Texas utility regulator nominated by Bush and probably FERC's=
=20
next chairman, said the agency needs to evolve into a "market cop with a=20
great big old stick," adding: "There is a role that only the federal=20
government can take. . . . The free market ain't a free and full market yet=
."
?????Already named FERC's special liaison for California, Wood remains=20
dedicated to market principles but vows to take a fresh look.=20
?????Commissioner Linda Breathitt, a Democrat, also talks of change. And=20
commissioner William L. Massey describes agency officials as naive in their=
=20
past actions, in contrast to what he calls the "very sophisticated players"=
=20
on the industry side.
?????If some commissioners are starting to sound more like watchdogs, that'=
s=20
partly because they feel the tug of two conflicting ideas in their mandate =
to=20
open markets while assuring fair prices.
?????Americans have always loved the way capitalism gives opportunities to=
=20
the shrewd and energetic. At the same time, the country has repeatedly turn=
ed=20
to government regulation when it thought particular industries, such as the=
=20
railroads, waxed too powerful.
?????How well FERC deals with this intrinsic conflict and meets its=20
challenges may have a sizable effect on the country's energy future.
?????Frightened by events on the West Coast, some states have slowed their=
=20
progress toward deregulation. Others have decided not to try at all, at lea=
st=20
for now.
?????"If the commission wants to have competitive markets," Hoecker said,=
=20
"it's going to have to pull the bacon out of the fire."
?????Though it traces roots back to the Federal Power Commission and=20
development of hydroelectric power in the 1920s, FERC began its present=20
incarnation in the 1980s, with the Reagan administration's deregulation=20
campaign.
?????FERC undertook to deregulate natural gas, then, spurred by a Democrati=
c=20
Congress and the first President Bush, it moved on to electricity.
?????The problem is that electricity and its markets differ significantly=
=20
from natural gas. Electric power cannot be stored to meet future shortages,=
=20
as gas can. Its markets are more volatile. And the effect of shortages or=
=20
price spikes cascades through the economy much faster.
?????Without anyone quite realizing it, FERC was sailing into uncharted=20
waters.
?????Moreover, as FERC's staff took up the original California deregulation=
=20
plan, it faced a significant constraint: The commissioners had made a=20
conscious call to let the state have its way most of the time.
?????As state officials saw it, so much power was available for the Western=
=20
electrical grid that prices would surely come down. FERC economists, on the=
=20
other hand, saw myriad problems.
?????For example, the state's scheme called for generators to submit blind=
=20
bids with a separate quote for each hour of the coming day. With any power=
=20
plant, the unit cost is highest when a generator is started up and declines=
=20
as it runs. So the price charged for later hours should be lower than for t=
he=20
first--but only if the operator can sell both the beginning and the later=
=20
hours.
?????Under the California blueprint, though, bidders could not be sure whic=
h=20
hours the purchaser might buy. That meant bidders would have to load the=20
higher start-up costs into each hour throughout the cycle to make sure thos=
e=20
costs were recovered. By contrast, the mid-Atlantic market requires the pow=
er=20
purchaser to add separate payments to cover start-up costs.
?????Other issues were deferred rather than solved before FERC granted=20
approval, including such questions as how to manage congestion on the grid=
=20
and what the transmission rights should be for municipalities that generate=
d=20
and sold power.
?????State legislative aide Rozsa argues that such matters were not crucial=
=20
and that the biggest flaw in the plan--the insistence that the system=20
operator not have any generators of its own--was conceived with FERC=20
guidance. Both FERC and the state, he said, had "an exaggerated sense of=20
their knowledge and ability."
?????As the California launch, originally scheduled for January 1998, drew=
=20
near, FERC's nervousness increased. As late as the Christmas holidays, the=
=20
state was still tinkering. The agency ordered the state to provide two week=
s'=20
written notice before taking the final step, even though FERC had already=
=20
approved the plan.
?????When California finally "went to market," FERC analysts snickered at t=
he=20
timing: The first electricity auction was held March 31 for power to be=20
delivered the next day--April Fool's Day.
?????As for the commissioners, "We were somewhat naive," Massey said. "The=
=20
commission believed there was so much inefficiency built into the=20
old-fashioned . . . regime that any new market would be better."
?????With the nation's largest state deregulating, FERC began blessing plan=
s=20
on the East Coast. Hundreds of companies lined up for permission to charge=
=20
market rates in various open trade zones.
?????FERC, according to its rules, was supposed to reject any firm that hel=
d=20
a big enough share in a market--generally defined as about 20%--to influenc=
e=20
prices for a sustained period. But doing the necessary market analyses prov=
ed=20
impractical.
?????For one thing, the rising workload was overwhelming the staff, which h=
ad=20
shrunk by more than 25% from its 1980 high of 1,600 employees. The agency, =
as=20
critics see it, simply buckled.
?????"Once it got going, it took over," Berry said of the momentum behind=
=20
deregulation. "FERC was handing out [permission] to anybody who walked in."
?????FERC economist Steven A. Stoft was infuriated. He wanted to start=20
cautiously, opening one small market, testing before expanding nationally.
?????"To put in markets everywhere, to affect a lot of people, to just wait=
=20
and see how it turns out, that's completely irresponsible," said Stoft, who=
=20
now lives in California and is writing a book for regulators about how to=
=20
design markets.
?????At first, the staff Cassandras seemed wrong. Prices generally headed=
=20
down.
?????But during the summer of 1998, prices spiked twice--once in the Midwes=
t,=20
once in California.
?????In the Midwest, several aging nuclear plants shut down for maintenance=
=20
just as a heat wave sent air conditioners into overdrive. Wholesale=20
electricity rose past $7,000 per megawatt-hour, 100 times normal. Consumers=
=20
and politicians screamed.=20
?????The weather cooled and new supply came in fast. Prices ebbed.
?????To consumer groups and several FERC economists, the sudden increase=20
suggested the worst can happen. Hoecker and FERC member Vicky Bailey drew a=
=20
different lesson, as did a staff investigation: The market worked to correc=
t=20
an unusual confluence of events that was unlikely to recur.=20
?????About the same time, a strange thing happened in California's reserve=
=20
market, where the state's independent system operator pays generators with=
=20
extra capacity to stand ready to meet unexpected surges in demand.
?????So few companies offered to sign such contracts that the ISO sometimes=
=20
had little choice but to accept whatever bid came in. It was just a matter =
of=20
time before someone took advantage. One day in that summer of 1998 someone=
=20
did: The only offer to provide reserve power was an astronomical $9,999 per=
=20

Duke Charged Record Price for Electricity
Crisis: But energy firm agrees to waive 80% of its $3,880-per-megawatt-hour=
=20
tab, if it gets paid.=20
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers
?????Duke Energy Corp., one of the power wholesalers that the state has=20
accused of price gouging, charged $3,880 per megawatt-hour for electricity=
=20
during a brief period last winter--by far the highest price yet disclosed f=
or=20
emergency power.
?????The price was more than double the $1,900 that Gov. Gray Davis=20
excoriated Texas wholesaler Reliant Energy Inc. for charging during an=20
emergency last month.
?????Spokespeople for Davis and Duke agreed Friday--but for entirely=20
different reasons--that the case illustrates nearly everything that has gon=
e=20
wrong with California's power market.
?????From the governor's perspective, the Duke sales represent a clear-cut=
=20
case of gouging. He has cited the opportunism of such out-of-state energy=
=20
merchants as a major cause of the ongoing energy crisis.
?????"It's obscene," Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said. "The state is on=
=20
its knees, and they're out to get every last dime from us."
?????But Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., said that it hasn't yet received a=
=20
dime for the power and that if it ever does get paid, it will gladly waive=
=20
the "credit premiums" that made up 80% of the $3,880.
?????Moreover, Duke said it made the sales in question only because it was=
=20
ordered to do so by the California Independent System Operator, the private=
=20
agency that runs 75% of the state's power grid. To provide the power, Duke=
=20
had to start up an idle generating unit at its Chula Vista station--the=20
dirtiest and least efficient of the four units at that former San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric Co. plant, spokeswoman Cathy S. Roche said.
?????"We tried to convince ISO that this was not a good unit to run in=20
January--that the power would be more needed in the summer," Roche said.
?????ISO declined to comment on the sales, citing a policy of confidentiali=
ty=20
regarding its transactions, spokesman Gregg Fishman said.
?????The sales, first reported Friday by the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, too=
k=20
place over eight or nine days beginning Jan. 17 and continuing into early=
=20
February, Roche said. Each sale occurred after ISO had declared a Stage=20
3--highest level--emergency, and two of the sales took place on days when=
=20
there were rolling blackouts.
?????In all, Duke said it sold 5,000 megawatt-hours at $3,880 each, for a=
=20
total of $19.4 million. The sales represent less than one-tenth of 1% of th=
e=20
power Duke sold in California during the first three months of this year, t=
he=20
company said. A megawatt-hour is enough power to serve about 750 homes for =
an=20
hour.
?????Duke's average price in California over that span was $136 per=20
megawatt-hour, up from $76 per megawatt-hour during all of 2000, the compan=
y=20
said Friday.
?????Duke, like other wholesalers, tacks on credit premiums as a kind of=20
insurance to reflect the financial condition of its buyers.
?????In this case, though ISO ordered the sales, the actual buyers were=20
SDG&E, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Edison and=
=20
PG&E were on the brink of insolvency and discussing bankruptcy at the time,=
=20
though it was not until April 6 that PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection.=
=20
Their shaky finances justified the big surcharges, Roche said.
?????By imposing an 80% credit premium, Duke indicated it wouldn't expect t=
o=20
get more than 20 cents on the dollar in a bankruptcy.
?????However, Maviglio and Joe Newlin, consumer advocate at the Foundation=
=20
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica, both called the surcharge=
s=20
excessive.
?????"It's greed on top of greed," Newlin said.
?????Subtracting the 80% premium leaves a price of $776 per megawatt-hour,=
=20
which Newlin said is still unjustifiably high.
?????But Tom Williams, another Duke spokesman, explained it this way: To=20
start up a generator that it hadn't planned on operating, Duke had to buy=
=20
natural gas on the spot market at a stratospheric $30 to $40 per million=20
British thermal units (BTUs), which meant it cost $450 per megawatt-hour fo=
r=20
fuel alone.
?????The balance of the price included operating and maintenance costs, a=
=20
large fee for emissions credits to run the environmentally costly plant, pl=
us=20
a reasonable profit, Williams said.
?????The Duke sales were different from Reliant's; Reliant sold its=20
$1,900-per-megawatt-hour electricity to the state Department of Water=20
Resources, which has become the emergency purchaser of power.
?????"The difference is, Reliant got paid," Roche said.
?????In any case, consumers do not pay these market prices. Instead, their=
=20
power rates are set by the state Public Utilities Commission.
?????But if residential customers were on the hook for Duke's $3,880 per=20
megawatt-hour on a regular basis, it would translate into $3.88 per=20
kilowatt-hour on a household's bill.
?????That compares to the 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour that Southern=20
California Edison customers have paid for electricity since January, with=
=20
another 5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour going to such services as transmission=
=20
and distribution. In March, the PUC added another 3 cents per kilowatt-hour=
=20
on average to electricity rates.
?????If the average household in Edison territory paid that $3.88 for each =
of=20
the roughly 500 kilowatt-hours used each month, the electricity portion alo=
ne=20
of the monthly bill would reach $1,940.

PUC May Trip Bailout of Edison
By JERRY HIRSCH and STUART SILVERSTEIN, Times Staff Writers
?????In a development analysts fear could push Southern California Edison=
=20
closer to bankruptcy, the Public Utilities Commission is expected to miss a=
=20
deadline to complete a set of regulatory changes required in a bailout plan=
=20
with Gov. Gray Davis.
?????Under the rescue agreement worked out between the utility and the=20
governor, the PUC was required to implement six regulatory changes--mostly=
=20
dealing with rate making, nuclear power sales and energy procurement--by Ju=
ne=20

?????But in a conference call with creditors Friday, worried Edison officia=
ls=20
noted that none of the changes are on the agenda for the next PUC meeting=
=20
Thursday.
?????The PUC agenda represents a "disturbing void" that could endanger the=
=20
entire agreement, said Theodore Craver Jr., chief financial officer of the=
=20
utility's parent, Rosemead-based Edison International.
?????Analysts said the lack of PUC action probably signals that the Davis=
=20
plan, which has little legislative support, also may be in trouble with the=
=20
state's chief regulatory agency.
?????Gary Cohen, PUC general counsel, said the commission's staff is workin=
g=20
on the regulatory changes, but that "everybody knew that June 8 deadline wa=
s=20
optimistic."
?????"We are not trying to kill the deal. It's just that there is a huge=20
amount of work to be done," he said.
?????But some legislators are pressuring the PUC not to move ahead.
?????"I am asking them not to do anything until the Legislature acts," said=
=20
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco). "Why give regulatory relief to=
=20
Edison until we know what the people of California are going to get in=20
return?"
?????In objecting to the PUC taking action, Burton is bucking Davis, who=20
still supports the agreement he reached with Edison.
?????"We would like to see the PUC consider the items as quickly as they=20
can," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor.
?????Craver said that without PUC action by the deadline, Edison would feel=
=20
free to walk away from the agreement, though it is not clear what other=20
options the utility has. Various state lawmakers are exploring rescue plans=
=20
ranging from the state purchasing the company to having ratepayers pay for=
=20
the rescue. None of the plans appear to have a consensus.
?????One option would be for Edison "to stick with the program as long as w=
e=20
were seeing some hard evidence as to what the PUC was doing and what would =
be=20
on their next agenda," said Stephen E. Pickett, vice president and general=
=20
counsel at the utility.
?????Creditors listening to the conference call clearly were disturbed by t=
he=20
turn of events and immediately peppered Edison executives with questions=20
about whether this development would push the utility closer to bankruptcy.
?????"We are not really in a position to speculate on that at this time,"=
=20
Craver said. "We will have to see what takes place," he added.
?????Nellwyn Voorhies, a San Diego lawyer who represents Edison bondholders=
,=20
said she had not seen the PUC agenda, but held out hope that there still=20
would be a way for the rescue plan to move forward. Still, she said she was=
=20
concerned by Friday's news, as well as the $9-million lien the city of Long=
=20
Beach recently won to attach Edison assets.
?????"Anything that leads us to believe that the memorandum of understandin=

won't be implemented is an incremental step that makes it more likely that=

someone will file for bankruptcy, either the debtor or a creditor," Voorhie=
s=20
said.
?????Voorhies said the legal move by Long Beach was worrisome because it=20
could keep the $9 million in assets away from other Edison creditors. As a=

result, she said, the attachment raises the likelihood of a creditor making=
=20
an involuntary bankruptcy filing.
?????With a bankruptcy filing, the $9 million in assets "could be distribut=

to all creditors, rather than just the one who attached them," she said.
?????Edison officials have maintained that they would do everything possibl=

to avoid following the footsteps of the Northern California utility Pacific=

Gas & Electric, which filed for bankruptcy court protection in April.
?????Both companies have come to the brink of financial ruin from soaring=

?????Though PG&E chose to file for bankruptcy protection, Edison reached a=

"memorandum of understanding" with the governor that could bail out the=20

$2.8 billion. The utility also would be able to issue ratepayer-secured bon=

to pay off $3.5 billion of debt piled up from purchasing electricity at=20

?????Craver and other executives said there was still a chance that the PUC=

Last August, more than two dozen employees at the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission were summoned to a conference room and told to find the cause of=
 a=20
dramatic run-up in electricity prices plaguing California and threatening=
=20
other states.=20
For California, the stakes could not have been higher.=20
Its utilities were amassing huge debts. Horrified consumers in San Diego sa=
w=20
their power bills triple. And in the Bay Area, a June scorcher brought the=
=20
first blackouts.=20
Ron Rattey, a respected FERC economist, scanned the room skeptically. With =
a=20
knot in his stomach, he realized he was one of just a few employees=20
experienced at in-depth market analysis -- and the group was being given ju=
st=20
three months.=20
``It was ludicrous,'' he said.=20
In the end, the group's Nov.?1 report largely detailed the well-known cause=
s=20
of the high prices -- a hot summer, more demand, less power available from=
=20
other states -- without answering the most sensational question: Were energ=
y=20
traders manipulating the state's newly deregulated market?=20
And FERC's commissioners, reviewing the report, turned down California's pl=
ea=20
for a cap on Western electricity prices.=20
The probe underscored the limitations of FERC, a little-known agency charge=
d=20
with regulating wholesale electricity prices.=20
Through interviews with FERC employees and reviews of documents, the Mercur=

?FERC lacks enough qualified employees to make sure that the savvy players =

the nation's highly complex, new electricity markets are not artificially=

?The agency's collegial relationship with companies it regulates makes it=

reluctant to demand crucial market data. It shuns the use of subpoenas and=
=20
did not back up California when the state issued subpoenas.=20
?Energy companies have derailed probes with a phone call, but when one=20
complained about a document leaked to the media, FERC interrogated 40=20
employees about it.=20
FERC's former chairman, James Hoecker, and its current chairman, Curtis=20
H,bert Jr., both say FERC does a good job with the powers and resources it=
=20
has. And Joe Bob Perkins, CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, said=20
generators are ``absolutely not'' receiving favorable treatment from FERC.=
=20
But Hoecker believes the agency needs more power. ``It can't be in a=20
situation where it is begging the industry for information,'' he said.=20
Rattey, a 26-year veteran, argues that FERC is not taking advantage of the=
=20
powers it has. At the request of senior FERC staff members, he wrote a=20
postmortem report on the market investigation and concluded: ``The=20
investigation was not well thought out, poorly designed and lacked a sense =
of=20
urgency and direction until its last few weeks.''=20
Not until January, more than two years after warnings that the markets were=
=20
vulnerable to manipulation, did FERC acquire the computers they needed to=
=20
track energy trading.=20
``This is a difficult time,'' said Daniel Larcamp, the FERC official charge=
d=20
with watching the markets. ``It's not going to happen overnight. We are=20
moving in the right direction.''=20
Order to investigate=20
The investigation began with a July 26 order from the commissioners to=20
uncover what caused prices to leap to record levels in California and to lo=
ok=20
at problems nationwide. Last June, prices hit $750 per megawatt-hour for=20
three days straight. The year before, electricity prices in the West averag=
ed=20
about $28 and had spiked higher than $100 only once.=20
FERC chose two people to lead the investigation: Andrea Wolfman, a longtime=
=20
lawyer at the agency, and W. Scott Miller, a former industry executive. Eac=
h=20
brought strengths to the probe, but each also illustrated some of FERC's=20
vulnerabilities in its attempts to grapple with a complex market.=20
Wolfman is highly respected within the agency, but her expertise is not=20
electricity markets. She has spent much of her career dealing with natural=
=20
gas issues.=20
Miller brought expertise. He had just left a $230,000-a-year job with one o=
f=20
the prime players in the electricity market, the power-generating subsidiar=
y=20
of PG&E Corp.=20
``Who better to look than someone who knows what is happening in the=20
marketplace?'' asked Larcamp, Miller's boss. Miller heads a key FERC office=
=20
when it comes to monitoring the market and investigating abuses.=20
But utility officials were suspicious that he would favor generating=20
companies.=20
Both Miller and Wolfman declined to comment on their investigation.=20
As the probe started, Miller and others met with utility representatives,=
=20
including Southern California Edison's Gary Stern, who wrote an 11-page roa=
d=20
map for how to investigate generators. He described ways to game the market=
,=20
including: overloading transmission lines, filing false power schedules,=20
shutting down plants and demanding top dollar for emergency power. And he=
=20
advised FERC on how to track them.=20
But FERC did not follow this blueprint, according to Stern and Rattey.=20
Stern said that when he talked to Miller about companies with sufficient=20
market power to affect prices, Miller used a definition of market power tha=
t=20
generators prefer, which limits it to companies that can affect prices for =
an=20
extended period of time.=20
``That sort of gave me a clue as to where he is heading on this,'' Stern=20
said. ``He's trying to find ways not to find market power.''=20
Team lacked key members=20
Market investigations cannot be done without a team of economists trained t=
o=20
understand the voluminous data that could reveal manipulation, unfair=20
advantages and what economists call ``imperfect competition,'' said Paul=20
Joscow, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology=
=20
who is widely recognized as one of the top experts in the field.=20
But no such team was assembled for FERC's probe.=20
``The FERC staff is very well-intentioned and they work hard. But I think=
=20
they are understaffed in the way of economic analysis,'' Joscow said.=20
Larcamp said FERC has a hard time competing for the talent it needs when=20
energy companies pay much higher salaries. Traders can make up to $130,000.=
=20
FERC salaries have gone up 21 percent since 1997, but they still average=20
about $80,000.=20
In the closing weeks of the investigation, FERC did add three senior=20
economists to the team. Recognizing that the report was thin on expert=20
analysis, one of the new economists tried to keep his name off the report,=
=20
and another was uncomfortable having his name on it, according to Rattey an=
d=20
another FERC source.=20
All three economists declined to be interviewed.=20
Data requests fall short=20
Even if FERC had put together a team of crackerjack economists, it would ha=
ve=20
needed comprehensive market data and ample time to discover whether traders=
=20
were exploiting the market.=20
In his postmortem report, Rattey complained that the agency's requests for=
=20
data were unclear. And he said FERC failed to collect data on specific=20
transactions and detailed supply-and-demand data.=20
FERC also chose to request data from just a dozen major firms, rather than=
=20
the scores of companies Rattey hoped to review.=20
The results, Rattey wrote, were ``superficial analyses.''=20
What little he did find, though, intrigued him. Prices in California were=
=20
much higher -- 65 percent higher in June -- than expected under normal=20
competitive conditions. The average cost of electricity on the spot market =
in=20
June, $324 a megawatt-hour, was twice the cost to produce it.=20
``If we had the data and the staff to evaluate the data,'' Rattey said, ``I=
=20
think we would have found that the players in the market -- the generators=
=20
and power marketers -- were able to game the system. And we'd see the games=
=20
they were playing.''=20
Generating companies have repeatedly denied that they manipulate the market=
s.=20
This wasn't the first time Rattey had run into this problem. The agency has=
 a=20
poor track record of demanding trading data -- the EKG of a commodities=20
market -- from companies it regulates.=20
When price spikes occurred in the Midwest in summer 1998 and in the Midwest=
=20
and Northeast in summer 1999, Rattey investigated. In both cases, he lost=
=20
battles to get the data he needed because energy companies bucked him, and=
=20
his bosses were reluctant to press the issue.=20
Last June, before the California investigation, an exasperated Rattey=20
e-mailed the entire FERC staff.=20
``The commission appears to have taken the tact (sic) (consciously or=20
unconsciously) that industry should police itself,'' he wrote. ``If FERC=20
staff has no ability to ferret out wrongdoing .?.?. how can FERC expect=20
market participants to undertake the effort?''=20
Former FERC engineer Judy Cardell confirmed that there are at least five=20
instances she knows of, or was involved in, where senior staff members=20
derailed requests for data after company officials complained. An associate=
=20
still at the agency confirmed her account.=20
``A number of people in FERC did not want to overburden the utilities or th=
e=20
people in the industry with these requests,'' Cardell said.=20
H,bert, the chairman, said he has started to negotiate with an industry=20
organization, the North American Electric Reliability Council, to get=20
detailed data on electricity transactions. But the talks -- recommended by=
=20
FERC staff members for three years -- could take time. Gene Gorzelnik, the=
=20
group's spokesman, said members want their names kept confidential. That=20
could hamper FERC's ability to use the data for enforcement.=20
Getting information=20
The industry has resisted efforts to collect data, arguing that leaks of=20
competitive information could hurt companies in a business based on thin=20
differences in prices.=20
FERC can subpoena data, but a spokesman said the last time it used a subpoe=

in a non-judicial investigation was 1985. In fact, FERC officials could=20

FERC has sat on a request from California's Public Utilities Commission=20
seeking help with its subpoenas. In August, the PUC subpoenaed pricing data=

from generators. It sent a second round of subpoenas a month later. In=20
November, the PUC asked FERC to force six major generators to turn over the=

information. The matter is still pending.=20
In documents filed with FERC, the PUC said that without this data, ``there=

Agency officials say the requests are overly broad. ``The CPUC was on a wit=

said.=20
Besides resorting to subpoenas, the commissioners can also ask the agency's=

``We do have enough resources, and we are handling it in a way that's=20

nt=20
supporter of free markets, he said FERC's primary job is to create a=20
competitive market for electricity and keep the lights on. Low prices will=
=20

But James Hoecker, FERC's chairman when California adopted its plan, has=20
become more critical of the decisions the agency made under his leadership=
=20
and now says FERC should have more aggressively scrutinized the plan rather=
=20
than moving it along.=20
``I would very much have liked for the commission to be more prepared for=
=20
California,'' he said.=20
FERC has a responsibility to rule on deregulation plans because, under a=20
66-year-old federal law, it regulates wholesale electricity. The law says t=
he=20
agency must ensure that wholesale prices are ``just and reasonable,'' thoug=
h=20
neither Congress nor the courts have made clear what that means in a=20
deregulated market.=20
For decades, FERC's responsibilities were much simpler. The agency set rate=
s=20
for wholesale electricity using a formula based on generating costs plus a=
=20
fair profit.=20
But the agency took steps to change its role in the early '80s, when it=20
helped set into motion the forces that would lead to California's=20
deregulation. In 1982, two years after President Reagan's election, a FERC=
=20
lawyer named Robert Angyal wrote an internal memo assuring commissioners th=
at=20
the ambiguity of ``just and reasonable'' gave them ample room to experiment=
=20
with free-market sales of electricity.=20
``We thought we were the good guys then,'' said Steve Greenleaf, who joined=
=20
the agency in 1986 as a regulatory specialist. Greenleaf, who now works for=
=20
California's power grid operator, said recent events ``certainly make me go=
=20
back and consider what we did.''=20
What he and others did was clear a path for the deregulation bandwagon. FER=
C=20
commissioners, generating companies, utilities and politicians -- both=20
Democrats and Republicans -- all argued that competition could both reduce=
=20
rates and boost profits, just as it had for natural gas, airlines and other=
=20
markets.=20
In 1992, Congress passed a law encouraging open access. FERC took the next=
=20

er=20
kitchen table one morning to begin drafting Order 888, named after the=20
agency's address in Washington, D.C.=20

s=20
by requiring utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power=

Daniel Fessler, a former University of California-Davis law professor=20

=20
Wilson, drafted California's deregulation plan in the mid-'90s. In a brief=

=20
on the plan and testified several times before the commission.=20
``Our dialogue was extremely public,'' he said.=20
But FERC officials say the agency took a hands-off approach, despite=20
conducting hearings and receiving thousands of documents.=20
Hoecker, who took over from Moler in June 1997, said the agency viewed=20
California's plan as an experiment that raised questions that could not be=
=20
answered until it was in place. ``Fundamentally, the commission took the=20
stance that no one had experience in the United States anyway with this=20

At several crucial junctures, the agency's commissioners passed on the chan=
ce=20
to explore the advice of critics, both academic and in-house, that could ha=

One of the nation's top experts on electricity deregulation, Bill Hogan of=

California's plan slip by them at FERC's summer 1996 hearings.=20
San Diego Gas & Electric, the state's third-largest investor-owned utility,=

report offers a blueprint for some of what eventually would go wrong.=20
Flaws in the plan=20

aspects of the plan: a market structure that made it possible for companies=

At a hearing, the San Diego utility's chairman presented Hogan's paper to t=

California could meet a start-up date of January 1998.=20
State lawmakers and other energy executives told San Diego to get on board =

The deep concerns of the staff members, however, were never impressed on th=

Mr. Bush, however, says such caps will only make the state's energy problem=

are opposed to price caps, controls will lead to worse shortages. The logic=

for this is simple: If power companies can't earn a decent return on their=

Indeed, government efforts to cap prices have a long history of failure. As=

early as 301 A.D., Roman Emperor Diocletian imposed economywide price=20
controls. The move led to mass shortages and he ended up abdicating four=20

A more recent -- and far more vivid -- example of how price controls can=20
backfire occurred during the 1970s when the federal government limited the=

But Mr. Kahn and other pro-control economists say California's problems are=

But that is not happening in California's wholesale electricity market for=

several reasons. First, it takes nearly two years for new power plants to=
=20
come on line, so energy supplies remain constrained. Meanwhile, consumers=
=20
aren't cutting back their electricity use, because their rates are capped.=
=20
That has led to a price squeeze and shortages.=20
Pro-control economists say the small group of power producers who run the=

plants that supply California with energy are exacerbating the problem by=

deliberately holding power off the market, forcing prices -- and their=20

Frank Wolak, a professor at Stanford University. (The power producers dispu=

Temporary price caps, Mr. Kahn and other pro-cap economists say, would soft=

These economists add that they can avoid the pitfalls of the past by settin=
