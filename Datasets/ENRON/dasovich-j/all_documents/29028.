Here is what IEP submitted.  As I said, this has been going on for two 
years.  I'll talk to Steven Kelly about the current status and whether IEP is 
considering legal action.

		 Subject: DRAFT IEP COMMENTS RELATED TO CEC DATA COLLECTION PROPOSALS


As reported to the IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee, the CEC held a workshop
recently to discussed proposed regulatory language to implement the CEC's
Data Report.  This activity is part of a two-year process to implement data
collection and information reporting protocols by the CEC.  The protocols
affect generators as well as load serving entities.

IEP raised a number of concerns during the Workshop regarding the CEC's
proposed language.  It is important that we put these concerns into the
public record as soon as possible.  Attached are IEP's draft Comments on
this matter.  Unless I hear from folks with serious concerns, I propose to
file comments by COB  today, Tuesday, July 17.  Please contact me ASAP with
any comments, concerns, etc.
