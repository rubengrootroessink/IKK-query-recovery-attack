Energy rebate may reward ex-gluttons
By Edie Lau
Bee Science Writer=20
(Published June 8, 2001)

When it comes to saving electricity, the hard truth is that the more=20
extravagant your past power use, and the more money you're willing to inves=
t=20
in energy-efficiency, the more likely you can conserve a lot -- and perhaps=
=20
be rewarded with a rebate for your efforts.=20
California's "20/20 Program," which began this month, gives a 20 percent=20
discount to most power users who use at least 20 percent less electricity=
=20
this summer than last summer.=20
The offer applies to customers of the investor-owned utilities -- Pacific G=
as=20
and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric C=
o.=20
People served by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and other public=
=20
utilities are not eligible. However, Roseville is funding its own program=
=20
modeled after the state's, with one key difference: Customers get a 10=20
percent discount for cutting their power use by 10 percent.=20
Roseville chose a more modest goal to enable more people to be successful,=
=20
said Bernie Fargen, city utility spokesman.=20
"We looked at the state's program," he said, "and it appeared to us that=20
customers were either going to have to make a major investment in some majo=
r=20
energy consumer in their home -- it could be replacing a refrigerator or=20
replacing their air conditioner -- or they were going to have to reduce=20
consumption through conservation ... at a level that would cause some major=
=20
comfort sacrifice."=20
Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who established the 20/20=
=20
program by executive order, said the governor hopes all Californians will c=
ut=20
back at least 10 percent. The rebate, he said, is meant for those who "go=
=20
above and beyond the call of duty."=20
More to the point, the issue is not moral, but practical. "The people who=
=20
have been conserving all along are the true heroes in this situation,"=20
Salazar said. "We're in a tough situation here; unfortunately, we have to g=
o=20
where the megawatts are. It's a sad truth that most of the megawatts we can=
=20
save ... are going to come from those who've been energy guzzlers."=20
Chris and Shannon Devine of Chico are among those who historically have use=
d=20
little electricity. They turn off all unnecessary lights in their two-bedro=
om=20
apartment, and set the thermostat at 82 in summer.=20
Now, Chris Devine said, it feels like they're being penalized. "To think=20
about conserving now, what are we going to do? Any hotter in the apartment,=
=20
and we can't sleep. Any less lights, and we'll be in the dark."=20
Still, he said he understands the state's needs. "We're not the people=20
they're after."=20
The state estimates that if one out of 10 Californians cut power use by 20=
=20
percent this summer, the savings in electricity costs will equal between $4=
00=20
million and $1.3 billion.=20
The Hathaway family in Rocklin has its sights set on the rebate and has=20
invested heavily to save electricity.=20
The biggest expenses: erecting a large patio cover to shade the south and=
=20
west sides of the house ($5,000); installing a whole-house fan ($1,000); an=
d=20
replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents ($150).=20
The family also unscrewed a bunch of unnecessary light bulbs (there are thr=
ee=20
bathrooms, each with a vanity mirror ringed by 10 bulbs); turns off porch=
=20
lights except when company's coming; closes the blinds during the day; uses=
=20
the clothes and dishwashers for full loads only; and has unplugged two of=
=20
three VCRs.=20
The savings have been huge. Robin Hathaway's records show they used 42=20
percent less electricity this April than last April; and 21.5 percent less =
in=20
May.=20
It's not just for the money that the family has altered its power=20
consumption. "We just want to feel like we're doing our part," Hathaway sai=
d.=20
"In the long run, who says this (energy shortage) is going to go away?"=20
The state rebate offer stands from June through September. Utility company=
=20
customers who save 20 percent or more will get an automatic 20 percent=20
discount on each month's bill. (San Diego customers, who saw the state's=20
first price spikes last summer, need save only 15 percent to get the rebate=
,=20
a nod to the conservation they achieved last year.)=20
In Roseville, those who wish to participate must sign up by June 30; bill=
=20
credits will be available after summer. Details are available by calling=20

In Sacramento, SMUD considered offering a similar rebate, but decided to=20

PG&E may pay small creditors first, execs say

The Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to expand the low-income=

ratepayers.=20
"It is critical that we act to provide relief to these most vulnerable=20

The PUC delayed action on a proposal to order the state's two largest=20

Money previously allocated by the Legislature to help low-income users woul=

WASHINGTON -- A widely criticized federal order to limit California power=
=20
prices significantly reduced rates for last-minute electricity purchases=20
during two power emergencies last week, new data show.=20
Also Thursday, more evidence emerged of a broad downward trend in Californi=
a=20
energy prices--well beyond what can be attributed to the consequences of=20
government intervention.=20
The unexpectedly positive data on the initial effect of the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission's price limits immediately touched off a stormy debat=
e.=20
The agency's besieged chairman claimed vindication. But critics said=20
electrical generators were already finding loopholes in the price limits an=
d=20
argued that the order needs more toughening to be truly effective.=20
The FERC order--which went into effect May 29--resulted in a 64% cut in the=
=20
wholesale price of power immediately after an emergency was declared the ne=
xt=20
day, according to data posted on the California Independent System Operator=
's=20
Internet site.=20
Prices dropped from $300 per megawatt-hour just before noon to $108.47 the=
=20
following hour after Cal-ISO, the state's power grid operator, declared an=
=20
official emergency that triggered the federal price limits.=20
A similar scenario unfolded during another declared emergency on May 31.=20
Prices dropped from $187 per megawatt-hour before the emergency declaration=
=20
to $66.51 immediately after.=20
During the May 31 emergency, power plant owners in California began selling=
=20
more electricity to out-of-state buyers. That electricity can later be sold=
=20
back to the state by out-of-state marketers, who are not as tightly=20
controlled by FERC's order. Market watchers call that "megawatt laundering.=
"=20
"We saw an increase in exports pretty quickly as a result of that" FERC=20
order, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water=20
Resources, in an interview. "So that clearly shows they're looking for ways=
=20
around it. As soon as they export it, they bring it right back through a=20
marketer, and then the marketer has a price that's not challengeable under=
=20
the FERC order."=20
FERC Chairman Curt Hebert disputed that, saying the agency can order=20
marketers to justify their prices.=20
Meanwhile, the continued across-the-board drop in California power prices i=
s=20
beginning to attract at least as much attention as the controversy over=20
FERC's actions.=20
According to analysts at Platts Electric Utility Week, which monitors the=
=20
industry, forward-looking prices for August delivery of electricity in=20
Southern California have fallen 69% since April. Prices for August=20
electricity stood at $220 per megawatt-hour on Wednesday, down from $700 in=
=20
April.=20
The figures are significant because they apply to purchases made under=20
long-term fixed contracts, not just the emergency purchases made by Cal-ISO=
=20
and subject to the FERC order.=20
Market watchers at Natural Gas Week reported that gas prices at a key=20
pipeline junction on the California -Arizona border had dropped=20
precipitously. Prices fell from $8.16 per million British thermal units on=
=20
Wednesday to $5.93 at the close of business Thursday--a 27% plunge in one=
=20
day.=20
High natural gas rates have been widely blamed for aggravating California '=
s=20
power crisis, since gas is the fuel most commonly used by electricity=20
generators.=20
At FERC, a small federal agency that functions like a national utility=20
commission, Hebert said the lower prices during last week's power emergenci=
es=20
show that the commission's efforts are finally paying off.=20
"Thus far, what we are seeing is that the price mitigation order is bringin=
g=20
real-time prices down, which is exactly what I said it would do," Hebert sa=
id=20
in an interview.=20
But Cal-ISO officials said it was too soon to break out the champagne.=20
Indeed, the state is threatening to sue Hebert's agency for not doing enoug=
h=20
to restore "just and reasonable" prices in California .=20
"It is too early to make any conclusions at this point," said Stephanie=20
McCorkle, a Cal-ISO spokeswoman. "We just feel we need more days of=20
emergencies to see how it is really working."=20
And there were signs that generators were looking for ways to sidestep the=
=20
FERC order.=20
The federal order relies on a complex formula to limit the price power plan=
t=20
owners can charge whenever the state's electricity reserves are depleted. T=
he=20
maximum price allowed in any given hour can vary according to factors=20
included in a formula. The FERC order requires California generators to off=
er=20
all their available power for sale when Cal-ISO declares an emergency.=20
But by contracting to sell electricity a day or more in advance, generators=
=20
can essentially tell Cal-ISO they have no power available to sell in an=20
emergency. Such a maneuver becomes all the more attractive if prices being=
=20
paid in surrounding states are higher than the controlled price offered in=
=20
California during an emergency.=20
Mike Wilczek, a senior market reporter for Platts, said that on Wednesday o=
f=20
last week, when the first emergency was declared under the FERC order,=20
generators were unsure how to respond. But by the second emergency on=20
Thursday, a strategy seemed to be emerging.=20
"People were selling ahead to try to get away from the order," Wilczek said=
.=20
"They wanted to avoid being 'mitigated.' In the northern part of California=
 ,=20
we saw some hours in which the ISO couldn't get any offers, even when they=
=20
[generators] were being forced to sell into the ISO."=20
Hart said his market watchers observed the same ploy. The Department of Wat=
er=20
Resources is purchasing power for the state's financially hobbled utilities=
.=20
Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento) said FERC needs to toughen the order by=20
extending it to all hours--not just periods covered by power emergencies--a=
nd=20
to every Western state. Ose said his proposal is picking up support among=
=20
Republicans who oppose Democratic demands for FERC to impose fixed price ca=
ps=20
on wholesale electricity in the West.=20
"The evidence is that the FERC order is working," Ose said. "If it works,=
=20
then let's use it. They need to take their order and extend it. Let's take =
it=20
to all the Western states. Twenty-four/seven coverage needs to be in there=
=20
also."=20
Paul Joskow, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who supports=
=20
temporary price caps, said strengthening the FERC order may prove to be a=
=20
workable compromise to rein in costs for the rest of the summer. "It's=20
getting late in the game, and expanding the number of hours of mitigating,=
=20
making sure there aren't loopholes, would be a very productive thing to do,=
"=20
he said.=20
FERC Chairman Hebert said the commission plans to review the order, but he=

would not commit in advance to suggested changes. "My position as chairman =
is=20
not to follow House or Senate members, or anybody else, but to do what is i=

the best interest of America," he said.=20
Meanwhile, power generators complained the FERC order is forcing them to se=

Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). Its future in the Assembly is uncertain.=20
Kuehl said saving money for Universal, an influential enterprise that makes=

She said that if Universal's power bills were to go down, bills for other=

"How do we expect other businesses and other residents of California to=20

between Southern California Edison Co. and the Los Angeles Department of=20

IT'S TIME to get tough in solving the state's energy crisis. Billions of=20

The measure would set a base of $60 per megawatt (the amount of electricity=

After months of lamenting California 's weak position in tackling the state=

With electricity prices at their lowest level in more than a year and natur=

gas prices down from record highs, Davis said in a meeting with The=20

But Davis cautioned that the state still faces a difficult summer of possib=

rolling blackouts, and said consumers and businesses must do their utmost t=
o=20
conserve power or be at the mercy of out-of-state generators.=20
The governor moved to protect one industry that has loudly complained about=
=20
the prospect of blackouts, asking Loretta Lynch, president of the state=20
Public Utilities Commission, to exempt oil refineries from rolling outages.=
=20
Davis made the request after being told last week by Chevron Corp. that it=

would cut production at its two California refineries to match the amount o=
f=20
electricity they can generate on their own during blackouts.=20
Another refinery owner, Valero Energy Corp., has no backup power at its=20
Benicia refinery and has warned that any blackout could shut it down for=20

Industry analysts have estimated that nearly one-third of California 's=20
petroleum output is endangered by power failures. The threat of less gasoli=

sufficient to get the governor's quick attention.=20
In a letter to the PUC president, he asked that refineries be considered=20
"essential-use customers" and thus exempt from rolling blackouts.=20
The PUC's Lynch said last night that the commission "will take a very hard=

Chevron and Valero officials said they were pleased with the governor's=20

Folwarkow said he and Rich Marcogliese, general manager of Valero's Benicia=

refinery, had met briefly with Davis on Monday to make their case.=20
'MOST CHALLENGING ISSUE'=20
In his meeting at The Chronicle, Davis emphasized that he inherited a flawe=
d=20
deregulation blueprint when he took office and has been forced to come up=
=20
with solutions to the problem.=20
"This is the most challenging issue any governor has faced in 50 years," he=
=20
said. "I think we're making progress."=20
The governor credited himself with streamlining construction of new power=

plants and promoting conservation.=20
At the same time, he said he has "shamed" power companies that have reaped=

huge profits at the expense of California utilities and consumers -- and no=

the state itself, which is more than $8 billion in the hole from electricit=
y=20
purchases.=20
"These people are not good citizens," Davis said of the generators. "They=

want to drive us into a grave."=20
Nevertheless, he said California has stood its ground and is now "on the=20
verge of breaking the back of the spot market," where electricity has been=
=20
sold at prices as high as $1,900 per megawatt hour.=20
CITES LONG-TERM CONTRACTS=20
The governor said 38 long-term power contracts signed by the state Departme=
nt=20
of Water Resources were largely responsible for the recent plunge in=20
wholesale electricity prices.=20
By reducing the state's demand in the spot market, he argued, power compani=
es=20
were forced to compete for buyers, which helped push electricity prices=20
lower.=20
"That's maybe one factor," responded Paul Patterson, an energy- industry=20
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. "But there's more going =
on=20
than that."=20
He said the tumble in electricity prices -- to as low as $50 per megawatt=
=20
hour this week from more than $500 -- is mainly attributable to more power=
=20
plants returning to service, increased output from dams and mild weather,=
=20
which reduces the need for air conditioning.=20
The drop in electricity demand caused a commensurate decline in natural gas=
=20
prices. Natural gas is the fuel that runs most power plants in the West.=20
PREMATURE VICTORY DECLARATION=20
Patterson said Davis may be premature in announcing that California 's war=
=20
with high power costs is all but over.=20
"The battle may have turned, but it's way too early to declare victory over=

Or over the power companies. Davis said he will be briefed by Attorney=20
General Bill Lockyer on Monday about the state's investigation into illegal=

MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WARNED=20
Davis also reiterated his threat to seize excess power from California=20
municipal utility districts, which he said have gouged ratepayers even more=
=20
severely than Texas energy titans such as Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc.=20
To prove his point, he revealed that municipal utilities charged the state =
an=20
average of $360 per megawatt hour during peak usage, whereas out-of-state=
=20
generators were charging $310.=20
But Jerry Jordan, executive director of the California Municipal Utilities=
=20
Association in Sacramento, said Davis apparently does not realize that most=
=20
municipal utilities are merely reselling unused power that they themselves=

had to purchase on the spot market.=20
"If we have to pay $450 on the market, we can't sell it to him for $300,"=

Jordan said.=20

Voltage-reduction project may stave off blackouts=20

In a move that could significantly reduce the risk of blackouts in Californ=
ia=20
this summer, a group of scientists working with the state's three major=20
utilities has begun testing a plan to conserve large amounts of electricity=
=20
by slightly reducing the voltage on the power grid.=20
The theory, known as ``conservation voltage regulation,'' is familiar to al=
l=20
motorists: Lift your foot from the accelerator and your car saves fuel.=20
If successful -- an early small-scale trial was encouraging -- the idea cou=

=20
the lights on or off on some hot days. Yet state regulators must overcome=
=20
fears about potential damage to appliances, and the loss of some profit to=
=20
utilities, which would sell less electricity.=20
``It's a big deal. I think it's very promising,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, a=
=20
board member of the California Energy Commission and a physicist at Lawrenc=
e=20
Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley.=20
Thursday, Rosenfeld held a conference call to plan tests with representativ=
es=20
of Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edision, San Diego Gas &=20
Electric, the governor's office and the Public Utilities Commission.=20
Utility representatives agreed to spend the next two weeks testing their=20
substations to measure the feasibility of the idea, he said.=20
Under the plan, California's major utilities would reduce the voltage=20
delivered to homes and businesses from the present level of 120 volts, to=
=20
perhaps 118 volts or 116 volts.=20
Such a slight drop would cause almost no noticeable change on appliances an=
d=20
computers, but could dim some lights, supporters of the idea say. Meanwhile=
,=20
it also could save between 400 to 1,000 megawatts of electricity. Put in=20
perspective, that is enough energy for 300,000 to 750,000 homes, or the=20
equivalent of instantly creating one or two new power plants.=20
``We believe that even if customers have to suffer through some low voltage=
s,=20
it might be better than having the power out,'' with stuck elevators and=20
darkened traffic lights, said Ron Ferree, director of grid operations for=
=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Last Friday, Edison tested the idea by turning down the voltage 4 percent, =
to=20
about 117 volts, at a substation in Riverside County, for 15 minutes. It=20
received no consumer complaints and reduced power demand about 2 percent, h=
e=20
said.=20
Edison can make the change by radio control. PG&E, which did not return cal=
ls=20
Thursday, would have to manually adjust hundreds of substations.=20
Some experts are wary about potential pitfalls.=20
Home appliances, computers and other equipment are normally rated to run be=
st=20
at about 115 volts. If voltage is dropped too low, say below 110 volts, it=
=20
can damage appliances by overheating motors.=20
``If you permanently lower the voltage, you are subjecting your motors and=
=20
compressors and appliances to greater stress and strain,'' said Ken Giles, =
a=20
press officer for the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission. ``That will=
=20
raise temperatures and can burn out motors.''=20
The key question: Can utilities turn down the voltage just a bit to prevent=
=20
blackouts, while not going too far?=20
``So long as you don't bring anybody's voltage down enough to damage their=
=20
equipment, it will work,'' said Julian Ajello, supervisor for gas and=20
electric safety at the Public Utilities Commission.=20
``You should aim not to go below 114 volts, with 110 as rock bottom,'' he=
=20
said.=20
In 1978, during a previous energy crisis, Ajello helped write the rule that=
=20
set the operating range for California's grid at between 114 and 120 volts.=
=20
Back then, the state saved energy by reducing the top range, which was 126=
=20

The change reduced energy consumption in California 3 to 5 percent, a savin=

PG&E scientists were working in April with Bill Wattenburg, a nuclear=20

Wattenburg, who also hosts a show on KGO radio, was testing an electric=20

During the tests, the researchers began turning down the voltage to=20

equipment.=20
``We took them down from 120 volts,'' Wattenburg said, ``all the way to 90=

Wattenburg said he realized that small changes in voltage, perhaps down to=

``Here's a way to give the governor the equivalent of a new power plant or=

official emergency that triggered the federal price limits.=20
A similar scenario unfolded during another declared emergency on May 31.=20
Prices dropped from $187 per megawatt-hour before the emergency declaration=
=20
to $66.51 immediately after.=20
Still, the continued, across-the-board drop in California power prices is=
=20
beginning to attract at least as much attention as the controversy over=20
FERC's actions.=20
According to analysts at Platts Electric Utility Week, which monitors the=

Southern California have fallen 69 percent since April. Prices for August=
=20
electricity stood at $220 per megawatt-hour on Wednesday, down from $700 in=

The figures are significant because they apply to purchases made under=20

=20
High natural-gas rates have been widely blamed for aggravating California's=
=20
power crisis, since gas is the fuel most commonly used by generators.=20
At FERC, Chairman Curt Hebert said the lower prices during last week's powe=

emergencies show that the commission's efforts are finally paying off.=20
"Thus far, what we are seeing is that the price-mitigation order is bringin=

real-time prices down, which is exactly what I said it would do," Hebert sa=

But Cal-ISO officials said it was too soon to break out the champagne.=20
Indeed, the state is threatening to sue Hebert's agency for not doing enoug=

"It is too early to make any conclusions at this point," said Stephanie=20
McCorkle, a Cal-ISO spokeswoman. "We just feel we need more days of=20

The FERC order requires California generators to offer all their available=

But by contracting to sell electricity a day or more in advance, generators=

can essentially tell Cal-ISO they have no power available to sell in an=20

California officials say the state is enjoying at least a brief respite fro=

sky-high wholesale electricity prices. But some of the relief is the result=
=20
of a combination of factors that may prove temporary.=20
The price of power solicited by the state's grid operator, needed to keep t=
he=20
system in balance, dipped to $85 a megawatt hour shortly after noon yesterd=
ay=20
before rising past $200 a few hours later. On many occasions in the past=20

of California.=20
But it is doubtful that the price dip represents a sea change in the overal=
l=20

California from the Pacific Northwest for the past two weeks as a result of=
=20
snow-melt runoff in the Snake River hydroelectric system. That runoff,=20
however, appears to be finished for the year.=20
It is anyone's guess how much water will be available to generate power=20
through the Columbia River basin that lies below the Snake system. Experts=
=20
aren't optimistic, as rainfall is at a 56-year low for the region.=20
Ray Hart, deputy director of California's Department of Water Resources, sa=
id=20
yesterday that recently signed power contracts reduced the average cost of=
=20
power under contract through 2005 to $84 a megawatt hour from the $86 a=20
megawatt hour that was cited in April. "We've been sharpening our pencils a=
ll=20
along through this," Mr. Hart said.=20
However, the $84 figure is still higher than the $79-a-megawatt-hour averag=
e=20
that was cited in March when Gov. Gray Davis announced the initial batch of=
=20
long-term agreements with generators. Deals negotiated since then had=20

For a 10-year period ending in 2010, the average price of power under state=
=20
contract appears relatively unchanged, falling to $60 a megawatt hour in Ma=

from $61 in April. Total generating capacity under contract increased to=20
10,950 megawatts from 9,725 megawatts, about one-quarter of the state's=20

It is still impossible to independently verify the average prices, because=

The state remains vulnerable to any new surges in spot-market prices. The=

$8.2 billion on purchases, with the money being borrowed from the state's=

municipal-bond issuance of as much as $13.4 billion later this year. To hel=
p=20
foot that bill, California electricity users were hit this month with the=

largest rate increase in state history.=20
The governor's office also said that energy-conservation efforts have=20
contributed to the recent fall in prices. It said demand was down 11% in Ma=
y=20
from May 2000. "It's been fairly remarkable how people have responded" to t=
he=20
governor's call to conserve, said the water agency's Mr. Hart.=20
However, that 11% figure is based on certain adjustments made by state=20
officials to take into account year-to-year differences in weather and=20
economic activity. Actual year-to-year demand fell only 4.8%, according=20
statistics supplied by the California Energy Commission. Some=20
private-industry analyses indicate that lower demand might have more to do=
=20
with milder weather than with active conservation.=20
"It's way premature to declare victory," said Joe Bob Perkins, head of=20
wholesale-power sales for Reliant Energy Inc., a big Houston-based power=20
