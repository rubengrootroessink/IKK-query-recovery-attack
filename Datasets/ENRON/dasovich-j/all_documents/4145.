I spoke with Jeff Dasovich yesterday.  He has a meeting with Gray Davis' 
Policy Director next Wednesday.  Jeff said it is a half hour who we are and 
what we want meeting with her.  I mentioned what we are looking for and why 
we think it would be valuable for Davis to get behind it.  Jeff was all over 
it especially since there are huge Davis - Chambers ties.  

Jeff asked for us to put together a one page, bullet point overview that he 
can give to her on Wed.  Definitely wants us to present it as a 
Cisco/Enron/PowerTek plan.  He thinks that the Cisco name will be crucial for 
us to beeline the process to obtain $$.  Jeff thinks that after she reviews 
this, we will have a good chance to meet with her or Davis folks to begin the 
process of obtaining funds.  However, Jeff thinks that the more we can drag 
Cisco into the mix, the better chances we have.

If we are going to put Cisco's name on this, you probably need to talk to 
your contacts before we move forward.  Call me to discuss.
