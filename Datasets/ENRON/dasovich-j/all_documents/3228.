Re: SDG&E, I don't think the timing is "right" to try to sell them a large 
amount of energy under a full requriements structure.  In fact, the timing 
might not ever be "right."  A few thoughts:

1.  Traders do not want to sell large quantities for long terms all at once.  
We have recently sold numerous 50 MW blocks to several munis in CA as well as 
PG&E.  That is the type of business with which we are most comfortable and we 
can be most profitable.  
2.  We do not generally want to sell shaped products where the quantity 
changes each hour according to a distribution representing load.  This is 
because we do not own generation and it is difficult to buy hourly 
quantities. Traders sell 25 MW blocks for peak and off peak hours.  Selling a 
"shape " that requires each hour's deliveries to differ from the previous one 
is difficult from a supply and scheduling perspective.
3.  We are working with SDG&E to try to put master agreements in place and 
still have some material contract issues to resolve.

For these reasons, I think it best that we do not aggressively promote the 
full requirements deal with SDG&E at this time. 

I want to bring this issue to some resolution for the time being so people 
are not waiting on us for someting.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Here is hourly load profile data from SDG&E.  If this is not hlpful or you 
need something different let me know.  Here is SDG&E's explanation about the 
load profile.

SDG&E developed the following 1999 static load profiles based upon a three 
(3) year average of electrical use (1994-1996). Rate class load estimates are 
presented in kWh and local time. Please be advised that except for the 
streetlighting class of customers, SDG&E no longer uses static load profiles. 
The static load profiles for 1999 are being provided to you at your request 
and are intended to be illustrative only. SDG&E does not warrant any 
information contained in the static load profiles nor does SDG&E ensure the 
accuracy of the static load profiles. You are solely responsible for your 
selection of these static load profiles provided to you by SDG&E and you are 
solely responsible for any results if they are used by you.
