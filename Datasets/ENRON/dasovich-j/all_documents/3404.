Dude,

Thanks for the abalone last night. Too bad we had to wash it down with that
discussion. Actually, wasn't so bad, really -- just a bit frusterating.
Anyway, let me know what I can do for Prentice's birthday. Do you want me to
go out there and check it out? Let me know about deposits and stuff like
that as well.

I'm sitting here in the new place in the 'Loin listening to that great
Mingus disk you got me. It's really amazing, a perfect compliment to sorting
out and organizing all my papers.

Hope you're having a good day.

Scott
