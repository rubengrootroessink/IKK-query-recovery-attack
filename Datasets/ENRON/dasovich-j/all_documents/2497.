The email just sent mentioned that SDG&E stated that the ALJ Ruling was =20
inappropriately applied to SDG&E.? The utility filed an Emergency Ex  Parte=
=20
Request to Commissioner Neeper requesting that they?should be =20
excluded?because:

"1)?SDG&E is not in the same financial situation as SCE and  PG&E, nor has =

regulatory environment as PG&E and SCE;

A thought occurs to me......is there anything to be gained with SDG&E  by=

having?WPTF file in support of their ex parte request and agree that  SDG&E=

should not be subject to the information request?
