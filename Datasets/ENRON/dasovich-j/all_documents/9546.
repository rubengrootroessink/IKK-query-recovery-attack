bottlenecks.? He does though indicate that to the  extent transportation=20
bottlenecks reside within state jurisdiction, the states  must similarly=20
undertake to improve their infrastructure.? With respect to California, he=
=20
indicated  that the Commission is responding as quickly as possible to any=
=20
applications to  construct new capacity, noting three certificate approvals=
=20
in the last seven  months for 118,000 Mcf/day.? On the  same page he exhort=

California officials to expedite considerations of  proposals to remove gas=

transportation bottlenecks within the state, which he  believes contributed=

to recent high prices in the Southern California area.? Touching on his bos=

theme, the  Chairman also speaks to the need for constructing a natural gas=
