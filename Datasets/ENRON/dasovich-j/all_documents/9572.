Haas-mates:
?
I'd like to take?a moment to invite you to the Haas Asia Business
Conference, happening  this Saturday.? As the subject line says, online
ticket sales end tonight at midnight. And while sales are going well, they  
haven't
gone as well as we would have liked within Haas -- 90% of our tickets
have been sold to alums and professionals.? So I'd like to take a  moment
of your time to explain what you will find at the ABC this Saturday.
?
For starters, we have a solid lineup of keynotes:Ta-Lin Hsu,  Chairman of
H&Q Asia Pacific; and?John Wadsworth, Honorary  Chairman of?Morgan Stanley 
Dean
Witter?Asia.?Dr. Hsu is known as the John Doerr of  Asia, and Mr. Wadsworth's 
achievements
are already familiar to many of you. We're fortunate to have  both of these 
gentlemen aboard.? 
More information is available at: http://www.haas-abc.org/details/keynote.asp
?
In addition, we have an outstanding lineup of panelists,  spread?across 6 
panels:
Biotech, E-Commerce, Entrepreneurship,  Technology/Manufacturing, Telecom & 
Wireless,
and Venture Capital. Some firms represented: NTT, Sun, Sony,  eSamsung, 
Sina.com,
TSMC, Ericsson, SSMB, and Walden International, among others.
For more info: http://www.haas-abc.org/details/panelists.asp
?
Did I mention the sponsor firms?? Our feature sponsors are MSDW  and
NEC Electronics; both will have booths on site. Other sponsors include  
Accenture,
Chevron, Lam Research, H&Q Asia Pacific, Toyota, and TSMC.
Why list the sponsors? We'll be sending them a resume book on CD after  this
is over. Guests who opt in to this can have their resume sent out to  every
sponsor and product fair firm.? Neat, huh?? I'll be first in  line.
For more sponsor info: http://www.haas-abc.org/details/sponsors.asp
?
But wait, there's more: thanks to our Product Fair  team,
we'll be the first Haas conference to plunk down a car in the  courtyard: the 
Toyota
Prius -- a hybrid gas/electric auto.? 70 mpg, in case  you're wondering.?
Also present: Creative Technologies (makers of the Nomad MP3  player), IBM 
(Almaden
Research Center), Kivera (location-based wireless services), and GetIT  
Multimedia.
for more info: http://www.haas-abc.org/details/product.asp?  (Worth it just 
for
the Flash movie.)
?
But wait -- there really is more.? An MP3 player raffle.  Sushi. Dim Sum. 
Giveaways
from The Body Shop, MSDW, Sina.com and Click2Asia.??And don't forget our very 
own Ipang Lin, erstwhile MBA01 who left to  launch a wireless startup in 
Beijing. He'll
be here as well. 
?
All this for the low low price of $25.? The kind of pricing that might  
inspire an investigation
into trade practices, if you ask me.? Your promotional code:  haasucb.
?
As I mentioned, online ticket sales stop at midnight tonight.? We'll  be in 
the courtyard tomorrow during
lunch.? So come by.? Pick up a ticket.? Trust me.? You  won't regret it.
?
And for those who love to wait 'til the last-minute: we will have tickets  
available Saturday
morning, at the slight premium of $30.? So save yourself 4.5 coffees  at 
Jimmy Beans. Buy
online tonight, or tomorrow in the  courtyard.? 
?
See you then.
