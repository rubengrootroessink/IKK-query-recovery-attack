Dude,

Next Wednesday, May 30. Let's see, the 12: the four of us, Nancy, Eldon,
then Molly, Sean, Chris, Kristina, Kent, Allison, and maybe scanky HO, and
her friend Stacey, or Riddles and his "girlfriend."

Listen, I just got back from ZYZZYVA and they want me to edit 3/4 of the new
issue--by Saturday, Tuesday AM at latest. I told them I'd get it to them by
Friday afternoon, so you know what that means. It's just that there are only
two people there, and you need fresh eyes to catch the small, but very
important, errors. I think they have someone else like me who does stuff,
but can't come through right now. Also, the deadline for application to the
Napa Valley Writer's Workshop is Friday, Nancy just told me. Then, my
Guardian article's due next week. I've never been this busy since I moved
here!! Pretty funny. But I'm sorry I can't make it. I do, however, pledge my
time to blue collar labor any and all days. Like, save the wood piles or
anything else 'til Saturday AM. Anyway, I guess because of that and
Prentice's strep, you can leave early.

Cheers, dude, and I'm bummed I'm not going early myself, playing golf, maybe
diving, and just chilling up there.

See you Friday!

LATE!
