At the Energy Committee meeting Monday we agreed to pursue proactive
development of an SVMG-sponsored Real Time Pricing proposal.

A meeting is scheduled for 1:00 PM Monday May 14 at Motorola prior to the
energy committee meeting to refine the draft proposal we discussed on Monday
(attached). The topic that has received the most discussion is how Historic
Load would be determined, and that will be the most important topic. We will
cover others as well.

Apart from many other issues, the ALJ's proposed decision on the CPUC's rate
increase did embrace the concept of a voluntary RTP program, and initiates
an effort to implement it as soon as possible.
