I think the implementation plan for the Res and Small Commercial makes good=
=20
sense.  This is good intelligence for preparing our curves and pricing=20
models; however, these customers are not our commercial focus and only tend=
=20
to show up as a few sites in a portfolio of sites.  SDG&E's plan was our=20
preferred plan to the extent that the Legislature or Commission had=20
implemented a mandatory rate cap for all size customers.

With respect to the larger opt-in customers, I expect that this is only=20
available to Standard Offer customers.  SDG&E should prevent cost shifting =
to=20
other customers who do not benefit from the cap, i.e. SO customers who do n=
ot=20
opt-in and DA customers who do not have the option.  Even customers who=20
opt-in will vary by differing degrees in terms of the size of the customer=
=20
and timeframe.  It seems to me, the only equitable implementation plan for=
=20
the opt-in customers is a customer-specific balancing account, similar to=
=20
that which is implemented for the balanced payment plan; otherwise too much=
=20
gaming will ensue which would result in the need for administratively=20
burdensome tracking.  To the extent that SDG&E makes all customers, includi=
ng=20
DA customers, pay for the undercollections, we can switch our customers to=
=20
Standard Offer without any negative ramifications.  (Note: It would be=20
difficult to exercise such a "regulatory switching option" if only those=20
customers who benefit incur a surcharge into the future, because our=20
customers would balk at us exercising the option during our contract term a=
nd=20
imposing a future liability on our customer beyond the contract term.)  In=
=20
fact, it might be better if all customers were expected to pay for the=20
undercollections so that we can exercise the regulatory switching option. =
=20
What do others think?  I think we can work with either implementation=20
method.  If it is a customer-specific balancing account, we will make=20
customers know that the lower rates is the equivalent to a loan they will=
=20
need to eventually pay off.  If it is all customers who are expected to pay=
,=20
we will exercise the regulatory switching option.  We need to be careful no=
t=20
to share too much of this strategy and insights with the utility, because=
=20
they will counter by imposing new rules and charges for switching customers=
=20
between DA and SO.

I don't believe that SDG&E's shareholders should be held accountable for a=
=20
percentage of the shortfalls.  This would provide a subsidy to SO service. =
 I=20
believe it is more important that customers realize that the utility's SO=
=20
service is not the right solution versus trying to drive the utility away=
=20
from SO service.  Either outcome works for us.

The last issue I will address is the timing of recovery of the=20
undercollections.  Will recovery begin during the period of the cap such th=
at=20
the cap will effectively be implemented as a freeze?  Or will the recovery=
=20
begin after the cap expires, resulting in otherwise higher future rates. =
=20
Defering cost recovery will always work to our advantage from a book=20
perspective.  The key for me is to know asap the details, so that we can=20
properly model our curves for pricing new deals and reflect the changes in=
=20
our book.  However, since these questions largely pertain to the smaller=20
customers in SDG&E's service territory, I do not anticipate a large impact =
on=20
our book and our marketing efforts.  In fact, I think the burdens of the=20
modeling changes would outweigh much of the benefits of this legislation fo=
r=20
us.

Thanks for the intelligence.

Governor has NOT signed AB 1156, $150 million from the general fund.  He HA=
S=20
signed AB 265 (SDG&E rate cap bill) and AB 970 (expedited siting for=20
non-permanent peaking).

I had a conversation today with Wayne Sakarias from SDG&E about=20
implementation.   It appears, based on the press release, that the Commissi=
on=20
will act tomorrow to adopt an order that will begin the implementation=20
process, although the order is not available for review yet.

I asked Wayne how they intended to implement the bill.  He believes that th=
e=20
opt-in provision for large C&I customers, and any associated undercollectio=
ns=20
associated with the customers that opt-in, would be handled separately from=
=20
the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercia=
l=20
customers.  I asked how they would collect any shortfalls.   It didn't soun=
d=20
like they had a plan yet.  I suggested balancing account treatment for the=
=20
customers that benefit from the opt-in with any shortfalls recovered as=20
quickly as possible but no later than 1 year. =20

Relative to Res/Small Commercial:

He said that SDG&E will propose, in response to ARM comments, that the cap=
=20
(for res and small commercial) customers would not disadvantage DA=20
customers.  In other words, they are concerned about the appearances that=
=20
SDG&E's rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and woul=
d=20
make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism, that in=20
effect, would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w/ SDG&E. =20

For example:  If prevailing market prices were 7.5 cents/kWh, SDG&E's res a=
nd=20
small commercial customers would only be charged upto 6.5 cents, and DA=20
customers would receive a 1 cent/kWh credit against their T&D charges so th=
at=20
in effect, there is no economic advantage to staying w/ SDG&E.  However, wh=
en=20
it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections, DA and bundled custome=
rs=20
would again be treated comparably.

Their BIG concern is that the Commission will hang them out to dry on=20
reasonableness. =20

We agreed to keep the dialogue open.  Things will likely happen quickly.  I=
f=20
folks have any recommendations or see problems with the above, let me know=
=20
asap.  Thanks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 6, 2000 =20


GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION
SACRAMENTO =01) Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the=
=20
burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation=
=20
designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting=20
process for new power plants.=20

"One of the major achievements of this year's legislative session is our=20
aggressive response to California's energy challenge," Governor Davis said.=
=20
"My Administration did not create this problem, but we are 100-percent=20
committed to solving it. And, now, after a long, hot summer of unconscionab=
ly=20
high energy prices, relief is finally on the way."=20

AB 265 by Assemblywoman Susan Davis (D-San Diego) and Senator Deirdre Alper=
t=20
(D-Coronado) will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal=
l=20
business (including schools and hospitals) in San Diego at 6.5 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. These rates will be retroactive from June 1, 2000 and extend=
=20
to December 31, 2003.=20

"In the short term, this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy=20
prices," Governor Davis said. "When it comes to predicting their electric=
=20
bills, San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough. This is an=20
urgency measure. I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take=20
immediate action at its meeting tomorrow."=20

As a result of this legislation, the average monthly bill for residential=
=20
customers in San Diego will be reduced to $68. Small businesses (all school=
s=20
and acute-care hospitals are included) will pay an average monthly bill of=
=20
$220. Medium businesses (consuming up to 72,000 kilowatt-hours a month) wou=
ld=20
also have a price cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. For large businesses,=
=20
AB 265 would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDG&E over a longer=
=20
period of time.=20

AB 970 by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny (D-San Diego) and Assemblyman Jim=20
Battin (R-La Quinta) will help California overcome the inadequate supply of=
=20
energy, one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices, by expediting=
=20
the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for=20
upgrades of old facilities.=20

"Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those=
=20
who would build more power generators in California," Governor Davis said.=
=20
"This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing=20
demand. It will also establish new programs to reduce demand."=20

Over the last three months, Governor Gray Davis' leadership has been=20
demonstrated in his response to the San Diego electricity crisis:=20


On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all sta=
te=20
facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity emergen=
cy=20
and rolling blackouts.=20
On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission=20
(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the Sa=
n=20
Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on t=
he=20
price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to the=
=20
governor and released on August 2.=20
On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to=
=20
take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in=20
California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in=20
refunds.=20
In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two=
=20
California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market, =
he=20
called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take=20
strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.=20
On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to=
=20
reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it take=
s=20
new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies. Please=
=20
go to http://www.governor.ca.gov/briefing/execorder/index.shtm to view copi=
es=20
of Governor Davis' Executive Orders.=20
On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission=
=20
(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by near=
ly=20
half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.=20
The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers=20
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between=
=20
50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to=
=20
reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.=20
On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi=
ng=20
him to expedite the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's investigation to=
=20
determine whether current electric rates in San Diego were unjust.=20
On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release=
=20
emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)=
=20
to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising=20
electricity bills.=20
On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request =
by=20

Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The president=
=20
also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the=20
operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration=
=20
to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.=
=20
On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on=20
legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. Today's bill signing=
=20
is the culmination of that agreement.
