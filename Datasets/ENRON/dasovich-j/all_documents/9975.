Subject: You Can Put A Stake in Their Hearts but They Never Die

Gang,

Just heard from someone at the ISO that the ISO Board is shoving a new mark=
et=20
approach down the staff's throat.

Rising from the almost dead ...

This "Market Repair Committee" is supported by Eric Woychik, advisor to Boa=
rd=20
Member Florio.  The Committee members are Joskow, Hogan, PJM people, et=20
cetera, et cetera.  There will be something posted on the ISO's web site=20
shortly.  It will be approved at the Board meeting Thursday.

I'll be there.
