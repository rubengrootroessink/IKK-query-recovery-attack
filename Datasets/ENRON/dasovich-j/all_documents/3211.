Subject: Draft Outline of JSJ Comments for FERC Meeting on Thursday, Nov 9; 
Conference Call Scheduled for 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 8

?

Attached is a draft outline of Jan Smutny Jone's Statement/Comments for the 
FERC Hearing on Thursday, November 9 to address the California Report/Order.? 

?

A conference call is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. (PST) on Wed., Nov 8 to discuss 
the draft outline.

?

??? ??? Call-In Number??? ??? ??? 888/476-6127

??????? Participant #???????????????111756

?

?

Note, as the Hearing is Thursday, we are working in real time to finalize 
this Statement.? This is a work in progress.? IEP will be translating the 
draft outline into prose continually between now and Wed noon, when we hope 
to finalize the Statement.

?

As a point of reference, building off the IEP Workshop we held last Friday, 
IEP is moving forward to develop detailed comments for the FERC proceeding on 
California market structure matters? These comments are due Nov. 22.? We 
anticipate these Comments to be detailed (e.g. 20-50 pages).

?

This Statement for the FERC Hearing on Thursday is building off of the 
discussion during the IEP workshop.? The Statement is expected to be 5-10 
pages, therefore by necessity it will be less substantive and exhaustive as 
the Nov 22 filing.? We are attempting to hit the 'high points" and provide a 
framework for FERC to (1) consider the specific details of their proposal, 
and (2) address certain FERC/state matters regarding roles and 
responsibilities.

?

We will be developing "talking points" as well, but these will be driven by 
the overall Statement.

?

Talk to you tomorrow.
