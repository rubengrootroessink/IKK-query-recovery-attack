Apparently Christy and I aren't allowed to leave The Desk during the summer, 
even for vacations?
Hmmm.  I'll have to make further inquiries.

The "big" meetings, which happen about every quarter, are de rigeur.  The 
summer "big" meeting is an absolute must (and generally very fun).  I'll be 
there.

Hope you're there, too.

Best,
Jeff
