All,
Here is an updated program with a laundry list of speakers.  This afternoon at
5:30/2:30 we need to:

1)  Make introductions

2)  Agree on general format

3)  Agree on date.  Bill prefers October so we need to resolve that.

4)  Agree on initial list of speakers.

5)  Determine contacts most likely to get the speakers to accept, and assign
calling list.

For selecting speakers, Lee and I have discussed a cascading selection method
(in the spirit of cascading electricity ancillary service auctions I suppose) 
by
which we try to get a commitment from our top choice then select our second
choice to ensure balance with the first, and each step of the way try to 
ensure
the next selection provides balance to the existing slate.  Since we'll all be
on the phone together our first step should still be to establish a top list 
and
assign responsibility for calling a few people.

Talk to you soon!  Bill can you set up the call and send around the call-in
number? Thanks.
