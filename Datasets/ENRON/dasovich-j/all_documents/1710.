 Home News: Pay dispute at National Grid ? 09/23/2000 Irish Times 5 Copyright

A pay dispute has arisen between staff and management at the National Grid, 
the electricity transmission system operator formerly owned by the ESB, which 
was 'ring-fenced' as a State-owned body in February, following deregulation 
proposals.

Staff at the National Grid have been working an interim agreement since the 
industry was liberalised. They now say the agreement has expired and they are 
demanding extra payment to continue working the new system. Earlier this week 
they reverted to pre-February work duties. Most of the approximately 100 
staff are represented by MSF and the ESB Officers' Association. 

In a separate development, the ESBOA has issued notice of industrial action 
in mid-October unless a 16.5 per cent pay claim is granted. Folder Name:
