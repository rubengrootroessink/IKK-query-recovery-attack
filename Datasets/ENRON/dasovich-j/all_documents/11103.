Mr. Fawcett, Having your copies of your presentation available would be very 
helpful and appreciated.  I am expecting about 80 people to attend the 
workshop.  I'll put Transwestern as the first name on the "standby" list.

Mr. Meyers, 
I certainly understand and, unfortunately, I suspected as much.  I'm 
sure there are quite a few parties with keen interest in this 
investigation.  Because of flight schedules, the Transwestern contingent 
may not be able to stay until 4:30 p.m., so I'm not sure I could even 
commit to a presentation at the end of the day.  We'd certainly be happy 
to be squeezed in during the day if another party's presentation was 
shorter than expected.  
In any event, I was wondering if I might leave behind a copy of TW's 
presentation for others to take home?  Like I said, its chief purpose is 
to introduce (or for most folks, reacquaint) Transwestern to the 
stakeholders in this investigation, and to provide specific information 
regarding it's capability to deliver gas to California.  Would it be 
possible to at least acknowledge during the day that our handouts are 
available to the attendees?  We could either pass them out or have them 
on a table at the back.  I'll wait to hear your guidance on the best way 
to do this. 
As I said before, Transwestern is committed to working with the CPUC to 
fully develop the record and to cooperatively address any and all issues 
identified in this investigation.  If I can be of any further 
assistance, please let me know. 
Thank you.
