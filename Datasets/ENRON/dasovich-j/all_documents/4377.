FYI - according to this article, a FERC commissioner informed Dow Jones that 
FERC does not plan to expand the price cap to the entire Western region.

DJ FERC: Davis Can't Force Generators To Sell Pwr In Calif
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A move by California Gov. Gray Davis which seeks to 
bar in-state generators from exporting their abundant power supply is a 
violation of interstate commerce rules - and therefore will never be 
implemented, an attorney with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told 
Dow Jones Newswires.

Last month, energy officials proposed to Davis the possibility of forcing 
in-state generators to sell all of their power into California, especially 
during statewide power emergencies.

Davis said Tuesday night he may still seek legislation to force generators to 
sell their power supply here, which would help the state's grid operator 
avoid rolling blackouts.

But according to federal law, the state cannot prohibit companies from doing 
business with other states, the attorney said, adding that it violates 
interstate commerce rules.

Part of the reason energy companies export some of their power is that other 
states are willing to pay far above California's wholesale electricity price 
cap of $250 a megawatt-hour.

Tuesday, with the state teetering on the brink of rolling blackouts, Northern 
California irrigation districts - government operated utilities that supply 
water and power to farmers - sold about 400 MW of excess power to the 
Northwest, reaping huge profits because customers there are not bound by a 
price cap.

The ISO - forced to compete with companies willing to pay $1,000/MWh for 
electricity - narrowly avoided rolling blackouts Tuesday by paying about $1.1 
million for 1,000 MW of power, which is $1,100 a megawatt-hour.

Still, Gov. Davis is pushing FERC to impose a $100/MWh regional price cap. 
But a FERC commissioner told Dow Jones Newswires that the commission will 
very likely impose a $100/MWh price in California only. FERC's final order on 
remedies California must undertake to repair its flawed market is due next 
week.

But the FERC commissioner said it's the state's current price cap of $250/MWh 
that's destroying the wholesale market and resulting in generators exporting 
their power for a profit.

"If they can make $275/MWh in Nevada they have an obligation to their 
shareholders," the FERC commissioner said.

State lawmakers, meanwhile, want to force generators who conduct business in 
the state to report all wholesale electricity transactions to a state energy 
panel and register before selling power.
