A scathing AP article against Governor Davis concerning his inaction with the 
California crisis. Davis is facing two issues. Sign the current rollback bill 
that is going through the legislature and upset the energy industry, or veto 
the bill and have many voters upset at him. Governor Davis is aware of the 
upcoming elections for members in his party, as well as the 2002 governor 
election and knows that his decision may cost himself and other members of 
his party election wins. Also, there is now talks that during August 21st PUC 
meeting the governor will suggest rate rollback for San Diego  to July 1998 
rates. This is a complete 180 degree turn from his August 3rd PUC meeting 
where he said he would steer clear of rate rollbacks or freezes and push for 
only a rebate.


Attached is a personal interest type story providing the general publics view 
of the whole California power situation.
