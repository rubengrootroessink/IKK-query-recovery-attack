This is a very important working meeting of the Blackout Busters, where we=
=20
will be voting on some proposals. We will not be able to reopen any of thes=
e=20
issues in the full committee. Therefore if you have any input to the these=
=20
documents, please participate.=20

The OBMC program is very critical to many of us who want a way out of rolli=
ng=20
blackouts this summer? by committing to curtailing demand when requested.=
=20

Many of us discussed? the PG&E=01,s proposal to CPUC for this program last =
week,=20
and determined that it is simply unworkable in its current proposed form.=
=20
SVMG must propose specific modifications to make it workable for us.=20

The Administrative Law Judge was very cooperative. He was planning to issue=
=20
the ruling on Friday, March 9, but agreed to wait for out input. He advised=
=20
that even though the comment period is over, he would entertain our comment=
s=20
if we filed petition to file late comments and followed some legal=20
procedures.=20

Based on input received from other members, I prepared a working document.=
=20
John Wilson from CEC volunteered and converted the working document into a=
=20
draft petition. Paul Stephens hand delivered the draft petition to the Judg=
e=20
on Wednesday. Please note that the draft petition included here is differen=
t=20
than what Paul handed over to the Judge. The two references to the=20
Transmission level customers were removed at the last minute without much=
=20
discussions. However, technically, the petition can not be accepted since i=
t=20
was not filed with proper legal process. Justin is working to get the legal=
=20
support. Meanwhile, we have time this afternoon to review the petition at t=
he=20
Blackout Busters meeting and make changes, if needed.=20

In the tradition of SVMG, I outlined our criteria for making any specific=
=20
suggestion in the working document. Please review it and bring your comment=
s=20
to the meeting.=20

 Mukesh & Nayeem, Because nearly 90% of the people who participate in the=

 for your help in making the schedule work.? Laura=20
