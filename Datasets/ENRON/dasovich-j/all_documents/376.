In follow-up to our off-site in N.O. I felt it would be good to have a 
conference call and discuss our next steps.  I am looking at sometime on 
Friday the 10th at 11:00 Central.  If too many people have a conflict with 
the 10th then we can go to monday the 13th.  Please call Terri Miller at 
603-223-2520 and let her know if the 10th is impossible.

First, I want to thank Margaret Carson for putting together the information 
summaries that Martin Wenzel requested at our meeting.  I understand the Tier 
I summaries were very well received at Martin's staff meeting and that Martin 
is looking forward to getting something on theTier II states soon as well.

Second, I have attempted to take what we learned from Jeff and Martin in New 
Orleans and to condense it into a powerpoint presentation which is attached.  
This is just a rough draft so please take a look at it and give me your 
comments on the 10th.  It needs work and I want your input.  If we have 
something ready in time I may try to present this at the Woodlands meeting.  
Let me know what you think.

Third, we need to start thinking about communications.  I was hoping to meet 
in Houston in connection with the Woodlands meeting and get some input from 
ECI like we did with Jeff and Martin.  So please check your schedules around 
the 30th and let me know if that works.

Finally, and perhaps most importently, I want to get a deal pipeline going as 
our May 1 deliverable approaches.  Please give some thought as to how we can 
work with everyone at Government Affairs in each of the four regions to 
collect a list of the potential commercial opportunities we are, or could be, 
pursuing with the business units.

Thanks again for your help.  I look forward to talking to you all.
