We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with 
Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a 
structure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short 
position in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  
I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the 
legal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract 
and the requirements for this potential deal.  Notional terms:

NP-15
