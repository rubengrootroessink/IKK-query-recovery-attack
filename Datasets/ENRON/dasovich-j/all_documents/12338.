"They should know that their constituents may well be hurt if, as a result =

Davis commended the only Republican to vote for the measure, Assemblyman=20

Since mid-January, the state has committed $6.7 billion from its budget to=

"We have a pretty good plan for the long range, but we've got some problems=

right now, and we're going to hear more and more about it -- whether it's=

Thomas, a Wyoming Republican. "How are you going to react to this summer's=

prices? And I'm not for price controls, but we need to have some reaction t=

Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon urged Abraham to push the Federal=20
Energy Regulatory Commission to control wholesale energy prices.=20
"We've never had a free market in energy, and people are truly going to wan=
t=20
to see this administration appearing more engaged than it appears to be,"=

Smith said. "We have a crisis here, and I think it would behoove the=20
president -- it would behoove all of us -- to figure out a way to relieve=
=20
this in a very aggressive way."=20
Abraham told the senators that a comprehensive energy plan, which a task=20
force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is expected to release next week=

will provide short-term and long-term solutions to the country's=20
energy-supply problems.=20
After the hearing, Abraham vehemently denied that either he or Bush has bee=

in office."=20
Abraham said the Bush administration has been especially responsive to the=
=20
problems in California.=20
"From the very first day that I was secretary, I was on the phone with=20
(California Gov.) Gray Davis, finding out what challenges he had and how we=

Spreading the pain=20


(Published May 11, 2001)=20

Monday the California Public Utilities Commission faces a $4.8 billion=20
question: How should regulators divvy up the electricity rate increase they=
=20
approved in March between residential customers and businesses?=20
All customer classes of the private utilities must bear some of the burden =
of=20
the higher costs for the electricity the state is now purchasing for Pacifi=
c=20
Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison (this rate increase does no=
t=20
pertain to municipal power agencies such as SMUD).=20
The right way to do that is to spread the higher electricity costs between=
=20
residences and businesses in proportion to their use of power. This princip=
le=20
will result in a higher average percentage increase for manufacturers and=
=20
commercial businesses because they now have lower per-kilowatt rates than=
=20
residences, but a rate structure that reflects their power usage.=20
But businesses shouldn't get saddled with some of the burden that belongs t=
o=20
residential customers, as two of the plans before the PUC propose.=20
A new law prohibits the PUC from increasing the rates on residential=20
electricity consumption below 130 percent of "baseline." Depending on wheth=
er=20
one believes the PUC or PG&E, the law exempts anywhere from one-third to=20
one-half of residential customers from any rate hikes.=20
Had they not been exempted, however, their proportional share of the=20
necessary rate increase would have been $1.1 billion. The Legislature=20
exempted these customers as a way to protect lower-income consumers as well=
=20
as those who conserve. Lawmakers didn't say, however, who should pay for th=
is=20
$1.1 billion in their place.=20
This thankless task now falls to the PUC. Two proposals -- one by PUC=20
President Loretta Lynch, another by an administrative law judge -- answer t=
he=20
$1.1 billion question in the wrong way. Both proposals seek to shift most o=
f=20
this $1.1 billion burden from the residential class onto manufacturers and=
=20
businesses.=20
That's both unfair and bad for the economy. This burden belongs solely to t=
he=20
residential class. Because the PUC cannot impose it on usage below 130=20
percent of baseline, regulators must impose it on the other residential=20
customers who are using the most electricity.=20
Yes, this would increase their rates even more steeply than Lynch is alread=
y=20
proposing. But it sends the right signal to large users of electricity to=
=20
turn down the air conditioner and turn off unneeded appliances and lighting=
.=20
The alternative is to subsidize their excesses through higher bills on=20
businesses, as Lynch and the judge are proposing. Many manufacturers in=20
California will struggle to stay afloat as they cope with their own fair=20
share of the costs. Making them take part of the residential share of the=

?????If Davis and his cadre of financial advisors are right, the state will=

goes, the power suppliers Davis has vilified will be reined in.
?????If his predictions are off by modest margins, which even many state=20

?????The governor's plan largely rests on these crucial assumptions: that=
=20
consumers will conserve a record amount of power at peak usage times, that=
=20
energy prices will drop precipitously, and that the state will lock in far=
=20
more contracts for long-term power. But those three assumptions could prove=
=20
faulty, according to government financial records and interviews with state=
=20
officials, Wall Street analysts and energy experts.
?????Davis is banking on that troika to quickly tame the wild prices of=20
last-minute power--which hit an apparent record of $2,000 for a megawatt-ho=
ur=20
Wednesday. Such purchases so far have put the state on the hook for $6=20
billion and pushed major utilities to the brink of ruin.
?????Davis' plan assumes that the state will reduce peak demand by 2,484=20
megawatts--enough to supply nearly 2 million homes--through three programs=

run by the California Independent System Operator, which keeps power runnin=

?????But Cal-ISO managers say they will be lucky to achieve a fraction of=

?????They say that one of the programs listed in the governor's plan was=20
shelved because regulators had raised concerns about air pollution. Another=

the governor has assumed will be saved when supplies are tight this summer,=
=20
said Cal-ISO Project Manager Bill Wagner.
?????"There's a lot of 'ifs' in there," he said of the conservation program=

which would pay businesses to cut back during critical hours. He said the=

utilities are months behind in installing meters to measure the savings.
?????Officials at another state agency in charge of a similar conservation=

program, the Public Utilities Commission, also said they are not sure about=
=20
hitting targets on which the bond plan is based.
?????PUC Senior Analyst Robert Strauss said he has no idea how many=20
businesses will agree to curtail electricity consumption in exchange for=20
cheaper power rates this summer. The program is only a month old, he said.
?????"We're in a new situation that we don't have good experience with,"=20
Strauss said. "Who's going to sign up for these programs? We don't really=
=20

=20
attracted interest from just two businesses since March.
?????"It's pretty ambitious to think we're going to get 1,600 megawatts by=
=20
June in that program," said Cal-ISO's Wagner.
?????Beyond Davis' assumptions about conservation, the success of his=20
hard-fought bond measure relies heavily on how much the state will pay for=

electricity during the next two summers. If the price is higher than foreca=

by Davis, the bond money could be consumed more quickly, potentially forcin=
g=20
the state to borrow more, dip into tax funds or raise customer rates again.
?????To keep prices down, the Davis administration has struggled to lock up=

?????In his effort to push his bond legislation through the Capitol, he has=

r=20
contracts they think will materialize.=20
?????So far, the administration has fallen far short, achieving final=20
agreements on only 28 contracts as of Thursday.
?????If that gap persists, the state will probably be forced to buy=20
electricity on the expensive spot market, which could eat into the bond mon=

?????"I think the operative word is uncertainty," said Paul Patterson, an=

energy analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "There are too many pieces,=

[and] all you need is for one or two of those not to work out substantially=

and things change."
?????Patterson, who says he remains cautiously optimistic about the=20
governor's plan, was among a group of Wall Street analysts who were briefed=

last week by Davis' top advisors.
?????Some wondered about who would provide the additional power that Davis=

?????During the briefing, the governor's advisors said one option being=20

?????In a striking declaration earlier this week, White House spokesman Ari=

?????Compared to most issues, public opinion about the energy debate is=20

?????Indeed, it's telling that, instead of discussing conservation, both Bu=

?????WASHINGTON--In the first test of congressional sentiment on California=

Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials to do so.
?????Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who offered the price control=20
measure as an amendment to the energy bill, argued that it would protect=20

power suppliers.
?????Without price controls, he said, the bill "does not do for California=

?????But the other three Californians on the subcommittee--all=20

?????"I recognize there's tremendous political pressure on us, but do not=

?????She was joined in voting against the measure by Reps. Christopher Cox=

Restarting of Generators in O.C. Approved=20


By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Granting the governor's wish that power plants receive=20
speedy approval, the California Energy Commission cleared the way Thursday=
=20
for the restarting of two idled generators that will double the output of a=
=20
plant in Huntington Beach.
?????The commission's action allows AES Corp. to run the two controversial=
=20
units for at least 10 years, provided that a midterm review finds that=20
operators are taking steps to limit any harm the plant may cause to seawate=
r=20
quality and marine life.
?????The commission also required the company to sell all the power generat=
ed=20
by the units, enough to supply about 337,500 homes, within California--a=20
restriction unprecedented in the state.
?????Some attorneys questioned whether the panel had the legal authority to=
=20
impose such a restriction. But Commissioner Robert Laurie said that althoug=
h=20
the limit "may not be good long-term policy," the state's power emergency=
=20
warrants it now.
?????The commission's unanimous vote capped weeks of arduous negotiations=
=20
involving AES, the state and Huntington Beach officials, who called the=20
10-year permit "a major disappointment." AES officials pushed for the 10=20
years on grounds that a shorter time frame would make the economics of the=
=20
project iffy.
?????City officials preferred a five-year permit, saying the company's trac=
k=20
record--it once paid a $17-million fine for allowing too much pollution to=
=20
spew from its Long Beach plant--raises doubts about its future performance.=
=20
The commission's staff also favored five years, with the possibility of a=
=20
five-year extension.
?????"They have not exactly been great corporate citizens," Matt Lamb,=20
project manager for Huntington Beach, said of AES. "This is a grossly=20
inefficient plant that has been mothballed, and they're basically=20
kick-starting it. We don't think it deserves 10 years."
?????But Gov. Gray Davis--who has publicly pushed the commission to approve=
=20
plants quickly--hailed the decision. "That's good news. That's supply we're=
=20
counting on," he said.
?????The two Huntington Beach units are 40 years old and have been idle sin=
ce=20
1995. But the energy crisis has made the old valuable once again, and AES=
=20
plans to invest $150 million to re-power the generators--once scheduled for=
=20
demolition.
?????The units represent almost 10% of the 5,000 megawatts Davis has said h=
e=20
will bring into service this summer to avert an electricity shortage.
?????Recent estimates, however, suggest that the governor's pledge was over=
ly=20
optimistic.
?????And although Davis and the Energy Commission are expecting the=20
Huntington Beach generators to begin operating in August, AES Southland=20
President Mark Woodruff said Thursday that it is unclear whether that goal=
=20
can be met.
?????The AES project is among a few receiving fast-track approval under the=
=20
governor's executive order earlier this year requiring expedited review of=
=20
such plants.
?????In normal times, a 450-megawatt project such as the one approved=20
Thursday might have taken a year's worth of study, public hearings and othe=
r=20
scrutiny, said Claudia Chandler, a commission spokeswoman. The expedited=20
review shrinks that to just 60 days.
?????That clearly rankles some Huntington Beach residents, who, in testimon=
y=20
before the commission, wondered whether emissions, ocean pollution and othe=
r=20
threats had been thoroughly studied.
?????"I think it's almost outrageous what's being foisted on the public,"=
=20
said Rich Lloyd, who lives about a quarter of a mile from the plant. "What=
=20
relief are you going to give to all these people, all these schoolchildren,=
=20
who have to breathe these emissions for 10 years?"
?????Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff said she too was troubl=
ed=20
by the fast-track licensing process: "We're taking a risk as a city," she=
=20
said. "If a price has to be paid, our citizens will be paying that price."
?????Critics are alarmed by a UC Irvine study concluding that the=20
plant--which now uses and discharges about 300 million gallons of seawater=
=20
each day as coolant--may combine with ocean currents to attract sewage=20
released miles offshore.=20
?????Many residents suspect that the plant contributed to pollution that=20
caused repeated beach closures in 1999.
?????Acknowledging the concerns, the commission required AES to spend $1=20
million to study whether water quality is at risk.
?????The company also must spend $2.5 million to monitor fish deaths caused=
=20
by its seawater intake system. If too many white croaker, queenfish and oth=
er=20
species become trapped and die, AES may be required to modernize its=20
equipment, commission officials said.
?????Other complaints have focused on the noise, smoke and smells produced =
by=20
the plant.
?????Jane Riley, who lives nearby, plans her outings with son Daniel, 6,=20
around the thick clouds of yellow-brown smoke that are a part of everyday=

?????"I try to avoid it. I take a look at which direction it's going," Rile=
y=20
said. With two more units fired up, a bad situation will only get worse, sh=

fears.
?????In other action Thursday, the commission approved a 95-megawatt "peake=

Discovery Has City Flying High=20
Energy: Claim of huge natural gas deposit leads Delano to dream of wealth=
=20
that may result. But some are skeptical.=20

By GEOFFREY MOHAN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????DELANO, Calif.--At the signal from oil wildcatter F. Lynn Blystone,=20
roughnecks opened the valve of a greasy well rig, and with an earsplitting=
=20
screech, a fat jet of natural gas blasted plumes of dust from the fields=20
outside this San Joaquin Valley town.
?????City officials covered their ears and dropped their jaws.
?????"That's the sound of money, loud and powerful," said Delano City Manag=
er=20
Adela Gonzalez.
?????Indeed, the estimated 3 trillion cubic feet of coveted and pricey=20
natural gas that Blystone, president and chief executive of Tri-Valley Corp=
.=20
in Bakersfield, claims to have tapped could be the biggest natural gas=20
discovery in California since the 1930s, and might rank among the top in th=

lower 48 states.
?????And although the full extent of the find remains unproven--and industr=
y=20
veterans urge caution--Blystone's well has set off a frenzy in this=20
impoverished agricultural town more famous for Cesar Chavez and the pickers=
=20
who touched off a national grape boycott.
?????Delano is seeing dollar signs in the dust. It's talking power plants,=
=20
pipelines, big industry, and independence from the grip of the statewide=20
energy crisis.
?????Energy consultants are lining up at City Hall, where visitors are urge=
d=20
to use the stairs instead of the elevators to save electricity. Ordinary=20
residents are scurrying to learn if they own mineral rights, mostly finding=
=20
that their dreams of overnight riches are about as real as the fictional=20
Clampett family on TV's "The Beverly Hillbillies."
?????"Everybody is doing their research, to see if they have mineral rights=
,"=20
said Delano Mayor Art Armendares. "We're getting control of our own destiny=
.=20
We can provide citizens with uninterrupted electricity and gas. Then we can=
=20
put up our shingle and attract industry."
?????Beyond grapes, almonds and other crops, industry is sparse in Delano,=
=20
which recently attracted a Sears distribution center for the West Coast.=20
Seasonal unemployment reaches upward of 30%, Armendares said.
?????Even if Delano is poised to reap rewards, the state in general won't s=
ee=20
much effect. That's because even the optimistic estimates of daily producti=
on=20
wouldn't meet more than 1% of the state's whopping 7.5 billion cubic-foot=
=20
demand, according to the state Department of Conservation.
?????That hasn't stopped Delano residents from dreaming. Among those who=20
might hit it big are City Manager Gonzalez's secretary, Phyllis Kraft, who=
=20
hails from one of the area's old farming families.
?????"People aren't exactly treating me differently, but they are saying,=
=20
'You're not going to forget me when you get rich and famous, are you?' " sa=
id=20
Kraft, who remains cautiously optimistic about the claim. "It would be=20
wonderful if it's true, but let's just wait and see."
?????For years, children here have learned that, while the soil rendered=20
their food, its hidden riches could one day change their destiny. Few sold=
=20
their mineral rights, even when they let go of their land.
?????As a result, the original landowners are most likely to get any=20
royalties from leasing those rights--generally 12.5% to 25% of gross=20
production, Blystone said.
?????Revenue from the field could be $7 billion or more over a predicted=20
lifetime of 85 years, he said.
?????Among the biggest winners so far appears to be the U.S. government,=20
which operates an antenna field for the Voice of America on about 800 acres=
=20
of the 6,600 that Tri-Valley believes harbor natural gas.
?????But Emeterio "Butch" Navalta, who owns the plot where Tri-Valley=20
drilled, ignored the screech of the gas well Tuesday and sullenly hoed weed=
s=20
from his 20-acre plot. He bought the land for $60,000 last year but didn't=
=20
get the mineral rights. Although he gets $12,000 a year leasing drilling=20
space to Tri-Valley, he is bitter.
?????"I didn't even think about it," Navalta said. "I'm trying to find=20
someone who knows what to do."
?????Ruth Hiett, 85-year-old matriarch of a farming family with several=20
hundred acres in the claim area, said she'll hold tight to her rights.=20
Surrounded by almond trees and fallow fields, she lives in an aging clapboa=
rd=20
house that is part of the family's original 1906 homestead.
?????"I don't know if it'll make me rich, but it might somebody," Hiett sai=
d.=20
"Anybody who knows anything at all likes to think some day we'll hit it. Bu=
t=20
some company still has to come and explore and do whatever they have to do.=
=20
Who knows? No telling."

?????'It's Just a Story as Far as I'm Concerned'
?????Thus far, no one knows, or no one is telling. But the prospect of 3=20
trillion cubic feet of unassociated, or "dry," gas--meaning it is not mingl=
ed=20
with oil--in an area that has not shown such deposits before raises ample=
=20
skepticism.
?????"It's just a story as far as I'm concerned," said Lawrence Chroman Jr.=
,=20
a third-generation farmer who kept the mineral rights to the land he sold=
=20
Navalta last year. "Whenever the price of gas or oil goes up, they have mon=
ey=20
to go out and do exploration. It goes through cycles. I'm not willing to go=
=20
any further until I see whether this thing develops or not."
?????Experts and regulators likewise cautioned that one gushing well does n=
ot=20
prove a major find.
?????"All we can say is we are rooting for him," said Don Drysdale, spokesm=
an=20
for the state Conservation Department. "It would help us all out. But the=
=20
statements they are making are based on one well. We don't know enough yet.=
"
?????Industry experts note that with natural gas going for $12 per thousand=
=20
cubic feet, plenty of wildcat drillers have been scouring overlooked or=20
unlikely places in search of El Dorado. Many find little more than, well,=
=20
Delano.
?????Tri-Valley, a public company whose stock trades at about $1.80, has be=
en=20
through bankruptcy protection before, fighting off a hostile takeover by a=
=20
creditor. And it has made one similar claim near Fresno, which proved dry.=
=20
When it announced the Delano find April 11, its stock leaped 75%, and has=
=20
since hovered just under $2.
?????The company will need about $100 million to drill about 40 wells that =
it=20
says could yield a total of 80 million cubic feet per day for about 85 year=
s.=20
That is well over the about 50 million cubic feet a day coming from the=20
state's most productive field, Rio Vista, according to the Conservation=20
Department, but still not enough to ease the state's crisis.
?????But because of the huge amount consumed daily in California, even if=
=20
optimistic estimates in Delano pan out, the production there won't help eas=
e=20
the state's crisis.
?????"We're not going to be able to materially affect the power needs of=20
California," Blystone cautioned.
?????Bolstering Blystone's claim is the East Lost Hills find reported in=20
February by Berkley Petroleum 25 miles west. That discovery has shown early=
=20
promise of being at least as big as the Delano find.
?????The two potential deposits were made public within six weeks of each=
=20
other, and nothing has been the same since in the area.
?????"There's almost been the equivalent of a Gold Rush to lease land all=
=20
around the Berkley field," Kramer said.
?????Drysdale said, however, that his department believes the two finds are=
=20
separate deposits.
?????Tri-Valley has mapped out 6,600 acres, and so far a substantial wedge=
=20
lies within Delano boundaries, where the city owns mineral rights.
?????Virtually everything is speculative about the claim, particularly=20
royalties. But city officials think they could make $3 million a year--in a=
=20
town with an operating budget of $6 million, dismally paved roads and=20
overcrowded schools.
?????Not only are they considering forming a municipal power authority, but=

they say they will waive about $1,000 in fees to landowners willing to anne=

?????"I'm going to make a one-time offer to all these farmers that the city=

will pick up the cost of annexation," said Matthew Alexander, community=20
development director for Delano. "I see this as a window of opportunity."
?????Alexander and others have been to Sacramento to study the pros and con=
s=20
of forming a municipal utility, and are convinced that building a power=20
plant, and using gas royalties to power it, is the answer.
?????"You're looking at a totally different town," Blystone said.
?????Small players like Navalta, however, suspect that Delano will be the=

Might Californians finally be seeing a dim light at the end of the energy=

tunnel? This spring and summer will be difficult times unless everything=20
breaks just right. But Gov. Gray Davis' recently announced energy plan offe=
rs=20
at least short-run management of the crisis--and a hope for a long-run=20
solution. And that's about all anyone should ask the government to do.=20
Ignoring the history and some mind-numbingly complex details, the electrici=
ty=20
problem comes down to this: Demand now outstrips supply by a wide margin ev=
en=20
on a normal day, and by much more on days of peak demand. With the utilitie=
s=20
no longer credit-worthy, the state must fill the gap by buying on the=20
wholesale market. These days, that means buying high and selling low.
Any comprehensive attack on this problem must have three components:=20
mechanisms for reducing demand, mechanisms for increasing supply and a pile=
=20
of money to cover the bills while the medicine works. The governor's plan,=
=20
while not perfect, has the three elements. It also avoids the wackier=20
suggestions from both the right and the left.=20
Let's work backward through the three components. First, the state needs=20
money to keep the lights on. One naive remedy would be to raise taxes to pa=
y=20
all the bills. No danger that any politician will ever latch onto that one.=
=20
But a related bad idea--raising retail electricity rates to cover all the=
=20
costs--does have a following. Why is that a bad idea? Because the utilities=
=20
are saddled with debt from the past. And things almost certainly will be=20
brighter (pun intended) in the future.=20
Like a family, when a government is faced with a huge, one-time expense--sa=
y,=20
to build a highway--it generally borrows most of the money. That's sound=20
financial practice because it spreads what otherwise would be a ruinously=
=20
high cost over time. Davis wants to spread the cost of the current crisis b=
y=20
issuing bonds worth about $12 billion to $13 billion, secured by future=20
payments for electricity. I do not know whether this is exactly the right=
=20
number. But the principle is clear, and it's too bad the Legislature delaye=
d=20
the bond issue.=20
Next comes supply. Wishful thinkers on the right have a simple solution: Ju=
st=20
let retail prices rise, and more supply will come. The trouble is that it=
=20
won't, at least not in the short run. Over years, greater supply is the onl=
y=20
lasting solution. But to expect much supply response in the short run is=20
dreaming.=20
The left has its own favorite silly idea: The state should seize control of=
=20
power plants and take over the business of supplying electricity. Seize? Ho=
w=20
much good would that do to California's business climate? And does anyone=
=20
really believe that the state can, over the long run, generate and supply=
=20
electricity better than private business? There are, in fact, traces of=20
public ownership in the Davis plan: The state is buying transmission lines,=
=20
and a new public authority would build power plants if private industry fai=
ls=20
to do so. But the governor sees public ownership as a last, not a first,=20
resort.=20
Finally, we come to the demand side, where true believers offer the same=20
remedy: Just let the retail price rise enough to cut demand back to the=20
available supply. Sound harsh? It is. Higher electricity prices must be par=
t=20
of the solution, at least in the short run. But relying exclusively on high=
er=20
rates would be foolhardy and perhaps even ruinous to California's economy,=
=20
because titanic price hikes would be needed to cut demand by enough in shor=
t=20
order. So we would wind up inflicting pain on consumers without calling for=
th=20
greater generating or transmission capacity.=20
The governor at first resisted the conclusion that consumer prices had to=
=20
rise. But he has now embraced it. His package includes not just price hikes=
=20
for big energy users, but also financial incentives for those who reduce=20
consumption. More can be done in this regard, but he is at least on the rig=
ht=20
track.=20
Will these conservation measures get California through the next few months=
?=20
I wouldn't bet on it. But unless the federal government truly caps wholesal=
e=20
electricity prices temporarily, demand management is about the only short-r=
un=20
game in town.=20

The owners of at least 19 small power plants scattered throughout Californi=

are now asking a bankruptcy judge -- along with state and federal power=20
regulators and lawmakers -- to set them free from their contracts with=20
bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric.=20
Attorneys for the so-called qualifying facilities said a new pricing system=
=20
recently ordered by the Public Utilities Commission lowers how much the QFs=

they run their plants because of soaring natural gas prices.=20
Those losses, as well as millions of dollars owed to all the state's roughl=

their electricity.=20
The qualifying facilities say that U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Monta=

But representatives for four QFs from the Bakersfield area at a bankruptcy=

state needs every megawatt it can get. And until they get paid a "reasonabl=

"If we're paid a rate that doesn't cover our costs we will financially fail=

said Bruce Leaverton, a lawyer representing the QFs.=20
Montali said he didn't think setting a new pricing system was within his jo=

"Even though your side doesn't like the result, a lot of time and effort ha=

gone into this decision," Montali said. He gave both sides until May 24 to=

PG&E said Wednesday that only eight of the 300 QFs within its territory=20

1400 megawatts of QF power remain offline statewide. That's an improvement=

Washington -- Three California House Republicans voted against Sen. Dianne=

Democrats warned the trio would pay at the polls.=20
In a test committee vote, Republicans George Radanovich of Fresno, Chris Co=

Feinstein proposal, saying it would make blackouts worse.=20
California Democrats had offered it as an amendment to a House bill aimed a=
t=20
ameliorating California's electricity crisis. The amendment failed 20 to 12=
=20
on a mostly party-line vote.=20
Given that there is little the federal government can do immediately to=20
increase power supplies to California, price controls have become the pivot=
=20
point of the debate in Washington over how to help the state.=20
PRICE-GOUGING ALLEGATIONS
Democrats, led by Feinstein, insist that federal regulators by law must=20
intervene when prices become "unjust and unreasonable." Not doing so, they=
=20
contend, puts California consumers at the mercy of price gouging by=20
wholesalers.=20
Republicans argue price caps would make the situation worse by discouraging=
=20
energy generators from providing power to the state.=20
The Democrats held an impromptu press conference in the hallway afterward,=
=20
accusing the Republicans of abandoning their state in its darkest hour.=20
"This Republican-dominated committee said that California should drop dead,=
 "=20
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles.=20
"I don't know about their districts, but I'll tell you one thing, my=20
constituents know that they're being screwed, and they're being screwed by=
=20
the out-of-state generators, and it's up to us to stand up for our=20
constituents," said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton. "I don't know what those=
=20
Republican members are going to say when they go home."=20
ANGRY GOVERNOR
Gov. Gray Davis blasted the Republicans from Sacramento.=20
"I find it very surprising that people here in California experiencing this=
=20
energy crisis can go back to Washington and vote against the best interests=
=20
of the constituents of the state," Davis said at a press conference.=20
The Republicans argued the Democratic plan would have hurt California.=20
"The fact of the matter is, if you put price caps on, you create a better=
=20
investment climate in Uganda than California," Radanovich said, "and I won'=
t=20
vote for anything that'll keep us from solving our supply problem."=20
Cox contended that price controls would do nothing to prevent blackouts=20
because they would not increase supply or reduce demand.=20
"In many ways this is for Californians simply changing the subject from our=
=20
immediate problems of May, June and July," Cox said. "No one is contending=
=20
that price controls will help us meet the blackout challenges."=20
He also argued that because Feinstein's plan would exempt about half of=20
California's power suppliers from the caps, it would open the door to=20
"further chaos."=20
EXEMPTIONS
Feinstein's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., would impose=

The state's top energy regulator says her proposal to force federal agencie=

But critics say the proposal by Public Utilities Commission President Loret=

refusing to rein in skyrocketing wholesale energy prices.=20
"It's just saying, 'You weren't nice to us, so we're not going to be nice t=

measure.=20
Lynch, a Democrat and appointee of Gov. Gray Davis, introduced the proposal=

this week as part of package of rate increases to be voted on Monday, which=
=20
could jack up monthly electricity bills on heavy residential energy users b=
y=20
40 percent and heavy commercial and industrial users by 50 percent or more.=
=20
Under her proposal, federal buildings, offices and military bases -- which=
=20
account for 1.5 percent of the state's energy load -- would pay rates based=
=20
on the fluctuating price of power on the wholesale market, probably leading=
=20
to huge increases at peak times.=20
Lynch said Wednesday the plan would force federal agencies to conserve=20
energy. She said the measure was not meant to punish the federal government=
=20
for not intervening in California's energy crisis.=20
"It's just an experiment," she said.=20
"I'm sure what Loretta is saying is, 'Put up or shut up,' " fellow=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown, a Democrat, who backs the idea said yesterday. "It=
=20
really puts the monkey on their back."=20
Brown said federal officials had urged state regulators to raise rates,=20
especially during peak times, to help cut demand. Lynch's plan would put th=
at=20
theory to the test on federal buildings, he said.=20
Federal officials say they are conserving energy. And earlier this month=20

In California, federal agencies have slashed energy consumption by 25 perce=

Mary Filippini, western region spokeswoman for the General Services=20
Administration, which manages federal offices, warned that any jump in ener=
gy=20
costs would have to be passed on to taxpayers.=20
Filippini also cautioned that Lynch's proposal could threaten a deal to sel=

State leaders consider scheduled power blackouts=20
Posted at 10:09 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 10, 2001=20
JOHN WOOLFOLK
State leaders are considering darkening sections of California on a rotatin=
g=20
schedule as one way to take the frustrating surprise out of the rolling=20
blackouts expected to be frequent this summer.=20
The proposal to turn off power to large sections of the state on a regular=
=20
basis rather than wait until the last minute to call a rolling blackout dre=
w=20
considerable interest among lawmakers. They met to consider the issue=20
Thursday, just days after outages swept the state with only minutes of=20
warning.=20
``We're talking about blackouts of such magnitude we just have to find a wa=
y=20
to get people better notified,'' said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo=20
Beach. ``People want to know whether it's in our best interest to simply pl=
an=20
for outages, rather than subject ourselves to an out-of-control market. We=
=20
may be better off doing that.''=20
But while scheduling power outages would make blackouts more predictable, i=
t=20
may also make them more frequent than necessary. Customers might find=20
themselves in the dark even if plenty of power is available.=20
But the advantage of planned outages is that by lowering power demand, the=
=20
state could curb the runaway power prices draining its budget and ``break t=
he=20
back'' of the energy ``cartel,'' Bowen said.=20
Currently, the state pays whatever is necessary to keep the lights on.=20
Wednesday, state officials said they paid $1,900 a megawatt-hour to avoid=
=20
blackouts, the most they ever have spent.=20
Residents and businesses complain that rolling blackouts would be more=20
bearable with more warning.=20
``The overwhelming response from our constituents is, `We want=20
notification,'?'' said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg, D-Los Angeles.=20
Businesses pay price=20
Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a=20
board member of the California Independent System Operator, which runs most=
=20
of the power grid, said rolling blackouts have come with just two minutes'=
=20
warning. He's trying to get a notification plan in place for the summer tha=
t=20
would allow at least half an hour of notice.=20
``A two-minute warning may be appropriate for a football game, but it's=20
inadequate to protect California's citizens and economy,'' Guardino said.=
=20
With at least half an hour, businesses could fire up standby generators or=
=20
turn off computers, assembly lines and other equipment that could be damage=
d=20
by sudden blackouts, Guardino said. That could lessen the enormous costs of=
=20
the blackouts to businesses.=20
The manufacturing group estimated that the first wave of rolling blackouts,=
=20
which hit the Bay Area during a heat wave June 14, cost Silicon Valley=20
companies $100 million.=20
A month's worth of blackout days this summer -- a likely possibility -- cou=
ld=20
cost California $16 billion and 15,000 jobs, Guardino said, citing a Bay Ar=
ea=20
Economic Forum analysis.=20
Rolling blackouts, in which utilities cut power from one group of customers=
=20
to the next for an hour or so, are ordered when power demand threatens to=
=20
overwhelm available supplies and crash the whole system. It could take days=
=20
to restore power after a systemwide failure.=20
Summer is critical because air conditioning is California's biggest power=
=20
use. Grid managers expect the state to be short some 3,700 megawatts,=20
particularly in May and June, enough for more than 3 million homes. New pow=
er=20
plants may lessen the shortage in late summer, but hydroelectric power coul=
d=20
be more limited then.=20
Desert residents object=20
With rolling blackouts a virtual certainty, some lawmakers suggested planni=
ng=20
the entire summer's outages months in advance.=20
``I'm interested in calendar blackouts,'' said Assemblyman Mike Briggs,=20
R-Fresno. ``I'm talking about calendaring months in advance, `These are you=
r=20
potential blackout days.'?''=20
Under the current system, about half of all customers are exempt from rolli=
ng=20
blackouts because they are essential services like police or hospitals or=
=20
share a circuit with them. The rest are divided among outage groups or bloc=
ks=20
spread throughout each utility's service area, a move intended to prevent=
=20
blackouts from affecting any region disproportionately.=20
Officials from desert districts oppose planning to turn off power in their=
=20
areas. But they suggested reconfiguring circuits so cool coastal areas coul=
d=20
go dark while hot regions are spared.=20
``If you want to black out other parts of the state, that's OK by me,'' sai=
d=20
Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, adding that his desert constituents have pa=
id=20
taxes to help coastal residents through earthquakes and mudslides. ``Now it=
's=20
our turn.''=20
The current system for dealing with power shortages was established under t=
he=20
state's 1996 deregulation plan, with three stages of emergencies declared a=
s=20
demand approaches the limits of supply.=20
During Stage 2 emergencies, utilities cut off businesses that have agreed t=
o=20
lose power in exchange for lower rates. Stage 3 emergencies indicate rollin=
g=20
blackouts are possible.=20
But state officials never expected to put such measures in place regularly,=
=20
and the system's flaws have become evident over the past year.=20
Grid officials avoid making outage predictions because they fight for every=

Here's what happened: In the wake of the energy crisis in the 1970s, ordina=

the oil industry was subject to ``refinery creep,'' the tendency of refinin=

the late 1990s.=20
What finally brought us up against capacity constraints was a surge in dema=

history -- 60 percent cheaper than it was in 1981. The nation rushed out to=

PG&E Files Opposition to Ratepayers' Committee



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 9, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Pacific Gas and
Electric Company today filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
asking the court to vacate the United States Trustee's (UST)
appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee. The filing indicates that
the creation of a Ratepayers' Committee exceeded the authority of the
UST because it was inconsistent with express provisions of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.


Pacific Gas and Electric Company appreciates that its Chapter 11
filing and Plan of Reorganization may create concerns for the
company's customers. Under the Bankruptcy Code, there are legitimate
ways by which the ratepayers can be represented and heard in the
process, for example, through the California Attorney General's
Office. In addition, the bankruptcy code provides flexibility and
discretion to the court to allow parties to intervene in the case when
they have standing to do so.


The utility does not object to ratepayers having a voice in the
process, when issues arise where the court determines they have
standing, but does object to procedures that are outside of the
existing Bankruptcy Code.


In its filing, Pacific Gas and Electric Company says the
"organizations and individuals appointed to the Ratepayers' Committee
-- and the ratepayers whose interests they supposedly represent -- are
neither creditors nor equity security holders and therefore not
eligible for appointment to a committee by the UST under Section
1102(a)(1). Thus, the UST's appointment of the Ratepayers' Committee
was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Code and constitutes an abuse of
discretion by the UST."

SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some Customers Following Stage 2 Electrical=20
Emergency Declaration



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 10 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) again declared a Stage 2 Emergency this afternoon due to
low power reserves and increased demand for power because of high
temperatures.  The agency called upon Southern California Edison and other
investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment programs for
certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 1 p.m. through
midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all customers to
immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels do =
not
deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction, at 1:48 p.m. SCE activated its voluntary
load curtailment program, under which large industrial, commercial, and
agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail electricity usage
during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's da=
ily
peak consumption period -- noon to 6 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of


highest electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an


air conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances


(dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and


electrical equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the "power-saver" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified


compact fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads; and


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

Associated Press Writer=3D


SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut
back on food or gas in order to pay his electricity bill.


The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays dlrs
80 a month for power during summer months. Now, he's trying to
figure out how to pay an electricity bill that could push dlrs 130
come June 1.


``Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been
dealing with balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ``But if I now
have to pay more for electricity, I'm not going to have money for
gas or food for the kids.''


As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened
thousands of businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many
struggled with an even bigger worry: how to pay for soaring energy
costs.


In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the
biggest rate increase in California history, up to 46 percent for
customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.
Those rate hikes start hitting customers in next month's bill.


Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres (640 hectares) in
the Mojave Desert, says a 40 percent increase would put his farm
out of business.


``It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said.
``Everybody here that farms alfalfa would be out of business.''


Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from
wells drilled 310 feet (93 meters) below his farm near Lancaster. A
small increase in the price of energy a few months ago added dlrs
80,000 to the dlrs 400,000 annual bill he was already paying.


To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ``interruptible''
customer, meaning he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off
during statewide electricity shortages in exchange for reduced
rates. So far this year, his power has been cut 26 times.


Even before the state utilities commission raised rates,
residents were paying 26 percent more for electricity than the
nationwide average, according to federal statistics. Only customers
in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii pay more.


One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity
has risen sharply over the past year but under California's 1996
deregulation law the state's largest utilities, PG&amp;E and SoCal
Edison, have been prevented from passing their costs to customers.
In April, PG&amp;E declared bankruptcy.


The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of
supplies, however. Its transmission system is fragmented and
overworked and would take years to improve, power officials told
the region's governors Wednesday.


``There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk
Kempthorne, one of four governors participating in a six-hour,
round-table meeting with industry representatives.


The Western Governors Association was told there is no
established method for paying for transmission upgrades, and market
and regulatory barriers stand in the way. It's not even clear where
new power lines are most needed.


The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana
and Wyoming, has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend
ways to eliminate bottlenecks.


Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of
rolling blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for
less service.


The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power
grid, has forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due
to severe shortages of electric supply.


Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles
and battery-operated clocks.


``I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in
California,'' she said.
