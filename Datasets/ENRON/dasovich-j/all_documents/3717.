Here is WPTF's draft  with my additions.  It proposes going with Hebert's 
formula.   I added some language to have the starting point be $350 or 
higher.  All the Hoecker questions are answered -- I was fine with it.  And 
Dan has a section at the end describing CA as Regulatory Luddites -- I LOVED 
it!

This looks really good -- I LOVED the Luddite Section!!!

I took out a lot of the PX wonderfulness -- the PX can say that stuff in its 
own comments and we have no independent way to verify what they say.

Also, I made a lot of changes to clarify or add thoughts.  Make sure the 
color graphics look OK in black and white.

My only disappiontment -- was no talk about the retail market or how CA 
regulators should focus on that -- I added the thought in one spot.

Because it is so long -- but still good-- I think a table of contents would 
really help-- so people see what is there and can flip to the relevant 
sections -- it also gets our full message across simply by looking at the 
headings.
