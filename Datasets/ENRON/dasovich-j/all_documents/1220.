Jeff,
 Don't you think this is a good thing? It sounds like the generators will not 
be singled out and that all market players: load, gen, rate payers etc., will 
need to take a little pain. This is the first time I've heard anyone say that 
rate payers will take some pain. Keep sending this stuff.
