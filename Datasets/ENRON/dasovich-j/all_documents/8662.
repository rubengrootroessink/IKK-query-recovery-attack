Jeff and Jim:

Here is a potential book on the California crisis and lessons learned.  The 
Independent Institute has a good track record with publishing and promoting 
books and would like Enron to be on the sponsors list to review and support.

If you are interested in this project, you can make contact with David and 
handle from here.  If you want me to handle with a potential contribution in 
the works, I can do that.

- Rob

Dear Rob,

Thank you for your note.

We do indeed have a number of excellent economists to do a piece along the 
lines that you are suggesting, as well as a separate, longer, more 
comprehensive book.

We also do have a number of contributors who believe that a full book project 
would be very timely because this issue is not going to be resolved with then 
immediate future.? In fact, with Gray Davis proposal and the Democrat 
stranglehold on the legislature in California, the chances are very likely 
that if anything, the policies that will be adopted will only make things a 
lot worse, especially for the prospects for real deregulation.

Hence, if you would be interested in reviewing such a project, please let me 
know.? As we have done in the past, a project of this timely nature could be 
streamlined for publication under our own imprint, with our own national 
distributor involved.

Best regards,

David

We gave Reason a general contribution due to their work on privatization 
given our water subsidiary that was interested in this area.? Their great 
electricity work was entirely their own w/o much Enron input.? We are now
following it closely and having conference calls on the issues. 

Books are too late usually but maybe you have a streamlined process.? If you 
sign up a Robert Michaels to write a whole book on the crisis, we should 
contribute something to the effort (how much I do not know).? Do you
have a pool of potential contributors who think a book would be timely enough?

Dear Rob,

A couple years ago, you may recall my indicating our interest in
pursuing a major book project on electric power regulation and
deregulation.? (I had organized and directed a similar project back
in the early 1980s that had produced the book, ELECTRIC POWER, edited
by John Morehouse.)

Since we speaking with you, we tried to pursue a new, in-depth
project with various funding sources who all claimed that the issue
was not an important or priority one to them.? As a result, little if
any solid work has been produced on this subject, and the momentum
has all been on the side of the re-regulators.

I am delighted that you recently funded the new Reason study on this
subject (and perhaps the forthcoming Cato study as well?).? However,
we believe that a comprehensive analysis is well overdue and in fact
is a must if we are to achieve the high ground on this vital issue.

As a result, would you be interested in discussing such a project with us?

Best regards,

David
