STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENT
IDAHO
Gov. Kempthorne nominates Hansen to PUC

Gov. Dirk Kempthorne (R.) has nominated Public Utilities Commission
President Dennis S. Hansen (R.) to serve a second six-year term as
commissioner.  Although the nomination is subject to Senate
confirmation, Kempthorne's staff told TR the governor doesn't expect to
encounter any problems with the confirmation.

The staff said no date had been set for a Senate hearing.  The Senate
has until the end of its session, which is expect to adjourn in March.

Hansen first was appointed to the commission in February 1995 by former
Gov. Phil Batt (R.), to a term that expired in 2001.  Before joining the
commission, Hansen served five terms in the Idaho Senate from 1987 to
1995.

In April the commissioners will elect a new commission president, the
PSC staff told TR.

SECTION 251/252
NEW MEXICO
PRC allows Qwest SGAT to take effect

The Public Regulation Commission yesterday allowed Qwest Corp.'s
proposed statement of generally available terms and conditions to take
effect, subject to review by the commission.  Pursuant to section
253(f)(3) of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, the commission
had to approve or reject the filing within 60 days.  Qwest filed the
SGAT Nov. 22.

The PRC staff told TR the commission will review the SGAT when the
regional workshops on Qwest's bid to enter the interLATA (local access
and transport area) market under section 271 of the Act have concluded.
(Utility case no. 3537 - In the Matter of Qwest Corporation's Statement
of Generally Available Terms Pursuant to Section 252(f) of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996)

IDAHO
Gov. Kempthorne proposes tax credits for broadband installations

Gov. Dirk Kempthorne (R.) has proposed offering companies tax credits
for bringing broadband connectivity to Idaho.  Under his plan,
investments in broadband infrastructure would qualify for a 3%
investment tax credit in addition to the current 3% investment tax
credit offered for any investment in the state.

Kempthorne proposed additional tax credits for investments in counties
where the unemployment rate is higher or where the personal income level
is lower than the statewide averages.  For example, if a company
invested in fiber in rural Adams County in western Idaho, it could
receive a 10.19% tax credit.  Companies investing in fiber optic
facilities in urban Boise, by comparison, could receive a 6.34% tax
credit.

The plan seeks to recognize the importance of Internet access and
high-speed connectivity.  The tax incentives also aim to reduce the
disparity in Internet access services available to residents of urban
and rural areas.

The total cost of the package is estimated to be $10.8 million.
Kempthorne also proposed a $3.4 million permanent tax cut in the
corporate tax rate, reducing the rate from 8% to 7.8%.  The governor
proposed implementing a research-and-development tax credit of 5%.
Kempthorne said he's proposing tax relief and tax incentives to
businesses that would total more than $22 million.

WIRELESS
NEBRASKA
Bill would create E911 surcharge

Sen. Pat Engel (I., District 17) has introduced a measure that would
establish a 50-cents per month surcharge on wireless service bills to
fund wireless E911 emergency response service.  Wireless carriers would
have to remit the surcharges to the Department of Administrative
Services' division of communications within 60 days of the last day of
each quarter.

LB 585 would create an advisory board to advise the division regarding
the implementation, development, and maintenance of E911.  The governor
would appoint the board's members, who would include county and
municipal officials and representatives from the wireless industry.

The division would determine (1) the costs of implementing wireless
automatic location identification, (2) the level of funding needed to
trigger disbursement, and (3) the costs to be incurred by wireless
carriers, "public safety answering points," and the advisory board for
implementing E911.

LB 585 has been referred to the Transportation and Telecommunications
Committee.

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
ILLINOIS
Legislators take aim at telephone solicitations

The House Rules Committee is considering a bill that would create a
Do-Not-Call database of listings of phone customers who don't want to
receive unsolicited telemarketing calls.  Beginning July 1, 2002,
persons and entities would be prohibited from making any telephone
solicitations to residential consumers who notified the secretary of
state that they didn't want to receive such phone calls.  The attorney
general would establish a toll-free number to take complaints about
unsolicited telemarketing calls.

The attorney general and the secretary of state would have to establish
an advisory group representing government entities, local exchange
carriers, business, and senior citizens and other community advocates to
promote educational literature to inform consumers about telephone
solicitations.

HB 176 would allow the attorney general to initiate proceedings that
could result in a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation.  Any
person who received more than one telephone solicitation within any
12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity could bring an action
to enjoin the violation, or bring an action to recover actual monetary
loss, or receive up to $5,000 in damages.

Reps. Jay Hoffman (D., Collinsville), Dan Reitz (D., Steeleville), James
Fowler (D., Harrisburg), Thomas Johnson (R., West Chicago), and Thomas
Holbrook (D., Belleville) introduced HB 176.

Rep. William Black (R., Danville) also has introduced a bill that would
create a no-call database.  HB 143 would require the state Commerce
Commission to establish the database and would allow the commission to
penalize violators.  (1/12/01 a.m.)

CUSTOMER-AFFECTING
COLORADO
Legislation would create no-call list

Sen. Ken Chlouber (R., District 4) and Rep. Mark Larson (R., District
59) have introduced a bill that would create a no-call list for
residential telephone subscribers who don't want to receive telephone
solicitation calls.  The Office of Consumer Counsel (OCC) would
administer the list.

The OCC would have to establish rules for developing and maintaining the
list.  The rules would have to require that local exchange carriers
notify subscribers annually through bill mailing inserts of the no-call
list.  The rules also would have to require the designated agent to
maintain an automated online complaint reporting system to enable
subscribers to report suspected violations.  The OCC would have to
contact persons or entities reported to have violated the legislation.

A consumer could subscribe to the list for free, but telemarketers would
have to pay $500 to access the list.  Violators of the legislation would
be committing a "deceptive trade practice" under the Colorado Consumer
Protection Act.

SB 93 has been assigned to the Senate Business, Labor, and Finance
Committee.

NEW HAMPSHIRE
Bill would bar solicitors' use of autodialers

Rep. Harold P. Melcher (D., District 11) has introduced a bill that
would prohibit telephone solicitors from using automatic telephone
dialing systems when calling residential telephone customers.  HB 115
would provide a $500 private right of action.  The bill has been
referred to the Commerce Committee.  Its text is available at
http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2001/HB0115.html.

MISSISSIPPI
Legislator moves to bar phone solicitors from blocking Caller ID

Rep. Joey Fillingane (R., District 101) has introduced a bill that would
prohibit telephone solicitors from blocking or otherwise bypassing a
consumer's Caller ID service.  Caller ID service providers wouldn't be
held liable for any violations of HB 208 by other parties.

HB 208 has been referred to the House Public Utilities Committee.

WIRELESS
MAINE
Bills target drivers' use of wireless phones

Competing bills that would ban wireless phone use while driving have
been introduced in the House.  Rep. Gerald N. Bouffard (D., District 90)
has introduced HB 98 to prohibit the use of handheld phones while
driving.

Meanwhile, Rep. Joseph E. Brooks (D., District 107) is sponsoring HB 91,
which would prohibit drivers from using handheld phones or any other
"handheld electronic device," including computers, citizens band radios,
dictaphones, and microphones."

Both bills would make violations traffic offenses.  They have been
referred to the Committee on Transportation.  The text of HB 98 is
available at
http://janus.state.me.us/legis/bills/billtexts/LD010201-1.asp, and the

UTAH
PSC sets conference on Qwest facilities prices

The Public Service Commission has scheduled a Jan. 31 scheduling and
technical conference to begin setting prices for facilities and services

services that the company provides to other LECs for which prices need
to be set.

Qwest initiated this proceeding, submitting a proposed list of
facilities and services that require prices.  Its list includes customer
transfer charges, unbundled loops, line sharing, unbundled dark fiber,
local switching, and unbundled network element platforms.  (Docket no.
