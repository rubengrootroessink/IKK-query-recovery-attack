Jeff:  Attached is a draft proposal - one page long followed by a page of
notes.  I am sending it first to you to get your thoughts and corrections.
You will note that I empahsized the need to open the natural gas market.  I
think this has been overlooked.  You will also note that I suggested
banning outdoor advertising.  Nixon did this in 1973 and it had two
effects.  First, it cut usage.  Second, it brought home the magnitude of
the crisis to consumers.  We need to do that now.  The ban also needs to be
state wide.  this would free some generating capacity for more essential
purposes.   As I recall, most out door advertisers did not object to the
ban as long as it did not put them at a competitive disadvantage.

I am trying to run down key individuals but have had no luck yet.  i
understand, however, that our legislators were busy all day!

Phil
