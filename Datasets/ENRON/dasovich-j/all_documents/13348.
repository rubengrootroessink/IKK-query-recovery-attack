a venture firm in Northern Virginia. Steve Dow, a general partner at Sevin=

Rosen, declined to name the firm but said the relationship is likely to=20
resemble one his firm recently established with Silicon Valley Seed=20
Investors, a fledgling New York City venture capital firm. According to Mr.=
=20
Dow, Sevin Rosen has been on the lookout for areas that "have the potential=
=20
to be more interesting over time." In the last year, Mr. Dow's firm, which=
=20
has offices in Dallas and Palo Alto, Calif., has opened two new satellite=
=20
offices in Austin, Texas and San Diego. The firm has one partner in the=20
Austin office, while another splits his time between Palo Alto and San Dieg=

The deal with the Virginia firm will likely be the end of Sevin Rosen's=20
expansion. "I would be shocked if you see us opening anymore [offices]," sa=
id=20
Mr. Dow. He said the firm, which has ten partners, wants to make sure they=
=20
have the ability to bounce ideas off one another. "Unlike with law firms,=
=20
it's not always clear how you should scale an early stage venture capital=
=20
firm," he said. Founded in January, Silicon Valley Seed Investors, which=20
focuses on early stage high tech companies in the New York metro area, rais=

$30 million from three venture firms: Canaan Partners, based in Rowayton,=

Conn., Rho Management, based in New York, and Sevin Rosen. Each firm=20
