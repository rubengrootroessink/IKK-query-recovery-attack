Ms. Halligan, 
Mr. Mark Baldwin with Interstate Gas Services will be representing 
Transwestern Pipeline Company during Tuesday's hearing.  Transwestern is 
a party of record in this proceeding.  Mr. Baldwin is Transwestern's 
California consultant, and is well versed in state regulatory matters 
and, in particular, this docket.  On behalf of Transwestern, Mr. Baldwin 
will address the following issues: 
1. The PD in light of recent events in both the natural gas and 
electricity markets in California. 
2  A comparison of certain features of the PD and the alternative 
settlement (Comprehensive Settlement) supported by SoCalGas Company and 
the majority of the stakeholders, including Transwestern Pipeline. 
3. The relationship between the CPUC's decision in this proceeding and 
the ongoing investigation of the sufficiency of infrastructure for both 
natural gas and electricity. 
My understanding is that the CPUC prefers the speakers be brief.  With 
your permission, Mr. Baldwin's remarks will be limited to no more than 5 
minutes, with an opportunity for questions to follow. 
Please let me know if there are any other guidelines the CPUC would like 
parties to follow in this proceeding.  Also, please let me know if there 
are any questions that I can answer for you.
