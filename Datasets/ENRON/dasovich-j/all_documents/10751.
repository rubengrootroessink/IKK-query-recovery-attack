USA: Enron to cut one-fifth of jobs at broadband unit.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

HOUSTON, April 6 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Friday 
it will eliminate some 250, or roughly 20 percent, of the jobs at its 
broadband telecommunications unit, detailing a move which it has previously 
described as an internal redeployment of staff. 
Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said the company is 
cutting jobs at the unit, which now employs 1,150 people, because it has 
completed the build-out of its 18,000-mile (29,000 km) fiber-optic network 
and because of slow demand for streaming media products delivered to personal 
computers.
"The network is substantially complete now, so that means fewer people are 
required for technical positions," she said. 
The job cuts also reflect Enron Broadband's decision to play a less active 
role in the market for streaming media services, such as video of corporate 
events delivered to personal computers, where demand had been slower than 
expected, she said. 
However, Kimberly said Enron Broadband will continue to pursue 
entertainment-on-demand services actively. 
Kimberly said employees whose jobs are being eliminated will be eligible for 
redeployment to other positions at Enron Broadband Services or other Enron 
units, although there could be some involuntary terminations. 
Previously Enron officials had dismissed rumors about job cuts at Enron 
Broadband Services and had spoken instead of an internal redeployment of 
staff within the unit without detailing its impact on overall employment 
there. 
The company's stock, which peaked at just above $90 last year and was trading 
in the $80s as recently as mid-February, has recently fallen into the $50s in 
line with broader weakness in the stock market and among technology and 
telecommunications stocks in particular. On Friday it was up 95 cents at 
$56.65. 
Since early last year Enron has been building a high-speed broadband 
communications network that it plans to use as a base to build a bandwidth 
marketing and trading business similar to its huge natural gas and 
electricity trading operation. 
Excitement among investors about the broadband business and about Enron's 
success in developing a strong Internet-based trading platform for energy and 
other commodities drove an 87 percent rise in the company's share price last 
year, outpacing a gain of 54 percent for the S&P utilities index. 
Kimberly said Enron's bandwidth trading operation is continuing to perform 
strongly, with more than 500 trades carried out in the first quarter, 
exceeding the total for all of 2000. 
Despite the jobs cuts at Enron Broadband, she said, the unit is recruiting to 
fill some other positions.

USA: RESEARCH ALERT-Morgan starts Dynegy as buy.

04/06/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan said Friday that analyst Anatol 
Feygin had initiated coverage of Dynegy Inc. as a long term buy with a price 
target of $63 a share. 
He said the company has provided "defensive earnings growth through a top 
tier wholesale energy player" that is "second only to Enron ."
Dynegy's asset-light strategy allows the company to follow Enron's lead, with 
a favorable risk/reward profile with 73 percent of EBIT coming from 
non-regulated "merchant energy" opportunities, he said. 
"We project Dynegy's long-term earnings growth rate at 22 percent," he added. 
The analyst attributed Dynegy's "retreat from the $57 level to the California 
power crisis, which has been a major stumbling block for the stock and should 
hinder near-term performance. It casts doubt on the very dynamic that Dynegy 
is a play on, and usurps management time and talent. 
"Although fundamentally we see it as more of a nuisance - a few 
credit/collection issues (with) little to no earnings risk, and a delay, not 
a derailment of the deregulation process - the resolution of the Golden State 
debacle is to us the key catalyst for an upgrade." 
Dynegy shares were off 94 cents at $49.98 in early New York Stock Exchange 
trading.

JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: On March 20, Vincent Viola was 
voted in as the new chairman of the New Mercantile Exchange. He takes over 
during a time of change and challenge for the NYMEX. Mr. Viola is here now to 
talk about his new position and the task ahead. 
Congratulations on the ascension to the throne down there.
VINCENT VIOLA, NYMEX CHAIRMAN: Thank you, Jack. 
CAFFERTY: Job one is? 
VIOLA: Making sure that the exchange is postured to fulfill it`s purpose as a 
magnificently liquid and efficient pricing mechanism, and a stable, global 
counterparty for mediation of credit and risk on the products that we pursue 
to trade on the exchange. 
CAFFERTY: And to do it with an eye on making a profit. 
VIOLA: Yes, exactly. 
CAFFERTY: Which is a little bit different assignment than it`s been down 
there. 
VIOLA: Yes, exactly, the fact that our business model now, by virtue of the 
fact that we seek to make and provide profit to our shareholders compels us 
to start to act and function like a business. 
CAFFERTY: Now last year, you did incur losses down there of about almost $3 
million. Tell me a little bit about why that happened and what you`re doing 
that`s going to prevent it from continuing to happen. 
VIOLA: Well, simply put, we had to make a decision as to enhancing the access 
of participants to our marketplace. And we went and decided to create our own 
proprietary electronic platform. 
CAFFERTY: Animex (ph), is that way. 
VIOLA: Enymex. 
CAFFERTY: Enymex, I`m sorry. 
VIOLA: And that was capital decision, capital spending decision that we made, 
rightfully so. And that caused the gap to close between revenues and 
expenses. 
CAFFERTY: All right, this is because, I would assume, of pressures from 
companies like Intercontinental Exchange, Enron Online, and some of the 
foreign operations as well, right? I mean, you to upgrade to stay 
competitive, is that. 
VIOLA: I think the B2B model hit everyone as a novel yet substantively 
interesting concept. For our marketplace, the most efficient source of 
liquidity right now, and the culture around trading our major product, oil, 
is based in the physical execution of those trades through open auction 
outcry. And the culture around oil trading is clearly much more comfortable 
person-to-person. We like to say, simply put, the best price for oil in the 
world is found on the floor of the NYMEX. The electronic umbrella around that 
execution in liquidity clearly will be best served by an electronic platform. 
CAFFERTY: Who`s going to win this tug-of-war eventually between the advent of 
electronic transactions and the old way of doing it by yelling out your bid? 
VIOLA: I think the source of liquidity that has the most continuous and 
consistent tightness between the bid and offer will in fact win out. And I 
think that the support of electronic access to the marketplace can only 
enhance the individual trader on the floor`s ability to provide the best 
service. 
CAFFERTY: Is it a matter of time, though, until technology simply outstrips 
the ability of individuals to move with the speed and proficiency that these 
computers can do? 
VIOLA: Clearly, technology, as it improves in terms of reliability and 
consistency, in terms of delivery of price, is the trend that we will react 
to as business people on the mercantile exchange. And we are preparing very, 
very aggressively to continue to make our markets the most efficient. It has 
to be stated that NYMEX is a double-A credit and a global counterparty, which 
mediates risk across a very, very wide range of market participants looking 
for credit mediation for the exchange of energy products. 
CAFFERTY: Talk to me for a minute about commodities and about the areas of 
the commodity business that you see perhaps being the areas that will 
generate the best profits for you, where the most action is likely to be. 
Just give me an overview of the markets from where you sit. 
VIOLA: Well, as a business model, the exchange provides for revenue- sourced, 
value-added functions. Firstly, it`s the only neutral model that can be 
conceived and executed currently, and looking for in the future. Secondly, 
its banking and mediation and price management through its margin facility 
and clearing facility, is a unique source of value. Thirdly, its information 
and data that it provides from the uniquely neutral and independent and 
uninfluenced prices that are physically identified on the floor is a unique 
source of basis and benchmark for oil trading throughout the world. And 
lastly, the professional and unique ability and experience of the best oil 
traders in the world, both on the floor and the ring of individuals that deal 
with those people off the floor every day, make the NYMEX a uniquely talented 
pool of business potential. It has to be stated that the gentlemen who trade 
oil for major concerns, institutional concerns, while they`re communicating 
with the floor of the NYMEX, every day, for many years, there`s a very, very 
close connection and cultural comfort and reliability on those prices and 
their efficiencies that have grown over the years. And we think that that`s 
going to be maintained. So I think those four principal sources of revenue 
are the essence of our model. 
CAFFERTY: What scares you about the new job? when you wake up in the middle 
of the night, you go, gee, I`m the chairman now, what worries you? 
VIOLA: I think I get a sense of unbridled excitement. I`ve always enjoyed a 
real good, fair fight. And I think what concerns me and excites me at the 
same time is that I`m responsible for almost 800-plus members and their 
families and the marketplaces that we serve, trying to bring very fair, open, 
properly banked markets. 
CAFFERTY: Good stuff. 
VIOLA: Yes. 
CAFFERTY: Appreciate your coming in. I wish you well, I hope your very 
successful as the new chairman of the NYMEX. 
VIOLA: You`re very kind, thank you. 
CAFFERTY: All right, Vincent Viola, thanks.

Deerfield Beach 
City Manager Larry Deetjen has hired two consultants to help a committee of 
volunteers shore up information about plans to build two natural-gas power 
plants in the southwest end of the city.
The consultants, Tom T. John and Pete Hoffman, will help members of the 
city's seven-member Ad Hoc Energy Committee find out as much information as 
possible about the proposed plants. Enron Corp. and El Paso Corp. want to 
build power plants in the city's industrial area. 
John and Hoffman made a presentation to the committee on Thursday. 
Many people who live in North Broward County have opposed those plans, 
particularly in the case of Enron Corp., which also wants to build a plant in 
Pompano Beach.

APPROVE ENRON POWER PLANT PUT POLLUTION ISSUE IN PERSPECTIVE

04/06/2001
South Florida Sun-Sentinel 
Broward Metro
30A
(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel) 

In a "perfect" world, there would be no automobiles, with their internal 
combustion engines spewing pollutant-laden exhaust into the air. But how 
perfect would such a world be without the mobility and economic vitality 
those cars provide? 
In a "perfect" world, there would be no factories or refineries polluting air 
and water alike. But how perfect would such a world be without the steel, the 
textiles and the petroleum products those plants produce to meet the needs of 
consumers?
And in a "perfect" world, there would be no power plants spewing pollutants 
into the air. But how perfect would such a world be without the electricity 
those plants generate to light, heat and cool our homes and businesses? 
Modern life forces unpleasant choices on all of us, from the average consumer 
to the highest-ranking public official. Those choices should be made with an 
eye on the big picture, and never on the basis of unrealistic notions of an 
idyllic world devoid of the sometimes unhealthy byproducts of human 
enterprise. 
The Pompano Beach City Commission is faced with such a choice. On Tuesday, 
commissioners are to consider a proposal by Enron Corp., a Houston-based 
energy company, to build a "peaking" power plant in the city. That type of 
plant operates only when a public utility, in this case Florida Power & Light 
Co., needs to purchase a backup source of power during periods of peak usage. 
The commissioners are under tremendous pressure from other politicians as 
well as residents, not only of Pompano Beach but of neighboring Margate and 
Coconut Creek, who worry about the increased air pollution such a plant 
inevitably would create. Opponents also are suspicious of Enron's long-range 
plans, which they contend involve a hidden agenda to push for state 
deregulation of the electric industry, which in turn would enable Enron to 
operate the plant 24 hours a day and sell the excess power elsewhere. There 
also are concerns about Enron's plans to use diesel fuel as a backup to its 
natural gas supply, the primary fuel source for the plant. 
Those worries are understandable, and no one should be unsympathetic to the 
residents' concerns. But if commissioners keep their eye on the big picture, 
they will have to conclude that the positives of this proposal greatly 
outweigh the negatives. 
To begin with, South Florida's burgeoning population requires foresight to 
avoid future power shortages like those California is now experiencing. A 
region that expects to add 2.3 million people during the next 20 years should 
be preparing now for the additional energy needs such growth will create. 
Moreover, a plant using relatively clean-burning natural gas and built by 
Enron, a company lauded as "progressive" by environmentalists for embracing 
alternative energy sources and for its commitment to tackling global warming, 
should be seen as preferable to what the area might ultimately be stuck with 
if forced in desperation to seek new sources of electricity generation during 
a power crisis. Already it has been determined that the proposed Enron plant 
would generate far, far less nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide than FPL's 
oil-powered plant at Port Everglades. 
To put things in further perspective, the plant would emit less than 2 
percent of the amount of nitrogen oxide emitted by Broward County automobiles 
in a typical year. Opponents of the plant should be asking themselves whether 
their concern for the environment extends to carpooling or even leaving their 
cars at home at times when they could walk or ride a bicycle to their 
destination. 
Concerns about the possible burning of diesel fuel are valid, but Enron has 
agreed to fixed limits on the amount of diesel it would use, and to use 
relatively high-quality, low-sulfur diesel. Moreover, Enron's smokestacks are 
to be 80 feet high, meaning neighborhoods near the plant would likely 
experience no more pollution than other neighborhoods in the area. It should 
also be noted that the state Department of Environmental Protection has given 
preliminary approval to a permit for the plant, saying a lengthy review had 
found that it would have little impact on the region's air quality. 
Little impact. Compare that with the positive impact it would have on Pompano 
Beach, by increasing its tax base, providing jobs and developing a large 
piece of land that no one else has expressed any interest in; and on all of 
South Florida, by providing a source of relatively clean power for a region 
that will surely need it in the not-too-distant future, by minimizing costs 
to consumers and by making rolling brownouts unnecessary during periods of 
peak electrical usage. 
The plant cannot be built without a zoning change for the 28-acre site from 
industrial to public utility. The Pompano Beach Planning and Zoning Board has 
already approved the rezoning. City commissioners should keep their eye on 
the big picture and ratify that decision, for the good of Pompano Beach and 
all of South Florida.

Transwestern Pipeline Company; Notice of Application

04/06/2001
Federal Register

Copyright (c) 2001 Federal Information & News Dispatch, Inc. All rights

April 2, 2001. 
Take notice that on March 29, 2001, Transwestern Pipeline Company, P.O. Box 
3330, Omaha, Nebraska 68103-0330, in Docket No. CP01-115-000 filed an 
application pursuant to Sections 7(b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for 
permission and approval for Transco to replace mainline compression 
facilities at four existing compressor stations in Arizona, all as more fully 
set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to 
public inspection. This filing may be viewed on the web at 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/online/rims.htm (call 202-208-2222 for assistance).
Specifically, Transwestern proposes to abandon in place twelve existing 
drivers and compressors, totaling 49,500 horsepower, at Stations 1, 2, 3 and 
4; and install operate a 41,500 ISO-rated horsepower turbine centrifugal 
compressor at each of the four stations. Transwestern also requests, to 
ensure a smooth transition to the new compressor units, to maintain the 
ability to operate the existing facilities up to six months after the 
installation of the new units. It is stated that the new units will require 
less maintenance activity than the existing units as well as operate more 
efficiently in flowing more gas through its system. 
Transwestern states that result of the project it will be able to provide 
incremental capacity of approximately 150,000 Mcf per day on its mainline 
from Thoreau, New Mexico to California, increasing its total capacity to 
California to 1,240,000 Mcf per day. It is indicated that the proposed 
modification will enable it to meet the supply and demand imbalance in the 
California area. Transwestern proposes to place the facilities into service 
by June 1, 2002. Transwestern estimates the cost for the proposed 
construction to be approximately $93,300,000, to be financed with 
internally-generated funds. Transwestern also states that it is not at this 
time requesting rolled-in pricing for the new facilities, and understands 
that it will be at risk for the recovery of costs associated with the 
proposed modifications. 
Any questions regarding the application should be directed to Keith L. 
Petersen, at (402) 398-7421. 
There are two ways to become involved in the Commission's review of this 
project. First, any person wishing to obtain legal status by becoming a party 
to the proceedings for this project should, on or before April 16, 2001, file 
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE, 
Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene in accordance with the 
requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 
385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). A 
person obtaining party status will be placed on the service list maintained 
by the Secretary of the Commission and will receive copies of all documents 
filed by the applicant and by all other parties. A party must submit 14 
copies of filings made with the Commission and must mail a copy to the 
applicant and to every other party in the proceeding. 
Only parties to the proceeding can ask for court review of Commission orders 
in the proceeding. 
However, a person does not have to intervene in order to have comments 
considered. The second way to participate is by filing with the Secretary of 
the Commission, as soon as possible, an original and two copies of comments 
in support of or in opposition to this project. The Commission will consider 
these comments in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but the 
filing of a comment alone will not serve to make the filer a party to the 
proceeding. The Commission's rules require that persons filing comments in 
opposition to the project provide copies of their protests only to the party 
or parties directly involved in the protest. 
Persons who wish to comment only on the environmental review of this project 
should submit an original and two copies of their comments to the Secretary 
of the Commission. Environmental commenters will be placed on the 
Commission's environmental mailing list, will receive copies of the 
environmental documents, and will be notified of meetings associated with the 
Commission's environmental review process. Environmental commenters will not 
be required to serve copies of filed documents on all other parties. However, 
the non-party commenters will not receive copies of all documents filed by 
other parties or issued by the Commission (except for the mailing of 
environmental documents issued by the Commission) and will not have the right 
to seek court review of the Commission's final order. 
[Page Number 18239] 
The Commission may issue a preliminary determination of non-environmental 
issues prior to the completion of its review of the environmental aspects of 
the project. This preliminary determination typically considers such issues 
as the need for the project and its economic effect on existing customers of 
the applicant, on other pipelines in the area, and on landowners and 
communities. For example, the Commission considers the extent to which the 
applicant may need to exercise eminent domain to obtain rights-of-way for the 
proposed project and balances that against the non-environmental benefits to 
be provided by the project. Therefore, if a person has comments on community 
and landowner impacts from this proposal, it is important either to file 
comments or to intervene as early in the process as possible. 
Also, comments protests, and interventions may be filed electronically via 
the internet in lieu of paper. See, 18 CFT 385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the 
instructions on the Commission's web site at 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/efi/doorbell.htm. 
If the Commission decides to set the application for a formal hearing before 
an Administrative Law Judge, the Commission will issue another notice 
describing that process. At the end of the Commission's review process, a 
final Commission order approving or denying a certificate will be issued. 
Linwood A. Watson, Jr., 
Acting Secretary.

Verizon to Pitch Movies-on-Demand to Studios, Variety Says
2001-04-06 15:29 (New York)


     New York, April 6 (Bloomberg) -- Verizon Communications Inc.
is offering movie studios millions of dollars in incentive fees
and other inducements to try to interest the studios in its high-
speed Internet movie-on-demand service, Variety magazine reported.
     Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.
and Sony Corp. are expected to meet with the telephone company
beginning next week, the magazine said.
     Verizon has completed market tests of the service in
Washington, and has placed tens of millions of dollars in orders
for television set-top boxes in order to begin offering the
service as early as June, the magazine said.
     An agreement could hurt plans by Enron Corp. to attract the
studios as partners for a service it planned with Viacom Inc.'s
Blockbuster Entertainment unit, the magazine said. Enron and
Blockbuster ended their exclusive relationship last month.
