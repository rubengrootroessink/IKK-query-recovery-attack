One element of net taxes is the transfer = interest payments on the public
debt.  Higher i raises interest payments and, thus, the goverment budget
deficit (G-T).

Same logic: Short-term loans need to be refinanced regularly (unlike long-term
fixed-rate bonds).  If I have loans that need to be refinanced, their
refinanced rate will be roughly 1/2 point higher this month than last due to
the actions of the ECB.

to primary bread-winners.

Lots of min. wage workers are teens, but roughly 40% are low-income heads of
households.

Turnover is high in low-wage jobs, so employment might fall, but not due to
many layoffs -- just lower hiring.  The point remains that employment still
declines.  Most estimates are that the employment declines are quite small, so
that low-wage workers on average come out ahead with the rise.
