Per Jim's request.  I will send you the previous repoerts and I have asked 
B&P to include you on the distribution for any future reports.  The hearing 
was originally supposed to conclude yesterday, but obviously did not.  We are 
not sure how long it will continue.

Becky --

B&P should probably send this information to Jeff Dasovich as well.
