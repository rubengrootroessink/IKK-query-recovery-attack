Great news!
We have been able to confirm the first 8 people on the waitlist by adding
another table for the VC Roundtable dinner on Mon 6th Nov.

Here are the names:
Jay Badenhope
Steven Sesar
Jerome Rougeot
Coco Kee
Leah Fine
Douglas Buzbee
Joseph Karp
Todd Miller

Further, there is now the possibility to add a further table (this will
only be confirmed tomorrow). So far we have the following people listed as
the next 8:

Lawrence Low
Peter Li
Aaron McNally
Will Birdsey
James Leonard
Florian Pestoni
David Hudson
Debra Underwood

Could all of you get checks for $25 (in favour of UC Regents) to my mailbox
(Nitin Chellaram) ASAP (look under Exchange Students in MBAA lounge) if you
have not already paid. Also, today is the last chance to e-mail me bios as
described in previous e-mails (2-3 paragraphs, up to one page max.,
highlighting parts of your resume that you feel are relevant to VC and
explaining why you are interested in attending this event). I MUST receive
bios by 5pm today at the latest if they are to be included.

Thanks
Nitin
