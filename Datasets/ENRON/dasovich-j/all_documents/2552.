A procedural order issued late last night on the Staff Investigation in the 
California market.  A special FERC Commission meeting will be held November 1 
to consider a draft order on remedies.  The Commission will also issue the 
staff investigation report.  Thereafter, comments are due within three weeks 
to supplement the record or comment on the Commission's proposed remedies.  
On November 9, the Commission will hold a public conference to discuss 
proposed remedies.  Based on the full record then, the FERC expects to issue 
an order directing remedies by the end of the year.
