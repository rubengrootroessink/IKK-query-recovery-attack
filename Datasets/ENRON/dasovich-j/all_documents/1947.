Jeff, I'm sorry.  I had an issue that I wanted to resolve.  I wasn't upset
and I was very calm when I called you, but when I brought it up, you just
freaked out and got defensive and started yelling at me about how you
"couldn't do this anymore."  Maybe you can be calmer now.  What I did find
out was that what you thought was a discussion about "moving in together"
was, in my mind, a discussion about me selling my place in order to buy my
own place.  If I were moving in with you, I would simply rent this place
out.  As far as I remember, you never said anything about me moving in with
you.  Which is fine.  I don't have a problem with the fact that we haven't
talked about moving in together.  That's not the issue for me.  What is an
issue is that you seem to not want to be straight with me.  If you were
truly talking about living together, then that's what you need say.  If not,
then you shouldn't tell other people that.  I feel like I need to guess at
what you mean.  (I think the communication is worse when you smoke pot, by
the way)  It also upsets me that you couldn't talk to me when I called you.
So, I guess "you just can't deal with this anymore."  And I guess that's up
to you.  But I do feel like you're bringing that on yourself.  I would like
to discuss these things calmly.  You can call me if you want to do that.
