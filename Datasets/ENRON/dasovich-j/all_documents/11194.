Harry,
The future prices used below are from NYMEX - quoted for California Oregon 
Border (COB)
I am attaching the web pages that are relevant


We obtained the NP15 numbers from a daily compilation of Dow Jones NP15 
quotes.  Since we don't have that on a recognizable piece of paper, I am 
attaching the most recent ISO Market Activity Report for February.  That 
contains a February price of $341/MWh (see page 3).


To get from $290 to (about) $300/MWh add the following
1) Ancillary services -- use about 4-5% of energy costs (see page 5 of ISO 
report)
2) Losses to get from Supplier to Customer -- even 5% losses (which is 
conservative) adds another $10/MWh

/TJ

NP15:  Recorded hourly Dow Jones numbers averaged using the same time periods 
as NYMEX.
MW:  Reported as of April 12 NYMEX.

Peak Periods = (365 days less 10 holidays) x 6/7 weekdays x 16 hours => 56% 
On-peak


The current rates for PG&E and SCE are as per the Mar 27 CPUC decision.  The 
GWh are from the utilities 2001 (12mos) rate design templates.
