Rob,

Thank you for the opportunity to clarify.  There is no rule for fifteen days
per se.  Based on the date we delivered the final study to CSUF/Enron (Jan.
12, 2000), we would need an answer back in 15 days in order to have a
reasonable chance at making your stated schedule (as shared with us on
11/15/99 and re-stated on 1/5/00) for getting the new substation on line.
You actually have 60 days to respond.

In the Detailed Study, we requested a written notice to proceed by February
1, 2000 to make CSUF/Enron's target completion date for the new  substation
online.  CSUF/Enron can take up to 60 days, but doing so will impact the
desired schedule and necessitate a scheduling change.

Don Fantz
