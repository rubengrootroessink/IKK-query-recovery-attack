Please explain the deletion of the provision precluding sharing of the
confidential information between Enron Comm and other Enron entities.  As
ISO indicated to you this is a key regulatory concern of theirs, and I do
not want to forward this until I understand Enron's position.

I believe that ISO will only accept California or New York law for their
agreements, but will check when I hear back from you.

Hi Jim:

Please find attached EBS's proposed modifications to the changes you
proposed.  Perhaps the biggest issue is which state's laws will govern.
We're open to Oregon, Delaware, or Texas.  California's a problem.  Let me
know what you think.

Best,
Jeff
