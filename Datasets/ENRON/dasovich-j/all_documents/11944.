Dear fellow students,

As classes are about to end for the semester, we will be asked to complete
Instructor Evaluations Forms for each class taken. The evaluations are one
of the most effective tools we have as students to ensure the quality of
instruction remains high and our tuition dollars are used effectively. Both
the Student Advisory Committee and the Evening MBA Association work hard to
improve the program but our efforts become difficult when those professors
whom students felt were not up to par receive high marks.

The evaluations are used in deciding whether to invite instructors back to
the program. Club 6 is an elite group of professors that have received a
median evaluation of 6.0 or better. Students should consider a rating of 6
as a sign of an outstanding teacher. This will allow us to truly reward and
distinguish the professors that stand out.

Please keep the following in mind when considering the Instructor Evaluation
Forms.

1. Courses taught by multiple professors require multiple evaluations. Not
all instructors add the same value and we should recognize this. Please
differentiate your evaluations being specific about each professor and
his/her specific strenghts and weaknesses.

2. Some classes are more 'fun' than others. Please keep in mind that the
form clearly distingushes between the course strenghts and the instructor's
effectiveness in teaching the course. While some classes are not so popular,
the professors teaching those courses might be truly outstanding.

3. Many people reported to us that they did not have a reference scale to
guide them in making evaluation decisions. Keep in mind that 6 is considered
an above average performanace. The following is the reference scale provided
a while back. Please bring it to class or keep it in mind when evaluating
the faculty.

1 - Soo bad, it's less than 2
2 - So bad, it's less than 3
3 - Class had many critical faults. This instructor should not be
invited again unless major changes are made
4 - Class had some critical shortcomings, this instructor should be
invited again after some adjustments
5 - A good course, instructor in line with expectation for HAAS
instructors
6 - Excellent course, instructor generally superior to MOST other
instructors previously had
7 - Outstanding/walks on water

4. For your reference, the following is a link to the article in HaasNews
announcing the members if this elite club for the Fall 2000 semester.
