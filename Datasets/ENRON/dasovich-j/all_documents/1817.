Jeff- 
Glad to have you along for the ride last night- hopefully Charlotte is not 
too jealous that I am pilfering her ridership.

Just wanted to see if you could mail me the phone numbers which you have been 
dialing in SF and Medocino that are giving you trouble so our network group 
can run a quality audit.

Thanks and see you at school. 
Jonathan
