Please consider this a reminder that your "IRT" updates are soon due to Rick 
& Sue Nord.  

In order to facilitate processing this report in a timely manner, please 
utilize the
attached Excel file (see below), which contains two worksheets, one "blank" 
for your usage for new entries (see the tab labeled "INPUT for SEPTEMBER").  
The other worksheet contains the August Report in its entirety (tab labeled 
"AUGUST REPORT"), for reference as well as "cut & paste" purposes (if 
simpler!).

Please complete and return to me by COB Wednesday, August 30th......
(and don't forget your priority "rankings" for each entry!)

Note:  if you'd prefer a hard copy of the above, please let me know.  

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
