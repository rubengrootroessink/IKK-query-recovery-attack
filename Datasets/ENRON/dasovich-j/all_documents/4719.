I'll be on vacation Tuesday, but am reachable by phone. And, yes, my
position is that I want trade associations taking a firm stance in cases
such as we face in Calif.

Having worked with many trade groups over the years, including API, IPAA,
SGA, AGA and the various Mid-Continent O/G assns. as a lobbyist and from a
public affairs standpoint, know a weak assn. does one no good in the long
run. It's imperative that the stronger members drive the process.

Unfortunately, arriving at consensus is far from easy, and many trade
groups would rather let the individual companies get out front because the
assn. can't reach consensus among its wishy-washy members.

We've had to do that somewhat in Calif. and have been working very hard
with selected media on our own to educate them since the issue arose in the
summer. Believe we are making headway, but can't let up now.
