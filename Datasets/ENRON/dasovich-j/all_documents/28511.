With the 15-day negotiation session nearly moribund, generators and power=

The judge held out the possibility that at least two parties, including San=

"If the judge is saying that the refund is topped at a billion that's=20
outrageous," said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network. "If=20

Michael Kahn, head of the California delegation and consultant to the=20
California ISO, nonetheless came away thinking the state had fared pretty=

"We came here wanting $8.9 billion," Kahn said. "In all candor, we didn't=

Other recommendations Wagner said he would make to the commission were a=20

To Matt Muniz, the solar panels sprouting on the rooftop of the Santa Rita=

Jail in Dublin aren't just energy-makers; they're money in the bank.=20
When all 4,000 panels are completely installed this month, the 500-kilowatt=
=20
photovoltaic system -- the largest rooftop project ever constructed in the=
=20
United States -- will cut the jail's demand on the electric grid by up to 2=
0=20
percent, according to Muniz, Alameda County's energy program manager.=20
That sun power, combined with conservation projects already completed at th=
e=20
jail, will slash about $300,000 a year from the facility's energy bill. Mun=

is already scouting other county rooftops for solar potential.=20
"With the cost of electricity going up, you can start looking at it as a=20

said Jolena Voorhis, an energy analyst at the California State Association =

promises customers lower rates in exchange for agreeing to shut down=20
electrical services in times of shortage.=20
Then California's power crisis hit full-force this year. Since January,=20
Edison has called on the Central Valley county to cut electricity at its=20

At times that meant no lights to greet the public, no computers to process=

"We had one week in January when we were virtually shut down," said Chief=

Administrative Officer Larry Spikes. "We just decided we couldn't function=

that way."=20
So Kings County supervisors bought a $550,000 diesel-powered generator to=

match those already at the jail and juvenile center. They also decided to=

open and close administrative offices one hour earlier this summer so=20
buildings can power down before high demand hits the grid around 4 p.m.=20
The new hours, dimmed hallways and moments of darkness that occur when the=

these days, Spikes said.=20
So far, most counties have been able to absorb higher energy costs without=

Public agencies' power troubles have proved a boon to some businesses.=20
Revenues at PowerLight, the Berkeley company that installed the Santa Rita=

"The last six months have been particularly intense," said Janice Lin,=20

=20
the state's demand for $8.9 billion in refunds.=20
"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe=
 a=20
billion dollars," Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief administrative law judge for=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in previewing the=20
recommendations he will make to the commission.=20
But Wagner, who mediated the talks, also suggested that power sellers are=
=20
still owed sums for electricity "that probably are higher than any=20
overcharges" for which they may have to pay refunds.=20
That opened the possibility that California could see no cash refunds, only=
 a=20
reduction in the billions of dollars the power generators and marketers cla=

Wagner said he would recommend that FERC hold a "fast-track hearing" to try=

to untangle the complex financial claims and counterclaims arising from=20
California's power crisis.=20
Wagner also outlined a method that he said FERC should use for calculating=
=20
refunds.=20
While his proposed formula includes part of one method the state used, it=
=20
contains several elements for calculating electricity costs that were favor=

by power sellers, who maintain that California's numbers are wildly=20

r.=20
"I think (Wagner's method) reflects more accurately what actually happened"=
=20
in the state's dysfunctional power market.=20
But Michael Kahn, the state's lead negotiator, said Wagner "vindicated"=20
California's core arguments.=20
"The hundreds of people who came here on the other side had argued to the=
=20
mediator that there should not be any refunds, and that position was loudly=
=20
rejected," said Kahn, chairman of the organization that manages most of=20
California's power grid.=20
"We think the numbers, even using the judge's formula, are going to be in t=
he=20
multiple billions. Whatever amount of money .?.?. is awarded to us, we will=
=20
have viable claims in state court and other jurisdictions for the remainder=
.=20
So what we have here is a situation where California will get its $8.9=20
billion."=20
Power sellers acknowledged that the threat of litigation remains worrisome =
to=20
them. They sought an end to investigations of their conduct, and immunity=
=20
from legal action as part of their bargaining position.=20
During two weeks of negotiations ordered by FERC, the two sides came nowher=
e=20
near bridging their differences. Wagner said a number of power sellers had=

put forward offers that totaled $716.1 million.=20
"That's a long way from splitting the difference," he said. "In 15 days, yo=

Yesterday -- the deadline for completing the talks -- the ill will between=
=20
the two sides broke into the open as Wagner allowed reporters into the=20
previously closed hearings.=20
Each side essentially accused the other of bargaining in bad faith and=20
failing to put forward realistic proposals.=20
John H. Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy Wholesale Group,=
=20
said the state used "biased calculations" to arrive at its $8.9 billion=20
refund demand. He also said that Reliant offered to knock $50 million off t=

$300 million it claims it is still owed for power sold into the state.=20
Kahn shot back that Reliant made the offer confidentially to Wagner and nev=

Figures scrutinized
"This is the first time we've heard any of this information. And to give th=
e=20
impression that somehow there's been cooperation or forthcomingness, I thin=
k=20
is misleading," Kahn said.=20
The state's refund calculations were scrutinized repeatedly during the talk=
s.=20
The $8.9 billion figure emerged from a study by the California power grid=

operator of charges for electricity between May 2000 and May 2001, a period=

when wholesale power prices soared.=20
Kahn said the figure was essentially duplicated when the state went back an=

FERC last month had been in effect for the entire yearlong period.=20
FERC ordered the pricing method in a bid to tame wholesale prices in the=20

In a partial win for the state, Wagner said he would recommend that FERC us=
e=20
the order retroactively as a basis for calculating refunds, an approach=20
resisted by the power sellers.=20
But he said that FERC should only scrutinize charges going back to October=
=20
2000, and should make several key changes in how power-generating costs are=
=20
calculated.=20
For instance, he said, FERC should determine the actual amount of gas heat =

takes to generate a megawatt of electricity and use spot market prices in=
=20
Northern and Southern California to determine the cost of gas, rather than =
a=20
statewide average cost, computed monthly.=20
Fewer overcharges?
Those and other parts of the complex formula Wagner will recommend could=20
increase the benchmark cost of producing power and drive down the amount of=

overcharges.=20
Kahn said that applying FERC's pricing method only back to October would pu=
t=20
about $3 billion of the state's refund claim off-limits.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel for Duke Energy North=20
America, said, "We think (Wagner's) modifications are certainly a vast=20
improvement over FERC's June 19 order and also certainly over (the state's)=

In Sacramento, Gov. Gray Davis issued a statement characterizing the=20

FERC Judge Says State Owed No More Than $1 Billion
From Associated Press

July 9 2001

WASHINGTON -- California is owed no more than "a billion dollars" from powe=
r=20
wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said today at the end of 15 days of=
=20
settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.

Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief=20
administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers=20
probably are owed more than that.

The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probabl=
y=20
will receive no refunds from wholesalers.

Wagner said power generators had offered $761 million in refunds. The state=
=20
has asked for $8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommen=
d=20
refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.

It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary=20
recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.

Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a=20
protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement=
.

Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Davis's representative in the talks, has said the=
=20
state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute mov=
ed=20
from mediated talks to a courtroom.

The producers reiterated today that California's numbers are grossly=20
inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators-- Duke Energy, Dynegy,=20
Mirant, Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos.-- said in a statement that the=
y=20
have made a "very substantial global settlement offer."

John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company=
=20
would agree to no more than $50 million in refunds, as part of an overall=
=20
settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal=
=20
claims.

But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains=
=20
that no refunds are justified."

FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences betwe=
en=20
producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated=20
electricity market.

The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly driv=
e=20
up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame=
=20
jumps in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the=
=20
workings of the free market.

The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $27 billion last year=

July 10 2001

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou=
p=20
of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h=
as=20
aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show.

During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of=
=20
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t=
o=20
Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the=
=20
Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.

Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per=
=20
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas=
 &=20
Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe=
r,=20
the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20
charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292=
=20
an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20
singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,=
=20
Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid=
=20
for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe=
r=20
megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents.

The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased=
=20
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more=
=20
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie=
s.

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest=
=20
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.

"You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said.

"The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20
generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%=
=20
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi=
ng=20
us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20
ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."

The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o=
n=20
the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20
quarter.

The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th=
e=20
first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's=
=20
energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited=
=20
to a few generators.

Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year=
.=20
"All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin=
ce=20
his agency began buying power in mid-January.

The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 =
in=20
January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t=
o=20
$271, the reports show.

In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded=
=20
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o=
ne=20
of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, =
a=20
total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.

By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.

A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of=
=20
Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b=
e=20
reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,=
=20
the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.

A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,=
=20
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se=
e=20
the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach=
ed=20
Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing=
=20
the power needed by the state were extremely high.

More Power Bought Than Projected

Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,=
=20
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas=
=20
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.

Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.

Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble=
ms=20
in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat=
e=20
projections in June and early July.

The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June=

gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and=
=20
which stay secret.

"The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh=
at=20
is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said.

Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers

Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati=
on=20
elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections."

Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont=
h=20
under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh=
at=20
seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency.

But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity=
=20
grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20
explanation.

Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full=
=20
picture of the plant's operation during the three days.

But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,=
=20
said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat=
a,=20
Duke was guilty of the same tactics.

"Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20
picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions=
=20
until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said.

To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive=
=20
up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20
submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the=
=20
expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said.

Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20
California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20
off-limits to legislators not on the committee.

Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20
comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke=
=20
would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t=
he=20
committee plans to turn over.

"We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we ar=
e=20
leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't=
=20
know what we are ultimately going to do."

The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they=
=20
provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha=
ve=20
said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,=
=20
were cited.

Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20
trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal=
ly=20
charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is th=
e=20
final arbiter of such issues.

Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited=

for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines. In 1929, the most=

NEWS ANALYSIS
Concern Over Price of Long-Term Power Pacts Grows
Embedded costs may yield more rate hikes, critics say, and the $43-billion=
=20
total could complicate plans to rescue Edison.
DAN MORAIN
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 9 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra=
y=20
Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch=
=20
on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly=
=20
more daunting task of balancing the books.

It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state=
=20
coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets.

In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office=
=20
as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20
market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about=
=20
the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo=
st=20
ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20
California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature=
.=20
Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20
$13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow=
er=20
purchases.

Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions=
=20
needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity=
=20
rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20
lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated.

Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta=
te=20
should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the=
=20
prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after=
=20
California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water=
=20
Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million=
=20
residents.

"They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20
(D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20
companies when prices were at record highs.

Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals th=
ey=20
could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation=
s=20
took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50."

Contracts Open to Challenges

The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ=
e=20
law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o=
f=20
allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity =
by=20
$8.9 billion.

"We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' "=20
Bowen said.

For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.=
9=20
billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He=
=20
attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20
conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a=
=20
major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o=
n=20
the volatile daily, or spot, market.

"You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20
shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," Davis=
=20
said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to=
=20
June.

Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,=
=20
said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin=
e=20
in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20
electricity-generating plants.

Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to=
=20
douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the=20
water damage."

The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20
professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil=
e=20
spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20
reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price.

"The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's=
=20
to reduce risk," Borenstein said.

Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20
Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit=
=20
by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav=
is=20
unseal the contracts.

An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing=
=20
Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a=
nd=20
large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag=
=20
announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth=
er=20
expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to=
=20
any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to=
=20
20%.

"Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte =
of=20
Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for=20
those contracts to be renegotiated."

As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly=
=20
are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront=
=20
fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro=
m=20
morphing into a broader financial crisis.

A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20
Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could =
be=20
tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20
break July 20.

Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the=
=20
Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the=
=20
state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20
permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3=
.5=20
billion.

Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve=
d=20
in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20
kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue=
=20
generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter=
m=20
power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b=
e=20
the largest municipal deal ever.

Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue=
=20
remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20
separate rate hike to cover its costs.

As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk=
=20
away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism=
=20
persists and crosses political lines.

Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20
Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20
rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20
interviews, they sounded similar themes.

"If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t=
o=20
pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said.

Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20
contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals=
=20
can be renegotiated.

"They are problematic," he said.

In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the=
=20
next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a=
=20
month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources as it goes about procuring power.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the=
=20
$13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre=
et=20
investors can be assured that they will be repaid.

"The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale=
,"=20
he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency."

The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,=
=20
would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than=
=20
just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20
would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20
as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20
Resources.

Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b=
y=20
which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,=
=20
although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20
remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co=
st=20
to be $800 million, spread over this year and next.

"It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)=
=20
said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission=
=20
to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides=
=20
to do."

"That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said.

'Dictatorial Power' Warning

Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it=
=20
would provide the water agency with "dictatorial power."

"As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,"=
=20
Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity=
=20
rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what =
we=20
need,' and the PUC must approve it."

Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20
extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the=
=20
Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so=
=20
deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20
consumers.

In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January created=
=20
"the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdictio=
n=20
of the PUC.

"There is no public power agency in California that is reviewed by the PUC,=
"=20
said Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.

Washington -- An administrative law judge, delivering a powerful message to=

that it is owed $8.9 billion in electricity overcharges by generators and=

Judge Curtis L. Wagner, although a strong endorsement of the generators'=20
position, seemed to indicate that neither side wanted to settle the issue=

before it reached the five-member regulatory commission.=20
"There are refunds due (to California) that total hundreds of millions of=

dollars and maybe a billion dollars," Wagner said yesterday.=20
"At the same time, there are sums due to sellers from the California=20
Independent System Operator and the investor-owned utilities in the state o=
f=20
California that probably are higher than any overcharges that (the state) m=
ay=20
come up with."=20
Now, it will be up to the federal regulators to settle the case. But the=20
recommendations by Wagner, who mediated the talks, carry significant weight=
=20
with the commission and cast doubt on the state's chances of collecting the=
=20
full $8.9 billion it claims to be owed.=20
The judge said he will recommend that the commission order new hearings to=

would be overseen by an administrative law judge and would last 45 to 60=20
days, Wagner said.=20
CLOSING SESSION
Wagner made his comments in the closing session of the 15-day talks, which=

were ordered last month by the regulatory commission to try to defuse the=
=20
dispute between power wholesalers and California officials before it reache=

The judge's message was a sharp rebuke to the unyielding stand by Californi=
a=20
leaders -- especially Davis, who last week said he wouldn't take a dime les=

than $8.9 billion for California's consumers.=20
The governor issued a statement shortly after the close of talks insisting=
=20
that California had won its basic case that the state is owed refunds.=20
"I am pleased that Judge Wagner accepted our methodology for calculating=20
refunds and rejected the generators' position that no refunds are due," Dav=
is=20
said.=20
The governor's chief representative at the talks, Michael Kahn, called the=

=20
Kahn said the judge's order would improve the state's legal position if it=
=20

GENERATORS FAVORED
But much of the judge's order seemed to favor the generators.=20
For example, state officials have made the case they should be refunded $8.=

e=20
regulatory commission has said only that the period starting Oct. 2, 2000=
=20
could be considered.=20
The judge said yesterday that he would stick with the October date, meaning=
=20
that more than a third of the state's claim -- at least $3 billion -- would=
=20
not be refunded by the commission.=20
Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel of Duke Energy North=20
America, said that under Wagner's guidelines, the state may be eligible for=
=20
$1 billion to $1.5 billion.=20
"Certainly to the extent that it helped refute what California has been=20
saying, it's a victory," Bailey said of the judge's statement.=20
But Davis said the nation's big power sellers never came to the table with =
a=20

"Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billion=
s=20

=20
$716 MILLION OFFER=20
Wagner disclosed yesterday that the generators had made an offer to=20
California: $716 million in refunds.=20
The judge said the figure included about $510 million from the so-called Bi=
g=20
Five generators, as well as $125 million from BC Hydro's Powerex, $49.6=20

California municipal utilities and $25 million offered by other out-of-stat=
e=20
power sellers.=20
California officials say it was not a legitimate offer because it included =
no=20
cash. It was simply an agreement by the companies to wipe some of the state=

Throughout the talks, generators complained that the California team was=20

Although the Los Medanos plant is one of a generation of efficient new gas-=

Power suppliers, state fail to agree on refund total=20
Posted at 10:41 p.m. PDT Monday, July 9, 2001=20
BY JIM PUZZANGHERA=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- California officials and power suppliers failed to agree on=
=20
refunds for electricity overcharges as 15 days of contentious negotiations=
=20
ended Monday, leaving the matter in the hands of a federal judge who said t=
he=20
state is owed much less than the $8.9 billion it demands.=20
The judge overseeing the talks for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
put the refunds at between several hundred million dollars and a billion=20
dollars. His estimate is closer to the $716.1 million offer made by power=
=20
suppliers during negotiations. The offer was rejected by California=20
officials.=20
But it was unclear Monday which side in the bitter refund battle would=20
prevail, and California officials indicated the dispute is probably headed =
to=20
court. At stake is how much the state's electricity consumers will ultimate=
ly=20
have to pay for costs that skyrocketed as California's deregulation system=
=20
collapsed.=20
Curtis Wagner, the commission's chief administrative law judge, will=20
recommend a formula for the commission to use to calculate a refund dating=
=20
back to October. That formula -- a complex methodology that involves factor=
s=20
such as daily natural gas prices -- includes many of the provisions the=20
energy suppliers had advocated during the talks.=20
Michael Kahn, who headed the California negotiating team, said the state=20
would contest some aspects of the formula. But even without changes, Kahn=
=20
said he was confident the formula will result in more refunds than Wagner=
=20
estimated.=20
``We think the numbers even using the judge's formula are going to be in th=
e=20
multiple billions,'' said Kahn, chairman of the state Independent System=20
Operator, which runs the electricity grid. ``California will get its $8.9=
=20
billion dollars. If we don't get all of it from the commission .?.?. we'll=
=20
still get the remainder of the money'' through the courts.=20
Amount in dispute=20
Power industry representatives appeared pleased with the judge's plan.=20
``We haven't gone and run the full numbers but it's going to be nowhere nea=
r=20
the $8.9 billion,''' said Brent Bailey, vice president and general counsel=
=20
for Duke Energy North America. ``But let's face it, that's a pie-in-the-sky=
=20
number that nobody in there believed in their right mind was a legitimate=
=20
number.''=20
Wagner acknowledged he had not calculated any figures using his formula,=20
saying he arrived at his dollar estimate based on the offers made by the=20
suppliers.=20
The energy commission ordered the private settlement conference last month=
=20
when it enacted new price controls to try to rein in soaring electricity=20
prices in California and throughout the West. Commissioners hoped that unde=
r=20
pressure of a deadline and their looming intervention the state and the pow=
er=20
suppliers could resolve the refund issue and stave off future litigation.=
=20
But the suppliers and state officials never came close to a deal,=20
participants said.=20
``The numbers were too far apart. You saw $8.9 billion on one end and you s=
aw=20
$716 million on the other end, and that's a long way to splitting the=20
difference,'' Wagner said. ``I think a lot of the parties genuinely wanted =
to=20
settle. Others didn't.''=20
Wagner now has until Monday to make his recommendation to the five-member=
=20
commission, which will make the final ruling on refunds. To date, the=20
commission has ordered $125 million in refunds for periods since last Oct. =
2.=20
Wagner said Monday that he will ask that a special hearing be set up in the=
=20
next 60 days to get the detailed information from the state and power=20
suppliers needed to determine a refund total using his formula.=20
The state may not end up with any cash, as any refund total could be applie=
d=20
to the several billion dollars California and its utilities still owe many =
of=20
the power suppliers.=20
Reflecting the tone of the negotiations, California Gov. Gray Davis on Mond=
ay=20
blamed power suppliers for the failure of the talks and challenged the=20
commission to resolve the situation.=20
``Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked ratepayers out of billio=
ns=20
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team=
=20
in Washington, D.C.,'' Davis said. ``While in the past the FERC has shown=
=20
little, if any, interest in consumers, they now have the opportunity to=20
redeem themselves by returning the $8.9 billion California has demonstrated=
=20
it is owed.''=20
Davis may go to court=20
At the opening of a new power plant in Contra Costa County on Monday, Davis=
=20
told reporters that he's prepared to take the power generators to court if=
=20
FERC doesn't order the full refund. Davis also said the ISO's estimate of=
=20
$8.9 billion doesn't represent all the overcharges. He said other estimates=
=20
put the figure as high as $20 billion, although he did not elaborate about=
=20
how those figures were calculated.=20
John H. Stout, senior vice president for Reliant Energy Wholesale Group, sa=
id=20
the state used faulty methodology to arrive at the $8.9 billion figure.=20
California officials and several suppliers said they would continue to=20
negotiate separately, and an official with San Jose-based Calpine said his=
=20
company is close to a settlement with the state.=20
Power suppliers urged Wagner not to calculate refunds by applying the energ=
y=20
commissions' June price-limits plan retroactively. But that's what Wagner=
=20
said he will do. It was a victory for California officials, who had pushed=
=20
for it. Wagner, however, also made some changes to the price-limit plan tha=
t=20
power suppliers had wanted. He applied it only back to Oct. 2, 2000. State=
=20
officials wanted it to cover up to May 2000.=20
$3 billion difference=20
The state's $8.9 billion figure comes from May 2000 through May 2001.=20
Factoring refunds beginning with Oct. 2, 2000, eliminates about $3 billion =
in=20
overcharges the state says occurred in the earlier period.=20
Among the changes to the commission's formula that Wagner made was to revis=
e=20
the way the prevailing electricity price limit is calculated. Wagner wants=
=20
the price limit determined for each hour of each day. The commission's=20
formula sets a price limit during Stage One power emergencies that remains =
in=20
effect until the next emergency.=20
But in a sign of just how complex the issue is, Stanford University economi=
st=20
Frank Wolak said he believes the standards described by the judge will=20
produce a much higher figure than $1 billion.=20
``That's the methodology the state used,'' said Wolak, who advises the=20

s,=20
according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a=20
legal dispute over public access to the data.=20
In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=20

electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Departmen=
t=20
of Water and Power.=20
The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that hav=
e=20
arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of th=

state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in=20
California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are=
=20
from the Northwest.=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much=
=20
of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in=20
President Bush's home state.=20
The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has=20
resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge=
=20
more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term=20
electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the fir=
st=20
quarter details.=20
Short on explanation=20
The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Wate=
r=20
Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major=20
utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the=20
price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for=
=20
what prompted the decrease.=20
In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market wa=
s=20
$321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May=
.=20
One megawatt powers about 750 homes.=20
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's=
=20
assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the=
=20
out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant=20
shift of money out of California.''=20
But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration=
=20
contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by=
=20
the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration=
=20
panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for=
=20
many years.=20
Used for support=20
Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks=20
against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power=20
generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down,=
=20
partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many=20
plants.=20
``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,''=
=20
said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt=
=20
the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.''=20
The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy=20
market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any=
=20
given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely=
,=20
with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and=20
companies outside Texas.=20
On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was=20
charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was=20
charging nearly $500 and Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was chargin=
g=20
up to $575.=20
The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power,=
=20
including the spot market and contracted power.=20
The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major=
=20
utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing=20
enormous debts for electricity.=20

On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a=

The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1=20
billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300=

the commissioners' hands.=20
Power generators, Wagner said, had offered a combined $716 million in=20
refunds, an offer the state rejected. "I don't think it's 8.9 (billion=20
dollars)," he said afterwards, "because I haven't been shown that it was."=
=20
For California consumers, every dollar the state can extract in refunds is =
a=20
dollar less that ratepayers have to shell out for state-purchased power. An=
d=20
the more money the state gets back, the better the chances of warding off=
=20
future rate increases.=20
"California will get its $8.9 billion," insisted Michael Kahn, head of the=
=20
state's delegation and the California Independent System Operator. Kahn=20
brushed off Wagner's comments, finding victory in the judge's assertion tha=
t=20
the state is owed some refunds, a concept the generators have been unwillin=
g=20
to embrace up to now, he said.=20
Since the talks began, some generators have made refund offers -- last week=
=20
Duke Energy offered $20 million and on Monday, Reliant officials revealed=
=20
their refund offer was $50 million, provided all other actions against the=
=20
company were dropped.=20
But the net result of the 15- day closed-door sessions is that California i=
s=20
no closer to getting repaid for what it claims was price gouging by power=
=20
companies going back to May 2000 than it was the day the talks began.=20
And it means the state is in for possibly more hearings before the FERC. If=
=20
unsuccessful there, the whole issue could wind up in court for years.=20
"You can take a horse to water but cannot make him drink," Wagner said duri=
ng=20
an afternoon public session where he made his preliminary recommendation. H=
e=20
has seven days to put his ideas in writing. At several points during the=20
often-tense talks, Wagner expressed frustration to the negotiators and trie=
d=20
to get them to agree, even to the point of holding an unprecedented Sunday=
=20
session.=20
"The numbers were too far apart," Wagner said.=20
While Kahn insisted the state had made progress, on hearing of the judge's=
=20
comments, state Sen. John Burton, D-Francisco, called them "barely better=
=20
than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick." Burton agreed with Kahn that the=
=20
state has to do all it can to get more than that.=20
And Davis backed up his team.=20
"Our delegation made a clear and compelling factual argument that there wer=
e=20
overcharges made because the market was broken," Davis said. "Remarkably, t=
he=20
energy generators and suppliers refused to recognize their responsibility t=
o=20
the people of California and own up to their profiteering."=20
Power generators seemed satisfied with the judge's views, even though John=
=20
Stout, vice president of Reliant Energy, said his company's "fundamental=20
position has been and remains that no refunds are justified."=20
Brent Bailey, general counsel for Duke Energy, called the judge's=20
recommendation, "a fair one."=20
Republican lawmakers in Sacramento were quick to say it was Davis' failed=
=20
energy policies that brought California to this point. They also distanced=
=20
themselves from the state's refund request.=20
"I don't believe there really exists a true justification for that number,"=
=20
said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "I've never considered that=20
anything more than a wild number to throw out there."=20
The two sides are so far apart in their estimates of overcharges because th=
ey=20
are using different assumptions about how to compute the complex pricing=20
structure. And Wagner was more persuaded with the majority of the generator=
s'=20
methods.=20
To start with, the state is asking for $8.9 billion, but about $3 billion o=
f=20
those alleged overcharges happened between May and October 2000, a period=
=20
FERC is not looking at. FERC issued two refund orders in March, finding tha=
t=20
power companies had $124 million in overcharges during power alerts. But th=
e=20
state is challenging that finding, saying there were overcharges beyond tho=
se=20
limited times. And the state is also asking FERC to reconsider allowing=20
refunds for May to October 2000.=20
How energy panel affects California=20
Six months ago, few people had heard of FERC. Now the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, the agency charged with making sure that the nation'=
s=20
power markets are running smoothly and that wholesale prices are "just and=
=20
reasonable," rolls off the tongue.=20
The five commissioners who make up FERC - all of whom were members of their=
=20
home state's Public Utilities Commissions - ordered the settlement talks th=
at=20
concluded Monday. They had hoped all the parties involved in California's=
=20
electricity crisis could reach an agreement on proposed refunds, long-term=
=20
power contracts and other issues that have divided the parties for months.=
=20
FERC's chief judge, Curtis Wagner, was asked to mediate the talks.=20
WHAT WAS AT STAKE?=20
For the state: $8.9 billion that Gov. Gray Davis said was the amount power=
=20
companies overcharged California in the past year. Wagner's finding? There=
=20
should be refunds. But more like $1 billion.=20
For the generators: More than $5 billion that they say they are owed for=20
unpaid power bills. Wagner's finding? Generators are owed more money than t=
he=20
refunds they owe California. He did not specify by how much.=20
For California consumers: A stable electricity market. Until the refund iss=
ue=20
is settled and power prices are stabilized long term, what the future holds=
=20
for rate increase remains uncertain. Wagner's finding? No settlement.=20
Consumers still in limbo.=20
HOW DID WE GET HERE?=20
In spring 2000, wholesale power prices began to soar. The state began=20
appealing to FERC to cap wholesale prices. In the meantime the utilities we=
re=20
running out of money. Generators weren't paid for all the electricity they=
=20
sold. Rolling blackouts began.=20
Starting in January, the state began buying the power, replacing the=20
near-bankrupt utilities. Politicians from Sacramento to Washington increase=
d=20
the pressure on FERC to cap rates. More than $27 billion was spent to buy=
=20
power for California last year, compared with $7 billion the year before. T=
he=20
price tag could reach $50 billion this year.=20
On June 19, FERC imposed the kind of soft price caps experts say could=20
moderate wholesale rates. Wholesale prices have come down, but the caps hav=
e=20
caused confusion among generators, leading some to hold some power off the=
=20
market.=20
WHAT'S NEXT?=20
The FERC commissioners will receive Wagner's report within a week. In it, h=
e=20
will suggest they hold a fast-track formal hearing that would last no more=
=20
than 60 days.=20
If they agree, after that hearing the commission would rule on refunds and=
=20
other California market issues.=20
If either the state or the other parties to this dispute disagree, they can=

contest FERC's decision in court. Such legal proceedings could last many=20
years.

The utilities had amassed billions in debts and were no longer creditworthy=

The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million. The=20
second-highest daily total was May 23, when the state spent $101.8 million.=
=20
But since May, spot-market prices have dropped, due in part to moderate=20
weather, lower natural gas prices, increased conservation that lowered dema=
nd=20
and because of increased scrutiny by lawmakers and investigators into=20
possible price manipulation. Gov. Gray Davis has said long-term contracts=
=20
also drove the price down.=20
"It does look like some of the spot-market prices have gone down, but it=20
looks like it's primarily due to natural gas prices," said Jamie Fisfis,=20
spokesman for Assembly Republicans.=20
The slight reduction in spot-market prices "underscores questions about the=

Most of the long-term contracts run for 10 years, with one lasting for 20=

That's why I'm gnawed by this "d,j. vu" sensation. The similarities and=20

WASHINGTON, July 9 -- A federal mediator ended two weeks of negotiations=20
about California 's demands for electricity refunds today, with the state a=
nd=20
power suppliers seemingly no closer to a settlement than when the talks=20
began.=20
The failure of the negotiations shifts the burden of resolving the yearlong=
=20
dispute to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to which the mediator=
=20
may recommend a pricing formula that would mean refunds of about $1 billion=
.=20
California , which wants $8.9 billion, vowed today that it would seek that=
=20
much and more, through the courts if necessary.=20
Although electricity prices in the West have eased in recent weeks, the pow=
er=20
crisis that has afflicted California and other Western states seems unlikel=
y=20
to be resolved unless rival parties can agree on how much electricity shoul=
d=20
have cost during the last 13 months.=20
The power market has been mired in an accounting gridlock. The state claims=
=20
that generating companies began grossly overcharging for electricity -- wit=
h=20
prices soaring by a factor of 10 or 20 over year-before levels -- beginning=
=20
in late spring last year. Generators say they are prepared to pay some=20
refunds, but argue that California 's estimates of overcharges are radicall=
y=20
inflated.=20
The mediator in the settlement talks was Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an=20
administrative law judge for the federal agency, who said today that the=20
negotiations had failed to reach the comprehensive voluntary settlement he=
=20
had sought.=20
Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the agency's commissioners that they=
=20
convene a 60-day evidentiary hearing that would impose an administrative=20
solution. He also said he would suggest a method for determining fair price=
s=20
for electricity .=20
Under federal law, the energy commission has the obligation to ensure ''jus=
t=20
and reasonable'' electricity rates. Though the commission declared last yea=
r=20
that California 's electricity market had broken down, it only recently beg=
an=20
imposing price controls on the market and has yet to address accusations of=
=20
past overcharges systematically.=20
While the scope of any refunds remains uncertain, Mr. Wagner's remarks=20
appeared more favorable for generators than for Western states, which have=
=20
collectively pressed for as much as $15 billion in refunds.=20
Mr. Wagner said that to determine how much California should have paid for=
=20
power since last September, when the commission began monitoring California=
=20
energy prices, he would suggest that the agency retroactively apply a price=
=20
control formula it adopted in June. He also indicated that he supported a w=
ay=20
of calculating the costs of power generation that is closer to the method=
=20
favored by power companies than to the one put forward by California=20
officials. The judge suggested that the formula he is recommending could=20
require generators to pay back hundreds of millions or ''maybe a billion''=
=20
dollars.=20
California officials gave a positive cast to the judge's statements, callin=
g=20
them a step forward because he formally acknowledged that companies would=
=20
have to pay some refunds. They also noted that whatever the level of=20
federally mandated refunds, they would have the option of seeking more in=
=20
court.=20
''We are still going to get the $8.9 billion,'' said Michael Kahn, who=20
represented Gov. Gray Davis of California in the talks. ''If we don't get i=
t=20
all from the commission, we will get the remainder in the courts.''=20
Governor Davis himself said today that if the agency did not provide refund=
s=20
in the amount the state claims it is owed, it would sue generators for $18=
=20
billion to $20 billion. ''We are in a war with generators, mostly out of=20
state, that are trying to bleed us dry,'' Mr. Davis said, speaking at the=
=20
ceremonial opening of a power plant in Northern California .=20
Representatives of several generating companies said that during the=20
settlement talks, they collectively offered to refund California about $500=
=20
million. They estimated that the calculation method suggested by the judge=
=20
would result in refunds of no more than $1.5 billion -- far closer to their=
=20
offer than to California 's demand.=20
Still, several executives said they now hoped to reach individual settlemen=
ts=20
with the state that would end the threat of prolonged litigation and allow=
=20
them to collect several billion dollars they say they are owed by the state=
=20
and its leading, financially pressed utilities, which ran up huge debts to=
=20
suppliers in the last year.=20
''We remain very interested in reaching a global settlement with the state=

that will put this problem behind us once and for all,'' said Brent Bailey,=

California and Energy Companies Miss Deadline

WASHINGTON -- State officials and power-company executives failed to meet a=
=20
federal deadline for settling $8.9 billion of disputed California electrici=
ty=20
charges, as a federal mediator overseeing the talks suggested the state's=
=20
demand was excessive.=20
Cautioning that he hadn't done formal calculations, Curtis L. Wagner Jr., t=
he=20
chief administrative law judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,=
=20
put the level of potential refunds at "hundreds of millions of dollars, may=
be=20
a billion dollars." He also said any sums due the state could well be offse=

Mr. Wagner said he would recommend to the commission that any refunds be=20

=20
decision alone would shave $3 billion from the $8.9 billion claim.=20
Mr. Wagner, who is expected to issue formal findings in the next few days,=
=20
said he would recommend that the FERC hold an evidentiary hearing to assess=
=20
the correct method for figuring refunds.=20
The collapse of the talks doesn't preclude individual deals later between=
=20
energy companies and the state, which has accused them of overcharging for=
=20
power during the past two years. Yesterday, some industry lawyers indicated=
 a=20
willingness to keep bargaining, and Mr. Wagner said two "partial" settlemen=
ts=20
were in the works.=20
Yet, absent any such solution, the overcharge issue -- a flash point in the=
=20
California power crisis -- is apt to be resolved in protracted legal and=20
regulatory proceedings, which could drag on for months or even years.=20
The negotiations began June 25, with a deadline set for midnight last night=

But late yesterday, participants indicated they were billions of dollars=20
apart, with basic differences over everything from the disputed charges to=

doubts about whether the FERC, which ordered the talks, could enforce a dea=

"We haven't reached a settlement. We really haven't come close," said John=

Reliant had offered to pay California about $50 million to extricate itself=

Mr. Wagner said the industry offered a total of $716 million to settle the=

The refund issue is fast becoming a test of the agency's authority and=20

California Gov. Gray Davis has said he hopes two new FERC members will take=
 a=20
much more aggressive tack. The agency is expected to act quickly on the=20
judge's call for a hearing and other findings.=20
Yesterday, Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer representing Gov. Davis at=

they validated the state's claims to some refunds, a concept the industry h=

=20
state doesn't recoup via the FERC it will pursue in court.=20
But power generators, who derided the state's request for a huge refund as=
=20
"ludicrous" and "unsound," felt vindicated by yesterday's proceedings. "The=

state came away with far less than its expectations," said Robert Loeffler,=
