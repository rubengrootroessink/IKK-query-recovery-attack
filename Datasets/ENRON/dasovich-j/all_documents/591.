Brian,
It is my understanding that the ISO has the right to get flat rate, (no 
mileage charge) access into the ISO network from within the LATA of the A 
POPs.  If this access is at the right price it means that any customer 
wanting to get a circuit between say, Redding CA and Orange County, CA would 
have VERY cheap access and competitive Long Haul.  That being said, at this 
point I do not think the A POP information is crucial to our initial meeting.

We need to ascertain the following:
1) Can the ISO nail up discreet circuits on this network?  It is currently a 
meshed ATM backbone with traffic being routed dynamically.  
2) What conditions need to be met by the ISO to scale the network to OC48?  
If they cannot scale it we have only about an OC3 of available bandwidth and 
that is not worth our time.
3) What are the DS3 and OC3/12 access rated from MCI?  This will uncover our 
true opportunity in this deal.

Forgot to mention---please recall that all of the information we're being 
provided is covered under an NDA that we and the ISO have signed.

Best,
Jeff
