Enron, through the coalition ARM, supported SDG&E's proposal to implement the 
voluntary, large customer opt-in.  SDG&E had some fairly tough credit and 
repayment requirements.  The Draft Decision, NOT FINAL, issued by Cmmr. Wood 
adopts the proposal with 2 modifications, that I don't believe are 
problematic for us.  Any concerns, please let Jeff or Marcie know.

Subject: Draft Decision on SDG&E Voluntary Rate Stabilization Program for 
Large Customers

Commission Wood issued a Draft Decision on the rate stabilization program
for SDG&E's large customers required by AB 265.  If you remember, SDG&E
filed its proposal to implement the program  in mid-September.  ARM filed
reply comments supporting the proposal advanced by SDG&E.  The Draft
Decision adopts SDG&E's proposal with a few minor changes.  Having reviewed
the draft decision, in my opinion, the few changes  made do not impact ARM's
interests and thus do not merit commenting.  

The changes made by the Draft Decision include: 

1. The Draft Decision provides for a 12 month amortization period of the
undercollected amount for agricultural customers whose demand is less than
100 kW.  (This would just be a limited exception to SDG&E's overall proposal
that customers under the program would have to pay the entire settlement
amount the month following either removal from the program or being on the
program for 12 consecutive months.

2.  The Draft Decision provides for alternate means of showing
creditworthiness to be eligible for the program.   


The commission wants to vote on this Draft Decision at the December 7th
meeting.  Accordingly comments are due November 27.

If you have any questions, call me.  Unfortunately I do not have the Draft
Decision electronically, but it is short and readily faxable.
