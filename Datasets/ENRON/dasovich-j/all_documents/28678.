Yep I got it -- though I hear that the Senate and Assembly are supposed to
be in Session throughout the weekend so we may be able to grab him before
then but if not we know we have something set. Many thanks to you and Hedy
for setting the meeting.

See you tomorrow,
laney

You got it.  I'll be there.  You get my voicemail on your cell phone?  re:
meeting with Brulte's on Monday, not tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff
