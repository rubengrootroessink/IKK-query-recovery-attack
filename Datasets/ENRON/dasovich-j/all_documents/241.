HEADLINE: "Wine of the Week"
AUTHOR: Paul Lukacs
SUMMARY:
Recommended:
* 1997 Robert Mondavi Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon North Coast-This full-bodied 
wine is an excellent value.  It outperforms many $20 cabernets by offering a 
delicious combination of brawn and finesse.  Rich black-fruit flavors combine 
with firm but not oppressive tannins to produce a wine that feels silky but 
tastes rich and powerful.  Drink this cabernet with full-flavored meat 
dishes-steaks and chops, roast beef or rack of lamb. ($12)

* 1994 Opus One-(94)
* 1995 Opus One-(95)
* 1996 Opus One-(93) Has very fine cassis, clove, currant, smoke and cedar 
aromas.  Softer then the '95, with great harmony and finesse.  Not for the 
long term, but drinks beautifully now.
* 1997 Opus One-(95) Bottled last spring, it will be released in the fall of 
2000.  Shows lots of toasty oak, with grapey, earthy notes.  Despite its 
youth it's already supple and harmonious.  Really wonderful mouthfeel, with 
sweet tannins.  Great fruit, opulent, very rich, very great quality.
1998 Opus One-(95) Still in barrel.  Almost black in color.  Smells very 
young and jammy.  Has gobs of youthful berry fruit.  Just a scamp now, but 
already rich, complex and opulent.  Should be very fine some day
