Hello!

The newly elected Marketing Club officers are looking for someone to
represent the Evening MBA interests in the Marketing Club.  This person
would act as a liaison between the day students in the Marketing Club and
the Evening MBAs.  The time commitment would be as little or as much as you
would like.  If you are interested, please reply to me at
eagleson@haas.berkeley.edu.

We look forward to your involvement!

Ali Eagleson
