DELETE IF NOT IN E207B-2 (GERLACH)

I'm very sorry, but there was a miscommunication between our office and
Professor Gerlach about whether class meets during the regularly scheduled
spring break.

Professor Gerlach's class WILL meet this week on Thursday, March 29!  He
recognizes that you may not be able to complete all the assigned reading by
that time.

We're sorry for the confusion.

Cheers,

Diane
