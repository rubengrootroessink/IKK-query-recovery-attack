The information was released yesterday.  The total revenue requirement is 
down reflecting lower power costs. Presumably, current rates (including the 
$40/MWh increase since 1/1/01) are now sufficient to cover power costs and 
some amount for past undercollections. 

Not sure what it assumes regarding agreement-in-principal contracts (i.e., 
whether they are in or out).
