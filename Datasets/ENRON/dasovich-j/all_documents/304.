Hi!

I would like to introduce you to a new service that you would find useful:
http://www.jobreviews.com

JobReviews.Com offers interview, salary, and job position reviews so that
any current or aspiring job hunter can get the inside scoop on actual
interview scenarios, salary offers, and prospective jobs.

I think this service is especially appropriate during this time of year
since the recruiting season is in full swing!

Check it out, and if possible, please forward this e-mail to your friends.

Thank you!

Julie Bard
Marketing Associate, JobReviews.com

our users, they have shared their personal job, interview, and salary

they
sign the hiring contract, it's too late to back out!
