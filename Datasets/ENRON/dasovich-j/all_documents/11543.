We probably need some view from Richard Sanders as well.  I agree with Dave 
that this is a little bit of I told you so ... but, I'm not sure (as long as 
legal o.k.'s) that there's much risk of being ignored (anymore than we are 
currently being ignored) and it may actually restore some credibility on the 
issue of price gouging.

Can we get any traction in supporting this?  The premise is obviously 
preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string 
of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their 
timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to 
thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the 
reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we 
would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get 
some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be 
like the irritating kid who keeps saying "I told you so", so it does not 
matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the 
prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices 
could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be 
there, partially revealed.)

My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal, 
and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a 
market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to 
restaurants near the CPUC......

I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to 
you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.

PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices 
into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case 
by case basis to advance our cause.  Just think about it...  what if SDGE had 
accepted our (and others) May/June proposals for 5.5 cents.....?)

		 Subject: LT Contracts:  A History of Inaction by the CPUC


Attached is a history of inaction by the CPUC in regards to long-term 
contracts. We are graphically portraying this as a timeline, incorporating 
the quotes.

We would like to also incorporate any public long-term contract offers IEP 
members made that utilities were not able to enter into because of the CPUC. 
?This will once again help reinforce that IEP members are part of the 
solution. ?

Please forward this information, or any other comments, to me or Katie by 8am 
PST, Thursday April 26.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Jean
