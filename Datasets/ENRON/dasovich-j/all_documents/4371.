Wine Team Gift Picks

We count on our crack Wine Team for expert advice all year long, so 
it's only natural that, during the holidays, we also tap their 
expertise for wine-related gifts. Following are some of their 
suggestions of highly useful accessories available from wine.com, 
symbiotically paired with wines that underscore their value 
(and vice versa). 

Burke Owens:
As a sommelier, I've worked with a wide variety of corkscrews, from a 
Swiss Army knife to the oh-so-refined French Laguiole. My favorite 
for general home and party use is the Screwpull LX Leverpull. And 
since this indomitable tool is affectionately known as the T2 in 
honor of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator, what better wine to open 
with it than another magnificent Austrian, the lush, floral, vibrant 
1999 Nigl Gruner Veltliner Siri Senftenberg. 

Peter Marks:
You can never have too many Champagne flutes, especially during the 
holidays, when flinging them into the fireplace becomes second 
nature. The practical and affordable Riedel Cuvee/Prestige flutes
First, though, make sure you drain them of the A.R. Lenoble Blanc de 
Blancs Grand Cru, Champagne you poured. 

Jeff Prather:
For people eager to learn about wine, Andrea Immer has just come out 
with an excellent primer: Great Wine Made Simple. Andrea is my kinda 
gal -- she just wants to have fun with wine, but her credentials are 
impeccable. She covers all the basics in a readable, easily 
understandable, down-to-earth style, and -- since the only real way 
to learn about wines is to taste a wide range of them -- she suggests 
illustrative wines at the end of each chapter. As it happens, 
wine.com has created special wine packs from Andrea's 
recommendations, the first of which is entitled The Big Six Wine 
Grapes. This way you can give the whole thoughtful package in one 
fell swoop, and your recipient will find out exactly how appetizing 
education can be. 

Diana Jacklich:
Another great way to learn about wine is our Wines of the World Club, 
which delivers a new set of wines for tasting every month. Then, 
after you've hooked up your newbie connoisseur with the fabulous gift 
of wine, they'll need a way to open it -- and fast! The Rabbit 
Corkscrew will have them making a toast to you in the blink of 
an eye. 

Bo Thompson:
What to do if you find yourself shopping for the special wine 
collector who has every new wine under the sun? How about the kind of 
pedigree that only age can provide? In the 1970s, Spring Mountain 
Vineyards, under the directorship of Charlie Ortman, made truly 
distinctive Cabernet Sauvignons that speak strongly of "Old Napa 
Valley." Venerable wines like these need special care, for which I 
recommend Riedel decanters: Handmade by crystal artisans in Germany, 
these beautiful vessels are the very best in the world, with both 
Single-Bottle and magnum sizes available. 

Julian Davies:
As is so often the case with state-of-the-art stuff, our High-tech 
Stopper and Stand represent a near-perfect union of function and 
form, creating something you don't really need but really ought to 
own. It's meant to be used in an opened but unfinished bottle of 
wine; I would personally employ it with the 1998 Lolonis Fume Blanc. 
Lolonis uses ladybugs instead of pesticides, so what better way to 
keep those darn bugs out of the bottle? 

Finally, when in doubt, check out the Wine Team's 12 Days of 
Christmas holiday case -- an all-purpose, international selection of 
stellar wines.

Heidrun Mead Adds Traditional Sparkle to the Holidays

If you're looking for something stimulating and different for the 
holidays, consider a bottle of sparkling mead from the Heidrun 
Meadery. Using honey rather than grapes, meadmaking is an ancient 
craft that this Northern California company has elevated to an art. 
Fermented from different blends of nectars -- apple, blackberry, 
clover, fennel, sunflower, morning glory, alfalfa -- Heidrun 
sparklers are refreshingly clean and delicate, suggestive of honey 
yet undeniably dry; each varietal offers a range of floral, herbal, 
and fruity notes, along with a woodsy, earthy undercurrent. Served 
chilled in flutes, like fine Champagne, it's a wonderful aperitif or 
accompaniment to a meal (and an especially attractive one to 
sensitive wine drinkers, as no sulfites are used in the process). Try 
a bottle during the holidays and discover a delightfully new old 
perspective on wine.
