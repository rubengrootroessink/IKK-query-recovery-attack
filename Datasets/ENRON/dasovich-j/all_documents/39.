>Re:  PG&E Hydro Auction Application
>
>Attached for your information is the filing PG&E recently made to the CPUC
>regarding an auction of their hydro facilities/assets.  IEP is currently
>reviewing the application.  Essentially, the filing calls for a
>price/auction, would auction groups of assets, and would be open to all
>bidders.
>
>Generally, the application moves toward the goals and objectives set by IEP
>in terms of hydro asset divestituture.  Additional work will likely be
>required to address environmental and local government concerns that were
>raised in the legislative process this summer.  But, overall, this is a
>very positive and fruitful step.  IEP will be moving forward in terms of
>creating a IEP Special Fund Task Force related to the proposed auction of
>PG&E's hydro assets.  Expect something early next week on this.
