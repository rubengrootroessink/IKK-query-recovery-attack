Dear Haas Community,

Sunday Dec 10th, 2000 between 8:00 AM and noon the main Haas  web server
will be shut down for planned  maintenance and upgrades.  Services will
include the Haas main page and other pages served from the unix server
"Haas".

During this period we will be upgrading the Perl software, the Apache Web
Server software, and the Major Cool software.  If the upgrades go smoothly,
the actual down time is will be much less than 4 hours.

Email services should not be affected.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the maintenance, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
