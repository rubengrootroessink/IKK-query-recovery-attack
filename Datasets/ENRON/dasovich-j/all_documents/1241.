I've reviewed the drafts, and I think it is good work.  The report of the MSC 
of the ISO has come out with some of its fixes to the market structure issues 
very closely parallels alot of our points.  I am at the hearing in San Diego 
today where that will be the topic discussed.  Will call at the lunch break.  
I really like highlighting how much development of retail markets will 
alieviate some of the problems, especially since that is something that is 
within the Commission's authority to fix.

Question on market power:
Do we want to highlight the myriad of other causes of higher than short-run 
marginal costs?  ie.  low hydro, NOX credits

Mona:

I saw the email about the delay. We have attached some draft material for
some of the questions anyway. I will call you in a bit to go through it.
