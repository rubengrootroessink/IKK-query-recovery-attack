> Hi Stephen:
>
> I'm on the organizing committee of a conference that is being put on by
> the Goldman School of Public Policy on electricity deregulation.  Unlike
> the annual UCEI conference, this will not be papers presented by
> researchers, but rather very short introductions (e.g., 5 min), followed
> by round-table discussions and then questions from the audience.  It will
> probably take place on monday November 13, though it could get moved to
> thursday Nov 17.
>
> I've been asked to invite you to participate in this conference, and I'd
> really like to encourage you to do so.  Also invited will be FERC
> Commissioner Hoecker, CalPUC President Loretta Lynch, and
> U.S. Representatives Markey and Largent.  They are also trying to get the
> CEOs of Enron, Duke Power, and a couple other producers.  Carl Shapiro
> will be on one of the panels, as will I.
>
> I realize that this is a long way to travel for a one-day conference.  I'm
> hoping that you have other invites in the U.S. you could piece together
> with it.  Also, I'd like to invite you to give a seminar here at UCEI
> while you are in town.  There is a lot going on in CA in electricity and a
> lot of research on the subject.  Besides all those you know of here,
> Catherine Wolfram has moved this year from Harvard to Berkeley, so is also
> now here permanently.
>
> If this doesn't work out, I hope we can make it happen another time.  In
> addition, it is looking likely that UCEI will receive funding from the
> state to open a Center for the Study of Electricity Markets, which would
> allow us to invite a number of visitors at the same time to do research
> here at Berkeley.  If that comes through, perhaps we could arrange a
> longer visit in Berkeley?
>
> I look forward to hearing from you.
