Ron -

If you have any conclusions on this, please get to Jeff Dasovich.  He is 
calling Mike Peevey to try and get CDWR to take over the contracts fully 
(including our LCs).

Mary, I like your points about the state being without jurisdiction over the 
BFM contracts (without commenting on whether such arguments would be better 
made at FERC or Dist. Ct. or both venues).  We would need to research those 
arguments to see if they hold up.   Ron

I think it may also be significant that the governor exercised his
authority over contracts, as opposed to real property.  Who ever heard of
the state "condemning a contract?"

Although I don't yet have all the facts, Steve Hall said that late
yesterday (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over
the IOU forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning
to pay PX participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the
following two possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates
the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions
requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.
Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to
exercise eminent domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to
support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.
