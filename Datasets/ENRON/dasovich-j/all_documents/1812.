We  are  preparing  an  advocacy piece on US electric  reliability  and
are  seeking  some   data    that  would   give  us   the dollars  that  high 
tech  as an industry
 spends  on  electricity  each  year..This  would  be  a  sizeable portion of 
the
$220  billion   a year  US   electricity  revenue  stream.  Do you have  such 
a  dollar  figure
or  a  BKWH  figure  from which   I could impute  a  value  for this?  I do 
know  that  computers  and
computer peripherals  consume   13  percent of  the US power  so I am  
missing  the
manufacturing   spending  piece.  

The   Edison Electric  Institute  says  1 percent of manufacturing  revenues  
is the electriocity  cost  but I think this  is way too  low.   Should b e  
perhaps   5 or 6 percent?  Thank  you for any help you can  provide. We
 will be happy to  share  our finished  document 
with you.  Margaret  Carson  Director  Competitor Analysis.
