Marcie,
Thanks for attending the meeting and for the feedback.  I will probably give 
you a ring tomorrow because I'mnot sure I understand the matrix andthe 
distinction on the two # of Account columns.  

This information in your e-mail is very valuable.  You may also want to 
participate in a call with the San Diego folks tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. p.s.t. 
and give them the scoop yourself.  Let me know if you can do that.  I will 
forward the call info to you.

Mona

Subject: SDG&E CCF Program

Mona, initially the discussion surrounded the radio ad.  SDG&E suggested 
tagging the message with "commercial customers check your mail" but there 
were strong objections because the current draft uses the words "free" and 
"price".  APSES stressed that if they aren't going to tag the message they 
need to be explicit in stating who the audience is i.e. residential and small 
commercial.  The small customer group is currently revising the language and 
I suggested that it was premature to make a decision on content and on the 
existence of cross benefits until we see a final draft.  

SDG&E was able to determine an approximate number of only non-DA accounts 
segmented into three categories.  The data was pulled using unique name and 
unique address.  The data follows:

 Category   Customers  # of Accounts  # of Accounts

A) ONLY over 100 Kw   2,180   0   2,655
B) over 100 Kw AND under 100 Kw 810   2,815   2,083
C) ONLY under 100 Kw   8,315   10,545   0

Totals     11,305   13,360   4,738

The group decided that it would be best to send two letters - one to classes 
A&B and one to class C.  SDG&E would state "our records show you are a 
________ customer", please refer to the matrix to determine which ESP's serve 
your customer class.  They did state that they have issues with credibility 
by identifying a small customer who may in fact be large when combined with 
existing DA accounts.  

The matrix will include the following categories:  Logo/Name, 
Address/Phone/Website/Contact, Customer Class Served (indicated by some sort 
of code like a color coded check mark), Products and Services, Customer 
References, and Company Description.  The BRC will be attached to the matrix 
and potentially will include the following three selections:  Send my 
information to ESP's that serve my customer class, Send my information to all 
ESPs, or Send my information to Only the following ESP's.  There was some 
discussion on the last selection surrounding whether or not to include all of 
the ESP's or require the customer to list them.  Most were neutral, although 
New Energy wanted them listed and APSES thought Select might object.  We 
discussed the snipe on the envelope as well and the group came up with 
"Important Energy Savings Opportunities Enclosed".  I voiced some objection 
about using the word "savings" as I wasn't certain what our liabilities are 
with respect to misleading the customer or potentially false representation.  
We also discussed how to ensure that the mailer gets to the correct person as 
opposed to the bookkeeper.  We agreed that sending it to the attention of the 
CFO/Energy Manager might be our best bet.

In any event, considering the number of direct mailers has dropped from 
20,000 to 11,500, the direct mail budget is approximately $24,100 including a 
20% BRC response estimate.  In addition, the six-week radio campaign 
beginning one week after the CPUC decision, continuing through a 4-week 
billing cycle, with one follow-up week came to $19,500 for the large customer 
group's 15% portion.  Total per ESP assuming 6 participate is $7,267.  SDG&E 
indicated that they can return any overage but are restricted from asking for 
more.

As far as other channels, SDG&E plans to include a CCF link on their webpage 
where the customer can access the brochure.  APSES indicated that the BRC 
would need to be better developed for the website to ensure the customer has 
a place to include their account number and other pertinent information that 
is being preprinted on the BRC in the direct mailer.  SDG&E also plans to 
include ESP links on their website provide the brochure to the press in 
conjunction with their press release and involve their account executives.  
The AE's will be provided with extra brochures and SDG&E is checking with 
their legal department on affiliate rules to determine if the AE's can 
provide customer contact information to the CCF Coordinators so that they 
might get the information directly to the customer.

The best case scenario time line is having a final resolution by the end of 
November with the standard 30 day comment period.  This may place it on the 
CPUC agenda the first part of January with a 30-45 day implementation 
period.  They had hoped to start the radio ad approximately 10 days after the 
PUC decision.  They would like our logo in an "eps file format" at our 
earliest convenience so that they can determine how much additional space 
will be available for the matrix. The rest of the timeline is still on track 
according to the e-mails you had forwarded.

Okay, well that's all I have for now (feel like you were there?).  Let me 
know if you have any questions and/or comments.  I also requested that they 
include me in any future correspondence because I would be backing you up 
when necessary.
