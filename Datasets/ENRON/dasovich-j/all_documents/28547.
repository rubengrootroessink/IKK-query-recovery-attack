Here is my first take on?a few?key messages.?  I'll forward a few more alon=
g=20
shortly.

It is beyond reason that the committee is focusing so heavily on a company =
=20
that represented only a low single-digit percentage of spot market purchase=
s=20
and  whose average price was 25%-40% lower than the cost of the state=01,s=
=20
average  purchase.
?
The committee appears to be basing its pursuits on politics and geography =
=20
rather than the realities of the marketplace. Enron transactions represent=
=20
less  than one=01)half of one percent of alleged overcharges, and Enron sal=
es to=20
the  state between January 18 and May 31 represented just one-tenth of the=
=20
dollar  value of power purchases made from Los Angeles-area public utilitie=
s =20
alone.
?
If the committee is truly dedicated to finding the causes of increases in =
=20
power prices, it should look closely at what happened within the state=01,s=
 =20
borders. California-based public utilities, for example, sold power to the=
=20
state  at average prices as high as $100/MWh above Enron=01,s average. It a=
lso=20
should  examine why the Administration and PUC did not allow utilities to=
=20
enter into  long-term contracts last year that would have saved Californian=
s=20
billions of  dollars and increased supply.
?
For the better part of five (?) years, Enron has repeatedly urged  Californ=
ia=20
lawmakers and regulators to address the flaws in electric  restructuring th=
at=20
led to the current energy crisis. We have, and will continue  to, offer our=
=20
resources and experience to help California secure its long-term  energy=20
future.
