Participated in a conference call yesterday on SDG&E's market facilitation 
proposal.  They would like to have a direct mail piece for commercial and 
industrial customers.  The attached summary indicates some proposed timelines 
and messages.  The cost of this (somewhere around $100,000) would be shared 
by participating ESPs.   The following companies participated in the call:  
NewEnergy, AMDAX, Dynegy, Strategic Energy, Tenderland.

Based on our discussion the other day, I made the following recommendations, 
which were incorporated into the summary:

1.  Further segmentation of the C&I group (currently at 20 kW and above, 
proposed 100 kW and above)
2.  That SDG&E indicate support for customers choosing alternate provider.
3.  Clearly indicate that this offer is for business customers only.

We will have multiple opportunities for comments on layout and message 
content.  We must decide by October 16 whether we are in or out, and at that 
point submit our "offer" or description of service (fixed price through...).  
They would like a graphics quality logo by end of the week if possible.

I will, of course, circulate copy when available.

Please let me know concerns about this e-mail or participation in this 
program asap.  Thanks.

Mona
