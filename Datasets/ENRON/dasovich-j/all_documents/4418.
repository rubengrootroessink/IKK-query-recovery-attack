the federal Supreme Court refused to uphold (or reject) the decision of the=

Florida Supreme Court to extend the deadline for hand recounts, and sent th=
e=20
case back for the court to explain its reasons. The next day, a Florida=20
circuit court upheld the state=01,s results, giving George W. Bush a winnin=

margin of 537 votes. Mr Gore appealed against the ruling. Mr Gore was=20
