   Members of the NAP of the Americas LLC Consortium elected a
six-member Management Committee to support and oversee the operation
and future growth of the NAP (Network Access Point). The committee
will represent the interests of the 85 NAP consortium members and will
create task forces to continue carrier recruiting, provide
technological oversight and support hi-tech educational initiatives.
   "The newly elected Management Committee of the NAP of the Americas
LLC Consortium is representative of the different telecommunications
sectors supporting the NAP of the Americas project," said Benjamin
Finzi, Chairman and CEO of NAP of the Americas LLC Consortium and
Executive Vice President/COO of Orlando-based EPIK Communications
Incorporated (EPIK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Florida East Coast
Industries, Inc. (NYSE:FLA,FLA.b). "These individuals are industry
leaders who recognized the importance and impact of a Tier-1 NAP in
South Florida and the growth opportunities it brings to Latin America
and other regions. They all provided valuable input to the NAP
initiative during the past several months."
   Internationally respected telecommunications companies are
represented on the Management Committee. Companies include Global
Crossing, which controls fiber optic cable throughout North America
and Latin America; EPIK Communications, the largest telecommunications
company headquartered in Florida; FPL FiberNet, a subsidiary of the
FPL Group; NetRail, an international telecommunications "backbone"

board will represent the NAP of the Americas LLC Consortium members
with visionary leadership as this project makes history as the first
privately developed tier one Internet data exchange."
