DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System 
Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.'s (DUK) 
off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif., Wednesday 
morning, a Duke spokesman said.

The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state 
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the 
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.

About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO.

The ISO manages grid reliability.

As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert 
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would 
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid 
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling 
blackouts.

The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), 
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).

Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives 
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.
