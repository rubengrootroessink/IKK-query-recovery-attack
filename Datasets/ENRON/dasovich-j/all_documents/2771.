Dear Enron Public Relation associate.

My name is Vi Truong and I am from Boston Pacific Company.  I am
interested in Enron's white paper "Fixing What is Broken: what steps are
needed to complete california's power markets."  Can you advise me where
I can find this paper?  Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Vi Truong
