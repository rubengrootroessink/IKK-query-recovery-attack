Dear Evening MBA Students,

This is the second announcement regarding our plans for the EMBA Seminar in
International Business. Much of this message is a repeat of the initial
one. But some points have been added.

NEW MATERIAL

1. As of today (December 7) we have received 30 deposits from interested
students. Should you be interested in participating and have not yet
applied, please do so as soon as possible, but in any case before the
December 15 deadline.

2. Regarding the possibility of visiting Cuba, some of you have asked about
the legality of this. Please note that I have a license from the US Dept.
of the Treasury that permits me to send students enrolled in a legitimate
course, for credit, to Cuba under certain conditions.

3. The current political situation in Indonesia is uncertain. However, my
sources there indicate that it should be OK for us to visit there if we
decide to do so. But, if the situation worsens we would alter the itinerary.

4. Some applications have been submitted without a preference for
destination. YOU MUST indicate your priority. You can rank all three
destinations if you wish, but you must indicate, at a minimum, your
priority for program A or B. Should you not be selected for your first
choice you will be transferred to the appropriate priority pool of your
second choice.

REPEAT

For those of you unfamiliar with this course, please see
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/HaasGlobal/NGcourseoutline.htm for the
2000 version that looked at Ghana, Belgium and the Netherlands or
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/HaasGlobal/JVcourseoutline.htm for the
1999 version that included Japan and Vietnam.

For 2001 we are going to try something slightly different. We will have two
distinct programs - one will be a repeat of last year's and the other will
venture into new territory. The details are as follows. Please note that
everything mentioned below is still tentative and subject to change or
cancellation.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

Both programs will commence with a series of classes, at Haas, in June.

Program A, led by Diane Dimeff will retrace the itinerary of the 2000
program to Ghana, the Netherlands and Belgium. The approximate dates for
the travel portion will be Saturday, July 7 through Saturday, July 21.

Program B, led by Sebastian Teunissen will consist of one of two possible
itineraries, depending on student demand:

itinerary 1: Cuba, Panama and Venezuela (or Costa Rica.)
itinerary 2: Australia and Indonesia.

Travel for program B will also start on approximately July 7 and end on
approximately July 21.

Costs for the programs are expected to be approximately equal to those
charged in previous years ($4,600), with the exception of the
Australia/Indonesia option. If this program is selected the final cost is
likely to be roughly $1,000 higher due to increased air fares. Final costs
will be determined once itineraries are set.

As you can see, planning is still in the early stages. But, before we go
much farther we need to know who is interested in participating. So, we
need to receive expressions of interest, in the form of a refundable $100
deposit from interested students.

APPLICATION PRIORITIES

Students will have different priorities depending on seniority. Priorities
are as follows:

Top Priority - both programs - students in fourth semester or higher in
January 2001 who HAVE NOT participated in the program in a previous year.

Second Priority - Program B only - students in fourth semester or higher
who did participate in the program in a previous year. These students are
not eligible for program A.

Lowest Priority - both programs - students in second or third semester.

Each group is limited to a maximum of 15 students.

APPLICATION PROCEDURE

Please submit, to the Evening MBA office, a check in the sum of $100
payable to UC Regents together with the following information, no later
than December 15, 2000.
- Name
- Semester level as of January 2001
- Whether or not you have previously participated in the program
- Choice of program: A or B (If you choose program B please also indicate
your preferred destination: Latin America or Australia/Indonesia.)
- e-mail address

Once we have a clear indication of preferences the final details will be
planned and announced. The announcement will likely be made in January. At
that time you will be advised of the program for which you are eligible.
You will then be asked to increase your deposit by $900 and the entire
$1,000 deposit becomes non-refundable.

OTHER ISSUES

Please check your passport to ensure that it expires no earlier than
December 31, 2001. If it does please renew it now. Passports with shorter
expirations may be rejected for visas, depending on the countries to which
you will travel.

Also, please check the visa requirements for the countries of interest for
your particular nationality. This may have a bearing on the program that
you select.
