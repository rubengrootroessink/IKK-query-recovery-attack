Attached is a draft of Enron's protest of PG&E Advice Filing 2010-E which
replaces Schedule PX with Schedule E-Gen.  The protest follows the same
lines as our protest of SCE's advice filing  last week. The only real
difference is that PG&E would apparently give a credit which reflects all of
a bundled customers generation costs -- i.e., retained generation (including
QF and purchase power contracts), ISO charges and DWR costs. Therefore we
did not have to include a section advocating that as the back up to our
market based credit.

The protest is due tomorrow (May 1).  Please provide all comments as soon as
possible.
