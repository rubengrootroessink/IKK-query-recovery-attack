I am available for a conference call 9/18 at 5PM eastern.
What concerns me about the competition is that their publicity is already
out, even though their date is 3 weeks after ours. We have to get ours out,
and that commits us to a hefty expenditure. While we have lots of
encouragement, we have practically no firm commitments of financial
sponsorship or speaker acceptances. We need both ASAP.
I have heard of no turndowns either of financial sponsors or of speakers,
but we need to secure the commitments. I think Loretta Lynch has confirmed,
as has Phil Harris. I am expecting a confirm from Stephen Littlechild
through Severin. I am awaiting a preliminary response about John Bryson. I
have not heard anything about any of the other speakers we agreed to seek,
so if any of you have information about these please pass it along.
Assuming we get a good "core" of our top picks for speakers, I am hoping
that we can get firm financial commitments from our loyal backers to give us
the "core" financial support that makes doing all of this possible.

Looking for more good news,
Lee

Subject: Final date and time, we have competition


All,
A few of you might have been testifying at the FERC hearings in San Diego, I
know Jeff was, so you know that most people wanted FERC to "do something."
The
silver lining in that proposal is that our conference becomes more
important.

Lee has decided on 12:30  to 6 pm on Monday November 13 so you can tell any
speakers you are inviting.  I think that's the best choice because it more
interesting to more people, and if they can do presidential debates in 2
hours
we should be able to address these issues in 6 hours.

Note that we have competition with another conference, see below.  We should
be
able to get better, higher profile speakers.  We need to get a list soon so
we
can send out advertisements.  Please send updates to Lee and me.  Expect
another
message asking for reactions to a proposed next set of speakers to invite.
If
you want to be on a voluntary conference call addressing the next speakers,
followed by an even more optional discussion on logistics with Heather, tell
me
if Monday 9/18 at 5pm EDT/2 pm Pacific works for you.

Lee, if you want to send this to the other potential sponsors you're talking
to,
feel free.

Thanks!
Rob
