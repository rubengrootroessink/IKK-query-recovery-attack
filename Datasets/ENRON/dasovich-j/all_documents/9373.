Greetings Sally:
My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres
of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the
hill from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I
contact you.

The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces
south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring
through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on
it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues,
and I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some
challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility
that I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.

I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking
