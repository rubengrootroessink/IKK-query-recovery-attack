Dear classmates,

Just a reminder to please provide me 2-4 items from the initiatives raised 
during the Career Center forums by this Friday, 2/23 to bring John Morel and 
the CSOs in synch with our interests and priorities.  A big thanks to the 
handful of individuals who have already done so.

Albert

Hello everyone,

John Morel and I received wonderful feedback from those of you who either 
attended one of the roundtable sessions or responded to me directly. Here's a 
synopsis:

Overall comments

1) Continued improved branding of the Haas EvMBA through the efforts of the 
Career Center personnel as well as the Haas administration

2) John has implemented a database, tracking the recruitment and career 
search outcomes of evening MBA students. Of course, the database is only as 
useful as the information you provide him on your job search results. So do 
communicate to him relevant stats if you have recently switched jobs during 
the program.

3) A few student-run organizations organize and distribute to companies their 
own resume books. Hence, if you're interested in including your resume in one 
or more of these books, do contact the appropriate person in these 
organizations for additional info.  Here's a url to assist:

http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~mbaa/officialclubs.html

4) Enhanced search capabilities (e.g., by geography and industry) for 
online-listed alumni jobs as well as including a Haas alumnus (vs. HR) contact

Finally, I would like for us to prioritize for John and the CSOs those good 
ideas we discussed. Therefore, from the list below, please respond with 2-4 
to which you would like more efforts directed, by next Friday, 2/23. Keep in 
mind that this list is not exclusive, so feel free to include your own.

- Job performance workshops
- Internships
- On-campus and company site networking events (with alumni if appropriate)
- Career planning/transition workshops (e.g., job interviewing, resume 
preparation)
- EvMBA-specific on-campus recruitment (recognize there are limitations to 
such an event)
- EvMBAA-sponsored resume book
- Student-to-student job fairs
- Survey list of companies (with contacts) interested in recruiting EvMBAers

As soon as I tabulate the results, I will present the findings to John and 
distribute them to you.

Thanks in advance for your feedback,

Albert
