Subject: New Procedure for Projects/RCR's

Please see the note from Elizabeth below.  

RCR's are now on-line and should be submitted via this on-line format.  
Please refrain from using the old form.  

Thank you,

gngr


Please see the attached Word document for directions on a new on-line 
procedure for RCR's.  All RCR requests must now be submitted on-line through 
the Project Tracking system.  To access the system, click on the first link 
below, and a new icon will be added to your Lotus Notes desktop (it has a 
picture of a globe).  (Don't click on the other two links, they'll be added 
automatically.)    If you have any problems accessing the system, please call 
me.  If you have any questions on entering the information, please call me or 
Ginger.  Thanks!!
