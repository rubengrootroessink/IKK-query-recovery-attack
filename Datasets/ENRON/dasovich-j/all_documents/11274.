Jeffrey,

As a VentureWire subscriber, I wanted to give you the

venture capital and investment communities with the
CEOs of the private organizations that are leading
development of the Wireless Industry. Be sure to be
in San Francisco on June 5th & 6th in order to assess
the companies shaping the next big trends in the
Wireless Industry! To register online or learn more

Here is What to Expect at Mobile Outlook:

Jeffrey, despite the slowdown in the market, there
are still significant investment opportunities in the
wireless industry. At Mobile Outlook, we will examine
the possibilities and pitfalls of mobile connectivity,
and cover the market and technology opportunities for
innovators and investors alike. You will be able to see
firsthand the latest technologies from up-and-coming
startups as well as establish contacts with the leading
entrepreneurs and investors who will make the mobile
Internet a reality:

* Get the true story from our panel discussions featuring
top-notch industry players, such as Bob Pinna, president
of Mobilize; Daren Tsui, chief executive officer of SkyGo;
and Rama Aysola, president & CEO of AirFlash

* Pick and choose from up to 80 management presen-
tations, featuring promising, private companies, such as
AirMedia, ePhysician, Informio, Morphics Technology,
Neomar, Qpass, and Tresidder Networks.

* Watch firsthand as Richard A. Shaffer and his panel
of experts select the "Investors' Choice" awards
designating companies most likely to succeed, at
the end of the Mobile Outlook Conference.

* And, at the end of the day, you can check out the
latest gadgets and gizmos during our product
demonstrations and reception.
