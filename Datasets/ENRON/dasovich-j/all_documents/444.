Dirk--

We're planning a conf call to go over the letter tomorrow at 10:30am CA 
time.  I will be in Phoenix but I can dial in.  Rob Cone is setting up the 
meeting.  After we get everyone's input we can send the letter out this 
week.  I'll be in San Antonio from Weds through Fri but available by phone 
and email.

AW

Andy, I made a few changes. We'll still need dates and comments from Rob. 
Your changes and edits are tremendous. Is it almost ready to go out?  Dirk
