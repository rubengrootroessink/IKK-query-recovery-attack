Attached are some articles concerning further development and elaboration on

issues/problems.

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the 
Assembly Utilities & Commerce Committee
By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how "dysfunctional" the 
market is and why it should be restructured.
