o notHarvard, Renamed Powered, Drops Lawsuit Against Harvard

AUSTIN, Texas -- notHarvard.com, an online education
firm, said it changed its name to Powered following
a trademark infringement suit Harvard University
filed against the company earlier this summer. notHarvard,
which prior to Harvard's action sought protection
for its name from a Texas court, said it retracted
its lawsuit against the university. Harvard University
couldn't be reached for comment. notHarvard said
the change had nothing to do with Harvard's lawsuit
and it was already well into the process of changing
its name when the Ivy League school filed its suit.
The company said that the name notHarvard was simply
"an internal code name that just stuck."  The company
previously argued that the "not" in its name clearly
distinguished it from Harvard University. The company
said  it will officially take the new name in about
60 days. notHarvard, which enables companies to
offer free online courses to their clients, is backed
by Austin Ventures, Barnes & Noble.com, CenterPoint
Venture Partners, Impact Venture Partners, Merrill
Lynch Kecalp, Sanchez Capital Partners, and TL Ventures.
