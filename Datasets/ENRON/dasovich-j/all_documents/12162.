Attached is a letter Marathon drafted to send to the top 100+ CA businesses 
in our database giving them info on our "comprehensive solution."  Rather 
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified 
version, plus an overview page that answers "What does this do for: 
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?"  

Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to 
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them 
to be signatories on a formal proposal?

Please let me know what you think. 

Thanks.

Hi Karen:

It was good to see you Friday.  I hope you had a nice visit in So. Cal.

I've attached a draft letter to existing list of CEO's from Ken Lay for your
review.  The attached draft letter assumes that the background material from
Jeff will be enclosed and that the sample letter to Gov. Davis, et. al. asks
for support of specific legislation, policies.

If we've got this wrong, let us know and we will try again.

Sandra
