Here's the scoop.
Name of Restaurant: Rooster
Address: 1101 Valencia Street, cross street is 22nd.
Meeting Time: 6:45pm. Everybody needs to be present in order to be seated by
7:00pm. Please ensure that you make it on time.
Parking Garage: 21st between Valencia and Mission. They charge $1 per hour.
It is really hard to get parking after 6:30pm.
We have to buy wine from the restaurant. Rooster just has wine and beer
available.
If you haven't RSVP'd and would like to come please let us know so we can 
update the reservation. Final numbers are due tomorrow.
See you Saturday!
