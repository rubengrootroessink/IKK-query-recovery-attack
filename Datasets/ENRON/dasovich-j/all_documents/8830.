Hi Team,

I was in class all day yesterday, and could not bear to be indoors on?yet  
another awesome day!! Purnima and I spend all day hiking. So - I have 
not read the Home Depot case yet - and am only just starting on it :-(? 
Good thing we don't have a case to prepare for Tiffany's class Wed!

Let's get an email dialog going once we get Mark's spreadsheets? 
I'd also be up for?a meeting/conf call late Mon/Tue eve to do the writeup.

Hi Carolyn. I'm running the numbers and the rest of you, team, are responsible
for the strategy and interpretation of the numbers for case 2. Case 1 was 
fine.
I have a few questions for our beloved professor and when she responds I'll
e-mail out my spreadsheet models.
