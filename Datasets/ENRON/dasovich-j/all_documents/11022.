Hi Evening MBA students,

For those of you who will be registering next week for Fall 2001, we have a
few updates.

1)  We just added E278 Deals on WEDNESDAYS, 6:00-9:30 p.m.
This 3-unit course is expected to be very popular as it is triple-listed
with the Evening MBA Program, Day MBA Program and Boalt Hall School of
Law.  Howard Shelanski from the School of Law is the instructor.  CCN:  #09562

This course will examine why firms engage in certain kinds of transactions
and the reasons why governance mechanisms (e.g. integration, joint venture
formation, long-term contracting, spot-market exchange) vary across
transactions. Why do firms accomplish some transactions through vertical
mergers but accomplish others through contracts? What are the attributes of
transactions and governance structures that give rise to matches between
them? What considerations give rise to whether a deal should be done and
then, if so, how it should be structured? In answering questions like those
above, this course will examine the roles that transaction costs, economic
strategy, and contract law play in influencing the nature and structure of
business transactions ranging from mergers and acquisitions to supply
contracts, patent licensing, and R&D joint ventures.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH: Professor Shelanski is a full time member of the law
faculty at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law. He received both his law
degree and his Ph.D. in economics from UC Berkeley. After graduating from
law school he served as a law clerk at  federal district and circuit courts
and for Justice Antonin Scalia at the U.S. Supreme Court. Before joining
the Boalt faculty, he was an associate with the Washington, D.C. firm of
Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd & Evans. Professor Shelanski's research
focuses on industrial organization, telecommunications regulation, and
antitrust. During the 1999-2000 academic year, Professor Shelanski was on
leave to serve as Chief Economist of the Federal Communications
Commission.  During the 1998-1999 academic year he served as a Senior
Economist to the President's Council of Economic Advisers.

2)  E259-1 Leadership & Change CANCELLED
Due to unforeseen circumstances, Leadership & Change has been cancelled for
Fall 2001.  The course may be offered again in Spring 2002 -- we'll let you
know.

3)  BA215 Economics of the Nonprofit and Public Sector
OPEN TO EVENING MBA STUDENTS
Day Course (TuTh 11:00-12:30 p.m.)
Instructor:  Frances Van Loo
This course explains, from an economic point of view, why all countries in
the world have not just for-profit businesses, but also governmental and
nonprofit organizations. It examines the tasks performed by governments and
how nonprofits supplement, and sometimes replace, government in
accomplishing these objectives. Because government and nonprofit
organizations differ from business in not having a profit motive, ways of
making them efficient are discussed. Examples include vouchers, contracting
out, and cost-benefit analysis. Also explored are recent developments where
alliances are formed between government and business (e.g. sports
stadiums), between the nonprofits and business (e.g.environmental
preservation), and nonprofits
and government (e.g. arts and social services).  Finally funding of
governments and nonprofit organization is addressed.  Examples are drawn
from a variety of fields including the arts, community economic
development, education, environment, health, international development,
religion, social services, and governmental programs in addition to those
listed above.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH: M. Frances Van Loo is an Associate Professor of
Business and Public Policy in the Haas School of Business. She established
the Program in Nonprofit and Public Management at the Haas School, 1989.
Currently, she is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Nonprofit
Management and Leadership. Honored with a campus-wide
Distinguished Teaching Award in 1985, she has also twice received the Earl
F. Cheit Distinguished Teaching Award in the School. Known nationally for
her work on nonprofit management education, she also does work in the field
of philanthropy, including teaching a course for undergraduates on the
philanthropic traditions of African-, Asian-, European-, Hispanic-, and

Economic Association (AEA), the Association for Public Policy Analysis and
