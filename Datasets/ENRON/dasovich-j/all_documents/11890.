JANET YELLEN NAMED TO THE ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES
 Janet Yellen, the Eugene E. & Catherine T. Trefethen Professor of Business 
Administration, was named a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences on April 26, 2001.? Members of this year's class included 211 
distinguished scholars, scientists, artists, business executives, educators, 
and public officials. They were honored for their achievements in fields 
ranging from mathematics to medicine, from computer science to literary 
criticism, and from public affairs to the performing arts.

"Janet Yellen is well-deserving of this honor," says Ben Hermalin, associate 
dean of academic affairs. "She is one of the leading economists of her 
generation. Her work covers so many areas within economics that it is 
difficult to characterize, except to note that it is all uniformly excellent 
and always exhibits great clarity of thought. Her works are always about 
matters of interest, usually of importance to policy debates, and they 
provide tremendous insights into these matters." 

Yellen's work includes major contributions in international economics, 
macroeconomics, microeconomics, labor economics, and the economics of social 
policy. Her writing has often focused on federal economic policy issues. She 
has served as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and as a member of 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Her writings on bundling and 
advertising (micro) and "near-rational" theory of business cycles are much 
cited, as are her papers on neighborhoods, crime, and teen pregnancy.

She graduated summa cum laude from Brown University with a degree in 
economics in 1967 and received her Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 
1971.

"You cannot help but learn from -- and be persuaded by -- reading a Yellen 
article," says Hermalin. "Although presumably not a factor in her receiving 
this honor, it is a pleasure to observe, nonetheless, that Professor Yellen 
is also an excellent teacher and a valued citizen of the Haas School and 
campus."

The academy has numbered among its members each generation's finest minds and 
most influential leaders, from George Washington and Ben Franklin in the 
eighteenth century to Daniel Webster and Ralph Waldo Emerson in the 
nineteenth and Albert Einstein and Winston Churchill in the twentieth. The 
current membership of 3,600 Fellows and 600 Foreign Honorary Members features 
more than 150 Nobel laureates and 50 Pulitzer Prize winners.

The new class is composed of 185 Fellows, along with 26 Foreign Honorary 
Members from 14 nations. New Fellows are nominated and elected by current 
members of the academy. More information is available at 
http://www.amacad.org/news/new2001.htm.

SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY TAKES FIRST PLACE IN UC BERKELEY B-PLAN COMPETITION
 RAPT Technologies, which has developed a dramatically faster and more 
cost-effective technology for etching and polishing optical and semiconductor 
materials, has won the third annual UC Berkeley Business Plan Competition. 
The Haas MBA organizers of the competition announced the three winning teams, 
which share more than $90,000 in cash and prizes, at Wednesday's final awards 
ceremony.

"The quality of the plans was extremely high," said Michael Powell, managing 
director of Sofinnova Ventures and a final round judge. "The teams all had 
their acts together. I would have taken any one of these teams to my 
partners."

RAPT's technology is able to etch or polish materials without making contact. 
It is 10 to 10,000 times faster than existing technologies and operates at 
atmospheric pressure. The idea came from Jeff Carr of the Manufacturing and 
Materials Division at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. He was joined by Haas 
evening MBA student Peter Fiske and Mona Alves, founder, president, and CEO 
of CHAT Communication Services.

In addition to the $50,000 first prize, RAPT received the $5,000 People's 
Choice Award, based on votes from the audience -- and independent from the 
judges -- at the awards ceremony.

The second prize of $25,000 went to biotechnology venture Aprotea Biochips. 
Aprotea aims to enhance drug discovery with its rapid and easy-to-use protein 
measurement system. Aprotea developed a patent-pending biochip for parallel 
analysis of 100 to 10,000 protein samples and is designed to be 
bio-compatible with virtually all proteins and capture agent libraries.

Haas evening MBA student Thomas McVey joined the Aprotea team, which also 
includes students from Boalt Hall School of Law and UCSF. Aprotea had 
previously won second prize for best management team in the Haas Social 
Venture Competition on April 14.

TruVideo, a wireless video infrastructure company, received the third prize 
of $10,000. TruVideo offers digital image quality over broadband that is 
superior to existing technologies. The company intends to take advantage of 
the convergence of wireless technology and the Internet to become the 
standard video platform for the emerging web-enabled wireless device market.

The TruVideo team consists of three Haas MBA students, Joseph DelCallar, 
Steven Stokols, and Raj Manghani, as well as engineering undergraduate Greg 
Chew and professor of electrical engineering Avideh Zakhor.

All six of the finalist teams have had at least one team member enrolled in 
"Opportunity Recognition," a course on how to commercialize new technologies 
taught by Andrew Isaacs, executive director of the Management of Technology 
program.

More than 65 venture capitalists, angel investors, and successful 
entrepreneurs served as judges and evaluated the business plan submissions. 
Another 26 entrepreneurs, professors, and professionals served as mentors to 
the teams that qualified for the first round and helped them develop their 
plans.

The keynote speaker at the awards ceremony was Nick Sturiale, MBA 2000, who 
was the founding CEO of Timbre Technologies. Timbre Technologies, a 
semiconductor software company that won the 1999 business plan competition, 
and was sold in February to Japanese company Tokyo Electron Limited for $138 
million. 

To date, teams from the 1999 and 2000 competitions have raised well over $90 
million in venture financing, including 1999 teams: +???????Alloptic- $19.7M 
www.alloptic.com);  +???????AudioBasket- $29M www.audiobasket.com);  +???????
GetRelevant- $4.855M www.getrelevant.com);  +???????Hotpaper- $2M, Acquired 
for $10M by GoAmerica www.hotpaper.com);  +???????Timbre Technologies- $2.8M 
(no website); and  +???????ZipRealty- $27.7M www.ziprealty.com). 

and 2000 teams: +???????DeltaClick (formerly known as iJacker)- $1.5M 
www.deltaclick.com);  +???????Onwafer (formerly known as AMS)- $350K 
www.onwafer.com);  +???????Opient- $400K www.opient.com); and  +???????
Skyflow- $3.5M www.skyflow.com), winner of the 2000 competition.

HAAS LEADS WESTERN BUSINESS SCHOOLS IN QUIRKY WALL STREET JOURNAL RANKING
 The Wall Street Journal ranked the Haas School as the best MBA program in 
the West in the newest and latest ranking of business schools in a special 
section of the newspaper on Monday, April 30.

Although the Haas School ranked only 21st out of 50 in the survey, the 
school's showing outscored all other business schools from the West Coast 
through the Rocky Mountain states - including Thunderbird (25); UC Irvine 
(29); UC Davis (34); UCLA/Anderson (36); Brigham Young (41); and, 
surprisingly, Stanford (45).? 

This is the first time in any major media ranking of business schools that 
Haas/Berkeley has done better than Stanford's Graduate School of Business.

The Journal's ranking of business schools -- its first ever -- is based on 
the opinions of 1,600 MBA recruiters.? The schools themselves supplied the 
names of its recruiters to the newspaper.? Each recruiter was asked to rate 
as many as three schools and was instructed to rate only schools with which 
he or she had recruiting experience in the previous two years.? Under the 
rules, recruiters who were also alumni of the school at which they recruited 
were permitted to rate their own alma mater.

The Journal's methodology produced results that are sure to be much discussed 
and questioned.? Traditional powerhouse business schools such as Wharton 
(18), Columbia (34), Duke (44) and Stanford (45) were significantly outranked 
by lesser-known business schools such as Purdue (6), Southern Methodist 
University (9), Wake Forest (11), and Michigan State (12).

In general, schools from the Western States did less well than others in the 
Journal's ranking, which has also been true of Business Week's survey that is 
based in part on a smaller survey of recruiters.

The top school in the Journal's ranking was Dartmouth's Tuck School, followed 
by Carnegie Mellon, Yale, Michigan, and Northwestern/Kellogg.

The editor of the special Journal section, Ron Alsop, told a group of 
business school deans in New York last week "there are a lot of surprises in 
the Journal's rankings."? Alsop spoke at an annual conference of business 
schools.

The Journal also listed the Haas School as being among the top 4 schools in 
the world that excels in the teaching of e-commence subjects, and the 7th 
best school internationally for its students' entrepreneurial skills.? These 
rankings were also based on recruiter input.

"The results of the Wall Street Journal's survey are clearly controversial, 
underscoring the need to think deeply about each ranking and what it purports 
to measure," said Richard Kurovsky, executive director of marketing and 
communications at the Haas School.? "With the continuing proliferation of new 
rankings, schools that do well in one ranking now find themselves doing less 
well in the next, forcing everyone to sort out what it all means.? This may 
ultimately be a very good thing for the consumers of rankings."

In other rankings over the past eight months, Haas has placed? #7 in US News, 
#13 in the Financial Times' ranking of international business schools, and 
#18 in Business Week's survey.

BERKELEY TEAM WINS ADVERTISING CASE COMPETITION
 The team of Berkeley undergraduates sponsored by the Haas School 
Undergraduate Program Office took first place at the American Advertising 
Federation's National Student Advertising District Case Competition on April 
20.

The team of Berkeley undergraduates went head to head with teams from seven 
other schools across the west at the Academy of Art College in San Francisco. 
They were asked to create a global marketing campaign for DaimlerChrysler. 
First place went to UC Berkeley, second place was California State 
University, Fresno, and third place was the University of Nevada, Reno. 

The Cal team will compete the national competition in Cleveland, Ohio, in 
June. This is the first time a Cal team has been to the national competition 
in three years.? The district competition trophy will be displayed in the 
Undergraduate Program office. For more information and pictures, please visit
