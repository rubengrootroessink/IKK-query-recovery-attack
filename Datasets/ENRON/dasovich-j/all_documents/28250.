Hello fellow HAAS classmates and friends,

It's time for Happy Hour of the Month again!!  This time it's going to take
place in Mountain View.  For all you South Bay people, it's only less than
15 min drive from the heart of Silicon Valley.  There isn't any excuse for
you not to show up and hang with your classmates.  For the SF crowd, it's a
quick 45 minute trip down Hwy 280, or better yet, ride the CalTrain down to
Castro station.  All of our activities for the night are within 2 blks from
CalTrain station.  For the East Bay group, be patient, the next one is in
your neighborhood.

Here is the lineup for July 6th:

5:30pm - 8:00pm Pockets Billiards/Bar 251 Castro St.
8:00pm - 10:00pm Dinner Break (See below for restaurant
recommendations)
10:00pm - ?? Molly McGee's  241 Castro St.

Dinner options:
Since downtown MV used to be my neighborhood, I have tried out most of the
restaurants in the area.  All these restaurants are highly recommended and
within 1 blk vicinity from Pockets.  If you want something else, talk to me!
There are more choices.
Italian:   Don Giovanni http://www.dongiovanni.com/
Chinese: Hunan Gourmet  http://www.waiter.com/hunan/
Japanese: Tomi Sushi  650-968-3227

Since a number of faces are new, check with Pockets' front desk and ask for
the "HAAS Group".  Otherwise, call me on my cell phone at 650-996-2947 if
can't find us.

See you all on Friday!
Tony Tai and Cindy Best
