Here is EPSA's "Fact Sheet" on California.  We're discussing it at the EPSA 
power marketers' weekly conference call tomorrow.  We're also considering 
having EPSA submit this Fact Sheet to the CPUC  in response to the data 
requests sent by the CPUC (responses are due on Friday).  If you have any 
comments or suggested changes, please let me know (as soon as possible) in 
case EPSA submits this paper to the CPUC.

Thanks

Sarah

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketing Working Group

FROM: Donald Santa, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Joe Hartsoe, Power Marketing Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: August 30, 2000

RE: California "Fact Sheet"

At our meetings last week with FERC, we had a great deal of valuable factual 
information and policy suggestions, but they were not pulled together as a 
cohesive story.  Based on materials provided by various companies, we have 
drafted the attached fact sheet entitled "California: The Real Story."  It is 
an effort to pull together the most compelling pieces of information and 
policy arguments as a "leave-behind" for FERC staff and other regulators and 
to form the basis for any testimony at the upcoming congressional hearings.

The paper includes factual information pulled from a number of sources and 
Jackie Gallagher, EPSA's Research Assistant, is attempting to verify and cite 
as many facts as possible.  To make the message convincing, we need "chapter 
and verse" on our facts.  Please review the material carefully to be sure it 
is accurate and compelling.  Any assistance in verifying these facts, or 
providing others that do a better job of telling our story, will be 
appreciated.  You can e-mail to Jackie at jgallagher@epsa.org.

We will discuss the paper during our conference call next Wednesday, 
September 6 at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and 
ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions or suggestions 
before Wednesday, please contact Julie Simon at 202-789-7200.
