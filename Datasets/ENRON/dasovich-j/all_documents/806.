Please delete if not interested in carpooling to class from downtown San
Francisco.

Hi everyone,

Last year a few of us first years (now second) ran a pretty successful
carpool from downtown San Francisco over to Haas. It makes sense for quite a
few reasons, and is a pretty good way to get to know each other. This year I
thought we should target everyone who might be interested. I've created an
egroup called haascarpool. If you're interested please go to

www.egroups.com/group/haascarpool

and join up. The calendar will be how we can arrange carpools. I've listed
that I'll be driving this t/th, how many people I can take, when I'll leave,
and what time I'll be in class. People can post if they can drive or need a
ride. You can e-mail people individually when you check the calendar. This
way we centralize everything and avoid tons of e-mails. Suggestions are
welcome.

Cheers,
Michael
