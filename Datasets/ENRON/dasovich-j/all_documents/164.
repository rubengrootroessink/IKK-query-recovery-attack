Jeffrey Dasovich,

Your registration for the Traffic School To Go program has been recorded.  We 
hope that everything is clear and that you will have no problem successfully 
completing the program but if you need help, please reply to this Email with 
your questions or phone toll free - (888) 349-8425.

Remember, this is EXACTLY how you will need to re-enter your information  
when logging back in to the program:

license state = California
license number= N7889351

To log into the course, visit the following URL:
http://www.trafficschooltogo.com/students/

If you find you have made an error in entering your license information, use 
the incorrect information to log in.  Once logged in, you will have the 
option of correcting the error by hitting the "Personal Information" button 
on your "Student Control Panel" at the bottom of any page.  Thereafter, the 
corrected license information will log you in.

Oh, and just to confirm, we have the following mailing
address information for you:

366 Dolores St., #3
San Francisco, CA 94110

If this is incorrect, use your "Personal Information" button to fix it. In 
fact, please be sure to double-check (and change if necessary) all of your 
"Personal Information" sometime before you finish so that we can reach you if 
there's a problem or so that your certificate does not go astray due to a 
typo in your mailing address. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Peggy Goldman
