Dear Haas Community,

Tuesday , Oct 31st, 2000 and Thursday, Nov 2nd, between 7:00 and 8:00 AM
portions of the Haas network will be shut down for brief periods for
upgrading.  Communications and Network Services network technicians will be
cutting over our network connections to new router interfaces.    This is
one of the early steps required for the coming upgrade of the Haas network
switched 100 Megabit/second service.

The network service interruptions should be short (less than 5 minutes and
most likely less than a minute) and are scheduled as follows:

Tuesday, 7:00 to 8:00 AM:  Library, Computer Center, CED, and classrooms
(subnets 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 71)
Thursday, 7:00 to 8:00 AM:  Servers, administrative offices, student
lounges, faculty offices (subnets 67, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75)

During the brief outages email will be held for later delivery.

There is a possibility that after the cutover, your workstation may have
difficulty locating network resources.  If so, simply shutting down your
computer and restarting it should correct the problem.

As always,  should you experience any problems with computing services
following the upgrades, please contact the information desk in the
Computer Center, or helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone
510/642-0434.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
