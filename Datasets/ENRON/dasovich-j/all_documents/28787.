Jeff,

Diann Huddleson has spoken with PG&E on numerous occasions, and they have 
confirmed that effective as of January 19, 2001, they began using a Weighted 
Average cost of Generation/Purchase for the calculation of the PX amount.  I 
will coordinate between Tamara and the Services group which has this 
information and make sure everyone is on the same page.  I also support 
Tamara's desire to reconcile, at a tariff level, the curves to actual utility 
bills. 

Thanks,
Wanda

Hi Wanda/Michael.  You aware of this?  I don't recall having received 
anything from PG&E.

Best,
Jeff

PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to 
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June 
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our 
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying 
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group 
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is 
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon 
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want 
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.
