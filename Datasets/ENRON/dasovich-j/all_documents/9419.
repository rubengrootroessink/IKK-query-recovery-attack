Attached is a list of deals my commodity team has booked so far this year.  
There is one deal missing that was $707,000 in origination.  Our total for 
the years is approx. $2.2 million in origination.

Thank you for all of your hard work.....it's truly paying off!

I've attached an excel file for your review of the latest booked deal (see 
dated tabs).  This file captures only the deals booked by commodity 
structuring.
Let me know if you have any questions.
