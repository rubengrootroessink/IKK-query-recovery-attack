_REQUEST_FOR_EXTENSION-FILING _3601.DOC>>


Gentlemen,

In light of the possible backouts in California today and later this week,
if it is possible, Ridgewood Power requests that your organization intervene
in support of the attached emergency filing at the FERC.  Please send this
e-mail to your firm's general counsel and ask him to contact either our
Washington counsel, Carol Smoots (202-496-7196), our general counsel, Dan
Gulino (800-331-8006, x-118) or me at (800-331-8006, x-163).  Any help would
be most appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Bill Short
