- MONDAY/TUESDAY -- AGENDA ATTACHED

Hi everyone!

Attached is the final agenda for Vancouver -- also is the final rooming list 
with confirmation numbers.   The Hotel Waterfront is located at 900 Canada 
Place Way, Vancouver, B.C. (604) 691-1991 (phone) and fax is (604) 691-1999.  
The hotel is approximately half an hour (cab ride) from the airport.  Cabs 
are the recommended mode of transportation because the hotel shuttle bus does 
not run very frequently and it often takes an hour to get to the hotel.  

The meetings will take place in Ballroom A on both days (see ppt presentation 
for meeting times)  there will be signs in the lobby which indicate where the 
Ballroom is located.

We will be serving breakfast and lunch Monday and only breakfast on Tuesday.

Attached are a few web sites if you are interested in any extracurricular 
activities.  The Canucks are Vancouver's hockey team and they are playing the 
Toronto Maple Leafs Monday, October 16th.   The writer's fest is taking place 
on Granville Island (approx. half an hour walk or a 10 minute cab ride) from 
the hotel -- see attached website for details.

Any questions, please call or email!  I look forward to seeing you in 
Vancouver!
