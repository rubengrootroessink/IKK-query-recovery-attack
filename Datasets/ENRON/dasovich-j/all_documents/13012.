One caveat -- on the expedited motion -- we have to tell them whether we are 
in or out by 1pm EDT tomorrow. SO, we would not be discussing at in our 
conference call.  I have already recommended internally that we go forward 
and join Dynegy's motion. So, by the time we have our call tomorrow, the 
filing will be made already.
