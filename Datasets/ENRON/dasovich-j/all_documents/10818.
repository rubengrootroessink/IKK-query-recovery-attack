I think I can, I think I can.  Yes, I can send you the power point slide 
presentation and outline I sent to Rick and Jim.

Here's our draft briefing book.  Ignore Jeff's power point attachment and use 
the following.  As Jeff states, this is a work in progress.  We'll need some 
assistance next week to clean things up and finalize.

I've focused my attention on editing the outline, which is about 60-75% 
complete.  Haven't touched the slides---they'll require substantially more 
work; but we shouldn't have any problem putting it to bed by end of next 
week.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff
