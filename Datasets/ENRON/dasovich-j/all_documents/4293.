Yesterday, a number of parties to the Interruptible OII c.00-10-002) filed  
their proposals for?what changes should be made to the utilities'  
interruptible programs.? A summary of those filings will be distributed  
later this week.? In addition the Energy Producers and Users Coalition  filed 
an emergency motion yesterday to make certain "refinements" to the  
utilities' programs.
?
Specifically,?the motion?requests that the Commission:

1. Order Edison and PG&E to implement Optional Binding Mandatory  Curtailment 
(OBMC) programs for all distribution level customers.? The OBMC  should 
provide flexible program criteria, recognizing that not all customers  have 
the same operational capability to control the manner and extent of  
curtailment as envisioned by the Commission in directing the implementation 
of  mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548; 
?
2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally  
suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased  
environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may 
qualify  under the "Essential Use" category of customers; and 
?
3. Approve a new service alternative for customers that would experience a  
disproportionate business interruption and economic impact upon 
interruption.  
?
Let me know if you want to see a copy of the motion.
