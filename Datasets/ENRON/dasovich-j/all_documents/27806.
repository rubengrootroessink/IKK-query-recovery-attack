Sue:

Bill Hatch echoes my sentiments 100%.  I am no longer in regulation but Kent
was a great friend and was the reason I came to the Commission almost 10
years ago and was a great friend and force in helping me start my own
business three years ago.  I'm glad California still has people like you as
true champions that have great heart and are willing to stand up for what
they believe are few and far between.  All the best in you're career with
Enron!

Truthfully Yours;
Bill Sandoval
