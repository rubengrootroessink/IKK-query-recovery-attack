There is much that is valuable in this letter, and a number of things are
brought to light.  However, in light of our initial plan, to provide an
easy to scan piece for "any fourth grader" and to produce something for
release to the press, I am concerned that the approach taken in this letter
is a little too legalistic for our target audience.  I was thinking that
something simpler and more designed for the common man might be
appropriate.

With fingers blazing to get a fleshed out outline out quickly, and little
regard for proof-reading or details, I have produced the attached "fleshed
out outline."  It is a little less than a first draft, but more of a
feeling for the way I think we might want to proceed.  I am not
volunteering to take over the letter, you understand, but I would like to
suggest this different approach.
Procedurally, I would rather Mike Day continued to serve as the gatekeeper
for this one.
