Dear Jeff,

Yes, the cookie that stores your login will store your most recent attempt
(regardless of whether it worked or not...).  So, that will lead to your
login being incorrect if you'd typed it in wrong any time...  Thanks for the
pointer; we'll try to see if we can come up with a solution...  :)

Cheers,

Izio Support
