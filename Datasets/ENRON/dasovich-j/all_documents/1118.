I think that we could put together a pretty close estimation.  When you say 
tenor, do you also want to try to estimate the balancing account as well or 
use the SDG&E estimates?  Also, what is your time frame?

Thane --

We now have enough information for the wholesale deal into SDG&E.  What I 
want is to mimic the legislation for R, Small C, and Street Lighting.  Can 
you put together the tenor and rates so we can match?

Jim

The RFP provided for our updating prices by noon today.  Here is what I sent 
out just a few minutes ago.  We don't know if they are going to disqualify us 
because we are not keeping our prices open, but we are trying to stay in the 
game.  (Jeff:  please forward tthis to Jim Steffes with a copy to me.  I 
can't find him in the Enron Corp. e-mail.)
