Here are the revised amendments Enron is offering to Assemblyman Wright for
AB 31X.  These include the latest ideas from Harry Kingerski on voluntary
participation by under 300 kW customers as well as the input from those
contacted by Leslie Lawner.  Scott, please get these amendments to Joe Lyons
today if possible.  Please note this language does not include the amendents
taken by Wright in committee yesterday, which are still not on the
legislature's websites.  Please forward those amendments when you get them.
Let Joe Lyons know I am willing to discuss these with him at any time.

Thanks, Mike Day
