Loretta Lynch/CPUC Rate Increase Proposal
*  According to our attorney in San Francisco who follows the CPUC, there has 
been no clarification about how the 3 cent increase will affect Direct Access 
customers (past, present, or future customers)
*  Lots of comments were filed with the CPUC that asked about the application 
to DA customers
*  However, in a signed ruling/statement/document yesterday, the CPUC didn't 
even touch the subject of DA...they didn't answer the comments
* Deadline for the CPUC decision on how to implement the rate increase is 
Mon, May 14 (surely? something would be final/solid by then?)

Governor Davis' Rate Increase Proposal
*  Looks more like a state revenue plan than power rate increase plan 
(according to the attorney)
*  Nothing about Davis' plan has been published except for a flyer (attorney 
faxing me the flyer now)
*  When asked about how Davis' plan would apply to DA customers, the Gov's 
spokesperson said that the policy has yet to be determined...that, as of now, 
there would be no special consideration for DA customers...(meaning that DA 
customers would be included in his rate increases)

Other Thoughts from the Attorney
*  No one is sponsoring bills right now to straighten-out DA's situation
*  CPUC, Governor appear not to focus on DA because they don't know what's 
going to happen with it

Sounds like we need to get on the phones....maybe a Telethon!  Dial for 
Direct Access;  Support Choice in California
...George, would one of the TV stations let us on?

Lemme know....
