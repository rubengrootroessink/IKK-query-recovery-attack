Unless you are really comfortable with the allegations, limit your dec. to 
facts not hypotheticals.   Let the lawyers allege.

Jeff,
I am attaching a draft declaration for your review.  Please let me know if 
you have any comments or changes or if you think we could explain things a 
little better.  Obviously, if you think we have misrepresented something, 
please let me know so that we can correct it.  I believe we have most of the 
exhibits.
Call me when you have had a chance to review.  My direct dial is 213.615.8774.

As I said, we need to file this in support of our Opposition to the 
plaintiffs' motion for shortened time, which is due tomorrow.  Accordingly, 
we would like to have this finalized and signed tonight, if possible.  Thanks 
Jeff.

Regards,
Kristen
