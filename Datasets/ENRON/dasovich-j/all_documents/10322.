This is the best I have seen yet on the going-forward cost of power. =20
Assuming 60% of term at $80/MWh this summer, the weighted average CDWR pric=
e=20
would be $240/MWh.  Using 75% term in winter, the CDWR average price would =
be=20
$129.

Harry or Robert: Can we re-run MRW's rate model using these nunbers?  Right=
=20
now I think they have in there $80/MWh.

On March 5, Freeman said the state had lined up contracts to cover 60% to 7=
