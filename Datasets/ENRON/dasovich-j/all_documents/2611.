HAAS RANKS FOURTH IN US NEWS UNDERGRADUATE RANKINGS 
 The Haas School Undergraduate Program ranked fourth in US News & World 
Report's academic reputation survey released in September. The University of 
Pennsylvania came in first with a score of 4.8, and MIT and the University of 
Michigan tied for second place with a score of 4.6 (out of a possible 5.0).? 
Haas scored 4.5.  Haas has traditionally done well in this survey, having 
ranked third with MIT in 1997 and first with Wharton in 1995. Haas ranked 
fourth in 1999. "Our position has been in one of the top four slots for many 
years in US News," said Dan Himelstein, director of the Undergraduate 
Program. "We seem to rotate positions among the top schools every few years, 
but the truth is that these are all excellent undergraduate programs with 
their own merits."  The US News survey also identified the academic 
reputation of school-wide academic departments (groups) within the surveyed 
institutions. Haas ranked as follows:  

2nd in real estate  
3rd in general management  
4th in marketing  
4th in consulting 
4th in finance  
5th in e-commerce 
6th in international management 
6th in human resources 
8th in entrepreneurship  

The survey, which included 338 accredited undergraduate business programs, 
asked deans and senior faculty to rank the academic caliber of the 
institutions with which they are familiar. The response rate was 45%.  For a 
full version of the rankings, visit the US News web site at

WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE CELEBRATES WOMEN'S CHOICES
 It may be Veteran's Day weekend, but here at Haas, it is women's weekend. 
The 5th annual Women in Leadership conference will take over the Haas School 
on Saturday, November 11, from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. This year's theme, 
"Options on Your Future," is meant to inspire and guide women to excel 
professionally and personally by making choices that satisfy their individual 
goals. Panelist and keynote speakers will address the challenges and triumphs 
of women in the workplace from many different perspectives.? The conference 
is open to the public. Men are encouraged to attend.

The annual Women in Leadership conference is the longest-running, student-run 
conference at Haas, attracting over 400 participants including current MBA 
students, Haas undergraduates, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay 
Area.? The event aims to promote the wide variety of career options and 
lifestyle choices available to women today through panel discussions, a 
networking lunch, and professional skills development workshops. 

Pat House, co-founder & executive vice president, Siebel Systems, will give 
the first keynote address of the day at 9:10 a.m. As executive vice 
president, House has responsibility for managing the strategic alliance and 
marketing communications efforts of Siebel Systems. 

Judy Lichtman, president, National Partnership for Women & Families, will 
give the second keynote address. In 1974, Lichtman became the executive 
director and first paid staff person for the Women's Legal Defense Fund 
(WLDF), which became the National Partnership for Women & Families in 
February 1998. The National Partnership for Women & Families uses public 
education and advocacy to promote fairness in the workplace, quality health 
care, and policies that help women and men meet the dual demands of work and 
family. 

There will be three sessions during the day with concurrent panel 
discussions. These include: Women Entrepreneurs; Changing the World Through 
Your Work; Women in Venture Capital; Personal Finance for Women; Start Up 
Fever; Traditional Investments: Women in Traditional Careers; Investing in 
Foreign Assets: Working Outside Your Home Country; Balanced Success; Risk and 
Return: Technology Career Choices; and Women in Media.

This year's conference is sponsored by FORTUNE magazine, Andersen Consulting, 
Ford Motor Company, Johnson & Johnson, PG&E Coporation, and others. Tickets 
for the conference are available at the WIL Conference web site 
http://www.wilconference.org/. The tickets are $30 for faculty, students, and 
staff, and $40 for the general public. 

HAAS UNDERGRADUATES BUILD CASE COMPETITION LEGACY
 Teams from the Haas Undergraduate Program have entered seven major external 
case competitions since fall of 1998, and have brought home awards from six 
of those competitions. Just this month, they brought home the Professional 
Excellence Award from the 2000 University of Texas International Business 
Challenge Case Competition in Austin, Texas.

The team for the Austin competition this year was Andrew Gu, Linh Hang, Diana 
Rothschild, and Jason Talavera.? The team was advised by Dave Robinson, Steve 
Etter, George Cluff, and Annie Lai.

"During this period of time, the track record of the Haas Undergraduate 
Program is unmatched by any other university in the world and our 
undergraduate students are representing Haas in a fashion that reflects very 
positively on the entire school," says Dan Himelstein, director of the 
Undergraduate Program. "We became the first program ever to earn awards at 
three consecutive University of Texas International Business Challenge Case 
Competitions." The awards won since fall of 1998 are: 

1998 Electronic Data Systems (EDS) Case Challenge - 2nd place 
1998 University of Texas International Business Case Challenge - 2nd place 
1999 University of Southern California International Case Competition - Most 
Creative Presentation 
1999 University of Texas International Business Case Challenge - 1st place 
2000 University of Washington Global Business Challenge Case Competition - 
2nd place 
2000 University of Texas International Business Case Challenge - Professional 
Excellence Award


FALL SPEAKERS: TOM SIEBEL AND RAY LANE COME TO HAAS
 The end of the month brings two major speakers to Haas in one week. 

Tom Siebel, CEO and founder of Siebel Systems, kicksoff this year's Fisher 
Center E-Commerce Executive Seminar Series on Tuesday, October 31, at 12:30 
p.m. 

Ray Lane, former Oracle president and general partner at Kleiner, Perkins,

Cyberspace" with the first of the Business Faculty Research Dialogue Series 
on Friday, November 3, at 4:00 p.m. 

Both events are free and open to the public. The Siebel event will take place 
in the Wells Fargo Room, with seats available on a first-come, first-served 
basis. Registration is not required for the Lane event in the Arthur Andersen 
Auditorium, but seats may be reserved by contacting Meredith LaCorte at 
510-643-2027 or via email at lacorte@haas.berkeley.edu.

EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT OFFERS NEW ECONOMY MARKETING COURSE
 Next week, Haas students will be rubbing elbows with executives coming to 
campus for the Center for Executive Development's "Smart Marketing for the 
New Economy." Running from November 1 to November 3, the program is designed 
to address both the fundamentals as well as the latest strategic thinking for 
smart marketing.

The program starts with the premise that marketing in a company has become 
too important to be left to the marketing department. Less a function or 
department, marketing is a philosophy, a way of thinking, the "glue" that 
holds the various independent activities of the organization together. The 
program will be led by Rashi Glazer, professor and co-director of the 
Berkeley Center for Marketing and  Technology.

The program will be preceded by an optional marketing fundamentals seminar on 
October 31.? For more information on CED programs, please visit
