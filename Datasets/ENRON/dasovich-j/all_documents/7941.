Jeff -- I believe there might be a meeting with Ken Lay next week while the
Gov. is in DC.  Could you email me his bio and anything you have on Enron's
operations in CA?  Thanks!  I have been trying to pull things off the net,
but our internet server is down in the Governor's office.

Thanks for any help you can provide.  I am out of here for a few days.
Best!

Hi Kari:

I know that you and I are both swamped, so I'm writing very briefly to give
you a brief update.  But first, thank you very much again for meeting last
week.  Greatly appreciated, and look forward to working together to help in
any way I can to find solution that is acceptable to all. Here's the
update:

Our "subcommitte" is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a
proposed solution.  It focuses on 3 key areas:

Using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices.
Designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more
appropriate balance in CA between state oversight and the need for
utility flexibility.
Rate stabilization/Undercollections (utility solvency)

I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress.  If thing's go
according to plan, we may be in a position to submit something to you a
early as Monday.  If there's a deadline from your end that I ought to be
aware of, let me know and I'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work
plan.

In the meantime, if there is anything at all that I can do to help, please
don't hesitiate to contact me.

Thanks again and all the best,
Jeff
