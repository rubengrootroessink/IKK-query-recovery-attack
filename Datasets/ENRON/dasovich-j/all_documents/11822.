FYI.  I will forward draft media responses (win or lose) either Sunday night 
or Monday
morning.  A win would mean we do not have to continue the process of 
returning the
campuses to our service -  as the judge ordered us to do.  A loss would mean 
that we
must continue returning the campuses to our service and therefore we would 
once again
be responsible for buying the campuses' power on the open market.   In either 
case,
we maintain the right to continue the appeal process, and legal will decide 
whether or
not it is appropriate to continue that process after the appeals court 
decision.    

Legal does not expect to hear the ruling until Tuesday morning, but there is 
a chance we
could hear something Monday afternoon.
