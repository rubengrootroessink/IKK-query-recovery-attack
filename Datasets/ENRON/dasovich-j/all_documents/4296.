Hi Everyone,

Tomorrow we are sending to your home addresses the materials you will need
to read in preparation for the Pre-Work Meeting and for the retreat itself.
There is a lot of reading in the packets, and it's important that you do
the reading prior to the event.  There will not be time during the pre-work
meeting or the retreat to catch up on the materials not read, and they are
critical to your effective use of very  limited time!

Please also note that in the materials, there is another list of the teams.
For a variety of reasons, we had to make some changes to the team
assignments, so please be sure to check which team you're on.

Cheers!

Diane
