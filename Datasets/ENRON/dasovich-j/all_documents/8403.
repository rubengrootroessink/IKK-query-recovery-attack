Jim et al---Paul and I have a meeting in Denver on Tuesday with Governor Bill 
Owen's chief of staff (Roy Palmer) and two of his policy guys.  The Governor 
is expected to stop in for a few minutes.  I also had the occasion to talk 
with Gov Owens this weekend in Washington DC, and I he articulated his 
support for "market" solutions.  He also will be an individual that we can 
count on to know the issues....he apparently was a lobbyist at one time for 
the oil and gas industry. Also, Gov Owens mentioned that he had breakfast 
with Ken Lay sometime in the last few months and that he had received support 
from Ken in the past.  Can we find out what support Owens was given?  (I got 
the sense that it might have been some money dedicated to a community or 
government program...maybe the Aspen Institute?  And it sounded like he had 
gotten some $ for his campaign)  

Unfortunately, Gov Owens will be leaving for an overseas trip this week and 
will not be attending the Feb 2 meeting in Portland, so our hope that he 
would be a stong  voice at the meeting is not going to happen.  I think that 
we can get some good work done with the staff, and good support in the long 
term, but we need to look beyond Owens for this meeting.

I got the sense over the weekend that Kempthorne is going to be pretty active 
on this issue, and since he is the chair of the WGA, he will be running the 
meeting.  In talking with FERC Commissioner Hebert at one of the inaugural 
events, he indicated that Kempthorne seemed to be pretty reluctant to take on 
the mantle of market solutions.  Paul has a meeing with Kempthorne's office 
on Friday of this week, so we'll be working on convincing him to be an 
advocate.  

As you know, Jim Souby from WGA did eventually make room on the panel for the 
FEB 2 meeting for us.  A letter of invitation should be on it's way to Steve 
Kean if it has not already been received.  

 I saw Hap Boyd and he says that Enron Wind is participating on Feb. 2 in the 
afternoon session.
