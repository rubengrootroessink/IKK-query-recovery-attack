Jeff:

Thanks for your attention on this matter. I am leaving for China tomorrow 
(Saturday 6/9) and will return on Saturday 6/16. I am confirmed to depart for 
Sao Paulo on 6/19. Is there a phone # I can reach Joe Kaischkill on? If so, I 
would contact him when I get settled in in Shanghai. On the contrary, I can 
be reached on Monday 6/18 in my office in Miami at 305-443-6665 or on my 
mobile 305-773-0319.

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards,
Joe Alcantara
