I think I have the basic data to do an estimate of interconnection benefits.  
Flow data is summarized in the attached chart.

It'll take a day or so of someone's time to crank out the benefit 
calculation.  It's a little tricky lining up the gas and power data.

Jim is there an access/excel jockey I could tap for such help?  Otherwise I'm 
going to plea for some external help.
