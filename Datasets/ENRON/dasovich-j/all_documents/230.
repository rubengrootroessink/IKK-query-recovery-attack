What is so proprietary about their distribution drawings? Should we start 
kicking butt? Dirk

 Rob,
I apologize for the misunderstanding of what we would provide you.
Our drawings are proprietary. After furture discussions with our experts,
they feel that what we have provided, should do what you need.  Mr. Raymond
will not be providing the drawing but should be able to offer the guidance,
to get where we need to go, to further the project.  I have been advised
that the description that we provided you will adequately cover the "ground"
needed in the CEQA.  Mr. Raymond (Ph. # 559.263.5239) can advise if you have
further issues.  He is an excellent resource and has done a lot of work on
our end with similar projects.  This is why we are confident with what we
provided.
If the above does not further the issue please call me immediately at
559.263.5528.  I will be out of the office on vacation tomorrow.
