*  PG&E statement below
*  they say they will continue with the bankruptcy court to resolve their 
situation
*  I heard on NPR this morning (trying to get the transcript right now) that 
if PG&E doesn't sell their transmission system to the state, it will cause 
SCE and SDG&E to go bankrupt as well....again, I'm trying to verify 
that....I'm not whole-heartedly trusting my early-morning listening skills

PG&E Issues Statement After State And Southern California Edison Reach An 
Agreement 
	San Francisco, CA -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today issued the 
following statement after the State and Southern California Edison reached an 
agreement:
	"We are pleased that Southern California Edison, given its set of facts, and 
the State have been able to reach an agreement and are hopeful that this 
agreement will contribute to the solution of the State's energy crisis.
