Jim et al.:

I heard from Robert Michaels that Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) may be 
interested in sponsoring his study.

Wayne Brough at CSE plans to approach EPSA and others to gauge interest.  He 
said that their president Paul Beckner is scheduled to meet with Steve Kean 
in mid- September on this and other topics.

Wayne said there was some thinking to let Ken Malloy front the study but have 
CSE write a grass roots version given their niche.  Malloy does not want to 
fund raise for his part, however, so CSE might be responsible for both if it 
gets done.

SO, everything is still in the planning stages.

Rick, et al --

I don't know if we need to do this study and the work that Seabron and LECG 
would be doing.  Maybe we incorporate these guys into the mix during the work 
up of the analysis.  

I think that we need to make sure that we have the right questions to ask.  I 
will get with Jeff Dasovich and Joe Hartsoe and Mary Hain to make sure that 
we (1) have the right questions and (2) have the right parties answering the 
questions.  Then let's look at our current resources and go outside only if 
necessary.

where are we on this? Jim- How does this square w/ Seabron's work? Is there a 
way to marry the two?

Robert Michaels is proposing a consultant study looking at the California 
electricity chaos (see attached).  It is roughly a $100,000 study before 
printing and distribution costs with a delivery date of December 1.  The 
study would also involve Ken Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets.

I think Robert would do a good job but raise these issues:

1) This is expensive.  It is at consultant rates and is not an academic study 
where a think tank can get the professors to do something at less cost

2) Malloy is pretty heavy into this at a cost of $14,400 of about 40% of 
Michaels.  His NARUC connections are very important, and we would want him on 
the popularization side, but this is too much.

3) The study might need a co-author with lots of academic credibility to join 
Robert as good as he is.

I'm glad that we have this proposal--it will force us to think about what we 
want, who does it, and how it should be distributed.  We should also think 
about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort (it 
should be large given the stakes).

Can you provide your impressions so I can get back to Robert?

- Rob

All --

Here's the memo I said you'd have today, and a preliminary budgeting
sheet.  Gimme a call as soon as is reasonably possible.

Thanx,
