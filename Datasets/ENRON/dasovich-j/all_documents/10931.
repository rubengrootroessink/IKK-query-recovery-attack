ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

Is there a settlement agreement here where we give up credits after 12/31 
(assuming that they are minimal) in exchange for full payment through 12/31 
(a lot of which I think has been paid)?  More importantly, can something like 
that be implemented by the CPUC in such a way (like some sort of binding 
order with findings of fact and/or law) that we can argue to the Bankruptcy 
Court that it is binding, or at least persuasive, on the PG&E situation?  I 
sense an opening here--any thoughts on how we can dig into this?

Subject: SCE PX credits

Interesting bit from SCE's MOU (p. 31) -

"the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "

Translation:  I suppose this means SCE is looking for an order absolving it 
of any responsibility for PX credits after 12/31/00, but implicitly, that 
seems to suggest they accept responsibility for PX credits before 12/31/00.  
Do you agree?
