The final decision added an average rate cap for industrial users.  It has 
the effect of lowering rates slightly.  Also, direct access remains exempt 
from the surcharge but language is added to ensure that DA Customers receive 
no bill credit.  The decision also adds the notion that the CPUC will now 
look at redesigning the credit system to "reflect current structural reality."
