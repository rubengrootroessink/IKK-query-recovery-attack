Met w/ Tom Bottorff, PG&E, with Mike McDonald, Jake Thomas and Laird Dyer to 
pitch a proposal to take-over the management of PG&E's gas procurement and 
physical assets (storage, pipeline capacity) in exchange for a guaranteed 
index minus deal, ensuring a higher level of shareholder benefit.  Tom was 
going to set up other internal meetings for us to explore further.

Tom also indicated that PG&E's number one issue is going to be the 
undercollections of their procurement costs that the rate freeze has 
created.  I said that we would like to keep the communication lines open to 
work on a solution to their situation that we could also support.  I would 
suggest that this would be a key point for CA strategy for both EES and ENA 
as it does create some leverage for us.
