I'll be in the RTO meeting starting at 12:30 pm.  I'll also pass along the 
most recent version of the AReM press release on this.

AB XX 82 

wrong bill for California
eliminates direct access until at least 1/1/03 -- also prohibits extension of 
DA customers' contracts --  requires those DA customers to RETURN to utility 
service
takes the energy futures of the citizens of CA hostage for years to come
will deepen and extend the harm to businesses and the economy
another example of policymakers in CA not being willing to stand up and make 
the hard choices necessary to solve the problem
