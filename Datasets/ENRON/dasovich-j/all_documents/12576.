Energy Committee Members:

Attached is the presentation on emergency standby generators as presented by
Steve Motzko at the energy committee meeting.

 <<BAAQMDRegProp010514.ppt>>

Here is a link to the BAAQMD Standby Generator Application Instructions:

The BAAQMD draft regulation and 34 page staff report can be accessed in PDF
files at:
http://www.baaqmd.gov/ruledev/reg-pmt/r0201ws2.htm
Here is a link to the California Air Resources Board "Statewide Portable
Equipment Registration Program Fact Sheet" for mobile sources:
http://www.arb.ca.gov/perp/factshe3.htm

I think the three links will be of interest to the energy task force as well
as the presentation
