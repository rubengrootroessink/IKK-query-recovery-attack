Dear E204 Students,
Please find the files on the Merton Case (for problems 3, 4, 5) and the
Non-Linear Programming advertising example attached to this e-mail.
We will explore more of the portfolio problem in class next week as we
complete the non-linear programming module, and then we will begin the
lectures on simulation (you have the chapter reading as a handout).
With regard to Team Project #1, you should be looking over the three
problems, discussing the facts and issues, and thinking about their
formulation/solution.  Your reports are due in two weeks (not next week)
so we can go over the problems and any questions/clarifications you may
need in the next lecture.  Given the detail with which some of you have read
the homework problems, I imagine there might be some clarification questions
even though the problem statements were meant to be as straightforward as
possible.  I would prefer to clarify all questions at one time during class
since
we have the extra week, but if you have something urgent you can always ask.
Note that you should have received the data file for Problem 3 of TA#1 by
an e-mail attachment last night.
Finally, I would like to introduce some conformity to the Personal Problem
Sets.
Please put:
    Last Name, First Name
    E204 - (1 = Wed, or 2 = Thurs)
    Personal Problem Set # ...
    Ch. ...,   # ....
    Date Due:  ... / .../ 00
in the UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER of your homework set on p.1
This will help our GSI record grades, especially if your homework has
gone into the wrong envelope.
Also, for the Team Project #1, you will need to take the FIRST PAGE of
that handout and make it the first page of your report.  All students will
need to CLEAERLY print their names (Last Name, First Name) and then
initial/sign for the statement assuring that only group members worked on
the assignment with possible help from instructor/GSI/Haas computer 
consultant.
The cohort is either 1-Wednesday, or 2-Thursday for the lecture
time.  Please make sure that your Team Assignment #1 report has this first
page filled out completely
(for each member) before you submit it (on April 19/20 in class by 6
PM).  If some
team members will be out of town, they should sign on the page early.  Every
team member should be reviewing all the problems/issues, not just selectively
--- you may have some focus on particular areas but not to the neglect of the
overall problem set.  When your results are handed in, each member should be
confident that they could now individually have written it.
