Nothing was fidgety, at all. I'm glad that you spoke your mind, because I
have been offended by those types of statements from Cameron many times. I
have tried to say something, only to be pushed aside by her adept
pettifoggery -- that you chimed in gave it weight. (She was also in the mood
for a little bout.) With that said, I've discovered that if I'm patient with
her, she will eventually listen to me, and the points I make about the holes
in her logic. She has a handbag of half-formed views which I am trying to
dispel. It has taken a while, but we're getting there. Hence, her saying at
the end of the conversation that she's against fundamentalism, rather than
religious people in general. She needs to take more of those strides.

You may certainly hold anarchist views (I respect that), but that night I
think you were simply expressing an abhorrence of gross generalization. I'm
glad we see eye to eye on that. Live and let live and all that. But once
Cameron says something like that, she feels she must stick by it. The
devil's advocate line is so boring: one must speak one's mind, not
contradict for contradiction's sake. (Do devil's advocates have nothing
themselves to believe in, so they simply take the opposing view for
something to hold onto?) Cameron has a bit too much of the devil's advocate
in her. I hope I can cast some spells to purge that ornery Lucifer from her.
I think I'll be less sucessful there. After all, she is a lawyer at heart.

Maybe next time we see each other you can explain to me exactly what a
social liberterian is. I really don't have a clear concept in my head there.

Hope you're having a nice day.
