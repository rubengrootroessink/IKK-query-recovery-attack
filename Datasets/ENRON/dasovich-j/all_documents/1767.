Now that I know that Anthony and George Cluff are organizing the event, I
would stay far, far away.  Maybe it would be good for them to talk to Gray
Davis, just to clear up this energy thing for him.

I certainly don't see why this is confidential.  Distribution wheeling has
been
"my baby" at Enron for years but I don't see Anthony Mazy contributing
anything
to the effort.  We don't need a big conference, or 150 people, or the
Governor.
We just need the CPUC and the FERC to say "Stop the Madness and Open the
System." So, I won't be participating.  Thanks for asking.

Here is something you don't see every day.  An invitation to talk to Gray
Davis (maybe) about distribution wheeling.  Has Enron got a candidate to
offer?   I would act quickly.  Mike Day

To all persons BCC'd:

There is an urgent need to identify at least one, and possibly two, persons
to sit on a discussion panel to discuss Distribution Wheeling* at a
conference October 21-22, at UC Berkeley.  The conference/symposium will be
limited to approximately 150 persons, to allow close and interactive Q&A
between panelists and the key audience of California's executive,
legislative, and regulatory officers, and their key staff.  We have been
told that Governor Davis himself is expected to participate.

Please respond ASAP, nominating one individual per message (suitable for
public viewing), identifying the individual together with that person's
relevant interests and affiliations.  Add approximately 1/4- to 1/2 page of
details of the person's issue, point-of-view, or proposal, together with
their relevant qualifications to address such.

If there are any questions, please call me at my office number and leave a
message or reply to this e-mail.  Due to the urgency of this need, and the
short turn-around requested, you are welcomed to call me at home,
925-855-0554, from 7:00 AM to 9:00 PM Sat-Sun, or 5:30 to 7:30 AM Mon-Fri,
Pacific time.


*Distribution Wheeling is the practice of relieving certain local,
distribution-level energy transactions from some or all of the regulations,
including tariff responsibilities, pertaining to interstate transmission
transactions.  This issue has been addressed at some length in the CPUC
proceeding R.99-10-025.

For quick reference, a copy of ORA's testimony in that proceeding (which,
admittedly, does not equally cover all possible interpretations of DW) is
provided for your convenience.
