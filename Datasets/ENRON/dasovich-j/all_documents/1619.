Jeff,
You had suggested some "wholesalers" and utilities the conference and I don't
know which if any are pure generating companies.  Would you say that SCE and
PG&E suffer from high prices and therefore support price caps?  We're thinking
of Bryson and Glynn and I want to make sure someone can speak to the issue of
price caps scaring away investment.  Would Southern and Reliant fit this bill?

Thanks a ton.  Sorry that the school's fundraiser called, I hope that didn't
bother you.
Rob

 * Southern Energy-CA
 * Dynegy
