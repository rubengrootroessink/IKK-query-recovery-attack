Below is the obituary that will run this week in the Chronicle and
Montclarion:
It is with great sadness that the Herring family shares the passing of Ward
Wesley Herring, a devoted father and husband, compassionate friend, revered
coach and great man.
Ward died peacefully of cancer on June 18, 2001 at home with his wife and
companion of 33 years at his side.  He was 57.  Ward battled cancer
valiantly, surviving to meet and welcome his third grandchild, Colin Ward
Lyman, who was born the morning of June 13, 2001.
Born on February 6, 1944 in Chicago, Illinois, Ward lived and traveled
across the United States but always stayed loyal to his Cubs and his Bears.
He graduated from New Mexico Highlands University in 1965 and received a
masters in mathematics in 1967 from Michigan State University, where he met
his wife, Ruth Thomas Herring of San Francisco.  Ward spent his career
working with computers and information systems; however, he was first and
foremost a family man.  He is survived and cherished by Ruth; their children
Michael and Lisa Herring of Oakland and Jeanne Herring and David Lyman of
San Francisco; their grandchildren Thomas Jackson (T.J.) Herring of Oakland,
Theodore Butler Herring of Oakland and Colin Ward Lyman of San Francisco;
his brother Ernest Herring of Hinesville, Georgia, and sister Janet
Kratochvil of Lawrenceburg, Indiana; his aunt Rita Norum of Skokie,
Illinois; his sweet dog, Sunday; and by a large extended family of cousins,
nieces, nephews, in-laws and friends who loved him deeply.  He joins his
beloved late brother Thomas Forrest Herring, father Ernest Paul Herring and
mother Rose Bridges Herring in Heaven.
The number of people Ward touched in his life is long and deep.  He kept his
friendships for decades across great distances, planning his vacations so as
to visit people dear to him.  His compassion and love will forever be
remembered by his coworkers at Heald Colleges, where he impacted many lives
over the last 12 years; by his childhood and college buddies; by his rugby
teammates from the Bald Eagles, Gael Old Boys and Queen City (Denver,
Colorado); by the hundreds of adults who as youth he coached in soccer,
football, baseball and life.
Family and friends are invited to a Memorial Service and Celebration of
Ward's life (reception immediately following) on Friday, June 22, 2001, at
10:00am at Corpus Christi Church, Piedmont.  In lieu of flowers,
contributions may be made in Ward's name to Sports4kids, 510 Third Street,
Suite 102, Oakland, CA 94607 to benefit Oakland kids' after school
activities or to Outervention, 549 42nd Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94121 to
help adolescent girls become strong, confident, independent young women
through outdoor activities with their families.
