since the siting legislation created only a program that is voluntary and not 
in place of the existing laws, and we have a committment from the 
legislature, the CEC and the govenor's office to take another shot in 
January, as they know that this legislation is flawed, too many conflicting 
interests trying to solve a complex problem in too short a time, I feel this 
is too harsh...we have already started the process of creating new 
legislation, that will be as close to a consensus as possible for next 
session..this legislation did not hurt us, and, some companies feel that they 
can use the processes.  We have to keep in mind that with the knowledge that 
there will be major reorganization legislation next year, we don't want to 
offend the friends that we have in Sacramento, particularly the Republicans 
who were the ones who insisted on an expedited siting bill
