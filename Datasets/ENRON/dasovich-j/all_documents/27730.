To Principal Officers Energy Committee members, Liaison Representatives and
Environmental Committee members:

It has been about a year since we began working together to advocate for a
healthy energy policy and future for California employers, employees and
their families.  We have been meeting weekly (at least).  It's been a great
challenge to understand the issues, determine our principles, goals and
objectives, build key partnerships and learn to advocate effectively in a
difficult and politicized environment.  We started out in the frying pan,
skipped the fire and went straight into the furnace (via the crucible) and
have remained there to the present.   Our learning curve has been steep and
bumpy at times.  Despite some frustrations and setbacks, I am happy to say
that there is much to celebrate and recognize as successes for SVMG.   We
have been involved in many sectors--Conservation, Smart Load Management,
advocacy for clean new generation and transmission, smart policy and
communications in all these areas.   Below is a brief presentation I made
to the SVMG board of directors this past Wednesday presenting our return on
investment and highlighting accomplishments for the dedicated efforts of so
many great people and companies.  Feel free to respond.  We welcome your
input and feedback.

I wish to especially recognize the efforts of your energy committee leaders
in this unprecedented effort:  John Redding of General Electric and K.C.
Mares (formerly Sun, now Exodus).  They have represented you with skill,
wisdom and more than a dash of panache.   In upcoming messages we will be
recognizing other key leaders who serve you so ably.   Please feel free to
express your appreciation to them.   (kc.mares@exodus.net;
john.redding@gene.ge.com)

One additional item.  I want you to know that SVMG has a unique opportunity
and role in the state.  We have been working daily here in the capital for
the last week representing Silicon Valley with a broad coalition of
stakeholders and legislators to find a workable solution to the financial
segment of the energy crisis.  I am encouraged by the committment to a
solution and the attitude of cooperation.  Quite a contrast to what we
usually experience.  Stay tuned.  We will keep you informed on the progress
as
we are able.

Grateful for your partnership in Energy,

Justin Bradley
Director of Energy Programs
