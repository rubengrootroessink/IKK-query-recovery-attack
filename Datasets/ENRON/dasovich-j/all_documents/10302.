would they sell the intrastate pipleine to an interstate pipeline and use the 
cash to pay bad debts?  Also, is distribution unbundled from retail sales?

Tom:  Apologies.  I'm wrapped up, but will try to come up with more.  Three 
things that come to mind:

1. Seems important that any price cap include a hard sunset date.
2. Direct Access for all customers in California should be a concession.
3. Dramatic commitment from California to substantially upgrade the in-state 
gas transportation network (fyi: it may  be in worse shape than the electric 
tx network--can build more plants, but if one can't get the gas to them.....)

Best,
Jeff
