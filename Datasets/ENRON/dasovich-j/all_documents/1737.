Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. 
Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. 

In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to 
purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock. The brunette balances 
their checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another 
ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale. 

Upon leaving, she tells her sister, "When I get there, if I decide  
to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home." 

The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides 
she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599, 
no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her 
sister a telegram to tell her the news.

She walks into the telegraph office, and says, "I want to send a 
telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I 
need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we 
can haul it home." 

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her,  
then adds, It's just 99 cents a word." 

Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She 
realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.  

After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, "I want you to send 
her the word, 'comfortable'." 

The telegraph operator shakes his head. "How is she ever going to know that 
you want her to hitch the trailer to your pick-up truck and drive out
here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word,  
'comfortable'?" 

The brunette explains, "My sister's a blonde. She'll read it slow."
