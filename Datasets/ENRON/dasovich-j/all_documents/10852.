CISCO AND THE INTERNET: THE SECOND ANNUAL E-BUSINESS CASE COMPETITION  
Predicting the future of high-tech companies may be tricky business, but UC 
Berkeley students are up to the task. Next Monday, April 16, five teams of UC 
Berkeley students (both undergraduate and graduate students) will make their 
best case for the future of Cisco Systems' use of the Internet at the 
E-Business Case Competition. The event takes place at 5:30 p.m. in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium.

Cisco Systems and Deloitte Consulting created this case to give students an 
opportunity to recommend solutions to Cisco for using the Internet to help 
its channel partners focus on their core-competencies and create a 
competitive advantage. In addition to the judges from Cisco, Deloitte 
Consulting, and the Haas School, the audience will vote for the winning team 
out of the 5 finalists. Over $2,500 in cash awards will be given to the 
finalists. The Haas School of Business, Cisco Systems, Deloitte Consulting, 
and the Schlinger Family Foundation sponsor the event.

The final teams were chosen from more than 20 submissions to the 
undergraduate program office. Each team is composed of UC Berkeley students 
from any field of study and must include at least one non-Haas major. The 
finalists teams are:  Aleksey Strygin, Mark Khavkin, Jane Knop, and Inna 
Garilova  Nancy Lan, Melissa Wong, and Darien Shanske  David Chan, Amyn 
Saleh, Christine Cho, and Lisa Mou  Vincent Chiu, Martin Lanner, Albert Lai, 
and Ryan Mickle  Christian Milan, Shirley Gou, Kitty Cheung, and Ruby Shih  
The competition and the reception that follows offer an opportunity to meet 
representatives from Cisco Systems and Deloitte Consulting. The entire UC 
Berkeley community is welcome to attend the final presentation night. A Palm 
Pilot will be raffled off at the end of the event. 

SUBMIT YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR THE FIRST HAAS STAFF AWARDS  Inaugurated by Dean 
Laura Tyson to recognize the tremendous contribution of the staff at the Haas 
School, the 2000-2001 Outstanding Staff Awards will be presented at the End 
of the Year Party on May 4, 2001. Members of the Haas community are invited 
make nominations. The deadline for nominations is Wednesday, April 25, 2001. 

The guidelines for nomination are:  Performs at a level above and beyond 
normal job requirements.  Significantly improves customer service or

 THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL MUSIC  The Management of Technology Program is joining 
Boalt Hall for a roundtable discussion on "Digital Music and Copyright 
Issues" on Wednesday, April 18, from 4:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium. 

"This year's Digital Music Conference is taking place in a different 
landscape for both Napster and peer services than last year's conference," 
says Drew Isaacs, executive director of MOT. "Although the 'shutting down' of 
Napster has had limited effect on the swapping of free music files on the 
Internet, it has brought to universal awareness the complex business and 
legal environment for digital music publishing and distribution.? This is the 
core issue to be examined at this year's event."

The event is free and open to the UC Berkeley community. The panel includes 
Robin Gross, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Gerd Leonhard, Licensemusic.com; 
Milt Olin, Napster; Barry Simmons, Simons and Stern; John Simson, Recording 
Industry Association of America; Carol Smith, Listen.com; and Peter Menell, 
executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, as the 
moderator. 

 NINTH ANNUAL YOUTH VENTURE CAPITAL COMPETITION AT HAAS  The Haas School's 
extremely successful youth outreach program, Young Entrepreneurs at Haas 
(YEAH), is holding its ninth annual Venture Capital Competition on Saturday, 
April 28, from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. in Wells Fargo Room. This competition 
brings students from local middle and high schools to Haas to present their 
business plans to a volunteer "venture capital" board. 

YEAH allocates over $10,000 to top performers for business startup or 
educational costs through this competition. The competition offers 
participating youth a chance to demonstrate their new skills, pitch their 
business ideas to a panel, and compete for grants of up to $500 for business 
startup or college costs.

YEAH is an academic preparation program for educationally disadvantaged 
middle and high school students who express an interest in business. With the 
support of 40 MBA volunteer mentor/business coaches, YEAH teaches teens how 
to develop their business ideas, draft business plans, and turn their ideas 
into entrepreneurial opportunities. The program also introduces youth to the 
stock market, the global economy, and teaches them how to improve test taking 
and study skills that are critical to admission to the UC system. 

Due to increased public and private funding, the YEAH Program has tripled in 
size to reach more than 170 youth from middle schools and high schools in the 
Oakland, Berkeley, Emery, and West Contra Costa Unified School Districts this 
year. For more information on YEAH, visit www.haas.berkeley.edu/yeah. 

The organizers are still looking for a few more volunteer panelists. Please 
contact Ajuah Helton at 510-643-0923 for more information.

ventures for the new century.

and International House, are co-presenting the symposium. All Cal alumni and
