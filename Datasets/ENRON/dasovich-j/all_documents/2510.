Dud (I mean Dude),

What are we doing for Prentice's Birthday.  How bought we get a giant
cake and YOU jump out of it in only YOUR birthday suit (mmm delicious).

Blow off that Sunday final, tell them that for religious reasons you
cannot take a test on a Sunday.

Let me know if Prentice will ever let you leave the house on a Friday
night and we can go get some dinner and talk about guy stuff.
