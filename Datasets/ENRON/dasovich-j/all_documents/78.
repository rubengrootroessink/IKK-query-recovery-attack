Message below from Professor Levine regarding E201B:

Dear Macro class,

This message concerns the first macroeconomics class, which will be held next
week October 21, 22 in C210.  Please read in the textbook "The Science of
Macroeconomics" and "The Data of Macroeconomics," Mankiw Chapters 1 and 2.

You should start receiving the Financial Times a few days before class begins.
If you do not receive your first copy before class begins, please contact 
Shawn
Allison (allison@haas).

Homework zero.  Please do before first class, but do not hand in:

1.      List three ways in which GDP over- or understates a nation's typical
standard of living.
2.      List 2 reasons why the CPI might over- or understate the true 
inflation
rate.
3.      What are 3 reasons why it matters if the CPI is accurate?
4.      Please look in the Financial Times and find a story that fits your
name.
        A) If your first name begins with A-D, find a story concerning why
living standards and output per capita differ so much between one or more
richer and poorer countries.
        B) If your first name begins with E-K, find a story concerning
persistently high or low unemployment and inflation.
        C) If your first name begins with L-O, find a story concerning 
interest
rates and central bank policies.
        D) If your first name begins with  P-S, find a story concerning
exchange
rates and one or more of trade deficits, the current account, or capital
mobility.
        E) If your first name begins with T-Z, find a story concerning
government macroeconomic policy and/or corruption.

I look forward to meeting you all in a few days.  Good luck on your finals 
this
week.  Pleas remind classmates to sign onto the email alias e201b-1 or e201b-2
(they are identical), as only 39 people total have signed up.

Till soon,

- David
