Attached is the 2000 Budget template that we will be using as a starting 
point for the Western States.
The numbers seem to outdated. There are probably missing proceeding. Please 
review, add or modify $ amounts and categories. Do not include speculative 
amounts, include only the numbers that we need to start our work in January 
1, 2000, for the year.  To the extent that you know, if RCRs have been 
approved on certain proceeding, please add the approved amount and the 
estimated residual amount that will be left Jan 1, 2000.  

Although it is my understanding that this detailed budget is not needed for 
the Colorado Springs meeting, it may be a good reference point for the 
meeting. Please get to me your numbers by EOB tomorrow ,Tuesday 11/16, so I 
can send out a revised budget on Wed. morning. Please feel free to include 
any suggestions or comments.
