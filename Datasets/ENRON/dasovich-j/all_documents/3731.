Paul -- Please contact the following gentleman with Universal.  As I said in 
my voice mail to you, Universal is apparently gearing up for a much more 
serious regulatroy and legislative effort regarding energy, and would like to 
explore the possibility of working closely with Enron.  

David is in charge of operations, is quite knowledgeable about the gas and 
power business, and is also a long time fan of Enron.  As many companies are 
these days, they are reeling from the frequent curtailments by Edison all 
summer, and as recently as two times last week.  If you have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to call me in Houston at 713-853-1564.  Thanks -- David
