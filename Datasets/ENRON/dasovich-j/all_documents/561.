Good Morning Jeff!
Contrary to popular belief, there are conversions that can be used, that will 
reasonably convert the various units of measure.  I took a moment to compile 
them into the attached spreadsheet.  Enjoy!

Quick question:  Most folks think in terms of MMcf.  I know there isn't a 
straighforward crossward from therms to MMcf, but do you folks have any rules 
of thumb about BTU content I could use to translate the therm numbers you 
sent into MMcf?  Thanks a lot.

Jeff
