Subject: Assignment for Thursday



Greetings:

Are we supposed to do the reading and the Oracle and Legal Services cases
for Thursday?  Syllabus says yes, but I gather from Tasker's Izio not that
we'll be in the computer center all class doing modeling.  (I'd email her,
but she doesn't get my emails apparently.)  Anyone have a clue?

Best,
Jeff
