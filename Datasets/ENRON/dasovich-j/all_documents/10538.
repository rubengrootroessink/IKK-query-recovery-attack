Proposals

We have filed comments in support (see attachments) of Kern River's emergency 
expansion proposal to add 135,000 Mcf/d of capacity through temporary 
compressors and El Paso's request to keep the compressors that had originally 
requested to abandon in their oil pipeline conversion application which will 
add 230,000 Mcf/d of capacity on their south system.   In-service dates would 
be July 1 for Kern River and August 1 for El Paso, assuming expeditious 
treatment of the applications at FERC and no problems with permits. 

Kern River held an open season for their expansion and ENA was awarded about 
3,700 Dth/d.  The El Paso capacity will not be contracted to individual 
shippers, but will be used for system flexibility and to cover outages on the 
system this summer when they start testing as required after the explosion 
last year.
