Jeff,
Thanks for the note, but you can't get away that easy without telling
me more about Fessler. The single-handedly (with SDG&E and Edison help)been
responsible for millions heading to billions of dollars out of this state.
I WANT to here the blow by blow.  How could he show his face on panel after
this?
Every time I turn around I keep hearing about my name popping up for
something.  FERC is definitely off the radar for me.  Once was enough, plus
I like making money like you now :-)
I would love to spend some time with Ken Lay or Jeff Skillings (saw the
Fortune article on him it was great). Believe it or not I have been thinking
of pulling together a summit meeting of the past "right" people under the
auspices of the Chamber to prepare a manifesto to be sent to Gov Davis, who
is thoroughly confused and misinformed.  I was thinking of a half day
conference that included my old coterie (you, Bob, Scadding, Dave Kelly,
distributed gen people, Skillings or Keane, Brulte, Neeper, David Rohy, CMA,
Green Mountain, Ed Caszlett, Robert Michaels, Bob Levine, etc. etc.)  What
do you think?
I am already doing a bi-national energy forum with Ernesto Ruffo
(Mexican Border Czar, former Governor of Baja AND on MY board of directors
thank you very much) and President Vicente Fox (assured to come).  Very
exciting!!!!
Hope all is well, if we can talk lets do it Friday.  By the way, my
PHONE NUMBER IN CASE YOU LOST IT :-( IS 619-544-1311 or cell 619-5207269 or
home 619-223-9555.
Your wine project sounds like a lot of fun.  Hey, I am going to the
Sonoma Cutrer winery's World Champion Croquet Championship to raise money
for Let's Make a Wish on Saturday May 19th (remember I went every year, this
is my 10th), it is a lot of fun, dress in whites or beige with beautiful
ladies in hats.  I have a table, only would cost you $225 a ticket.  I have
room at my table which I have to fill.  Joye is coming with me.  Are you
interested?   Only requirement is that you would have to drink a lot of wine
and have a great time in the sun.  Very classy deal.  Let me know.
By the way, did you hear about Kent Wheatland's sad passing?

you done good, fella.  how's life at 50 treating you?  it was great to see
you, and between you and me, i don't think that anyone would come close to
guessing that you're fifty.  i want you to know that i'm constantly trying
to figure out how i can get down to s.d. to spend some time together. it's
something that i very much look forward to, but i gotta tell you, man,
working for enron and attending UC's evening mba program is kicking my
butt!

the good news is that enron has seen fit to promote me (senior
director---one notch below v.p.), and i didn't even have to move to
houston....and cross your fingers---if things work out i may sign a
contract with a winemaker to buy grapes from 10 acres of vines on the land
that i bought on the sonoma/mendocino coast (vines ain't planted yet; way
it works is you get the contract from the winemaker and use the contract to
finance the development of the vines).  anything but a slam dunk, but i'm
going to work hard (and have fun) trying to make it happen.

it was great to see you in Oakland and thanks very much for the kind note.
you will always be an very dear friend and you can count on me showing up
on your doorstep soon.  give jessica a hug and a kiss.

all the best,
jeff

p.s. confidentially, and i know you'd never take it, but ken lay's been
throwing your name around quite a bit as the "top choice" for a FERC
position.  also, (and i'll tell you more when we get together), i was on a
panel in new york with dan fessler!  he was the same, though arguably a
beaten, dejected man, based on what he did to California.

agency and has been a member of the Nissan Team for past 6 months. As part
