Got as fatal error on you, so am resending!


Hello everyone.

First let me say how much I enjoyed meeting and working with you last
Saturday. I know how busy all of your lives are.  I appreciate the energy
you put into a long, beautiful weekend day you might have spent playing
with family and friends.  Thank you for the commitment you brought to the
entire day.  I appreciated the number and quality of questions, and your
engagement in class discussions.  I look forward to working with you again
next class, and beyond.

The remainder of this message concerns the impromptu exercise you will do
the morning of February 24, as well as a few reminders.  The message is
relatively long, so you might want to save or print it and read it when you
have time.

Before I get to our impromptu exercise for next week, I want to make a few
comments about impromptu speaking.  People give many more impromptu-type
speeches in their lifetimes than prepared speeches.  To cite one
researcher, Rick Isaacson states in his book, "Fundamentals of Impromptu
Speaking," that the average person gives more than 20 impromptu speeches
for every prepared speech.  That ratio is too high for many of you who give
business presentations regularly, but even you will give more "off the
cuff" speeches than prepared ones.  Being effective in impromptu speaking
also helps you organize and deliver answers to surprise questions you may
receive from superiors, clients, and others.  You chose a good exercise.

Now, a few words about topics.  Bring at least five, more if you feel like
it.  Remember to put them on individual slips of paper.  I plan to bring a
few myself, just to be sure we have a good assortment.

You might want to write one question or topic in each of five different
areas.  For instance, a standard business topic, like bank mergers, social
responsibility issues, or the business future of the Pacific Rim; a Haas
topic, like requirements, the availability of electives, or costs; a Bay
Area topic, like traffic, the environment, or bridge retrofits; a social
topic, like welfare, education, or abortion; a political issue, like
campaign reform, taxes, or immigration; etc. etc.  You might even want to
include a light topic, such as entertainment (perhaps asking what the Bay
Area's best restaurant is, or who will win the Academy Awards, or what rock
band is best).  Or brainstorm and come up with five from a similar area.
Just remember that you will be speaking on topics others give you, so be
kind.

You could just state the topic and let the speaker focus the speech, or you
could pose it as a question, such as: Should U.S. organizations offer
better family leave benefits?  Topics are OK, because they allow the
speaker to completely determine his or her own approach, though a question
helps the speaker focus.

We will break into four groups.  Each person will select three topics from
a "hat," and will choose one to speak on.  Generally with this type of
exercise, it is good to give the speaker a minute to think about the
speech, though many people choose not to take the entire minute.  Then the
speech itself should be 1 - 3 minutes - we will make the time limit more
specific on Feb. 24.

After each speech you will coach each other by providing constructive
critical feedback.  We should have time for everyone to give at least two
impromptu speeches.

I also want to say a few things about the final speech session in the
afternoon.  We will do eight speeches. take a break, do eight more, take
another break, and finish with eight speeches and course evaluations. We
will have a short coaching session after each speech, including comments
from me.

Also, please remember that I plan to start class right at nine, to give us
as much time for the impromptu exercise as possible, as well as to have
time for the opening exercise (which is a quick nonverbal game that is fun,
invigorating, and educational).  We also will spend a little time
discussing the articles I gave you.  For the most part, I want you to use
those articles to help you revise your prepared speeches, though the
articles also contain ideas we may want to discuss.

Finally, remember your blank video tapes!  I really do want you to contact
me after our second session.  This class is too short to devote enough time
to my fully commenting on your speaking abilities.  If you bring a video
tape on the 24th, we will video your final speech and we can go over the
video together at some later time convenient to you and me.  Even if you
choose not to video, we can still meet to discuss your final speech and
other exercises.  I want you to know that I am also available for other
communication advice after the completion of our class.

I look forward to seeing and working with you all on Saturday, February 24.
I will send you a short reminder to bring your topics and blank tape closer
to class day.

Bill
