By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published July 11, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- Midway through the negotiations between California and power=
=20
sellers to settle the myriad issues arising out of the state's energy crisi=
s,=20
the mediator told California's negotiating team that he thought a deal wort=
h=20
more than $4.5 billion would be appropriate -- a much higher figure than he=
=20
suggested after the talks ended Monday.=20
Whether the statement by Curtis Wagner, the chief administrative law judge=
=20
for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was a negotiating ploy or a=
=20
reflection of his evolving beliefs is not clear.=20
Before the settlement talks began two weeks earlier, Wagner said he thought=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a=
=20
settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.=20
The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway=20
through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge=
=20
let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal=
=20
should involve "hundreds of millions, maybe a billion" dollars.=20
While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges=
=20
during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope o=
f=20
review. Even as a starting point then, the $4.5 billion mentioned by Wagner=
=20
represented 75 percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged pri=
ce=20
gouging between October and May.=20
The judge's $4.5 billion figure, divided between cash payments and savings=
=20
from long-term power contracts, was confirmed by three sources who asked to=
=20
be identified only as "close to the negotiations" because participants had=
=20
been required to sign confidentiality statements.=20
The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July 2 meeting with Wagn=
er=20
in which the judge also dismissed as "inadequate" a $670 million settlement=
=20
offer made by power generators and marketers.=20
By Monday, the settlement offer had risen to $716 million. But the state=20
refused to back off its $8.9 billion demand, and there never was any seriou=
s=20
back-and-forth negotiations during the 15-day period the regulatory=20
commission had given Wagner to craft a deal.=20
As a consequence of the failed talks, Wagner said Monday that within a week=
=20
he will send the five-member commission his recommendations on how it might=
=20
approach an order refunding power overcharges.=20
Among Wagner's suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before =
a=20
different administrative judge to take testimony from generators, marketers=
=20
and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement.=20
The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the ti=
me=20
when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by abo=
ut=20
one-third -- and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a=20
formula more favored by generators.=20
It is not clear whether Wagner, who moved from one negotiating team to=20
another during his two-week quest for a deal, ever raised the $4.5 billion=
=20
settlement figure to the power marketers and generators.=20
Joel Newton, who represented Dynegy Power, Duke Energy, Reliant Energy,=20
Williams-AES and Mirant in the talks, said Tuesday he was bound by the=20
confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations.=20
Wagner also is refusing all media calls.=20
According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday,=
=20
Wagner was angry at the snail's pace of progress after the first week of th=
e=20
talks.=20
On Friday, June 29, Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolde=
d=20
them. He condemned the California team, saying they all ought to wear "clow=
n=20
suits" because they were "in the pocket" of Davis and refused to show any=
=20
independence.=20
He then turned to the generators and said that after a week of talks, nothi=
ng=20
had been heard from them. He told them he wanted them to produce "real=20
numbers, and hard numbers" over the weekend and that if they didn't, he wou=
ld=20
-- "and you're not going to like it."=20
Wagner's admonition apparently moved no one toward a deal. On Monday, in th=
e=20
meeting with the California delegation, one source quoted Wagner as saying=
=20
the settlement number he received from the generators and marketers "is so=
=20
low I can't even present it to you."=20
"I'm not happy with the figures, they're not adequate," others quoted the=
=20
judge as saying.=20
At that point, the sources said, Wagner said he was thinking of a settlemen=
t=20
of $2.5 billion in cash, $2 billion in long-term contract savings and other=
=20
money from out-of-state investor-owned utilities and even the federal=20
Bonneville Power Administration, which markets power from dams in the=20
Northwest.=20
But as the clock wound down on the negotiations, nothing much happened unti=
l=20
Friday and Saturday, when the California team met with the five largest pow=

generators.=20
It was at those meetings that the generators offered $510 million in refund=

to settle their disputes with the state. But the money would have gone to=

The Democratic governor also lobbed threats at state legislators, suggestin=

Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality contin=
ues


(Published July 11, 2001)=20
California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit:=20
The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than =
it=20
can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of=20
dollars to cover the debt.=20
There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's he=
at=20
truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners=20
demand more juice than California can generate or buy.=20
One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy=20
protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of=20
joining it.=20
There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin,=20
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becomin=
g=20
dominant, while the real situation fades into the background.=20
This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality=
=20
and everything to do with the virtual version.=20
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from t=
he=20
generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past=
=20
year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and rippe=
d=20
off." But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an=
=20
arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intend=
ed=20
for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealisti=
c,=20
Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity.=20
"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe=
 a=20
billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But=
=20
that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you=
=20
think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see=
=20
you in court," Davis said Tuesday.=20
Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since h=
e=20
began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off=20
California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for=
=20
substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple=
=20
of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be=20
embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as=

Missing megawatts: Conservation saving state from blackouts


(Published July 11, 2001)=20

A public that doesn't believe that California's electricity crisis is genui=
ne=20
is nonetheless acting as if it is. Experts are revising down scary=20
predictions of rolling blackout after rolling blackout as Californians have=
=20
opted to conserve rather than consume.=20
During June, Californians cut back on electricity use by roughly 4,750=20
megawatts when it mattered the most, on hot afternoons. Those decisions=20
shaved about 12 percent from the expected demand. That's equivalent to the=
=20
output of nine or 10 medium-size power plants. Last June, grid operators ha=

to call six shortage alerts. This June, which was hotter, they called none.=

For a state that's been derided as selfish and wasteful, that's nothing sho=

Some of what Californians are doing now to conserve isn't likely to become=

habit in the long run. Businesses may want to turn back on all the banks of=
=20
lights. Homeowners may decide that 82 degrees is the right temperature when=
=20
power is short but too warm when California's supply emergency is over.=20
Yet there's a huge potential payoff into the future if some of these change=
s=20
become permanent. It's encouraging that the most effective forms of=20
conservation -- switching to more energy-efficient appliances or=20
manufacturing techniques -- have yet to be implemented on a large scale.=20
Subsidies for these programs have yet to translate into changes in business=

and in homes that will lower demand even further.=20
For a while this spring, some attempted to diminish the role of conservatio=

Davis firm on demand for $8.9 billion refund
By Ed Mendel=20

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis had a tough message for federal regulators=20
yesterday after the failure of settlement talks in California's bid to get =
an=20
$8.9 billion refund from electricity suppliers: "See you in court."=20
The governor said California will seek a full $8.9 billion refund for=20
electricity overcharges, even if federal regulators award the maximum refun=
d=20
of $5.4 billion allowed under their guidelines.=20
"Our message is just order what you are going to order," Davis said of the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "We believe you should order $8.9=20
billion. But you order what you think is fair. We will take what you order,=
=20
then we will see you in court."=20
Davis, joined by his negotiating team, made the remarks at a news conferenc=
e=20
a day after two weeks of closed-door talks with suppliers in Washington=20
failed to reach an agreement.=20
An administrative law judge made a recommendation to the regulatory=20
commission that Davis' top negotiator, Michael Kahn, chairman of the=20
California Independent System Operator, expects to result in a refund of mo=
re=20
than $1 billion.=20
Davis said that a revealing decision will be made by the commission, which =

hopes has embarked on a "new path" with the appointment by President Bush o=
f=20
two new members, Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.=20
"Are they on the side of consumers, as the federal power act envisions them=
=20
being," Davis asked, "or are they just there to do the industry's bidding, =
as=20
they have so often in the past?"=20
Kahn said rules adopted by FERC cut off the refund period at last October,=
=20
trimming $3 billion from the $8.9 billion overcharge claimed by California=
=20
dating to May 2000.=20
He said FERC has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities, such as the Los=
=20
Angeles Department of Water and Power, that sold power to the state. The=20
municipal districts overcharged the state by about $600 million, according =
to=20
Kahn.=20
As a result, he said, the maximum refund that FERC could order for Californ=
ia=20
is about $5.4 billion.=20
"We made it clear to everyone that if we did not settle for $8.9 billion, w=
e=20
would seek redress in court for the remainder of the money above $5.4=20

"We obviously disagree with that number, because we disagree with some of t=

=20
"We don't think it's anywhere near that. We think it's a low number."=20
He wouldn't specify the company's counteroffer, but noted new FERC figures=
=20
showing the company did $29 million in business with the state in the first=

five months of this year.=20
The California Independent System Operator estimated the company owed more =

The ISO essentially multiplied what Calpine was able to produce by the amou=

much electricity the company actually sold.=20
ISO spokesman Michael Bustamante defended the projections by the state's gr=

July 11 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a=
=20
ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and=
=20
denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could=20
prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges.

Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers=20
committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not=
=20
creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6.

But Montali criticized "misguided remarks" by a committee attorney on July =
5=20
and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the repor=
ts=20
left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would=
=20
reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds.

The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving=
=20
PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission.

State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californian=
s=20
by energy companies since last year.

The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and=
=20
customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims b=
y=20
a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said.

The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee=
=20
Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among=20
PG&E's 5.5 million customers.

He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the=20
erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites.

Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and=20
consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11=
=20
reorganization.

But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under=20
bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to=
=20
participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.

Stanley said she has not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling to federa=

At the same time, the Bush administration signaled its willingness Tuesday =

in the federal corporate automobile fuel economy, or CAFE, standard.=20
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Congress to lift immediately a=

CAFE standards, which mandate fuel economy requirements for vehicle fleets,=
=20

=20
spurred by energy shortages in the early 1970s, required passengers cars to=
=20
meet a fleet average of at least 27.5 miles per gallon. Light trucks -- a=
=20
category that includes SUVs, vans and pickups -- have to meet a 20.7 mpg=20
fleet average.=20
With the widespread popularity of SUVs and vans in recent years, many=20
environmentalists have argued that the lower truck standard has compromised=
=20
the intent of the 1975 law. SUVs and vans comprise more than 40 percent of=

the passenger vehicles on the road today.=20
As three committees began crafting energy legislation, lawmakers were=20

for motor vehicles. Some increase in the CAFE requirement was virtually=20

Davis ups the voltage=20
Published Wednesday, July 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News=20
Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff, but he should keep pushing FERC=20
THE strategic choice facing Gov. Gray Davis in the struggle over electricit=
y=20
price refunds has come down to three questions: When do you negotiate, when=
=20
do you demand, and when do you bluff?=20
Negotiations are over, Davis declared Tuesday. He demanded that the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now. ``The case is nearly a year=
=20
old,'' he said. ``They have to decide which side they're on.''=20
Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also=
=20
said, ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refund=
s,=20
we will see you in court.''=20
A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may b=
e=20
around $1 billion, or perhaps nothing at all, when counter-claims against t=
he=20
state are subtracted.=20
Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to=20
overturn a decision by a federal commission. The federal courts have some=
=20
limited jurisdiction, according to University of California Energy Institut=
e=20
director Severin Borenstein, but that a court would reverse a commission in=
 a=20
case like this is ``extremely unlikely.''=20
Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, had the opposite view, when asked whethe=
r=20
the state has a good chance of winning: ``I think so. It happens all the=20
time.''=20
At a Sacramento press conference, Davis continued to insist that there have=
=20
been overcharges of $8.9 billion. But other state officials conceded that=
=20
only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.=
=20
Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.=20
The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices hav=
e=20
not met the Federal Power Act's requirement to be ``just and reasonable,''=
=20
refunds are in order. But the commission has not defined what portion=20
exceeded ``just and reasonable.''=20
Throughout his press conference, Davis used the prospect of litigation like=
 a=20
goad to spur the federal regulators into action. But if you listened=20
carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case=
.=20
Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading t=
he=20
federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need.









Wednesday, July 11, 2001=20






Lights go out on Davis' power show=20
Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being=20
applied to California's electricity crisis:=20
First, "The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed=
=20
maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9=
=20
billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis," reported the Register yesterday. Even=
=20
that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes=
=20
the power producers.=20




To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California=20
electricity crisis.

Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state=
=20
of California.=20
Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant=
=20
the "refunds," the state probably will go to court, where the matter could =
be=20
stuck for years.
"In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a=20
future even in California, but not thanks to the state," Robert Michaels, a=
=20
professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to t=
he=20
state's botched 1996 "deregulation" effort, which has been made worse by Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago.
"FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of politica=
l=20
reality," Mr. Michaels added. "Now we're at square one: The industry doesn'=
t=20
owe $9 billion to California." As this process continues, he said, another=
=20
positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. "We'll see what=
=20
has been happening in the markets" in which power is bought and sold.
Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not "Made in=
=20
Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats hav=
e=20
been contending.=20
In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring "the greed of thes=
e=20
Texas energy companies," such as Reliant and Dynergy.
In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor=20
finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of=20
producers.=20
"In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2=
=20
billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for=20
electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hyd=
ro=20
in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angel=
es=20
Department of Water and Power," reported the San Jose Mercury News.
Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from=20
companies with headquarters in Texas.
Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be=
=20
done next:=20
lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.=20
This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys th=
e=20
electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (pai=
d=20
by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.=
=20
Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leadin=
g=20
in time to lower prices.
lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to=20
off-peak hours.=20
lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.=20
Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before=20
"deregulation." Gov. Davis should set the pace by ending his Clintonian bla=
me=20
shifting and embracing these realistic solutions.=20
