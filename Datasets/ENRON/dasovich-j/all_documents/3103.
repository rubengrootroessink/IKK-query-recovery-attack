the trooper started to lecture the farmer about his speed, and in general 
began to throw his weight around to try to make the farmer uncomfortable. 

Finally, the trooper got around to writing out the ticket, and as he was 
doing that he kept swatting at some flies that were buzzing

around his head.? The farmer said, "Having some problems with circle flies 
there, are ya?" 
The trooper stopped writing the ticket and said- "Well yeah, if that's what 
they are-I never heard of circle? flies."
So the farmer says-"Well, circle flies are common on farms. See,? they're 
called circle flies because they're almost always

found circling around the back end of a horse." 
The trooper says, "Oh," and goes back to writing the ticket. Then after a 
minute he stops and says, "Hey...wait a minute, are you

trying to call me a horses ass?" 
The farmer says, "Oh no, officer. I have too much respect for law enforcement 
and police officers to even think about calling you

a horses ass." 
The trooper says, "Well, that's a good thing," and goes? back to writing the 
ticket. 
After a long pause, the farmer says, "Hard to fool them flies though."
