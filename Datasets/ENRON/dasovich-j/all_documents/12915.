Amazon.com expands Toys R Us relationship

A revamped Babiesrus.com Web site will reportedly launch this
week as part of a widening relationship between Amazon.com and
Toys R Us . The new children's products retail Web site will
include a baby shower registry, a spokeswoman for Amazon.com told
the Seattle Times. The Babiesrus.com effort comes almost nine
months after the two companies agreed to a 10-year deal under
which Toys R Us handles the inventory and Amazon.com does the
site and order fulfillment on the Toysrus.com Web site. "I think
it's (clear) that the alliance is working," said Jeanne Myer,
Toys R Us vice president of corporate communications.

Web grocers' problem is obvious

You can't blame someone at Peapod or Webvan for watching gasoline
costs. The expense of making home deliveries is sky high,
according to senior analyst Ken Cassar at Jupiter Media Metrix .
He calculates Webvan and Peapod spend $27 to process each order
and two-thirds of the expense is for delivery. "Given the current
low level of consumer demand, delivery costs are breaking the
backs of online-only grocery retailers," Cassar wrote in a
report.

Internet radio listening rises

MeasureCast Inc. reported Tuesday a 14% increase in Web radio
usage during the week of May 14-20. The research company's index
shows consumption of Web radio has risen almost 50% since the
start of the year. Broadcasters with strong weeks included
ClickLive's WLIR-FM, which doubled the number of hours streamed,
CableMusic Network's Hot 100, which had a 97% increase, and
KNIK-FM, streamed through WarpRadio, which notched a 66% gain in
time spent listening.

at the Salt Lake City Olympics are drawing bids for thousands of

the Games' organizing committee. The auction continues for two
weeks, offering 100 front-row tickets to 11 events. If the
