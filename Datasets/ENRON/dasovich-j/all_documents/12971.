If Morrow would only think for himself (instead of trying to anticipate what
his Sempra-masters think), he would understand your comments better.  I gave
SoCalGas a hardball because they refuse to deal with our concerns in a
pragmatic way.  I'm trying to convince them that it is better to reach
accommodations with PG&E outside of the public arena and that failure to do
so only makes things more difficult for them. Plus, I wanted the
Commissioner's to see some passion.  Too many of the speakers were
bloodless, despite their good points, and it went over the heads of the
Commissioners.  The Commissioner's want sound bites, so you have to give it
to them.  I offered to help on the CSA behind the scenes if the Commission
goes the alternate route to Day and Lorenz .

And I'm having a great time.

Rick Morrow was very unhappy with it, which in some ways surprised me.
Man, you were loaded for bear!  The points you made came off very
compelling.  You enjoying the new role?
