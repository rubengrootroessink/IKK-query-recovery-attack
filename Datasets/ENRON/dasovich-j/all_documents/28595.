HEADLINE: Davis firm on demand for $8.9 billion refund

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Gov. Gray Davis had a tough message for federal regulators yesterday after
the failure of settlement talks in California's bid to get an $8.9 billion
refund from electricity suppliers: ''See you in court.''

??The governor said California will seek a full $8.9 billion refund for
electricity overcharges, even if federal regulators award the maximum refund 
of
$5.4 billion allowed under their guidelines.

??''Our message is just order what you are going to order,'' Davis said of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ''We believe you should order $8.9
billion. But you order what you think is fair. We will take what you order, 
then
we will see you in court.''

??Davis, joined by his negotiating team, made the remarks at a news conference
a day after two weeks of closed-door talks with suppliers in Washington failed
to reach an agreement.

??An administrative law judge made a recommendation to the regulatory
commission that Davis' top negotiator, Michael Kahn, chairman of the 
California
Independent System Operator, expects to result in a refund of more than $1
billion.

??Davis said that a revealing decision will be made by the commission, which 
he
hopes has embarked on a ''new path'' with the appointment by President Bush of
two new members, Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.

??''Are they on the side of consumers, as the federal power act envisions them
being,'' Davis asked, ''or are they just there to do the industry's bidding, 
as
they have so often in the past?''

??Kahn said rules adopted by FERC cut off the refund period at last October,
trimming $3 billion from the $8.9 billion overcharge claimed by California
dating to May 2000.

??He said FERC has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities, such as the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power, that sold power to the state. The
municipal districts overcharged the state by about $600 million, according to
Kahn.

??As a result, he said, the maximum refund that FERC could order for 
California
is about $5.4 billion.

??''We made it clear to everyone that if we did not settle for $8.9 billion, 
we
would seek redress in court for the remainder of the money above $5.4 
billion,''
Kahn said.

??Calpine of San Jose and several other generators have expressed interest in
the state's offer to negotiate one-on-one with the state while the federal
regulators consider their decision, Kahn said.

Referee Shift Seen in Refund Talks;
Power: Participants say mediator was swayed by arguments that California
estimates were based on faulty analysis.

BYLINE: RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??For the better part of 15 days of closed-door negotiations, the federal
mediator in California's price-gouging case bandied about the possible
dimensions of a settlement.

??Curtis L. Wagner Jr. went as high as $4.5 billion, fully half of what
California said it had been overcharged by out-of-state electricity suppliers.

??But Wagner got no takers for that figure. And in the end, when talks ended
Monday with no deal between the state and the energy generators, he said
publicly that $1 billion was closer to the truth.

??Participants in the talks, speaking on condition that they would not be
identified, said Wagner appeared to have been persuaded by the power suppliers
that California's $8.9-billion overcharge estimate was based on unreliable
economic analysis.

??The state's analysis "is fatally flawed and cannot be used to . . . 
determine
overcharges or refunds," William Tabors, an MIT economist retained by one of 
the
companies, said in an affidavit that is part of a transcript released by the
judge.

??"I certainly think Tabors was very persuasive," said an industry lawyer.

??By contrast, at another point, Wagner questioned whether California
regulatory agencies were truly independent of Gov. Gray Davis, saying their
representatives to the talks might as well put on "clown suits."

??Now the issue is about to move to the governing board of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, which had given Wagner the job of trying to broker a
settlement. The California side will have one more chance to make its case. 
But
it will have to go back to its spreadsheets and generate numbers that can
withstand scrutiny.

??Wagner is to send his formal recommendation to the FERC board in a week, and
the board is expected to hold a hearing on how to calculate a refund before
finally deciding whether California is owed one.

??California's delegation was disappointed by what it perceived as a shift in
the mediator's sentiments during the two weeks of talks. "For [Wagner] to do
what he did was a 180-degree turn," said a participant familiar with the
delegation.

??Clues to the arguments that swayed the judge can be found in a transcript he
released of this Sunday's session, the only portion of the deliberations that
has been made public.

??During his public comments at the end of the talks Monday, Wagner echoed 
some
of the technical points that Tabors, the industry economist from MIT, made in
the transcript.

??California's delegation was headed by San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn,
chairman of Cal-ISO, the California Independent Systems Operator, which runs 
the
state's electricity grid. An industry lawyer said the decision to have Kahn, 
who
is a political supporter of the governor but who has no experience with FERC,
head the delegation may have hurt the state.

??But a source close to the Californians said Kahn was an effective leader. 
"We
were better served by the fact that we didn't have a FERC lawyer," said the
source.

??At the end of the first week of negotiations, Wagner delivered a
tongue-lashing to all sides, questioning the political independence of the
Californians but also growling at the generators. He warned the companies that
they might be ordered to refund "substantially more" than $2 billion.

??On July 2, Wagner told the California delegation he was disappointed with 
the
offers he had received from the generators. Later, he revealed they added up 
to
$670 million. That total rose only $46 million by the conclusion of the
negotiations.

??The next day, Wagner floated a possible deal: $2.5 billion in cash payments
and $2 billion in discounts on long-term power contracts.

??The Californians were intrigued. "When you're talking about $4.5 billion,
you've got to sit down and start thinking about it," said a source close to 
the
delegation.

??An industry participant sized it up differently. "That proposal was floated
out one day and never really went anywhere," he said. "No one seemed
interested."

??From there the talks bounced up and down before finally ending on a 
decidedly
down note.

??On Sunday, Wagner scheduled a session to go over once more how California 
had
estimated that it had been overcharged by $8.9 billion. Once again, he came 
away
unconvinced. But this time there was no next time: On Monday, Wagner ended the
talks and prepared to make his recommendation to the FERC board.

Calpine to Buy More Natural Gas Reserves;
Energy: The power producer is set to purchase wells in Texas and New Mexico 
for
$355 million plus debt.

BYLINE: From Bloomberg News

BODY:

??California power producer Calpine Corp. on Tuesday agreed to buy 236 billion
cubic feet of natural gas reserves in Texas and New Mexico for $355 million in
cash and $49.5 million in assumed debt to boost reserves of the fuel it uses 
to
generate electricity.

??San Jose-based Calpine agreed to purchase 35 wells that produce 6 million
cubic feet of gas a day in New Mexico's San Juan Basin from closely held 
Bayless
Cos.

??It also agreed to buy a majority interest in Houston-based Michael 
Petroleum,
which produces 43 million cubic feet of gas a day in south Texas, from Carrizo
Oil & Gas Inc.

??The purchases increase Calpine's gas reserves to about 1.5 trillion cubic
feet, spokeswoman Katherine Potter said.

??The company, a large seller of electricity in California, has been buying 
gas
reserves to protect itself from price increases. The average price of 
California
gas has more than tripled so far this year from a year ago.

??Potter declined to comment on the price of each transaction or to provide
other details.

??Calpine has bought three Canadian gas producers in the last nine months. It
agreed in February to buy Encal Energy Ltd. for about $1 billion in stock, 
more
than doubling its gas reserves.

??In November, it bought TriGas Exploration Inc. for $103 million. In January,
it bought closely held Quintana Minerals Canada Corp. for $97.6 million.

??Calpine said in April it's considering buying gas-producing properties in
western Canada and offshore Nova Scotia.

??With the purchases, Calpine is meeting its goal of owning 25% of the gas it
needs to produce electricity, the company said. Calpine is running or
constructing enough power plants to light about 41.2 million U.S. homes.

??It expects to supply energy to 70 million homes by the end of 2005, the
company said.

??Shares of Calpine rose $1.39 to close at $45.34 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have risen 30% in the last year.

Edison's Finances Fare Better;
Energy: After selling some assets, the company appears to be back on track. 
But
it says the future of its utility is in the Legislature's hands.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

??Ailing Edison International will have $46 million cash in hand by year's end
thanks to a series of financial transactions and asset sales the 
Rosemead-based
power company has undertaken in the last month, company executives said 
Tuesday.

??Although the actions--which include a massive refinancing of bank loans and
bonds, the sale of land and a home security company--will stabilize Edison
International, the future of its Southern California Edison utility remains
precarious, officials said.

??In a conference call with creditors that are owed nearly $1 billion by SCE,
Theodore Craver Jr., Edison's chief financial officer, said the fate of the
utility is largely in the hands of a state Legislature that appears reluctant 
to
take action on a rescue plan worked out by Gov. Gray Davis. ?

??The agreement between Davis and Edison gives the Legislature until Aug. 15 
to
approve the deal. However, some lawmakers have said that's an arbitrary date 
and
that the deadline could be extended.

??The Legislature is scheduled to recess July 20.

??One factor complicating efforts to rescue the utility is the recent failure
in settlement talks between the state and power generators. In a hearing 
before
a federal administrative law judge in Washington, state officials and power
generators argued over $8.9 million in disputed charges without reaching an
agreement.

??Settling the dispute may take months, and the judge indicated Monday that
California probably will recoup less than $1 billion.

??"The delay doesn't help the odds of getting the Legislature to move," said
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "A big refund in 
hand
would have made things simpler for the Legislature."

??The agreement with Davis calls for the state to purchase SCE's transmission
lines for $2.8 billion and for SCE to issue bonds to repay as much as $3.5
billion in debts that accrued from selling power at a loss when prices spiked.
The bonds would be paid off by a rate increase.

??During the conference call Tuesday, several creditors expressed concern over
the lack of legislative movement on the utility's rescue plan. SCE is making
only interest payments to the creditors, which hold $931 million in defaulted
bonds and notes.

??One creditor asked whether SCE would file for bankruptcy if the Legislature
fails to take action by the August deadline.

??"We are not prepared to state what we would do," Craver responded.

??However, he noted that the utility let pass an earlier deadline for the
California Public Utilities Commission to approve aspects of the agreement. 
The
commission has since addressed most of the issues.

??He said SCE still believes that a bankruptcy would make solving the 
utility's
financial problems more complicated.

??The next significant date after the August deadline is Sept. 15, when $200
million in bank loans come due.

??On Tuesday, Edison International's shares closed up 5 cents at $14.05 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen about 21% over the last five
trading days.



??Recharged

??A debt refinancing and the sale of its home security business and other
assets have helped stabilize the finances of Edison International, sparking a
rally in its stock, which has gained nearly 21% over the last five trading 
days
on the New York Stock Exchange.

DATELINE: MOJAVE, Calif.

BODY:

??The shepherd was deep in the desert, eight miles from the nearest road and
more than four miles of rocky brush past the closest sign of civilization, a
landfill. It was midafternoon, 110 degrees, and the 500 sheep he tends 24 
hours
a day, seven days a week were sleeping. But with nothing else to do, he was
watching them anyway, pacing the parched earth with two panting border collies
by his side.

??Two years and eight months into a three-year contract as a shepherd under a
federal guest worker program, the 40-year-old Peruvian said he was still 
waiting
for a day off. He lives in a 6-by-12-foot trailer with no running water, no
electricity, no phone, no toilet.

???"This is my bathroom," he says with a toothy smile, holding up a
long-handled garden shovel.

??The man, who would not let his name be used for fear of angering his
employer, is typical of shepherds in the United States, about 800 of whom toil
in California. Mostly from Peru and Chile, they live isolated, nomadic
existences here, dependent upon their employers for food, mail and all contact
with the outside world.

??Aside from tinny radios or tiny televisions that some keep in their 
trailers,
they live much as shepherd have always lived, in the middle of nowhere with no
human contact save for when their bosses come to move the trailer to a new
grazing spot or bring their weekly rations of food and water.

??In the universe of migrant farm labor, shepherds make up the tiniest sliver
and are so invisible that with a few exceptions they have had no advocates to
call for reform.

??As federal guest workers, they are brought here because their employers, the
sheep ranchers, could find no Americans willing to be shepherd, even here in
California's farm belt, where unemployment in some counties is over 15 
percent.

??That may be not only because their living conditions make migrant farm
workers seem pampered, but also because under a quirk in federal labor laws,
shepherds are excluded from minimum wage regulations. Until July 1, when
California's Industrial Welfare Commission, which regulates working 
conditions,
ordered sheep ranchers to increase herders' wages by $150 a month, shepherds,
who are essentially on duty 90 hours a week, made $900 a month.

??Still, shepherds in California, the largest sheep ranching state after 
Texas,
are the lucky ones. They make the most money. In other states, the pay is $600
to $800 a month.

??Shepherds are also on the legislative map. When the state Industrial Welfare
Commission refused to set working conditions for shepherds, such as overtime 
pay
and rest periods, State Assemblyman Paul Koretz, a Democrat from West 
Hollywood,
drafted a bill that would require rest periods and basic amenities, such as
toilets, lighting, water and regular access to phones.

??The bill, which has passed the Assembly and is expected to be reviewed by a
State Senate committee today, would require shepherds to be given a 30-minute
meal break in a five-hour work period if someone is available to relieve them.
It would also require employers to provide housing that includes toilets,
heating, lighting, water, stoves and refrigerators.

??"It's logical that at some point their conditions would have to change from
the days of the Old Testament," Mr. Koretz said. "I'm generally trying to 
bring
them up to the 20th century."

??But passage of Mr. Koretz's bill is in no way assured. Ranchers vehemently
deny that shepherds are mistreated, and lobbyists for the sheep ranching
industry say that new regulations would kill an ailing industry.

??Over the last 20 years, sheep ranchers have seen their profits steadily
erode. In 1999, California ranchers made 35 cents a pound for wool, 30 cents
less than in 1994. Lamb meat wholesales for 82 cents to 83 cents a pound. In
1997, it was 91.6 cents.

??With the erosion of profits, the herd in the state has steadily declined.
From 1994 to 2001, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, 
the
number of sheep produced in California dropped by a third, to 840,000, and the
number of farms with sheep has dropped by 45 percent.

??Officials of the Western Range Association, a lobbying organization
representing ranchers in 11 states, did not respond to calls seeking comment.
But in an article in The Fresno Bee, James Holt, an agricultural economist 
with
the association, said the sheep ranchers had been trying to make it clear to
legislators that the money to pay for any added benefits or amenities to 
herders
is simply "not there."

??"We've tried to be responsible and responsive" to shepherds, Mr. Holt said.

??Dennis Hollingsworth, a Republican assemblyman from Temecula who voted
against the bill, said he thought it would do more harm than good. The
shepherds, he said, do not really need rest periods.

??"Most of the time they are resting, unless there is a danger," he said. 
"Most
of the time, it's just watching the flock."

??Mr. Hollingsworth added that the impact of the bill "will not be better 
wages
or working conditions for sheepherders. The impact will be that wool growers
will leave this state and there will be less jobs for sheepherders to have in
California."

??Mr. Koretz said that he was trying to be sensitive to the industry, and that
if necessary, he would moderate his bill so it could land on Gov. Gray 
Davis's 
desk and be assured his signature. But a small, persistent group of advocates
for the shepherds say that modest goals for shepherds should not be 
compromised.

??"We're not asking for Jacuzzis," said Chris Schneider, executive director of
Central California Legal Services and a crusader for improved conditions for
sheepherders for over a decade. "When an industry is going through a low 
period,
we don't lower the minimum wage or say it could force their workers to work
without getting paid."

??Last year, the Fresno-based legal aid group published a report on the
conditions of 41 shepherds in the lower Central Valley counties of Fresno and
Kern, which contain most of the sheep ranches in the state, and found that 90
percent of the shepherds had never had a day off and more than 95 percent had 
no
toilets. The report also said that many shepherds were not allowed visitors, 
and
that they were threatened with deportation if they asked for such things as 
more
food or clean water containers.

??One former shepherd, Victor Flores, said he was dumped at a motel in
Bakersfield when he asked his employer for more food. He said he was forced to
take another job, as a dishwasher, and now, seven years later, works in a 
fruit
packinghouse. He has formed an advocacy group, the Sheepherders Union, which
documents the conditions and experiences of the shepherds.

??"I never thought when I came here from Peru that this country would treat
people as less than human," he said.

??Ranchers say that the shepherds are paid much more than they would be making
in their native countries, an argument that rankles those fighting for 
improved
conditions.

??"When someone comes to this country, we don't take their native country into
consideration in how we treat them or pay them," Mr. Schneider said.

??There is no denying that the shepherds live primitively. Visits to shepherds
in Fresno and Kern Counties -- where finding just four herders took two days
because of their remote locations -- found them in very old, dilapidated
trailers, full of flies and mosquitoes. One shepherd had a plastic water 
barrel
that was clearly full of fungi and smelled of rotted meat. One was spending a
113-degree afternoon in his 110-degree trailer, waiting for the sun to set so 
he
could spend several hours putting up temporary fences to contain his sheep. 
All
their dogs stayed in holes they had dug under the trailers to avoid the
blistering heat.

??The shepherd found in the Mojave Desert, the most remote location of any
shepherd interviewed, will be moved in October during what is called the 
lambing
season, to farmland outside of Bakersfield.

??He said he looked forward to it, despite the backbreaking 13-hour days of
caring for newborn lambs and their mothers, because then he has greater 
contact
with the outside world. Two or three shepherds work together and occasionally 
go
to stores to get supplies for the sheep.

??"I get depressed here very often," he said.

??But he also considers himself fortunate. Once a week, a kindly man he met
when he was stationed near Bakersfield during the six-month lambing season
brings him a newspaper. And his employer comes to check on him every other 
day.
Many shepherds do not see their bosses for a week or two, when they bring
supplies. A few weeks ago, his employer replaced the shabby 6-by-8-foot wooden
trailer he was living in with a newer, 6-by-12-foot one that has seating 
besides
a bed.

??And while he has never seen a movie, eaten at a restaurant, attended a 
church
service or even spent a free hour walking around the one city in the United
States he has glimpsed, Bakersfield, he said he would renew his contract and 
do
the work for another three years.

??"My sons are 11 and 12 and I want the best for them," he said. "That's what 
I
keep remembering all the time while I'm here."

HEADLINE: Governor threatens to sue utilities for refunds;

Davis says California won't settle for $1 billion

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Mark Martin

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
One day after a federal judge rebuked California's claim that energy 
generators
owe the state $8.9 billion, Gov. Gray Davis all but vowed to sue the companies
to recoup the money.

???"If you think California will settle for $1 billion in refunds, we'll see
you in court," Davis said yesterday.

???Continuing his heated rhetoric on the energy crisis, Davis blasted the
energy companies for being inflexible during a 14-day negotiation session in
Washington, D.C., that ended Monday. Both the state and power generators argue
each is owed money as a result of California's dysfunctional electricity 
market.

???Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis
L. Wagner ended the talks by saying the state was owed far less than it 
claimed,
but the FERC's governing board will make a final decision on who owes what to
whom in the coming months.

???Yesterday, Davis made it clear he wouldn't accept a FERC decision that
strayed far from the state's calculations that power companies overcharged
California nearly $9 billion.

???"The ball is in the FERC's court," he said. "They must step up and provide
the refunds we've asked for."

???While Davis said California officials had gone to Washington prepared to
discuss ways to reach a settlement, including renegotiating long-term 
contracts
to buy power, an energy industry official faulted the state for its
unwillingness to compromise.

???Generators put forward an offer even though they believe no refunds are
owed, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy 
Producers.

???Smutny-Jones said the state needed to stop thinking it would get the $8.9
billion.

???"It's clear from the way the issue was characterized by the judge that $9
billion is not something the state is going to see any time in the near 
future,"
he added. "It is not based in reality."

???Davis also took heat from Republicans yesterday.

???"He desperately needs that refund, so he can renegotiate the dreadful
contracts he has entered into," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant for the
California Republican Party. "He's sitting at the poker table with very few
chips."

???In other energy news yesterday, a judge refused to let a committee 
represent
the public in the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. bankruptcy case and said a 
consumer
lawyer's "irresponsible position" at a hearing last week could mislead PG&E
customers into filing needless refund claims with the court.

???U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said any refunds owed to customers 
were
unrelated to the bankruptcy case and would be determined by regulators.

???At the hearing Thursday, attorney KaarenThomas argued that unless a
committee represented customers' interests, PG&E could try to bar all refund
claims that weren't filed by Sept. 5.

???Montali ruled in May that the committee was not authorized by federal
bankruptcy law, and reaffirmed his ruling yesterday.

HEADLINE: GOP Speeds Action on Limited Energy Bills

BYLINE: Peter Behr and Mike Allen, Washington Post Staff Writers

BODY:


???House Republican leaders yesterday began a hurried campaign to pass a
package of energy measures before Congress's summer recess begins in three
weeks, but left many key issues on the sidelines because of differences with
Democrats and a lack of clear policy signals from the Bush administration.

???A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee is scheduled to begin voting this
week on a scaled-back legislative proposal that would increase federal 
subsidies
for cleaner coal-burning technology, help more low-income households winterize
homes and pay energy bills, and call for more energy-efficient television 
sets.

???But a much longer list of high-priority measures, including many in
President Bush's energy plan, are stalled or tangled by divisions within the
energy industry or between the industry and environmental critics. The delays
could threaten action on the energy production and transmission problems cited
by the administration eight weeks ago when it unveiled its program to address
what it said was a looming national energy crisis.

???"Whatever momentum there is [for comprehensive energy legislation] is
dissipating by the day," said Randall E. Davis, a Washington attorney who was 
a
White House energy policy adviser in the Reagan administration.

???Bush administration officials are finishing legislative proposals to deal
with challenges to the nation's electricity system, including siting of new
power lines, transmission network reliability and the future of retail
electricity deregulation. White House aides say the complexity of these energy
problems takes time to resolve.

???"If we were to rush through these things, you'd be asking, 'Don't these
issues require more deliberation?' " said Dan Bartlett, deputy assistant to 
the
president.

???The test for the president, however, is whether the window of opportunity
for enacting major energy legislation will close this summer or fall before 
the
administration can weigh in -- and how much leverage Bush can exert on the
politically charged issue.

???"If you don't have the White House exerting leadership, I don't see where 
it
comes from," Davis said.

???In the face of polls suggesting that energy is becoming a political
liability for the Republicans, the House GOP leadership has decided to push a
first round of energy legislation forward on a fast track without waiting for
the White House, aiming for votes on a package before the Aug. 4 congressional
recess.

???Senate Democratic leaders say it will take most of the fall to find
agreements on an energy plan that can win approval.

???Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), the House Energy and Commerce Committee
chairman, acknowledged yesterday that the bipartisan bill he and other 
committee
members were introducing this week left a small footprint, although he called 
it
"a good first step."

???"It does not do everything that everyone wants at this time," Tauzin said.
"Energy issues are never easily addressed," he continued, but the nation's
energy challenges require action now.

???The GOP strategy is to report different energy bills from three or four
committees, including Commerce, Ways and Means, and Resources, and to bring 
them
to the House floor this month under the direction of House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay (R-Tex.).

???In addition to the Commerce bill, the other initiatives include opening the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and other federal lands to oil and 
gas
drilling, and tax incentives and credits for coal-fired power plants and
conservation.

???Some lawmakers said that compromise agreements on new conservation
initiatives are possible, but will take time, and therefore should not be
rushed. For now, however, the limited bill introduced in the Commerce 
Committee
yesterday represents the extent of Republican and Democratic agreement on 
energy
issues, legislators said.

???As the debate unfolds this month, the parties' more numerous differences on
energy will be highlighted.

???At a news conference today, for example, Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton
and GOP congressional leaders will begin the campaign to open the Arctic 
refuge
to drilling. One of Bush's top priorities, it is opposed by most congressional
Democrats.

???Democrats on Tauzin's committee will look for opportunities in the next few
weeks to focus attention on one of their key issues, California's energy 
crisis.
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (Calif.) and other House Democrats hope to force a vote 
on
a measure Republican leaders oppose that would order federal regulators to
impose tighter price controls on California electricity sales.

???Other energy issues that appear adrift are proposals to increase the fuel
efficiency of automobiles, particularly gas-eating sport-utility vehicles;
renewal of comprehensive liability insurance for nuclear plant operations;
possible repeal of a 1935 law restricting power company mergers; and whether 
to
rewrite clean air rules for power plants and refineries.

???Several administration officials professed to be mystified by congressional
criticism. They said more than a dozen administration officials have held five
energy meetings on Capitol Hill in the past five days, and Bush plans to 
address
energy, among other subjects, when he meets with the House Republican 
Conference
this morning.

???"Implementing the president's energy strategy is more important now than
ever," said Jim Wilkinson, a White House communications official. "Consumers 
are
still vulnerable to wild fluctuations in prices. We've got to make sure that
next summer and the summer after that are better than this summer was."

HEADLINE: Texas to Avoid California Electricity Shortage; New Customer 
Brochure
Explains Differences in the Texas and California Electricity Markets

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Texas, July 10, 2001

BODY:


??The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) and Texas Electric Choice
announced today the availability of an educational brochure that explains why
Texas will not experience California-style blackouts and electricity price
spikes.

??Titled "Texas is Different from California," the brochure informs electric 
customers that the lights will stay on in Texas because we have plenty of 
power
reserves, diverse sources of power and a strong infrastructure to support
competition.

??"Texas is implementing competition before deregulation to ensure that we get
it right," said PUC Commissioner Brett Perlman. "In other parts of the 
country,
there are legitimate causes for concern about the energy infrastructure. But
Texas has a strong infrastructure to meet our needs for electricity, even 
during
a hot Texas summer."

??Many areas of the United States have experienced strong economic growth in
recent years. Questions are being raised about the supply of electricity
primarily because new infrastructure to produce and deliver electricity has 
not
kept pace with the new homes and businesses that use electricity in our 
growing
economy. In Texas, new power plants have been built to supply electricity for
our growing economy. Texas has also structured the competitive market to
encourage competition among Retail Electric Providers (REP) and given them the
tools to offer stable prices to customers.

??The brochure explains that Texas has plenty of power to keep up with the
rising demand for electricity. More than 50 new power plants have been built 
or
are currently under construction in Texas since 1995 and 31 more are in the
planning stages. California, on the other hand, has built only two power 
plants
since 1995. Texas gets its power from diverse sources, whereas California 
relies
on hydroelectric power for 25 percent of its electricity needs. Therefore,
during dry conditions, California is susceptible to electricity shortages.

??In 1999, the Texas Legislature passed a law that introduces retail
competition in electricity beginning in January 2002. This law gives Texans 
the
power to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP) -- the company that provides
their electricity. Customers of Texas' investor-owned utilities will be able 
to
shop for a REP -- giving Texans more control over their electricity buying
decision. The PUC will continue to enforce customer protections and regulate 
the
delivery of electric service to ensure safety and reliability.

??To obtain a copy of the "Texas is Different than California" brochure, or 
for
additional information about Texas Electric Choice, customers may contact the
Texas Electric Choice answer center toll free at 1-866-PWR-4-TEX
(1-866-797-4839). Customers may also download a copy of the brochure from the
www.powertochoose.org web site.

HEADLINE: The Shaw Group - President & CEO - Interview

GUESTS: James Bernard, John Manley

BYLINE: Mark Hianes

BODY:
???THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY 
BE
UPDATED. MARK HAINES, CNBC ANCHOR, SQUAWK BOX: Piping hot earnings right off 
the
presses. The Shaw Group beat the Street by $0.02, third quarter earnings 
$0.42 a
share, net income up 142 percent to $18 million. Revenues up 125 percent to
nearly $400 million. The Shaw Group is a leading maker of prefabricated piping
systems used mainly in the power, chemical and gas processing industries. The
stock has been on a slide. It's down more than 50 percent from the highs it 
set
just last June, just a month ago, a little more than a month ago. Late June it
was over 60 from the looks of that chart, closing about 42. Since then about 
50
percent. What's going on? No, wait a minute, 60 to 42 is about 30 percent. 
Where
is the stock headed from here? Let's ask James Bernhard. He is Shaw Group's
Chairman and CEO. Good morning, sir. JAMES BERNHARD, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & 
CEO,
THE SHAW GROUP: Good morning. HAINES: Is Wall Street missing something here?
Your numbers look terrific and the stock is something less than that. 
BERNHARD:
Well, I think that in our sector when FERC came out with the ruling mitigating
wholesale price markets in the power business in the western part of the 
United
States, that our stock took a momentary reflection on a downward trend. But I
think once we work through those issues that the regulations that occur there
has, won't build any more power plants and that is what our business is, the
building of power plants, and that market has never been better. ?HAINES: Walk
me through this. I guess the thinking was the FERC decision would discourage 
new
power plant production, is that it? BERNHARD: That's it. But, you know, the 
need
for electricity hasn't diminished so the FERC rulings won't decrease the
building of power plants and we are not in the buying and selling of
electricity, but are in the business of building power plants, coal, gas 
cycle,
as well as nuclear power plants. HAINES: Have you, without naming names, are 
any
of your customers expressing reservations about building plants in certain
geographical areas where they fear the political officials? BERNHARD: No, we
haven't seen any indication of a downward trend on the building of plants. We
have several opportunities in Arizona and Utah and (unintelligible) where we 
are
building plants for the California region as well as those local areas as far 
as
the wheeling process back to California. You know, business has never been
better. In fact, yesterday we received a half a billion dollar order from
Florida Power and Light for a cogeneration plant in the northeastern United
States. So continuing electricity is a decade building process, not an 18 
month
process. JOHN MANLEY: Mr. Bernhard, it's John Manley. That leads to my 
question,
which is when you talk about the business being as good as it is has ever 
been,
how cyclical is your business? How long can it stay this good? Is there a
question of over capacity in that industry at some point in time? BERNHARD:
Well, at some point in time there will be but, you know, in the United States 
we
are going through a metamorphosis where we haven't built plants in 20 years 
and
we have deregulation. We not only need to replace old plants but we need to
build more efficient plants. And certainly we have to go back to our old coal
plants and make them more environmentally -- clean air continues to be a huge
factor and I think this is a business for a long time to come. The cycles are
long and not the short cycles of 12 to 18 months. The cycles tend to be 10 and
15 years. HAINES: About 80 percent of your business is domestic but 20 percent
is a pretty big chunk and it's overseas. What are you seeing in your overseas
market? BERNHARD: Well, the overseas markets are beginning to come back,
especially the power business in Europe. We think that after the United States
in the next eight or 10 years the European market will begin in the next few
years, with the deregulation there and the increase in capacity required that 
it
will be also a huge market for us. HAINES: I take it that none of your 
customers
are having difficulty getting financing? BERNHARD: I don't think so. It has 
been
a pretty strong market out there, the need for electricity. I mean, when we 
are
talking about blackouts in different parts of the country, that is a long way,
and the need for electricity continues to grow. We are a long way from
satisfying the requirements. You need to have a 17 to 20 percent reserve.
HAINES: And the credit is out there, was my question, because there are
suggestions that many sectors of the economy are seeing a bit of a credit
liquidity crunch. All right, Mr. Bernhard, thank you very much and
congratulations on some great looking numbers. We appreciate it. BERNHARD: 
Have
a good day. Thank you. HAINES: James Bernhard is Shaw Group Chairman and CEO.

HEADLINE: Analysts: Overloaded California Grid Can't Handle High Demand, New
Plants

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:


??Gov. Gray Davis' visit to Pittsburg on Monday to start Calpine's new
gas-fired power plant highlighted the state's scramble to avert summer 
blackouts
by squeezing megawatts out of the fleet of generators in California and other
western states.

??But while successful so far, running the electricity infrastructure at full
bore raises the risk of an even more calamitous collapse, according to a 
report
issued late last month by the Electric Power Research Institute, a Palo Alto
organization funded by investor- and government-owned utilities.

??"Critical equipment -- such as large transformers -- on overloaded lines 
will
be running at maximum capacity," according to "The Western States Power 
Crisis:
Imperatives and Opportunities."

??"The failure of a single such critical component could result in unplanned
outages that might cascade throughout the Western Region, similar to the
multi-state outages of July and August of 1996."

??That July blackout plunged 2 million customers into darkness, while the
August blackout in the midst of a heat wave left 7.5 million people throughout
the West without power for up to seven hours.

??The institute's report warns that despite those outages and additional
demands on the electricity infrastructure from the growth of region-wide
electricity trading, transmission line owners have failed to invest in new 
lines
to carry power over long distances. In addition, "routine maintenance and 
upkeep
of transmission equipment has been significantly reduced over the past 
decade,"
the report says.

??That has left the West with a big backlog of work.

??"The estimated cost of bringing the regional transmission system back to a
stable condition is $ 10 billion to $ 30 billion, to be spent over the next 10
years on new transmission lines and upgrades of existing facilities," although
new technologies could trim that spending some, according to the report. 
Despite
the need for such investment, the analysts warn, there is a "lack of adequate
financial incentives for investment in the underlying infrastructure and (a)
lack of alignment between 'who pays and who gains."'

??California's electricity industry makeover has worsened the problem,
according to Brent Barker, the Electric Power Research Institute's corporate
communications manager. "With restructuring, the responsibility has been left
hanging," he said. "There's a vacuum right now."

??More dollars won't do the job alone, warned Mark Stultz, public affairs vice
president for the Electric Power Supply Association, a Washington, D.C.,
organization of generating companies. To clear the way for effective 
investment,
he said, federal regulators must have the authority to use eminent domain --
take private property for transmission line rights of way and other public
purposes.

??But addressing the transmission investment problem won't be easy, warned
Severin Borenstein, executive director of the UC Berkeley Energy Institute.
"Every transmission line has huge competitive ramifications," helping some 
power
plant owners and hurting others, he said.

??Still, power plant builders are pushing ahead. "California is building its
way to total energy self- sufficiency," the governor said in Pittsburg.

??New technology could also aid that effort, enabling generating capacity to 
be
added more cheaply by upgrading existing plants than by building new plants, 
the
report said. Up to 5,100 megawatts -- more than nine times the capacity of
Calpine's new $ 350-million, 555-megawatt plant -- could be added with an
investment of only $ 460 million in upgrades, according to the institute's
report. Fully 700 megawatts could come from spending only $ 2 million to 
change
timber harvest laws to ensure a steady supply of wood chips to fuel 
generators,
it said.

??The report criticizes California and other states that responded to a 1992
federal law encouraging electricity restructuring. They "failed to provide
sufficient incentives to build needed generation facilities, increase
transmission grid capacity and provide customers with better ways of managing
their electricity usage," the report said. Wholesale competition was separated
from retail competition, while developing a competitive wholesale electricity 
market presents "a significant technical challenge that has generally been
overlooked by policy makers," it added.

??Stultz of the Electric Power Supply Association said California created many
of its own problems. "The wholesale market has shown itself to (be) adaptive 
in
other regions of the country."

??The report also warns against depending too much on a single fuel, natural
gas, that faces growing demand and will remain expensive. "California is on 
the
verge of an overreliance on natural gas," it said. "If all the planned 
additions
are built, well over half of California's generation will be gas-fired, 
compared
with about 30 percent now."

??"We may be setting up the next energy crisis down the road," Barker warned.

??To avoid future problems, the report calls for "a coordinated planning
mechanism to ensure adequate investment in generation, transmission and load
(demand) management" and to design power markets. It also calls for the 
creation
of an "independent institution/agency to perform periodic assessments of the
performance of the infrastructure, markets and their interface."

??But Stultz emphasized unleashing market forces. "The way to address the
situation in the future is to embrace competition, not to shy away from it," 
he
said.

BODY:

??The energy crisis settlement talks in Washington have failed to reach
agreement on how much money the power companies should refund to Californians.
But the conference overseen by a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission judge
established one very important truth: Power companies definitely did gouge
Californians.

??Administrative law judge Curtis Wagner says FERC's latest price-restraint
rules should be applied retroactively to Oct. 2 in order to figure out how 
much
the state was gouged. Oct. 2 is the date when FERC acknowledged that wholesale
prices were not ''just or reasonable'' under federal law. FERC commissioners
claim they have no authority to issue refunds before that date, although
California claims they do.

??Wagner says California was gouged by only $1 billion or so, dating to Oct. 
2.
California says it's more like $4 billion. If the recent FERC price restraints
were retroactive to May 2000, and overcharges by all power providers were 
added
up, the state figures it would be owed $8.9 billion.

??Some believe California's deregulation law gave energy companies the freedom
to gouge. That's not true. Price gouging in the wholesale electricity market
violates the Federal Power Act of 1920, which mandates just and reasonable
rates. Market power, the ability of electricity producers to force prices
higher, violates that law, and the Federal Power Act requires refunds when
market power exists. Market power is gouging.

??FERC, the supposed enforcer of the Federal Power Act, acknowledges that
electricity companies engaged in market power but it has so far refused to 
order
appropriate refunds.

??Following the failed settlement talks, California has several venues to 
press
its case. First, FERC could ignore Wagner's figures and decide that power
generators owe California the $4 billion. We urge commissioners to do so.

??Wagner also recommended that FERC hold a hearing in which California and the
power generators could make their financial claims. If FERC refuses to hold 
that
hearing, or issues a ruling against California, either with or without such a
hearing, the state can file a protest to the commission to make its case. If 
the
state gets no satisfaction, it can go to federal court and request a judicial
review.

??Federal judges have not yet ruled on whether FERC violated the Federal Power
Act by allowing gouging to continue. Federal courts have rejected requests by
Southern California Edison and others for emergency action against FERC. The
courts said such extraordinary requests were improper because other remedies
were available.

??A judicial review would be very different. It would look directly at whether
FERC is in violation of the Federal Power Act by failing to ensure just and
reasonable wholesale rates. If a federal court finds that FERC has failed its
regulatory duty, it could force the commission to order refunds of all charges
that were unjust and unreasonable.

??FERC still has the opportunity to make the right ruling and give California
ratepayers and businesses their money back. If it doesn't, the state should
pursue its case aggressively.

HEADLINE: California to get plan for refunds;
Officials celebrate judge's proposition

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??WASHINGTON - Power companies failed Monday to reach agreement with 
California
over how much to pay in refunds for alleged overcharging during the state's
electricity crisis.

??And so the judge who tried to mediate those talks will recommend a plan that
would generate "hundreds of millions, and maybe $ 1 billion" worth of 
refunds, a
far cry from the $ 8.9 billion California has demanded.

??A marathon, 15-day negotiating session between California and a collection 
of
power generators that included Houston-based Reliant Energy, Enron Corp., 
Duke 
Energy North America, Dynegy and El Paso Corp. ended without the parties 
coming
close to clinching a deal.

??"In 15 days you can't work miracles," said Curtis L. Wagner, the
administrative law judge overseeing the talks at the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.

??As a result, Wagner will propose the five-member commission adopt a plan 
that
would result in at least some refunds for power sold between October 2000
through May.

??California officials quickly seized on that point to claim victory.

??Michael Kahn, head of the California Independent System Operator, called
Wagner's plan a "ringing endorsement" of his states' claims that refunds are
necessary.

??But Wagner's methodology for determining how those refunds should be
calculated tilted toward the power generators' position in many key respects,
hence the wide disparity between his ballpark estimates and California's 
claims.

??Wagner noted that he had not run the numbers under his methodology. Instead,
he will recommend regulators hold hearings within 45 to 60 days to determine
exact refund totals.

??California officials insisted the final refund dollars will total "multiple
billions." And they left open the very real possibility they will sue in 
federal
court to recoup the remaining dollars they believe they are owed.

??California Gov. Gray Davis, who has been a vociferous critic of the
commission, went on the offensive again Monday.

??"While in the past the FERC has shown little, if any, interest in consumers,
they now have the opportunity to redeem themselves by returning the $ 8.9
billion California has demonstrated it is owed," Davis said in a prepared
statement.

??During the negotiations, the electric power companies, marketers and other
suppliers offered to pay $ 716.1 million, never coming anywhere close to
California's demands.

??"Not surprisingly, the energy pirates that bilked rate payers out of 
billions
of dollars stonewalled and refused to negotiate in good faith with our team in
Washington," Davis said in his last salvo at the out-of-state generators.

??California wanted Reliant, for instance, to pay $ 376 million in refunds,
said John Stout, senior vice president for asset commercialization for 
Reliant's
Energy Wholesale Group.

??But that's nearly three times the $ 127 million operating margin the company
garnered from its California operations between October and May, according to 
a
filing the company made with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.

??Stout said Reliant offered to pay slightly less than $ 50 million.

??"We were essentially offering to refund one third of the operating margin
over the relevant period," Stout said.

??But Davis contends: "The energy generators and suppliers refused to 
recognize
their responsibility to the people of California and own up to their
profiteering."

??California's claims for $ 8.9 billion include sales starting in May 2000. 
But
Wagner only considered claims from October onwards. That meant $ 3 billion of
California's claims were not part of the settlement talks.

??"For California to continue this bogus claim of $ 8.9 billion, I think just
shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement," Enron 
spokesman
Mark Palmer said. "They are just interested in creating a whipping post. The
last thing that the political leadership in California wants to do is take
responsibility for the problem they created."

??Joel Newton, regulatory counsel for Dynegy and a spokesman for a coalition 
of
generators, argued that California's analysis did not account for last year's
rise in natural gas prices, high environmental costs and transportation
constraints for both electricity and natural gas.

??The settlement talks were organized not only to try to resolve the
differences over refunds but other outstanding disputes stemming from
California's power debacle.

??California, trying to move away from its dependence on power purchases from
the spot market, has been trying to line up long-term power contracts.

??As of June 12, the state had signed deals totaling $ 42.8 billion with 18
different suppliers. As a result, California purchased only 1.9 million 
megawatt
hours of power on the spot market, down from 4 million in May.

??But with a slew of civil and potentially criminal investigations, some power
companies have been loathe to sign long-term deals while those disputes are
still outstanding.

??The power companies pushed, as part of the settlement negotiations, to have
those other investigations dropped. But California officials refused.

??"We're disappointed that we were unable to reach a global solution," said
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.

??California is not the only Western state seeking refunds. Other states in 
the
region have their own claims, totaling more than $ 6 billion.

??Wagner has proposed holding a separate negotiating session for those states,
arguing that their concerns had been given short shrift in the settlement 
talks
because of the central battle with California.

HEADLINE: Officials in California fail to reach settlement over the state's
demand for more than $8 billion in refunds to electricity customers

ANCHORS: BOB EDWARDS

REPORTERS: SCOTT HORSLEY

BODY:

??BOB EDWARDS, host:

??This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. ?I'm Bob Edwards.

??The state of California says it's not giving up its fight for billions of
dollars in refunds from wholesale electric bills. ?But power producers aren't
giving that money back voluntarily. ?A 15-day negotiating period ended 
yesterday
with no settlement of the state's claims. ?The case now goes to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and a regulatory judge suggests that he'll
recommend only a fraction of the refunds California wants. NPR's Scott Horsley
reports.

??SCOTT HORSLEY reporting:

??Lawyers for the state of California and power producers spent the last two
weeks arguing over who should pay the state's electric bill. ?But despite 
daily
negotiations, they failed to reach any agreement. Wholesale power prices have
soared in the last 14 months. ?California accuses generators of price gouging
and demands refunds of $8.9 billion. Generators blame the price increase on
market forces. They've offered refunds of less than $1 billion. Federal
regulators assigned Judge Curtis Wagner to try to broker a compromise and as
late as yesterday, Wagner said, he hoped for a partial deal. ?In the end,
though, Wagner emerged from the talks saying the two sides were too far apart.

??Judge CURTIS WAGNER: A lot of the parties genuinely wanted to settle; others
didn't. ?As I said in the room, you can take a horse to the water but you 
can't
make him drink. ?And if you don't want to settle, you know, you can't make 
them
settle.

??HORSLEY: Wagner wouldn't comment on which side was the more stubborn horse 
in
these negotiations. ?But without a settlement, he'll send the case back to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Wagner's recommendation will be 
closer
to the generators' position than to California's. ?In general, Wagner says 
he'll
recommend the commission calculate any refunds by applying a price control 
order
it issued last month retroactively to last October. ?Wagner says he hasn't 
done
that calculation himself, but it's unlikely to yield anything close to the 
$8.9
billion figure California wants. ?In fact, Wagner says, any refund would
probably be more than offset by money the generators claim they're owed for
power that was purchased but never paid for by California's cash-strapped
utilities. ?Power producers were cheered by the judge's stance, which sets the
stage for a follow-up hearing.

??In the meantime, Brent Bailey, vice president of Duke Energy, says his
company is willing to keep talking.

??Mr. BRENT BAILEY (Vice President, Duke Energy): We've had serious settlement
talks with the state over the last few days and hope to continue having those
over the next few days and over the next couple weeks. ?We would still like to
resolve all this on a global basis 'cause we think that's in the best interest
of all parties to help resolve what's going on in California right now.

??HORSLEY: Other Western states are also seeking refunds totaling around $6
billion. ?Those issues have been on hold until the California case is 
resolved.

??California's negotiating team struggled to put the best possible face on the
bargaining session. ?Even though the judge's refund recommendation is likely 
to
fall far short of its demand, California's lead negotiator, Michael Kahn,
insists any refund amounts to a victory.

??Mr. MICHAEL KAHN (Legal Negotiator, California): We came here wanting $8.9
billion and in all candor we did not receive any meaningful settlement offers
from anyone, so the negotiations were not as helpful as we had hoped them to 
be
but the process was very useful because we feel our positions have been
vindicated.

??HORSLEY: In fact, California lost on several crucial points. The judge's
refund recommendation will only cover power purchased since October, while
California was hoping for refunds dating back to May of last year when the 
spike
in prices began. ?In addition, the judge plans to make several technical
modifications to the commission's price control order, all of which should
benefit producers.

??California will continue to press its case to the full commission and
spokesman Roger Salazar of the governor's office warns that may not be the
state's last stop.

??Mr. ROGER SALAZAR: We'll take whatever we can get from the folks over at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and if need be, we're ready and willing 
to
go to court to get the rest. ?So one way or the other, we're going to be 
getting
that $8.9 billion back that Californians have been bilked out of.

??HORSLEY: Governor Gray Davis himself declared yesterday that California is 
in
a war with power generators. With the failure of the peace talks in 
Washington,
there will apparently be more battles to come. ?Scott Horsley, NPR News, San
Diego.

HEADLINE: No energy refunds foreseen for California ; Power: Judge rules state
is owed up to a billion dollars, but owes suppliers more than that

BYLINE: Mark Sherman; The Associated Press

BODY:


??WASHINGTON - California is owed no more than "a billion dollars" from power
wholesalers, a federal regulatory judge said Monday at the end of 15 days of
settlement talks in the state's electricity crisis.

??Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's chief
administrative law judge, said that at the same time the power suppliers
probably are owed more than that.

??The net effect of his preliminary recommendation is that California probably
will receive no refunds from wholesalers.

??Wagner said power generators had offered $ 716 million in refunds. The state
has asked for $ 8.9 billion since May 2000. Wagner said he will not recommend
refunds for power sales that occurred before Oct. 2.

??It was not immediately clear what impact the judge's preliminary
recommendation would have on efforts to settle the dispute.

??Both sides said before the judge's announcement that they expected a
protracted legal battle in the event the talks did not produce a settlement.

??Michael Kahn, Gov. Gray Davis's representative in the talks, has said the
state would seek more than twice the claimed overcharges if the dispute moved
from mediated talks to a courtroom.

??The producers reiterated Monday that California's numbers are grossly
inflated. Attorneys for the five major generators - Duke Energy, Dynegy, 
Mirant,
Reliant Energy and the Williams Cos. - said in a statement that they have 
made a
"very substantial global settlement offer."

??John H. Stout, a senior vice president for Reliant Energy, said his company
would agree to no more than $ 50 million in refunds, as part of an overall
settlement that also would have to include protection from additional legal
claims.

??But Stout also said, "Reliant's fundamental position has been and remains
that no refunds are justified."

??FERC ordered the talks last month in an effort to resolve differences 
between
producers and the state over the breakdown of California's deregulated 
electricity market.

??The state has accused the producers of manipulating supply to unfairly drive
up prices. The producers have acknowledged that prices are high, but blame 
jumps
in the price of natural gas, which fuels many power plants, and the workings 
of
the free market

??The bill for wholesale power in California soared to $ 27 billion last year
from $ 7 billion the year before. Davis has estimated that the state could 
spend
as much as $ 50 billion this year.
