I heard through the grapevine that Judge Campbell's final order (the follow 
up to his minute order questioning whether or not fair market value had been 
determined) came out late last night.  I am attempting to get a copy.  I was 
told that he essentially held up AEPCO's comments which completely invalidate 
the AZ Electric Competition Rules.  I will keep you posted.
