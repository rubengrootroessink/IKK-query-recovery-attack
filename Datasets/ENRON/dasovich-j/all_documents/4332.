I'm forwarding a notice from the California ISO, telling us it will be 
responding to a very broad Subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board 
(EOB).  Many of the questions relate to the period of from September 2000 
through November 2000.  The ISO indicates that it will be answering the 
requests because the EOB has granted what it believes is an adequate 
protective order.  This order agrees to keep the answers to certain questions 
confidential, but to provide them to the CPUC and the AG if they agree to 
keep them confidential.  If we have concerns about the confidential order we 
are supposed to advise the ISO by Monday 12/1, at 9:00 a.m.  The subpoeana, 
and confidential order, and a letter explaining the treatment of the various 
requests are attached.

I am assuming that because the order appears to protect our commercial 
interests, we will not protest this.  Richard - let me know if you want to 
have a conference call on this and I'll have Lysa set one up.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) Further Subpoena


  ISO Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

  The Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB") has issued a further
subpoena to the ISO in the context of its ongoing investigation of
California's electricity grid and markets during and subsequent to the
Summer 2000. The subpoena seeks information that is confidential under ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.2. This notice is provided in accordance with Tariff
Section 20.3.4 and includes the subpoena as an attachment.

  The EOB has issued three letters in which it sets forth the
confidential treatment it will afford confidential information produced by
the ISO including:

* an initial letter dated July 20 which addresses data subject to ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.;
* a letter dated July 28 which addresses additional data; and
* a letter dated October 3 which clarifies that the confidential
treatment set forth in the July 20 and 28 letters will be applied by the EOB
on an ongoing basis in its investigation of the electricity markets.

  The three letters are attached to this notice.

  The ISO will mark as confidential documents it produces to
the EOB that contain information subject to 20.3.2. It is the ISO's
understanding that the confidential treatment provided by the EOB to
information subject to 20.3.2 is satisfactory to Market Participants. The
ISO intends to comply with the EOB subpoena in a timely manner on December
18. If a Market Participant requires any further confidentiality protection,
the ISO expects such Market Participant to take timely action to obtain
directly from the EOB such further protection so that production by the ISO
is not delayed. The ISO would appreciate being notified of any such action
and its resolution so that it can comply with its responsibilities as set
forth in ISO Tariff section 20.3.

  The EOB contact related to the subpoena is Eric Saltmarsh
who can be reached at (916) 322-8601.

  Any concerns relating to the EOB's subpoena should be
communicated by 9:00 a.m. on Monday, December 11th, to Jeanne Sol, at
jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.comburns@caiso.com> , and copied to
Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com <mailto:crobinson@caiso.com>  and
