Paul,

We see what you refer to as " the Cavanaugh/Edison bill" as a re-play of AB 
1421 from last year.  That bill will destroy the retail market.  We opposed 
1421 and we'll oppose any son of 1421. We do not want to see it tied to any 
aggregation bill, the public goods charge extension or anything else.

Don,

While the points you make are good ones, I think we should go for it this
year.

First, the Cavanaugh/Edison bill will in part restructure Chapter 854
regarding the role of the default provider, and Edison will be asking for a
solidification of its distribution role, so this it is the natural vehicle
to redress aggregation. If we wait until next year it may be too late,
because we will be pushing rather than pulling. I think Edison and PG&E may
put up less of a fight in this context.

Second, while the League of Cities has not been involved, twelve cities and
counties representing 2 million Californians passed a resolution last year
asking the legislature for Community Choice. The leaders, from the Southern
California Cities Joint Powers Consortium, San Francisco, Oakland, and
Marin County, are actively involved in geting support from Bowen and
Burton. Oakland is planning a statewide conference of cities and national
leaders on Community Choice this Summer, which would coincide with
committee hearings and attract media attention. In both Massachusetts and
Ohio, we had weak support from the Leagues and did the job with about 35
municipalities represented. I am confident we will have that number in
California this year.

Third, TURN is providing strong support for the bill. I believe CALPIRG,
UCAN and other consumer groups will give strong support as a result of the
national coalition for Community Choice legislation, RAGE, which has signed
most of them on the agenda over the past two years.

Finally, the PUC is looking into Distribution Competition this year, and
both the ORA and Strategic Planning are actively interested in Community
Choice as a strategy for making the market work.

As you described it, the legislation allows municipalities to implement
Community Choice programs, and does not require it.

Regards,

Paul Fenn
