While attacking the Clinton-Gore Administration's "nonexistent" national=20
energy policy, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush recently=20
revealed his own policy.

"Despite presiding over a period of unprecedented economic growth and=20
increasing energy demand, it is clear that the Clinton-Gore Administration=
=20
has done little to plan for America's future energy needs," said a Bush=20
position paper on energy issues. "At best, for the last seven-and-a-half=20
years the Administration has had no energy policy. At worst, its policy has=
=20
been to ignore America's increasing reliance on foreign oil, while=20
discouraging domestic energy exploration and production. Moreover, the=20
Administration's actions have been inherently contradictory: extolling the=
=20
virtues of information technology, but failing to plan for the increased=20
energy needs of the New Economy; promoting the development of electric=20
vehicles, but discouraging investment in new electrical generating capacity=
."=20

In particular, Bush criticized the Administration for allowing U.S.=20
dependence on foreign oil to jump to a record 56 percent, compared with onl=
y=20
36 percent during the 1973 oil crisis. As important as oil is, however,=20
"increasingly, the most critical source of energy for the country is=20
electricity, which is principally produced not by oil, but by natural gas,=
=20
coal, nuclear energy, and hydroelectric power," asserted the Bush energy=20
policy outline.

And while the Clinton-Gore Administration has been pushing Americans to=20
increase their use of renewable energy resources, Bush believes that a=20
national energy policy "must also be realistic about our current situation.=
 .=20
. . [and] must reflect the fact that, for the foreseeable future,=20
hydrocarbons -- oil, coal, and especially clean-burning natural gas -- will=
=20
continue to play a critical role in meeting the growing energy needs of the=
=20
New Economy. Hydroelectric and nuclear power will also play an important=20
role."

Bush also blasted the current Administration for discouraging investment in=
=20
additional electrical generating capacity and transmission, leaving certain=
=20
areas of the country vulnerable to regional brownouts and blackouts. In=20
particular, the presidential hopeful noted that Internet-related activities=
=20
now consume about 13 percent of U.S. electric output. Further, while in 197=
5=20
roughly 25 percent of U.S. energy demand was delivered as electricity, Bush=
's=20
energy outline said this figure has risen to almost 37 percent and will=20
continue to rise "due to the growth of the New Economy."

"Intel estimates the number of Internet nodes will reach one billion someti=
me=20
during the current decade," noted Bush. "New web sites translate into more=
=20
users, more traffic, more servers, more peripherals, more air conditioning =
--=20
in short, more demand for electricity and for the fuels that are used to=20
produce it."

And as demand keeps growing, the nation's generating fleet is getting older=
.=20
By 2015, about 60 percent of the existing coal-fired plants and 40 percent =
of=20
nuclear plants will be more than 40-years-old. At the same time, the nation=
's=20
electric transmission grid desperately needs new investment as it bends und=
er=20
the strain of greater power flows created by competition in wholesale=20
electricity markets. "Unfortunately, the Clinton-Gore Administration has=20
failed to establish a framework to encourage this investment," Bush asserte=
d.

Bush next noted the nation's dependence on coal to produce 50 percent of th=
e=20
nation's electricity supply. Yet, while the U.S. holds more than 25 percent=
=20
of the world's coal reserves, which would be enough to produce power at=20
current production rates for the next 250 years, Bush said the current=20
Administration's policies and implementation of the Kyoto global climate=20
treaty would reduce electricity derived from coal to less than 10 percent b=
y=20
2020.

"As a result, electricity prices would increase 50 percent in real terms an=
d=20
a massive investment in natural gas infrastructure would be required to=20
replace the lost coal capacity," Bush continued. Further, substantial=20
emission reductions "could be more readily achieved by scheduling emission=
=20
reductions to coincide with technological advances, but the Administration =
is=20
instead insisting upon substantial reductions before these advances can be=
=20
reasonably deployed."

The Clinton-Gore Administration was also blasted by Bush for doing nothing=
=20
about replacing the 40 percent of the nation's electricity needs currently=
=20
being met by the nuclear capacity expected to be retired by 2020 and for th=
e=20
costly and time consuming current hydropower relicensing process, as well a=
s=20
for not taking a stand on Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt's open=20
advocacy of destroying dams.

Finally, Bush -- who passed an electric industry deregulation bill while=20
governor of Texas -- complained that the Administration has not pushed hard=
=20
enough for a federal electric industry deregulation bill. "Roughly half of=
=20
the states, including Texas, have passed some form of electric restructurin=
g=20
legislation to deal with retail markets," Bush stated. "It has become=20
increasingly clear, however, that federal legislation is needed to assure t=
he=20
reliability of the nation's electrical grid, and to promote consumer choice=
=20
by removing federal barriers to competition. Unfortunately, the=20
Administration has not offered the leadership necessary to pass a=20
comprehensive electric restructuring bill, thus preventing consumers from=
=20
receiving all of the benefits that deregulation can provide."

In contrast to the Administration, the position paper said Bush "recognizes=
=20
the need for a comprehensive, strategic approach to ensuring U.S. energy=20
security. He understands that the only way to meet America's growing energy=
=20
needs is to utilize a range of fuels and technologies: oil, natural gas,=20
coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and biomass, as well as increased=20
conservation. He also understands the critical need to help low-income=20
Americans with their energy bills."

Thus, if elected president, Bush pledged to work with Canada and Mexico to=
=20
develop a North American energy policy. "The U.S. must develop policies and=
=20
strategies to support the increasing cross-border flows of oil, natural gas=
=20
and electricity within North America," Bush explained. "Governor Bush and h=
is=20
Secretary of Energy will work with their counterparts in Canada and Mexico =
to=20
improve oil and gas distribution, enhance the reliability of the North=20
American electrical grid, and promote cross-border energy trade. For exampl=
e,=20
Canada and the U.S. could work together to streamline permitting so that a=
=20
natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the Midwest could be built."

On whether to use the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR)to mitigate high oil=
=20
prices, Bush said no. Instead, he would like to create a privately-managed=
=20
Northeast home heating oil reserve. "However, he does not believe that the=
=20
government should be actively trading petroleum products into, and out of,=
=20
storage, as this represents significant government involvement in the oil=
=20
markets," said the paper. "Rather, the government should contract with=20
private companies to perform storage services. This will minimize governmen=
t=20
expenditures and interference in the market, while ensuring that heating oi=
l=20
supplies will be available when needed."

To help the nation meet "the electricity demands of the new economy," Bush=
=20
pledged to encourage the development of North American oil and natural gas=
=20
resources. As part of this strategy, Bush would propose to open 8 percent o=
f=20
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge "to environmentally responsible=20
exploration," which could replace the oil that the U.S. now imports from=20
Iraq, and "examine whether certain promising natural gas reserves in federa=
l=20
lands should be opened to environmentally responsible and regulated=20
exploration."

Bush also recognizes the need for environmentally responsible development o=
f=20
existing coal, nuclear, and hydro capacity. Thus, as president, he pledged =
to=20
fund research into "Clean Coal" technologies and support the permanent=20
extension of the existing R=02=15tax credit.

To facilitate the transfer of nuclear assets to U.S. utilities specializing=
=20
in operating nuclear power facilities, Bush promised to seek legislation=20
clarifying that the transfer of plant decommissioning funds not be taxed as=
=20
part of the transaction. On hydropower, Bush wants to streamline the=20
relicensing process and oppose efforts to breach hydroelectric dams.

Bush also insisted that comprehensive electric industry deregulation=20
legislation is necessary "to encourage the investment necessary to expand=
=20
electrical generating capacity," maintain reliability, and encourage=20
competition. "Having enacted one of the most successful and comprehensive=
=20
electricity deregulation bills in the nation, Governor Bush understands the=
=20
need for complementary federal deregulation legislation," the position pape=
r=20
stated.

Thus, as president, Bush would support federal legislation that (1) empower=
s=20
a single organization to oversee reliability concerns and assess penalties=
=20
for those that abuse the transmission grid, (2) protects consumers, and (3)=
=20
repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act and ends the mandatory=20
purchase requirement of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

A President Bush would also promote separate legislation (1) establishing=
=20
mandatory reduction targets for emissions of four main pollutants: sulfur=
=20
dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide; (2) phasing in these=
=20
emissions reductions over a "reasonable" time period; (3) allowing utilitie=
s=20
to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation under=
=20
the Environmental Protection Agency's new source review requirements; and (=
4)=20
providing market-based incentives, such as emissions trading and carbon=20
credits, to help industry achieve the required reductions.

To encourage the development of renewable and alternative energy sources an=
d=20
to promote conservation, Bush would propose to create a "Royalties=20
Conservation Fund" that would earmark royalties collected from new oil and=
=20
gas exploration on federal lands to fund conservation efforts. "It is=20
estimated that royalties collected from opening just 8 percent of the Arcti=
c=20
National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration could produce hundreds =
of=20
millions of dollars in royalties annually," the paper noted. Bush would als=
o=20
support tax credits for electricity produced from alternative and renewable=
=20
resources.

Finally, among other things, Bush plans to (1) require federal regulators "=
to=20
develop a comprehensive policy for approving pipelines, (2) invest $1 billi=
on=20
over ten years "to establish clear rules to help efficient utilities purcha=
se=20
nuclear plants, streamline the relicensing process for hydroelectric=20
projects, and oppose the breaching of dams"; (3) and propose legislation=20
requiring electric utilities to reduce harmful emissions, not just asking=
=20
them to do so voluntarily as advocated by Vice President Gore.=20
