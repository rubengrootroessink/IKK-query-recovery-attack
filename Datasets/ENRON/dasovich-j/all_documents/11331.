Transmission Deal and Democratic Support
As Governor Gray Davis scrambles to build support for his SoCal Ed.=20
transmission proposal, one thing is evident; the longer the deal is exposed=
=20
to public debate, the less likely it is to pass.  In fact, politicians have=
=20
been so leery of the deal that Davis has been unable to locate even one=20
sponsor to introduce the bill in the Senate.  In the eyes of many Democrati=
c=20
legislators (and all Republicans) forcing SoCal Edison into bankruptcy is=
=20
looking like a better option than buying the transmission lines; that is wh=
y=20
the Governor's senior strategists have quietly been trying to schedule a=20
quick "up or down" vote on the transmission line purchase as early as next=
=20
week.  The bill is currently not scheduled to be voted on in effort to avoi=
d=20
debate, however, if there is an opening within the next two weeks and Davis=
=20
feels he has enough support, it will be pushed through.  Because the SoCal=
=20
deal needs every piece in place as "negotiated" by Davis' team, the team=20
wants no amendments allowed on the Assembly floor and a quick vote.  If thi=
s=20
unlikely fast track strategy fails for Davis, the prospects for the=20
transmission lines purchase will deteriorate steadily (keep in mind that th=
at=20
it cannot even be resubmitted to the Assembly until it has been vetted by=
=20
SoCal Edison attorneys).  According to sources, the legislature is going to=
=20
try to modify the Memorandum of Understanding between Gov. Davis and SCE. =
=20
However, the Senate leadership does not believe there will be sufficient=20
support to pass even a modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes that at lea=
st=20
6 Democrats will vote against it along with the Republicans.  The more that=
=20
bill gets picked apart in public, the uglier it looks and the more Democrat=
s=20
will realize that they are all alone in supporting it.=20
=20
Another problem faced by the legislatures is the deal is in favor of SoCal=
=20
and not the state.  Among other things, the state is overpaying by about $1=
.5=20
billion for the transmission lines.  Additionally, the MOU Davis has with=
=20
SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point for point, the deal Davis condemned with PG=
&E.

Asset Seizures
Since before the PG&E bankruptcy filing, we have maintained that asset=20
seizures through eminent domain would become a major pursuit for increasing=
ly=20
frustrated Democrats.  Davis' legal office has thoroughly scrubbed the law =
on=20
eminent domain seizures of everything from power generating assets across=
=20
California to existing power contracts negotiated by, whom Davis's calls,=
=20
"profiteering power brokers".  Of course, everyone in the Governor's office=
=20
understands that any seizing would immediately end up in state and federal=
=20
courts, and would be a legal nightmare (there are a few minor Constitutiona=
l,=20
legal and interstate commerce problems). The main thing is that the seizing=
=20
would continue Davis's main approach to this problem -- management by press=
=20
conference -- and it would put the Governor and Democrats on the right side=
=20
of the issue -- punishing the capitalist leeches.  According to one senior=
=20
Democratic legislator, there is movement within Democratic members of the=
=20
state Assembly to demand that Davis agree to seize the power contracts in=
=20
return for their vote in favor of the power transmission purchase. Of cours=
e,=20
taking the contracts would only be setting a precedent for taking the power=
=20
plants.  The appeal of seizing the contracts is that it would allegedly put=

=20
mark-ups substantially as they used the contract power authority to provide=
=20
spot-market power purchases before peak emergency conditions drive the pric=
e=20
through the roof.=20

Price Caps
One strong indication as to whether or not summer price caps will occur=20
depends powerfully on decisions made by the three Republican Governors from=
=20
Colorado, Alaska and Wyoming. These three were the key players during the=
=20
Portland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according to senio=
r=20
White House officials, it took the personal and prolonged intervention of=
=20
President Bush himself to peel these three away from an otherwise unanimous=
=20
call for price caps from the governors. "If they had signed that price cap=
=20
appeal," the administration source said, "we would already have price caps.=
=20
So if they start to make it clear something has changed, we will have to=20
listen."  Sources indicate that if these Republican leaders begin to rethin=
k=20
their opposition to price caps, the Bush administration will be forced to=
=20
reconsider price caps as a remedy for the West.=20

Cost Plus Caps -- Think of these as Republican price caps in that their fir=
st=20
duty is to make sure private companies make money and have incentives to=20
provide power into the affected grid. Just to give some idea of magnitudes =
in=20
a cost plus deal, current discussions would put a cap on power costs at=20
something like $250 per kilowatt hour. That is a long way down from the=20
August futures contract that is pricing in $750 per kilowatt hour, but a lo=
ng=20
way above last August's $150/kwhr price and a particularly long way above t=
he=20
cost of generating this power, which is something like $25-30/kwh.=20

Market-Price Exceptions -- The option allows the Bush administration to hav=
e=20
political credit for imposing price caps. As we write, FERC is currently ,i=
n=20
the process of considering permit renewals for five companies generating=20
power in California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant and Williams).  The permit=
=20
grants a further three-year waiver that allows them to sell power into=20
California in the existing "whatever price the market will bear".  In other=
=20
words, FERC could simply not grant these companies the right to sell energy=
=20
at the market price, perhaps by changing a definition of controlling market=
=20
share, and then power to control prices would revert back to FERC.=20

Technically, in granting the extension of these permits, FERC has to=20
establish a formal finding that the five power companies do not wield "mark=
et=20
power" -- that means they cannot affect the price of energy by withholding=
=20
power at crucial times. Of course, FERC has just found on three different=
=20
rulings in the last four months that the companies wield exactly that kind =
of=20
ability over market prices and has ordered minor rebates to adjust for the=
=20
subsequent price spikes. But that would mean FERC would have to want to wie=
ld=20
effective power over price capping in California and they have shown no=20
desire on that front. The escape clause for FERC simply to renew the waiver=
s=20
is that they are routinely renewed unless the company applying for waivers=
=20
controls more than 20% of an electricity market and none of these companies=
=20
come close.

In other words, the waivers option lets FERC escape if the Bush=20
administration and FERC commissioners really want to escape. Once again, th=
at=20
decision may be more in the hands of the three Republican Governors than=20
anywhere else in the country. But you can be certain that in the past few=
=20
days Administration officials have become fully aware of the potential=20
political liabilities of doing nothing except advocating more nuclear and=
=20
coal power plants.=20

Democrats Seize Opportunity to blame Bush
Senior political leaders now think the total energy bill for the year could=
=20
come in as high as $60 billion, which would destroy state finances for a=20
decade.  Add to that the constant drumbeat of numbers that voters hear=20
everyday about their own direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid =
$7=20
billion for electricity in 1999, $27 billion in 2000 and are expected to pa=
