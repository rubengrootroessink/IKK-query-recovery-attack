I spoke with Dan this morning and conveyed our lack of enthusiasm with the 
Gov's siting improvements.  Do you have any concrete examples of why the 
siting is still not adequate and what can be done to improve it?  Also, what 
is Cisco's position on Calpine's San Jose facility?  I thought that Cisco 
opposed the plant.

as you all know, Gov. Davis has gone to great lengths to highlight the
improvements he's made in the siting and permitting of new energy
generation.  however, I have heard from some industry analysts that things
aren't working as well as advertised.  do you have any insight on this
issue?  I'd like to know if the process has been drastically improved or
just marginally.

if you're not satisfied with the process, what could be done to improve it?
