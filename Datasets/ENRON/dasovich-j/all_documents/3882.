Well...after a brief  series of technical issues, we have the Haas Student 
Supply store back up and  running with a variety of commonly needed items.? 
Just to give you an idea  of some of the goods you can purchase at Haas, 
here's a short  list...
?

AA & AAA  batteries
Single 100MB  ZIP disks 
CD-RW's?(for all you music lovers...) 
Sanford  Rollerball pens (black & blue) 
Kodak  film 
Penguin Caffeinated Peppermints 
Disposable  cameras 
Epson and  HewlettPackard Inkjet  cartridges. 
...and  more!!!

We've also added  n inkjet?cartridge selector, so if  you know your printer 
model, the machine knows which cartridge fits the printer  you've 
selected!!!??Our prices are competitive with the bookstore, and  your can 
easily pay with most major credit/debit cards!!!
