Yes, based on previous notes, I'd assumed we were trying for Saturday or
Sunday evening.  Seems like folks had landed on Sunday.  I have a "family
thing" that I need to do from noon to 4 pm on sunday (or I will be a social
outcast for the rest of my life)--apologies.  So anytime before 11:45 AM or
after about 4:45 on Sunday works great for me.  Hope that's not a problem.

Best,
Jeff

Hey guys,

I think we got our wires crossed. I was talking to Jeff and Shawne last
night about
meeting at Jeff's office either Sunday morning or late afternoon. I'm
willing to go
anywhere, anytime, but I don't think this will work for Jeff.
