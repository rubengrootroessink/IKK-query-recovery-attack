FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, D.C.  20426

April 12, 2001

       Docket Nos. EL00-95-027
           and EL00-98-026
To: Companies Listed On The Attachment

Dear Sir/Madam:

 On December 15, 2000, the Commission issued an order in this proceeding 
directing remedies to address dysfunctions in spot markets operated in 
California and to ensure just and reasonable wholesale power rates by public 
utility sellers in California.  San Diego Gas & Electric Co., et al., 93 FERC 
? 61,294 (2000).   Several of the key elements of that order were intended to 
remove barriers to entering into long-term contracts.  The Commission now 
seeks information to determine how successful efforts have been to fashion 
long-term contracts and to reduce reliance on spot markets.  In addition, we 
note that at a hearing held by the Committee on Government Reform of the  
United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2001, in Sacramento, 
California, the Committee requested that the Commission provide information 
on bilateral contracts for sales to the California Department of Water 
Resources (DWR), which has been negotiating such contracts with suppliers on 
behalf of end-users in California.

 The Commission directs each supplier listed on the Attachment to file by the 
close of business, April 16, 2001, copies of all short-term and long-term 
bilateral contracts for electricity which such seller has entered into with 
DWR subsequent to the December 15 Order.  The Commission will treat these 
contracts as confidential, unless the supplier waives such confidential 
treatment.  However, the Commission intends to provide copies of the 
contracts to the Committee on Government Reform under confidential seal.  To 
the extent any responsive contracts have already been filed with the 
Commission, in unredacted form, suppliers may substitute a reference to the 
Docket No. assigned to the 








Docket Nos. EL00-95-027 and EL00-98-026                    - 2 -

pertinent document rather than submitting a copy of the document.  If a 
seller has not entered into any such bilateral contracts with DWR, it should 
file a letter so stating by the close of business, April 16, 2001.

 By direction of the Commission.

        

       David P. Boergers,
             Secretary.
