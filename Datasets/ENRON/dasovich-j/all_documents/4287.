DG interconnection is the subject of a concerted effort in W Va that 
commenced yesterday.  AEP and Allegheny have proposed interconnection 
standards that allegedly are based on earlier drafts of IEEE 1547.  Over the 
next several weeks, we have the opportunity for input.  Distributed Power 
Coalition of America is aggressively involved as well, and will be advocating 
its Model Standardized Interconnection Package for Distributed Generation.

Jeff and Tom, I would like to send copies of AEP's?APS's requirements for DG 
connection for your review, if you are interested.   Do you know why the 
content of earlier versioins of 1547 has been removed (i.e., stuff that has 
been reinserted in the utilities' proposals?)

I will be reviewing the materials, and have arranged with Peter Chamberlain 
(representing DPCA) to work cooperatively on a response, to the extent our 
interests coincide.

YEs, I think so.  If the Ohio utilities agree to defer to the IEEE standards 
once they are approved, is that good for us?  What is our view on this?
Thanks

I assume you are referring to the IEEE effort to develop a standard for the 
interconnection of distributed resources (IEEE P1547).  I was following this 
development but have since reduced my efforts in this area.   The status is 
that they are working to get an approved standard released in the 3rd quarter 
of 2001.

Is anyone from Enron involved in the IEEE discussions for uniform standards 
for interconnection?
