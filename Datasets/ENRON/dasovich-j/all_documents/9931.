The tail is beginning to wag the dog.  Although the QFs represent only abou=
t=20
3000MW of capacity, the gas (and then coal) QFs have the least ability to=
=20
withstand a further delay in payment, given their relative lack of liquidit=
y=20
and high level of fixed obligations (O&M, debt) and unreimbursed fuel=20
expenses.  The legislature needs to move quickly to stem the tide.

Good morning,
-Yesterday, Edison International indicated that Caithness, a QF, is seeking=
 a=20
lien on an Edison asset that would give it a secured claim in the event of=
=20
bankruptcy. Edison stated that it would fight any U.S. court decision in=20
favor of Caithness, which could come as early as tomorrow.
-Because of their dire financial situation, we believe that QFs like=20
Caithness pose the greatest risk of filing an involuntary bankruptcy petiti=
on=20
against PG&E and Edison International.
-Last week, state legislators modified SB47X, the draft bill to lower QF=20
prices, in an effort to speed its passage. Reportedly, legislators are tryi=
ng=20
to lower average QF prices to $0.079 per kWh. The CPUC is unlikely to decid=
e=20
on revenue allocation until the bill is passed.
-This week, California moved forward with demand- and supply-side programs,=
=20
including the governor=01,s plan to give a 20% rebate to customers that red=
uce=20
power consumption by 20%. Also, three Western governors made another reques=
t=20
to FERC to cap wholesale prices.
-Although Governor Davis and the utilities continue to negotiate a utility=
=20
recovery plan, it is unclear if the state legislature will pass such a plan=
.=20
Therefore, we suggest that investors avoid EIX ($14.88, Hold) and PCG=20
($14.24, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatility.

Please call us with any questions you may have.
