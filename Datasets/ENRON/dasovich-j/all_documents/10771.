See attached pdf that I mentioned last night.  Lots of goodies in there
about synergies, cost savings and EPS accretion.  I have no idea who Argus
Company is - got the file through my Fidelity brokerage act.  No reason to
believe it is not reputable.

Here are the highlights:
- with the merger Pepsi will have 25% of non-carbonated drink market vs.
coke's 10% share; non-carb drinks are growing at 8% annually
- Pepsi mgt is projecting revenue and cost savings increase of $230 million
in operating income by 2005; half from distribution system and half from
reduced procurement costs and SGA savings
- Pepsi mgt forecasts a restructing charge of $400 million after
finalization of deal; not accretive to EPS in 2001
- earnings will increase by $.02 in 2002 b/c of the merger

I also attached another report with lots of industry comps and ratios for
OAT.
Hope this helps.
