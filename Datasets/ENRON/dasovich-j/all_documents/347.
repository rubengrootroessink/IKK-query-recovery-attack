Hello everyone,

After much research and some delay, I have the info that I think will work
well for Mom and Dad.  I tried to combine a NICE cruise (good food,
accommodation, itinerary) with cost.

Here's what I have come up with:

Princess Cruises
Dawn Princess (ship), July 17 departure, 7 night cruise
Vancouver-Inside passage-Ketchikan-Juneau-Skagway-Glacier Bay-College Fjord
crossing-Seward(Anchorage)
Outside room with balcony
$2555.45/per person

I also think that they should spend a day in Vancouver before the cruise.
That adds $258/night (I think they should stay 2 nights--they fly up
Saturday, have Saturday night and Sunday, board the ship on Monday).  The
somewhat high price is because they stay at either the Four Seasons or Sutton
Place.

The total is $6026 or $1506 for each of us (if I did the math right--check
it).  This price includes airfare, port charges, all food etc on board. It
doesn't include alcohol or sodas on board, any excursions taken in port
(sightseeing tours), tips for cabin steward, waiter and busboy (about $200
for the trip). So we could also throw in a few hundred dollars of mad money.

This price ($2555.45 per person with the hotel in Vancouver) is really
great--they are doing some kind of special.  Holland America is much more and
a comparable cruise with no balcony is $2440).

I have a reservation for them which is good until Monday.  There is a $500
deposit required with the balance due 60 days before departure.

Let me know what you think--comments, etc.

Debbie
