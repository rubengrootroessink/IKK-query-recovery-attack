For Anne Miller, the breaking point came on a sweltering Monday night.=20
"That first day of the rolling blackouts when the heat hit, when I went to=

=20
Miller didn't want to squander electricity by switching on the air=20
conditioning in her Gold River home, but she wanted to sleep comfortably.=
=20
"I turned on the fan and had the windows open, and I lay there and listened=
=20
to all the air conditioners running," she recalled, "I thought, what's the=

Miller toughed it out, but later sent off a thoughtful e-mail to the=20
Sacramento Municipal Utility District, asking what good any one person's=20

Others are much angrier.=20

You could call this the work of energy snitches. Or you could call it the=

"It is fascinating that there is some kind of moral dimension to this whole=

It reminds Hackett of his childhood days during World War II, when he would=

he said. "Somebody should notice this and do something about it."=20

The Governor's Office of Emergency Services, which coordinates with local=

=20
For the most part, the governor's order is being enforced informally by=20

Utilities are headed down troubling path: The expansion frenzy may eventual=

United States, Canada and Mexico.
By James B. McClatchy

(Published May 14, 2001)=20

If privately owned utilities have their way, their expansion frenzy of rece=
nt=20
years will probably lead to a consolidation of ownership of electrical=20
generating and transmission lines into a few super-giant energy companies f=
or=20
all of the United States, Canada and maybe Mexico.=20
Their vision of what this would give them in the political and financial li=
fe=20
of these countries is breathtaking in its scope and boldness. Growth and=20
business issues dominate their thinking, and have since the electrical=20
industry began to form in the years just before 1900. What a greater golden=
=20
goal than to be the electricity kings of America?=20
The first private generating companies were small and inefficient. As time=
=20
went by, utility management became professional, and engineering improvemen=
ts=20
made them financial and political powerhouses. New York financial groups=20
became dominant in the industry, smothering or buying up competitors. Fraud=
=20
and violation of securities laws were common, as was the overcharging of=20
customers. High rates gave them giant profits. Corruption of public officia=
ls=20
was wholesale, finally becoming so grossly visible that private citizen=20
groups arose, demanding the right to organize publicly and locally owned=20
utilities.=20
This was the birth of the public-power movement. The disregard for honest=
=20
business practices and the public welfare, the venality, the threat to basi=
c=20
democratic values finally collapsed the structures those bandits created.=
=20
J.P. Morgan and Samuel Insull were the linchpins with holding companies tha=
t=20
owned most of the big utility companies in the United States. They used the=
ir=20
vast power to squash opposition, and the two of them were on their way to=
=20
dominate the electric utility industry in the United States when the Great=
=20
Depression arrived. Insull was overextended and his dream of a national=20
monopoly evaporated in bankruptcy, public disgrace and jail for a long list=
=20
of major crimes against his fellow citizens. Morgan survived.=20
The scandals that are being revealed these days in the energy business don'=
t=20
have the coarseness of the robber barons of those days. Publicly owned=20
corporations are mixed with a great variety of private ventures into a=20
growing web of interrelated businesses. It is an international mixture, wit=
h=20
these conglomerates increasing their size and activities all over the world=
.=20
U.S. names in Japan, Japanese names in Europe, German names in Asia, French=
=20
names in Latin America.=20
So our own Pacific Gas & Electric -- once the largest utility in the United=
=20
States -- is now only a cashless subsidiary of a holding company called PG&=
E.=20
The parent company sold off the utility's fossil-fuel generating plants,=20
sucked the cash out of their California subsidiary and has gone on to=20
continue its growth elsewhere.=20
Meanwhile, some old PG&E plants are now owned by Duke Energy, which started=
=20
as an electric utility in North Carolina but now operates power plants and=
=20
gas pipelines in other states and countries.=20
Where does public power fit into this depressing scene? It is as=20
conservative, American and traditional as apple pie. If it is broadly enoug=
h=20
accepted as a solution to the past excesses of utilities dominated by=20
financial institutions, then local ownership -- regional, city and otherwis=
e=20
-- could derail or limit the utilities' strategy of dominating an=20
international electricity grid covering the United States, Canada and who=
=20
knows where else.=20
Impossible? Not at all. The utilities are run by persons with brilliant=20
minds, big ambitions and appetites for profit, and access to enormous=20

Boom Days on the Plains=20



Hunt for energy turns to methane-rich Wyoming, unsettling ranchers who fear=
=20
for impact on land
By Steve Schmidt=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 13, 2001=20
SPOTTED HORSE, Wyo. -- William Friday West is 68. Grew up here. Courted his=
=20
bride here. Married and had kids here, on a grassy homestead with a=20
bullet-riddled mailbox.=20
He thought he'd seen all a seasoned rancher could see, until some young buc=
ks=20
stopped by his weather-beaten ranch house one fall.=20
They had a deal for him, they said. He'd make good money, they said. Just=
=20
sign here.=20















He did, and more men came to this hiccup of a town -- drillers and=20
shed-builders and grubby roustabouts with their bulldozers and backhoes and=
=20
pickups with out-of-state plates.=20
The nation's desperate hunt for energy begins here as well as anywhere, in=
=20
the gullet of rural America, under an old rancher's porch.=20
But the search is also dogged by controversy.=20
Deep under the rolling plains are pools of natural gas so vast they make=20
Arctic oil look like chump bait. Inventors, Texas oilmen, even ex-shoe=20
salesmen are storming northeast Wyoming to suck the methane from waterlogge=
d=20
coal beds.=20
Fortunes hang on the new process. Geologists figure that mining just 15=20
percent of the nation's coal-bed methane will produce a trillion-dollar=20
bonanza.=20
Not only that, but hundreds of new power plants planned across the nation,=
=20
from New York to Otay Mesa, will need coal-bed fuel and other natural gases=
=20
to run.=20
But in Wyoming, many ranchers and conservationists say runoff water from=20
methane mining stunts crops, kills trees and spikes rivers and wells with=
=20
high levels of salt.=20
It's reshaping ranch life, too.=20
Much of Wyoming remains remote and raw, a land of wood-paneled roadhouses a=
nd=20
cattle amid oceans of alfalfa. Ranchers relish being off the beaten path.=
=20
Now it seems like every guy with a drilling rig and a dream is moving in,=
=20
erecting power lines and pump sheds and stripping the place of peace.=20
"Everything has changed so much in such a short time," West says. "It's har=
d=20
on a person."=20

??
Even before the energy chaos in California, things were going great guns=20
around Spotted Horse. Most everyone wanted a piece of the gas mining boom.=
=20
Now look at it.=20
Drillers and other field workers pack the motels and trailer parks.=20
Once-lonely roadhouses are jumping. Hundreds of miles of new power lines la=
ce=20
the oatmeal-colored plains of the sprawling Powder River Basin.=20















"California's hurting real bad so things are going all wacko around here,"=
=20
says Randy Frank, 41, who builds pump sheds.=20
Frank struck out for Wyoming last year in his rusty, 1976 Chevy Malibu afte=
r=20
selling Kinney Shoes in North Dakota.=20
He lives in a trailer park and clears $700 a week, more than he ever made=
=20
peddling high heels.=20
The Powder River boom began about three years ago when the technology was=
=20
perfected to extract methane sealed in shallow coal beds. With natural gas=
=20
prices near an all-time high, the hunt for coal-bed methane also rages in=
=20
Colorado and New Mexico.=20
More than 8,600 wells have been drilled in the river basin, with thousands=
=20
more planned. About 80 coal-bed methane companies operate in the region.=20
Many of the companies report fat profits, and some of the nation's largest=
=20
energy firms are staking claims in the region.=20
"I don't see how we could be in a better spot," says Steve McNelly, who wor=
ks=20
for a methane company, Well Completion of Gillette, Wyo.=20
The state of Wyoming last year projected a $183 million deficit. Now it's=
=20
enjoying a $700 million surplus, largely because of royalties from methane.=
=20
California's surplus has shriveled in recent months because of the energy=
=20
mess.=20
Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer recently told Congress that his state's energy=20
potential is huge. "We have it. America needs it," he said.=20
This is Dick Cheney country to boot. The vice president is from Wyoming. As=
 a=20
young man, he worked in the backcountry, erecting power lines.=20
Now Cheney chairs President Bush's energy task force. The panel will make=
=20
long-range recommendations this week for solving the energy crunch.=20
Critics complain that Bush, a former oilman, is too cozy with the energy=20
industry. Others welcome him, dismissing President Clinton as a tree-hugger=
.=20
Wyoming has a history of mining booms, in oil and coal.=20
But this boom, nervous ranchers say, is radically different.=20

??
To get the gas out, miners must draw water from the coal beds. Each well=20
produces about 12,000 gallons of water a day, much of it high in salt.=20
The impact can be jarring. This spring, runoff water from neighboring wells=
=20
flooded William West's ranch, killing creekside Cottonwoods and about 100=
=20
acres of hay. Some of the ground sits bare and bleached.=20
"We're extremely worried," says his wife, Marge West. "This water is going =
to=20
kill the land."=20
Gary Beach, Wyoming's chief of water quality, says the salty water tends to=
=20
destroy the soil's chemical structure. "It starves plants for water," he=20
says.=20
Rancher Ed Swartz says that is what's happening at his homestead. "It just=
=20
makes you sick," he says.=20
But coal-bed companies say they often work with landowners to soften the=20
impact. Some pipe the water into man-made ponds. Others inject it back into=

Summer blackout forecasts still hazy=20




By Karen Kucher=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 13, 2001=20
This promises to be a summer of uncertainty.=20
Rolling blackouts pummeled the state twice last week when grid managers cam=
e=20
up short on energy supplies, and power was cut off to thousands of business=
es=20
and residents.=20
With summer near, everyone is wondering how regular this routine will becom=
e.=20
But there are no clear answers.=20
"It is going to be a great soap opera," said consumer advocate Michael=20
Shames. "We are calling this 'our summer of disconnect.'?"=20
Predictions abound. One often-repeated estimate is that the lights will go=
=20
out on 30 to 35 days, an educated guess based on last year's consumption=20
levels. One local fire chief said he had heard that blackouts would hit two=
=20
to three days a week.=20
But the agency that manages the state's electricity grid has issued no such=
=20
estimates.=20
Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operato=
r,=20
said blackout predictions are springing up like urban myths, taking on the=
=20
ring of truth with repetition.=20
The real truth, she said, is that no one can say how often the lights will =
go=20
out or for how long. It depends on the weather, the daily fluctuations in t=
he=20
wholesale electricity market, how much conservation takes place and whether=
=20
power plants run steadily or suffer mechanical breakdowns.=20
"You can understand the dynamics here," O'Donley said. "We have to play the=
=20
cards we are dealt that day, and we will definitely do the best to locate=
=20
enough resources and try, but it is going to be a challenge."=20
Grid managers say blackouts are possible on days when consumption exceeds=
=20
40,000 megawatts. The state exceeded that level on 34 days last summer.=20
But that measuring stick isn't a strict standard.=20
Just this past week, blackouts were ordered on two days when peak usage was=
=20
about 34,000 megawatts. Enough power couldn't be bought to meet demand, and=
=20
about one-third of the state's generating capacity was unavailable because =
of=20
breakdowns or planned maintenance.=20
California got into this crisis after its 1996 deregulation plan went=20
terribly wrong. The wholesale price of power skyrocketed, and=20
electricity-generating capacity suddenly was inadequate to meet growing=20
demand.=20
Critics of deregulation say electricity suppliers, who have posted huge=20
corporate profits from the higher electricity prices, manipulated the marke=
t=20
and made the supply situation worse.=20
Power suppliers say California, which did not build any new generating plan=
ts=20
in a dozen years, simply does not have enough supply, a situation they say =
is=20
worsened by a reduction in the availability of hydroelectric power from the=
=20
Pacific Northwest. The suppliers also say increased demands on California's=
=20
aging system of power plants are responsible for the historically high leve=
l=20
of facility outages.=20
Shames, who heads the Utility Consumers' Action Network, said he expects=20
power emergencies to be declared all summer long.=20
It wasn't a good sign that just a few days of warm weather pushed the state=
=20
beyond its tight energy supplies, he said, adding: "It is pretty clear to m=
e=20
that we are going to see through May, June, July and probably into August=
=20
almost continual Stage 2 situations. So much of this depends on Mother=20
Nature."=20
On that front, weather forecasters say not to expect any miracles.=20
A statewide 90-day forecast for California says June, July and August shoul=
d=20
hit normal summer temperatures.=20
Imperial County, eastern Riverside and eastern San Bernardino counties are=
=20
expected to average about half a degree above normal. The average in San=20
Diego and Los Angeles counties and in western Riverside and western San=20
Bernardino counties will be about two-tenths of a degree above normal.=20
While those changes are significant for meteorologists, they probably won't=
=20
make much of a difference for most state residents.=20
"You won't be able to feel the difference," said Philip Gonsalves, a=20
meteorologist intern for the National Weather Service. "If you normally set=
=20
your thermostat to 72 degrees and you set it at 74, that's a bigger=20
difference than what we are anticipating."=20
The ISO has predicted California will be short nearly 3,700 megawatts next=
=20
month, enough to provide power to more than 2.7 million homes.=20
Gov. Gray Davis had hoped to have 5,000 additional megawatts online by July=
=20
to help meet that shortfall, but many of those plants have been delayed.=20
The California Energy Commission says 2,100 megawatts of new power generati=
on=20
is expected to be online by July, far less than what state officials had=20
wanted. By September, about 5,200 megawatts should be operational.=20
"We are doing everything we can to get new generation online," said Claudia=
=20
Chandler, assistant executive director of the commission, which approves ne=
w=20
power plants in the state. "It is disappointing to us that all of them won'=
t=20
be available earlier in the summer."=20
Chandler said there have been delays in getting emergency peaking facilitie=
s=20
built. Peaker plants are small, relatively inefficient plants used only=20
during periods of high electricity demand.=20
"Those applications just didn't come in as early as we needed," Chandler=20
said. "It took a while before we saw the first peaker application come into=
=20
the process. .?.?. The good news is we are going to have a problem next=20
summer, too, and all this generation will be ready for next summer's demand=
."=20
Uncertainty about the electricity market has people rearranging the way the=
y=20
do business.=20
Scientists at local biotechnology companies put off experiments on days whe=
n=20
outages are considered possible, said Joe Panetta, president and chief=20
executive of BioCom, a local biotech trade association.=20
"They are announced, and on the surface they seem to appear to only be a=20
nuisance," he said. "But what we are finding is that you essentially have t=

Panetta said business leaders have been asking for utilities to provide=20

=20
can be made.=20
"We are talking a day's notice at least so we have the chance to juggle som=
e=20
things around at the companies well in advance," he said.=20
Because of concerns like that, state lawmakers last week discussed planning=

daily outages to drive down the price of power and to provide consumers a=

more predictable pattern of blackouts. Some suggested that the state=20

Natural-gas price at prime entry site rose 489 percent

From March 2000 through February 2001, the price at a critical market entry=

Californians to pay by far the highest natural-gas prices in the nation.=20
The skyrocketing price of natural gas has been felt by many ratepayers in=

Communities Fighting $270-Million Power Line=20


By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer=20

?????ROMOLAND, Calif.--It has all the trappings of a parochial,=20
not-in-my-backyard brouhaha: anxiety over property values, the environment=
=20
and local business.
?????But the subject of this particular debate--a proposed $270-million=20
electricity transmission line starting in this scrubby outpost of chicken=
=20
wire, strip mall churches and tumbleweeds--has ominous implications for all=
=20
of California.
?????Effectively using California's energy crisis as ammunition, San Diego=
=20
Gas & Electric Co. wants to build the 500,000-volt line through 31 miles of=
=20
bluffs, parks, wilderness and neighborhoods in southwest Riverside County.
?????That has prompted a boisterous response from area residents, who have=
=20
countered with door-to-door campaigns and picket lines--and challenged the=
=20
very notion, an article of faith in the energy industry, that additional=20
power lines are needed to dig the state out of its energy crisis.
?????"We're not human beings to them," said Loma Bosinger, co-chairwoman of=
=20
Save Southwest Riverside County, formed in response to the SDG&E proposal.=
=20
"We're nuisances. We're red tape."
?????SDG&E and other energy companies say that although the lack of=20
generators in California is the most pressing component of the crisis, a la=
ck=20
of power transmission lines also is a key contributor. During the state's=
=20
first round of rolling blackouts in January, Northern and Central Californi=
a=20
suffered largely because of a transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley=
.
?????The gaps in generation and transmission mean that California's=20
once-sturdy energy grid has become a fussy, delicate contraption, said Jim=
=20
Avery, SDG&E's senior vice president of fuel and power operations.
?????"If one part gets out of balance, it can take down the whole system,"=
=20
Avery said.
?????Neighborhoods along the proposed route of the so-called Valley Rainbow=
=20
Interconnect, through dusty Hemet and the wine country of Temecula, aren't=
=20
convinced that California's situation is quite so dire.
?????They point out that SDG&E first pitched the line last summer by saying=
=20
that it was needed to provide power to the San Diego area--because state=20
energy officials believe that demand in the region will begin exceeding=20
current deliveries in 2004, which would mean blackouts. More recently,=20
though, SDG&E has begun pitching the new transmission line as a system to=
=20
export electricity from new generators in the San Diego area to the rest of=
=20
the state power grid.
?????SDG&E insists that those two arguments do not conflict. But residents=
=20
have found the company's position disingenuous at best. And what seemed a=
=20
neighborhood tiff has become something more, widely seen as a harbinger of=
=20
scuffles to come as California confronts its power crisis.
?????The state already has 26,000 miles of electric transmission lines. And=
=20
in the next four years--according to the California Independent System=20
Operator, the agency that oversees the state grid--74 transmission-line=20
construction projects are expected so energy companies can meet state and=

federal reliability standards.
?????More lines will be added purely for economic gain, said Armando Perez,=
=20
director of grid planning for Cal-ISO, and similar battles are expected to=

?????"But what you will see is that the power companies are going to be usi=

=20
again and again."
?????In coming months, politics may further complicate the debate.
?????In Washington, the task force developing a national energy=20
strategy--headed by Vice President Dick Cheney--is reportedly weighing a mo=
ve=20
to give federal authorities the power of eminent domain to acquire private=
=20
land for new electrical transmission lines.
?????And in Sacramento, Assemblyman Dennis Hollingsworth (R-Murrieta) has=
=20
proposed a bill that would require state energy officials and utilities to=

use public land for transmission lines before they would be allowed to=20
acquire private property. That bill, which awaits votes in two Assembly=20
committees in coming weeks, targets not only future transmission lines but=
=20
the proposed line in southern Riverside County, Hollingsworth said.
?????"I object to the fact that private property is looked at as the path o=

?????In Riverside County, community leaders say they have a series of=20
concerns about the SDG&E proposal. Some are worried that the line will mar=

the picturesque bluffs of the region, which could in turn hurt its ability =

?????In Hemet, residents are enraged that the transmission line apparently=

Bush Tax Incentives Fuel Plan on Energy=20

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--President Bush on Saturday called for a "new kind of=20

technology, signaling a shift in tone as he prepares to unveil his long-ran=

energy policy.
?????Bush=01,s focus on conservation in his weekly radio address follows=20
criticism that he and Vice President Dick Cheney have been drafting a plan=
=20
that is heavily weighted toward more oil and gas drilling while giving shor=

shrift to other approaches to the energy problem.
?????In a clear response to such attacks, Bush pledged that conservation=20

?????However, rather than call for Americans to sacrifice, as President=20
Carter did during the energy crisis of the 1970s, Bush said, "Some think=20
conservation means doing without. That does not have to be the case."
?????Conservation, he said, can be achieved through technological innovatio=

such as building sensors into buildings to shut off lights as soon as peopl=

?????"Over the long term, the most effective way to conserve energy is by=

administration=01,s energy plan."
?????Bush=01,s stress on conservation seemed to contrast with recent commen=
ts by=20
Cheney, who has been in charge of drafting the energy policy. In a recent=
=20
speech, Cheney said, "Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it=
=20
is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy."
?????Energy conservation advocates, although welcoming Bush=01,s comments, =
noted=20
that the administration has adopted less stringent energy-efficiency=20
standards for home central air conditioners than those advocated by the=20
Clinton administration. The Bush administration contended that the standard=
s=20
proposed by Clinton set too high a burden on consumers.
?????David M. Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a=20
Washington-based coalition of business, consumer, government and=20
environmental leaders, called Bush=01,s emphasis on conservation a "great=

start," and he said it reflected a "change in tone from where [the=20
administration] has been in the past."
?????However, Nemtzow added, "There needs to be a lot more."
?????Bush, who has been criticized by California officials for not doing mo=

said.=20
?????But Gov. Gray Davis, reacting to Bush=01,s address, assailed the White=
=20
House for refusing to back firm price controls on wholesale electricity=20

from building power plants.
?????California last week had to pay $2,000 a megawatt hour for electricity=

up from $30 a year earlier, Davis said in a statement. The power supplier, =
he=20
noted, was a Texas energy company.
?????"I hope that President Bush and I can agree that any worthy energy=20
policy must address the price gouging of consumers by greedy energy=20

State buffer on blackouts near limit=20
Program that lets big businesses curb energy use almost exhausted=20

While some of California's biggest energy users cut their power last week t=
o=20
keep the lights on in the rest of the state, the program that provides that=
=20
emergency help is almost out of business.=20
Most of the state's 1,600 or so "interruptible customers," who agree to=20
short-notice power cuts in return for lower energy costs, were asked to shu=
t=20
down four times last week as demand for electricity rose in the hot weather=
=20
and supply was constricted by planned and unplanned generator shutdowns.=20
But there are strict limits on how often those customers can be turned to=
=20
during the year -- and the state is fast approaching those limits.=20
"There are only about eight more times we can call on them this year," said=
=20
Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System=20
Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid.=20
QUOTAS NEARLY FULL
The situation is especially bad in Northern and Central California, where a=
ll=20
but a handful of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s 170 interruptible customers=
=20
have already reached their quotas for the year.=20
"These customers are mostly big manufacturers, food processors and companie=
s=20
like that," said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman. "The ISO called on us a=
=20
lot."=20
With the state's creaky, overworked power system poised on the knife's edge=
=20
between demand and capacity, the interruptible customers often are all that=
=20
keep the system from tipping over into rolling blackouts.=20
"They are a huge, huge help," McCorkle said.=20
Last Monday, for example, the ISO ordered interruptible customers to cut=20
their loads shortly after 10 a.m. Within 30 minutes, the power crunch had=
=20
started to ease, as about 900 megawatts of demand dropped out of the system=
.=20
That's enough power to supply 900,000 homes.=20
It wasn't until late in the afternoon, when those companies reached their=
=20
six-hour daily limit and were allowed to power back up, that an hourlong=20
blackout became necessary.=20
Thursday, the cooperation of interruptible customers meant blackouts were=
=20
never called.=20
DIFFICULTIES FOR CUSTOMERS
The power cuts aren't easy for the businesses ordered to make them.=20
Hanson Permanente Cement in Pleasanton is one of the companies that already=
=20
has used up its voluntary blackout hours for the year.=20
"In January, the outages essentially put us out of business," said Earl=20
Bouse, who runs the company. "It put us in a situation where we couldn't ma=
ke=20
product."=20
The plant, which has 200 employees and operates 24 hours a day, gets only a=
=20
half-hour's notice to shut down. That means the kilns have to be powered=20
down, machinery turned off and the lights dimmed. Only a minimal amount of=
=20
power remains online.=20
But even when the lights come back on, things don't immediately return to=
=20
normal, Bouse said.=20
"If we're down for four hours, it's another 20 hours before we're up and=20
running at capacity," he said.=20
In exchange for the headaches -- and lost business -- the cement company pa=
ys=20
an electricity rate that is 15 to 20 percent below what PG&E normally=20
charges. That is a major incentive for a company where power makes up about=
=20
15 percent of its total costs.=20
"For companies paying a $10 million electricity bill, that's a savings of $=
2=20
million a year," Homrig said.=20
For years, it was even a better deal. Although the interruptible power=20
program has existed since the mid-1980s, the power was almost never=20
interrupted. Companies signing up for the program have received $2 billion =
in=20
reduced rates since 1990, but until recently they never had to turn off the=
ir=20
lights.=20
From 1992 to 1999, for example, PG&E's interruptible customers were asked t=
o=20
cut power only 19 times. Southern California Edison, which has the bulk of=
=20
the interruptible companies, had only four curtailments, all in 1998.=20
When the power crunch hit last year, everything changed. Both PG&E and Edis=
on=20
called for power interruptions 20 times, and their customers started=20
screaming.=20
"It was an emergency capacity program, and no one expected we'd have so man=
y=20
emergencies," said Lynda Ziegler, an Edison executive.=20
A report by the state Public Utilities Commission in February was more=20
specific.=20
"Numerous customers, including some schools and hospitals, 'gamed' Edison's=
=20
tariffs," the PUC said. They figured that they could get the lower rate and=
=20
never have to cut power.=20
When Edison ordered the power shutdowns last year, only 62 percent of their=
=20
interruptible customers complied, despite signed contracts with the utility=
.=20
With PG&E, the compliance level was 96 percent.=20
NONCOMPLIERS TO THE SOUTH
Many of the Edison customers "are unwilling or unable to lower their energy=
=20
use when requested," the PUC report concluded.=20
In 2000, Edison hit noncompliers with $92.4 million in penalties and PG&E=
=20
ordered $2.2 million in fines. Millions of dollars more were assessed this=
=20
year before threats of lawsuits, potential legislative action and howls fro=
m=20
California manufacturers persuaded the PUC to order the fines suspended lat=
e=20
in January. Much of the money probably will be returned.=20
Because of the controversy surrounding the interruptible program, state pow=
er=20
officials are trying to have a new, more flexible system in place by June.=
=20
The new program allows companies to cut only part of their electrical load=
=20
and limits the blackouts to four hours a day and 10 days a month.=20
"We're trying to get (customers representing) another 400 megawatts signed=
=20
up," Homrig said. "That's the same as we have for the current program."=20
Without the help an interruptible user program provides, California residen=
ts=20
could be spending a lot more time in the dark this summer, ISO officials=20
warned.=20
"(Interruptibles) have always been a buffer," said Jim McIntosh, the ISO's=

director of operations. "When I don't have that buffer, we'll move to almos=
t=20
instant blackouts."=20

What makes this little network of steel and cables, owned by power giant El=

something El Paso adamantly denies.=20
But none of that matters much to the squad of nearly two dozen El Paso=20

El Paso Energy was facing ruin.=20
It was the mid-'90s, and California's energy overseers were sure deregulati=
on=20
was going to drive the cost of natural gas through the floor. So Pacific Ga=
s=20
and Electric Co., with the happy acquiescence of the state, dumped a huge,=
=20
long-term gas contract with El Paso.=20
For the state, the decision was a no-brainer: PG&E was buying more space on=
=20
gas pipelines than it needed.=20
For El Paso, though, it was a disaster. The company started handing out pin=
k=20
slips like they were candy.=20
But in the long run, it wasn't El Paso that would end up on its knees. It=
=20
would be PG&E and the state of California.=20
That pipeline space that the utility and regulators saw as unnecessary woul=
d=20
soon become precious -- and El Paso, led by a law-sharp chairman with=20
bare-knuckle smarts, would turn itself into the biggest natural gas firm in=
=20
the world.=20
So big, in fact, that in the eyes of vengeance-minded lawmakers and=20
regulators, El Paso has become a poster monster for how Californians came t=
o=20
be plagued by rolling blackouts and sky-high energy bills.=20
"They didn't mind seeing all of us at El Paso being dealt a terrible blow=
=20
back then," said Randy Wu, an El Paso manager then. "And now . . . well,=20
let's just say they should have planned better." -- -- --=20
It's not like El Paso was some new kid on the block.=20
The company was founded in Texas in 1928 and stayed a local concern until=
=20
1947, when it laid out 700 miles of pipeline to deliver gas to California.=
=20
It grew steadily from there until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided=
=20
El Paso was getting too big and ordered it to divest its pipeline holdings =
in=20
the Northwest. That set off a long tumble that William Wise, who had starte=
d=20
at the company as a general counsel in 1970, set out to reverse when he too=
k=20
over as president in 1989.=20
Wise, a 56-year-old whose lean build reflects both his passion for running=
=20
and his reputation for driving himself hard, is a rare bird in the world of=
=20
oil.=20
The University of Colorado law school graduate has mastered both the legal=
=20
side of his "litigious" industry, as he once called it, and its hardball=20
economic strategies -- skills he honed by surfing the bust-boom cycles of h=
is=20
business at its epicenter, Texas.=20
Those skills came in handy when El Paso got the hammer blow from PG&E in 19=
96=20
and 1997.=20
PG&E had been buying extra space on pipelines crossing into the state at th=
e=20
Arizona ghost town of Topock -- enough to import a whopping 1.1 billion cub=
ic=20
feet of natural gas a day.=20
The trouble for El Paso was that when PG&E dropped the contract for the=20
pipeline space, $170 million of the company's annual revenue was erased.=20
"It seemed like everyone thought the company was toast," said Wu, the forme=
r=20
El Paso manager. "Of course, California didn't care at all."=20
But Patrick Power, the attorney hired by El Paso to plead the pipeline=20
company's case before the state Public Utilities Commission back in 1996,=
=20
could see trouble looming for the state.=20
If PG&E and other utilities didn't keep the pipeline capacity to meet futur=
e=20
needs, he warned, they would probably regret it later. His words fell on de=
af=20
ears.=20
"The mentality at the PUC, PG&E and Southern California Gas was, 'This will=
=20
be El Paso's problem,' " Power said. -- -- --=20
Wise reacted to the loss of the PG&E contract by taking no salary himself f=
or=20
a year and freezing his executives' pay, Wu said. While laying off more tha=
n=20
one-third of the company's workers, he and his staff negotiated a hefty=20
settlement from PG&E and other companies in exchange for their having dropp=
ed=20
the pipeline space.=20
Then Wise set off on a plan to absorb other pipeline companies so he could=
=20
expand his system of delivering natural gas throughout the United States.=
=20
"Bill Wise knew California had turned its back on the company, so he had to=
=20
get creative," Wu said of Wise, who has declined interview requests from Th=
e=20
Chronicle.=20
"Attorneys generally don't have a lot of common sense in my mind, but Bill =
-=20
- he's got extra," said former El Paso Mayor Larry Francis. "He cuts his=20
losses in a hurry, and he recognizes when he has to move on. And so he=20
moved."=20
Within a few years, Wise stretched the now Houston-based company to full=20
"wellhead to wire" operations, running everything from natural gas drilling=
=20
to electric generation plants. Before El Paso embarked on this expansion,=
=20
California constituted fully two-thirds of El Paso's natural gas sales --=
=20
much of that to PG&E.=20
The strategy was that if the state was going to ditch El Paso, El Paso woul=
d=20
make sure its reach became so extended in other directions that it would=20
never be dependent on one market again.=20
Wise's company scooped up interests in 40 electric power plants in 11 state=
s=20
by April 2000. Along the way, it spent billions acquiring enough pipeline=
=20
companies to spread the El Paso reach along 58,000 miles of pipe nationwide=
,=20
from Bakersfield to Boston.=20
"The company was a very traditional gas company until then," said Fred=20
Pickel, a Los Angeles energy consultant who has observed El Paso since the=
=20
1970s. "Wise, though, understands the street-level complexities of the=20
business, and what he had the company do was partly smart and partly logic.=
=20
"He was just able to see the possibilities that nobody here in California w=
as=20
able to see."=20
But some believe that what El Paso did to take advantage of those=20
possibilities took unfair advantage of California.=20
In his cluttered downtown San Francisco office at the PUC, staff attorney=
=20
Harvey Morris thought he "smelled a rat" as long as three years ago.=20
Morris, a natty 47-year-old graduate of Boalt Hall School of Law, takes on=
=20
the look of a determined terrier when he outlines his suspicions about El=
=20
Paso -- and he's been carrying that look a long time now.=20
After losing PG&E, El Paso leased the utility's entire block of pipeline=20
capacity to another Texas gas and electricity giant, Dynegy. Gas experts we=
re=20
stunned that one firm would bid for all that space -- but they, and Morris,=
=20
were even more surprised by what followed.=20
Dynegy didn't behave the way PG&E and California officials had expected=20
energy companies to behave in the era of deregulation.=20
Like PG&E, Dynegy didn't need all that pipeline space to serve its own=20
customers. But unlike what PG&E did when confronted with all that extra=20
space, Dynegy didn't resell it at a huge discount. In fact, Dynegy didn't=
=20
sell any of the space. Instead, it raised the price so high that seemingly=
=20
nobody wanted to buy it.=20
Competing gas marketers were alarmed. They suspected that Dynegy was=20
collaborating with El Paso to constrict the supply of gas flowing into=20
California so prices would rise. Great for anyone with space reserved on th=
e=20
pipeline -- but disastrous for those left out in the cold.=20
In 1998, having convinced his bosses at the PUC that what El Paso was doing=
=20
on the Dynegy contract was anticompetitive, Morris filed the first of many=
=20
complaints with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He's still pursui=
ng=20
them.=20
As it turned out, spot prices didn't rise while Dynegy held the contract; g=
as=20
shippers could still find space on other pipelines for less money. Dynegy l=
et=20
the contract lapse in late 1999.=20
Not long afterward, the pipeline contract wound up with El Paso's market=20
affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy. And that's when things started to get=
=20
really serious, Morris says.=20
El Paso's own marketing arm now controlled more pipeline space heading into=
=20
Southern California than any other trader by far -- just as the demand for=
=20
gas was about to soar.=20
In his many filings, in which the PUC has been joined by Southern Californi=
a=20
Edison and others, Morris contends that El Paso Merchant Energy prevented=
=20
pipeline space from being used.=20
"They basically kept so much of the capacity to themselves, the prices went=
=20
through the roof," he said. "It was the same as closing off part of the=20
pipeline."=20
El Paso officials, for their part, say market rates started soaring in 2000=
=20
simply because the demand for gas overwhelmed supply. They say they never=
=20
charged more than what industry rules allowed, and that attempts to prove=
=20
otherwise are preposterous.=20
And thus far, except for a mild rebuke here and there on technicalities, th=
e=20
free-market-minded Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has not concluded t=
he=20
company did anything wrong -- though a commission hearing is set for tomorr=
ow=20
on the latest allegations filed by PG&E, Edison and the PUC.=20
Edison estimates that El Paso's "manipulation" at Topock jacked up rates al=
l=20
over the industry so badly that state gas buyers had to pay $3.8 billion mo=
re=20
than they should have just in the past year.=20
Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that gas prices in California have=
=20
been anywhere from two to 10 times as expensive as on the other side of the=
=20
border in Arizona, and in almost every other state.=20
Once prices started to rise at Topock, gas marketers throughout California=
=20
followed suit -- and the ripple spread quickly.=20
Gas prices for consumers started going up. The rise also propelled=20
electricity costs skyward, because three out of every five electricity plan=
ts=20
in California run on natural gas.=20
The firms that own those plants then jacked up electricity prices to the=20
utilities, like PG&E, which had shed many of their own plants as part of=20
deregulation.=20
The problem for PG&E and other utilities is that they couldn't pass those=
=20
higher electricity costs on to their customers, because electricity rates=
=20
were still regulated.=20
So the red ink started to gush, in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And=
,=20
with gas prices still higher here than anywhere else, it is still gushing.=
=20
But not for El Paso. -- -- --=20
El Paso Energy rose from its financial emergency in 1996 to become not just=
 a=20
survivor, but a $50 billion behemoth involved in virtually every aspect of=
=20
the energy industry in California and much of the rest of the United States=
.=20
The company, renamed El Paso Corp. this February, is now practically printi=
ng=20
money. The company's revenue shot from $1 billion in 1995 to $22 billion la=
st=20
year; its profit last year alone was $652 million, its highest ever. Wise's=
=20
compensation package reportedly totaled $20 million.=20
And it's not just with gas that El Paso is making its money. Among its=20
holdings are 19 small power plants serving PG&E and Southern California=20
Edison.=20
Under El Paso's contracts, the price of that electricity automatically rise=
s=20
when the price of gas rises. That's true even at the power plants that don'=
t=20
use any natural gas.=20
All told, in just a bit more than one year alone, consultants for Edison sa=
y=20
El Paso earned an extra $85 million thanks to electricity produced by those=
=20
plants.=20
And all this is blossoming for El Paso while PG&E wallows in bankruptcy=20
court, billions of dollars in debt with no relief in sight.=20
The one cloud on El Paso's horizon: A host of California legislators,=20
industry experts and state regulators suspect that El Paso's sunny profit=
=20
picture owes a lot to what happened with that huge block of space on El=20
Paso's natural gas pipeline that PG&E had been so happy to surrender.=20
The hearing before federal regulators is looming tomorrow, and just last=20
month the state Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight dragged three top=
=20
El Paso executives -- but not Wise -- to Sacramento to testify on the matte=
r.=20
It was the first time the company has ever felt such heat in this state. An=
d=20
though the executives grimly waved off reporters' questions as they strode=
=20
from the room, company spokeswoman Norma Dunn stayed behind to insist that=
=20
the accusations will blow over, "because there's nothing to them.=20
"The thing to remember is that we have been in this state for more than 50=
=20
years, and we want to continue being here," Dunn said. "We take this matter=
=20
very seriously. . . . We want to be cooperative."=20
Accusations that El Paso caused price spikes by maneuvering to hold pipelin=
e=20
space hostage amount to "nothing but conspiracy theories," she said.=20
The Assembly panel, however, concluded that both El Paso and Dynegy had=20
manipulated the market at an enormous cost to California consumers.=20
"The numbers tell the truth," the subcommittee said in a report obtained by=
=20
The Chronicle. "The exorbitant prices cannot be defined away by regulators=
=20
and bureaucrats, or explained away by corporate lawyers' wordplay." The=20
report was produced by three Assembly Democrats and two Republicans.=20
Wise, when he addresses the accusations, says he is mystified why state=20
lawmakers are mad. He points to company plans to expand pipelines heading=
=20
here and to even build a power plant at San Francisco International Airport=
.=20
When it comes to California, "El Paso has always tried to be a part of the=
=20
solution, not the problem," he told a gas industry newsletter in December.=
=20
State lawmakers' attempts to pry extensive hard numbers from El Paso have=
=20
been met with resistance from the company, which calls them proprietary=20
information. And judging by Morris' experience, chasing El Paso to the grou=
nd=20
may take the Legislature quite a while, if that's what it decides it wants =
to=20
do.=20
Morris found that as he filed complaint after complaint against the company=
,=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would either rule against the PUC =
or=20
put the filings off so long that they were moot when they came up.=20
The Assembly subcommittee's report was scathing in regard to the commission=
,=20
saying its approval of El Paso pipeline contracts "raises serious questions=
=20
about whether it met its statutory duty under the federal Natural Gas Act t=
o=20
protect consumers from unjust and unreasonable rates."=20
The commission did not send anyone to the Assembly hearings and has refused=
=20
to comment on its rulings.=20
By the time the El Paso Merchant Energy contract expires May 31, opening th=
e=20
crucial block of pipeline capacity to what critics say is true competition=
=20
for the first time in more than three years, it will be far too late, Morri=
s=20
said.=20
"The damage was done long ago," Morris said. The state and its utilities ar=
e=20
on the hook for billions in debt, money for last winter's bills has already=
=20
left consumers' pockets -- and regulators fear prices are unlikely to come=
=20
down soon.=20
"The market got set, and now we're in trouble," Morris said. -- -- --=20
PG&E, for its part, sees the whole mess through the eyes of a victim.=20
The utility had paid $560 million to hold its excess El Paso capacity from=
=20
1993 to 1997, and the PUC had forbidden the company to recover $167 million=
=20
of that through customer rates. And in 1996, the PUC and ratepayers were=20
clamoring for lower power bills, and there was a huge amount of pipeline=20
space in the state that wasn't being used.=20
So when you're trying to cut costs, what better to cut than something you=
=20
don't need? said Dan Thomas, PG&E's director of gas transmission.=20
"I still think it was the right decision to relinquish the capacity," he=20
said.=20
Still, there's no denying the numbers. At latest count, PG&E owed El Paso=
=20
more than $150 million for gas and electricity.=20
As Morris sees it, El Paso is "this big, 800-pound gorilla at the border an=
d=20
can limit supplies as they wish. It's outrageous, and there wasn't a thing=
=20
anybody could do to stop them."=20
El Paso officials, of course, put it differently.=20
"All we did was good business, smart business, and people keep dishing dirt=
=20
about us, but we just don't see ourselves in it," company spokesman Mel Sco=
tt=20
said.=20
"It's pretty obvious to the analysts and to us that California set up this=

faulty deregulation system, and if (PG&E and Southern California utilities)=
=20
had been in their right minds and signed up for long-term natural gas=20
contracts back in 1996 and 1997, they wouldn't be in this trouble."=20
Nobody official at El Paso is publicly gloating, but pleasure over the turn=
=20
of events is never far from the surface. Those who can speak more freely=20
don't mind putting the boot in a bit.=20
"Everything bad that's happening right now (in the pipeline fight) could ha=

Wu said. "But I have yet to hear anyone in this state say that.=20
"In fact, I have yet to hear anyone even at PG&E say that, and that's sad."=

What it all comes down to is this: El Paso figured out how to play=20

Most analysts cite the dramatic jump in gas-fired electricity generation in=
=20
recent years as the major factor causing current supply constraints.=20
Information analyzed from Boulder, Colo.-based RDI's POWERdat series=20
indicates this growth trend is starting to level out.=20

In contrast, 2000 saw a slight increase of both coal and oil for electric=
=20
power generation, suggesting that fuel switching and consequent natural gas=
=20
demand destruction may play a growing role in power markets.=20

"The demand side of the story appears to be a bit confused, but one thing=
=20
that's clear from this past winter is that more fuel switching to liquids=
=20
occurred than most of us thought possible in such a short period of time,"=
=20
said EOG Resources CEO Mark Papa during a recent conference call with=20
investors.=20

Despite the disproportionately low natural gas supply response relative to=
=20
rig count increases, RDI data, along with bullish underground natural gas=
=20
storage levels, may be early indications that the gas market is inching=20
toward equilibrium.=20

Natural gas burn slows
The U.S. consumed about 6,555 trillion British thermal units (Btus) of=20
natural gas for electricity generation in 2000, an increase of about 616=20
trillion Btus over 1999 levels. This is in sharp contrast to the previous=
=20
year's extraordinary jump of 2,631 trillion Btus.=20

In 2000, the 487 TWh of power generated from natural gas accounted for abou=
t=20
14% of the nation's total. This was not far above 1999's 455 TWh. The lack =
of=20
change is a stark shift from just a year prior; in 1998, only 260 TWh of=20
power were generated using natural gas.=20

Texas (ERCOT) topped the list in terms of the greatest use of natural gas f=
or=20
electric power generation, where 1,643 trillion Btus were burned. Although=
=20
this is an increase of about 148 trillion Btus from 1999 levels, it is a=20
relatively small increase in comparison to the near 454 trillion Btu increa=
se=20
this gas-rich region experienced from 1998 to 1999.=20

During 2000, the one anomaly in terms of gas growth was=01*not surprisingly=
=01*the=20
North American Electric Reliability Council's (NERC) Western Systems=20
Coordinating Council (WSCC) region that covers 11 states, including=20
California. Here, gas consumption rose by 431 trillion Btus during 2000, an=
=20
amount that comes close to the 524 trillion Btu increase from 1998 to 1999.=
=20



Coal dominates
RDI's POWERdat database shows coal was responsible for about 1,956 TWh of=
=20
power generation through the end of 2000. While that figure is up about 2.5=
%=20
from the close of 1999, coal's nationwide share has declined from about 56.=
4%=20
in 1998 to the current level of 54%.=20

Despite this relative decline, however, coal continues to dominate the powe=
r=20
generation market, and its consumption grew slightly in all NERC regions=20
during 2000, continuing the upward trend visible since 1998. The most=20
significant growth was experienced in southern states (excluding Florida).=
=20
The second-largest growth in coal use was in the mid-central eastern states=
=20
(East Central Area Reliability Council or ECAR).=20



Balanced portfolios?=20
California's problems have vividly illustrated the value of a balanced=20
fuel-use portfolio for electric power generation. As of the close of 2000,=
=20
nationwide, coal dominates at 54%, followed by uranium at a distant second =
at=20
21%. Natural gas is gaining ground with 14% of the nation's total fuel use=
=20
for electricity generation.=20


Regionally, the distribution is much more variable. For example, about 37% =
of=20
the fossil fuel consumed in the WSCC region for power generation was natura=
l=20
gas in 2000 compared to 29% in 1999. In absolute terms, several other regio=
ns=20
consume similar amounts of costly natural gas for power production. The NPP=
C=20
region=01*New England including New York=01*relied on natural gas for about=
 40% of=20
its power generation in 2000 followed by SPP (primarily Oklahoma) with abou=
t=20
33%.



The distribution of fuel use is, in most cases, linked to available=20
resources. Given its proximity to natural gas reserves, for example, Texas=
=20
relied on this fuel for a full 60% of its power generation in 2000, up from=
=20
55% in 1999. While less at risk for supply disruptions, a heavy dependence =
on=20
natural gas presents more exposure to its price volatility. On average, tot=
al=20
production costs for natural gas-fired generation topped $50 per MWh in 200=

making it second to the total production costs for solar power.=20

On Tuesday, he had just minutes' notice that blocks of the county's power=
=20
system were about to be blacked out by the local utility, Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison, except he was not sure which blocks, or for precisely how long, or=
=20
exactly when it would happen.=20
He had seconds to notify the most important of the county government's 87,0=
00=20
employees, but without using telephones, because that would take too long, =
as=20
he had discovered on previous blackouts, and without sending too many e-mai=
l=20
messages at once, because that would cause the system to crash.=20
And then there was Wednesday. Again, Mr. Mohr received notice of imminent=
=20
blackouts from Southern California Edison, bringing another round of franti=
c=20
measures, except this time it turned out to be a false alarm.=20
''My entire life has been turned upside down,'' Mr. Mohr said. He explained=
=20
that taking part in energy policy had been such a ponderously slow process =
in=20
the past that it could take him four days to prepare a short letter.=20
''We've been working 14-, 16-hour days.'' he said. ''My boss just missed hi=
s=20
anniversary. The main thing is that before, with emergency procedures, you=
=20
knew the rules. Everything was stable. You took a manual off a shelf. There=
=20
is no manual for a one-hour blackout.''=20
Traffic may be the worst problem in the blackouts. For instance, in Ventura=
,=20
just north of here, the streets immediately came close to gridlock on=20
Tuesday, and officials could only counsel patience.=20
''We just leave the intersections dark,'' said Ronald Calkins, director of=
=20
the city's Department of Public Works. ''The motorists just have to know th=
at=20
they are supposed to treat it as a four-way stop. We thought about using=20
portable stop signs, but it takes too long. By the time you get the stuff o=
ut=20
the lights are back on.''=20
In Irvine, there were three fender benders during Tuesday's blackout; in=20
Santa Monica, one car was rammed so hard at an intersection that it flipped=
=20
over.=20
Eileen Salmon, Irvine's emergency coordinator, said the best that could be=
=20
done, once care is taken to make sure essential services keep running, was =
to=20
communicate, but even doing that can be problematic. Ms. Salmon said that=
=20
last Tuesday she received several false alarms before the blackouts, making=
=20
her responses something of a guessing game.=20
She said most city operations were just told to wait out the blackouts.=20
Schools, she said, do nothing special; and city employees just take a break=
=20
for the most part.=20
Allison Hart, the Irvine city manager, said the lack of specific advance=20
information from Southern California Edison was another problem.=20
The utilities have said that they do not identify which areas will lose pow=
er=20
in advance because of concerns that criminals might take advantage of the=
=20
situation by looting or breaking into buildings.=20
''If you think the possibility of looting or something is worse than the=20
devastating economic uncertainty of being hit by unpredictable rolling=20
blackouts in the sixth-largest economy in the world, I just think you're=20
wrong,'' Ms. Hart said, adding that business groups have said they would=20
prefer more notice as well.=20
The municipalities usually have backup diesel generators at critical sites,=
=20
but even using those can pose difficulties. Many city officials said that a=
s=20
they get warnings that power is running short, they are inclined to fire up=
=20
their generators early so that important facilities will never lose=20
electricity.=20
But state air quality rules restrict how long the cities can operate the=20
generators, usually to 200 hours a year. If the generators are left running=
=20
an hour or two every time there is a warning, as happened on Wednesday, the=
=20
officials fear they will waste precious operating time.=20
Mr. Mohr said that perhaps the greatest trial would be keeping municipal=20
employees alert in a summer when emergency warnings would be the norm.=20
Already, he said, officials are struggling against complacency.=20
''Please don't let a lazy or indifferent attitude develop due to the false=
=20
predictions,'' Mr. Mohr pleaded in a mass e-mail message sent after=20
Wednesday's near miss.=20
Then he added, ''This will be the last message tonight, unless conditions=
=20
deteriorate.''=20
