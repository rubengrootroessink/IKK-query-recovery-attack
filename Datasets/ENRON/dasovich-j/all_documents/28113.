The economist's name is Ben Zycher (not Zucher). Do we have any interest in 
this?

		 Subject: Heads Up on Funding solicitation


I was approached last week by the Pacific Research Institute for Public
Policy, a conservative think tank, to have WPTF help fund a study they
are undertaking by well-known economist Ben Zucher.  I thought I would
just give you this heads up that a formal proposal will be forthcoming,
that I will copy you all on it, and we should discuss it at our July
Board meeting.  Ben's paper will be entitled The Economics and Politics
of Electricity Deregulation, and it will be a substantial body of work.
