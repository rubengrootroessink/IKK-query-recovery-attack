Governor told to try seizure in power war=20



By Philip J. LaVelle=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 19, 2001=20
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take=20
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an=
=20
action the governor said may be in the cards.=20
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego=20
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial=
=20
properties here.=20
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed=
=20
to the media.=20

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against=20
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power=20
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you .?.?.=20
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a=20
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without=20
blackouts and without staggering prices.'?"=20
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting =
in=20
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to=
=20
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your=20
court, gentlemen."=20
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank=
=20
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but=
=20
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly=
=20
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, includin=
g=20
seizing plants."=20
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of=20
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state=20
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning=20
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it,=
"=20
she said.=20
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree fro=
m=20
Scripps Research Institute.





Davis intensifies attacks on Texas firms=20



By Ed Mendel=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 19, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy=20
companies, shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home=
=20
state of President Bush.=20
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price-gouging us,"=
=20
Davis told reporters while responding to Bush's energy plan this week. "Man=
y=20
of those companies are in Texas."=20
The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California=20
utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy=20
companies in the Southwest.=20
Anyone could have purchased the California power plants, Davis said, "but t=
he=20
people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest .?.?. "=20
However, a state Energy Commission report shows that when California=20
utilities sold more than 20 power plants capable of producing 20,000=20
megawatts, Texas firms purchased plants producing about 7,000 megawatts.=20
Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give=20
California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on=
=20
itself.=20
"So if Texas can have some kind of price relief," Davis said, "I think=20
California is entitled to price relief."=20
But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from=20
offering to sell power for more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour -- far above=
=20
the $346 average that California expects to pay for non-contracted power th=
is=20
spring.=20
The campaign operation for Davis, who is up for re-election next year and h=
as=20
been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in 2004, distributed a news=20
release yesterday saying that "Davis is emerging as a national spokesman fo=
r=20
the Democrats on energy issues."=20
The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic=20
presidential candidate Al Gore's campaign, Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, a=
s=20
interim communication consultants. He named Gore's former deputy chief of=

were sold to Duke of North Carolina, Mirant of Georgia, and Calpine of=20
California.=20
The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES=20
Corp. of Virginia, which obtained 4,706 megawatts. Reliant, a Texas firm,=

bought plants from Edison that can produce 4,000 megawatts.=20

Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic=
=20
transfer of wealth from California to Houston. A large electricity marketin=
g=20
firm with close ties to Bush, Enron, also is based in Houston.=20
But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant, whose profits soare=

last year. Reliant openly rejected Davis' call last week for generators to=
=20
accept a 30 percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California=20
utilities.=20
Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to=

ed=20
number of days.=20
The state of California, which has spent about $7 billion buying power for=

utility customers since January, made emergency purchases of 336 megawatt=
=20
hours from Reliant on May 9 and 10, paying $1,900 per megawatt hour for a=
=20
total of $638,400.=20
In Texas, the Public Utilities Commission adopted a $1,000 per megawatt hou=

"I realize that amount has been reached in California," said Terry Hadley, =

Texas."=20
Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator wa=

Texas has a surplus of power, unlike California, which has to import about =

about 85 percent of the state, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and=

Austin. California is part of a sprawling Western power grid.=20

Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation=20

LOS ANGELES =01) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission pro=

a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduc=
ed=20
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.=
=20
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch=
=20
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at=20
three plants on a single day last November.=20
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the=20
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power=20
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low.=
=20
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies=
=20
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production =
to=20
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates.=
=20
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is=20
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by=
=20
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and=20
playing, to an extent, California."=20
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid=
=20
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said.=20
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say th=
at=20
they are owned by at least two companies.=20
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged=20
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning.=

He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing=

Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan=20
Power: He also hires high-profile consultants in effort to boost his=20
political standing.=20

By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z. BARABAK, Times Staff Writers


?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic=
=20
Party's point man against President Bush's energy plan, even as he seeks to=
=20
bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed=
=20
their crisis-management skills during the scandal-ridden Clinton=20
administration.
?????Davis was expected to again criticize Bush's energy plan today as he=
=20
makes the official Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address.
?????In the last week, Davis has variously blasted the president's energy=
=20
plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show, on CNN, and in an=20
opinion piece for the Washington Post. In an interview with Associated Pres=
s,=20
Davis vowed to "hold everyone accountable: myself, the energy producers and=
=20
the president of the United States."
?????"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging=
=20
us," Davis said Friday. "Many of those companies are in Texas. Mr. Presiden=
t,=20
you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one who can solve it."
?????At the same time, Davis all but acknowledged his own political problem=
s=20
when he announced that he has retained two political aides, Mark Fabiani an=
d=20
Chris Lehane. The two, who also do work for Southern California Edison, wil=
l=20
be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of $30,000 per month--more than the=
=20
$13,750 earned by the governor himself.
?????Lehane, known for his tart-tongued commentary, was Vice President Al=
=20
Gore's main campaign spokesman, and had a knack for getting under Bush's sk=
in=20
during the 2000 campaign.
?????Fabiani, a Harvard law school graduate, became a highly partisan and=
=20
acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in=20
investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky=
=20
affair. Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises=20
while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the e=
nd=20
of the late mayor's tenure.
?????In political circles, the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaste=
r.
?????Davis' decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governor's=
=20
once-sterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent=20
criticism over his handling of the energy crisis.
?????Their arrival also corresponds to Davis' increasingly aggressive stand=
=20
on the energy crisis. In recent days, Davis for the first time has attacked=
=20
an individual generator, Reliant Energy of Houston, for charging a record=
=20
$1,900 per megawatt for electricity on two days last week. He also dared=20
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to "stand up" to their=20
"friends" in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices=20
charged in California.
?????Davis' more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up the=
ir=20
attacks on the president, using the energy plan to launch a broader assault=
=20
on Bush's leadership and policies.
?????"One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no=
=20
short-term relief for consumers," said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the=20
Democratic Governors Assn., which Davis chairs. "And there is no better=20
example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in=
=20
California."
?????In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of California--t=
he=20
nation's largest electoral prize--Democrats see Bush's energy response as a=
=20
way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interes=
ts.
?????"This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration an=
d=20
a party that is bought and paid for by special interests," said Jenny Backu=
s,=20
a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
?????To press the case, the party has created a snide Web=20
site--www.grandoldpetroleum--and will soon start running TV ads attacking G=
OP=20
lawmakers over the energy issue, including in California.
?????Paul Maslin, the governor's pollster, said Davis had given the preside=
nt=20
a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would addres=
s=20
the energy problem. But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it=
=20
became clear "we weren't going to get any help from Washington."
?????For his part, Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech=
=20
Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, part of his tour to sell t=
he=20
administration's energy blueprint. The president praised Californians for=
=20
doing "a fantastic job in conservation."
?????"And yet they're lacking energy. They're having blackouts," Bush said.=
=20
"We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great sta=
te=20
of California. But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve=
=20
your way to energy independence."
?????While Bush did not mention the governor, the president's deputies have=
=20
rushed to criticize him.
?????Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, head of the Republican National Committee=
,=20
suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when "the president is the=
=20
one who came forward with the first energy plan we've seen in years."
?????"He's going to have to answer the question of what he's done as=20
governor," Gilmore said. "While he's in the process of attacking, one might=
=20
suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record."
?????On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine=
=20
Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party=20
official Darrell Kearney.
?????"He's had plenty of time to do something, and he hasn't done anything,=
"=20
she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada, Iowa, where Bush had just=20
finished speaking.
?????Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush=

plan, namely the focus on long-term solutions at a time voters are growing=
=20
increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills.
?????"While [the administration] talks about how we approach things in the=
=20
next five years, there's not a lot of empathy or understanding for what's=
=20
affecting people now," said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political=20
analyst in Washington.
?????"Maybe it's unfair to talk about Bush and Cheney's oil backgrounds and=
=20
Texas backgrounds," Rothenberg said. "But it's an obvious thing for critics=

to do."
?????Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of=
=20
Congress next year, "if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans=20
really become concerned. . . . It puts the burden on the White House and=20
Republicans to change that."
?????Davis' new aides, while considered expert in solving the kind of=20
political crisis threatening Davis, pose the potential of controversy on=20
their own.
?????As consultants, Lehane and Fabiani, unlike government officials, are n=
ot=20
required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings a=
nd=20
sources of income.
?????However, in an interview on Friday, Lehane acknowledged that he and=20
Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern=20
California Edison. He insisted there is no conflict.
?????Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck wi=
th=20
Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. Several lawmakers oppose the=
=20
deal, contending that it is too rich for Edison.
?????"Both sides [Edison and Davis] are in agreement on what needs to be do=
ne=20
here," Lehane said. "As the governor said . . . we are literally in a war=
=20
with these out-of-state generators."
?????Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications=
=20
issues for Davis, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union, a critic of the=20
Davis-Edison deal, blasted Davis' decision to hire consultants who also wor=

for the utility.
?????"Davis has done everything politically wrong," Snyder said. "He hasn't=

?????Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo=20

"He has tremendous experience. . . . He takes the incoming. You get hit wit=

?????But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions=20
surrounding the generators' activities.
?????Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power=20
generation at three plants on a single day last November. After the plants=
=20
reduced production during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state=

out for criticism this week by Gov. Gray Davis defended his company Friday=

and warned that the governor's rhetoric will ultimately hurt California.
?????"On Wednesday we were called obstructionist," said Joe Bob Perkins,=20
chief executive of Reliant Energy, which bought five Southern California=20
power plants when the state launched deregulation in 1998.
?????"I don't think it's obstructionist to supply record amounts of power=

?????Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures coul=

?????For months, Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in=20
California as gougers and profiteers, but until last week he did not single=

out individual companies.
?????Last Thursday, after state power buyers paid an extraordinary $1,900 p=

?????State investigators have uncovered evidence that a "cartel" of power=

the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
?????PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state=20
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have=
=20
created "artificial shortages," particularly when the state has issued=20
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
?????"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose=

?????Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough=20
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action=

against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she sai=
d,=20
is still under review.
?????Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide=
=20
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain=20
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
?????Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark=
et=20
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the=

t=20
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
?????Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of=20
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has=
=20
been unwarranted.
?????In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a stateme=

last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was=

justified and that the company's officials were "accommodating."
?????State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi=

week.
?????"I would argue it's no accident," Lynch said of the high prices. "That=

in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel."
?????The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the=

rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to bu=

power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
?????Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power=20
producers, said Lynch's allegations were "the height of idiocy."
?????The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is th=

power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe=

demand.
?????He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing=20
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
?????"My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their=

Power Trading Forum.
?????State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap=20
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power=

?????According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were=

more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat=

the state's power market.

electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs=

the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
?????Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven =

Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--"not coincidental=

Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark=20
Effect: President's energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the=
=20
power-deprived Golden State.=20

By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS, Times Staff Writers=20

?????California lawmakers, analysts and others waist-deep in the state's=20
power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House=20
energy plan:
?????By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too=
=20
late to do the Golden State much good.
?????"This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the=
=20
next critical 18 months," groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=
.=20
"You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be de=
ad=20
before we get the life-support systems in place."
?????Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to=
=20
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are=
=20
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
?????Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an=
=20
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclea=
r=20
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy=
=20
development.
?????Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many=
=20
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woe=
s=20
far ahead of other states.
?????The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or=20
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from=
=20
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
?????"Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' " said=
=20
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and=20
advocacy group.
?????"I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California," added=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
?????State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the=
=20
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one.=20
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27=
=20
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
?????"It's not that we don't have long-term problems," said Stephen Levy,=
=20
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the Californ=
ia=20
Economy. "It's just that energy isn't among them."
?????Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a=
=20
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a=
=20
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
?????"Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to=20
purchase more efficient air conditioners?" asked Dan Reicher, assistant=20
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Over the course of the yea=
r,=20
a program like that can make a dramatic difference" because air conditionin=
g=20
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
?????Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency=
=20
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the=20
country to build 43 new power plants.
?????Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California=
=20
were clouded by doubt.
?????Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to=20
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as "Path 15," between Northern=
=20
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires=
=20
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by=
=20
"nonfederal contributions"--meaning the financially strapped utilities migh=
t=20
be expected to bear the cost.
?????Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from=20
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an=
d=20
criticized the president for allowing "the price-gouging energy companies,=
=20
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder."
?????Davis said the state is "doing everything possible to build and conser=
ve=20
our way out of the problem," but it desperately needs federal price control=
s=20
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion;=
=20
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
?????But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that=
=20
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forc=
es=20
reign.
?????Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in=20
peril.
?????"Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning =
a=20
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state," Davis=
=20
said. "Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because the=
y=20
can't afford these rates."
?????Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly=20
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California=
.
?????Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20=20
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a=20
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year=
s.
?????The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi=
ng=20
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however=
,=20
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive=20
order issued in February.
?????There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to=20
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plan=
t=20
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found=
=20
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.
?????"You can barely build clean-burning gas plants here, let alone nuclear=
=20
plants," said Edward Kahn, a San Francisco-based energy consultant with=20
Analysis Group/Economics.
?????Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a=20
proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines.=
=20
Currently, the U.S. government's power to forcibly acquire private property=
=20
applies only to highways and gas pipelines. Expanding that power is likely =

=20
backing from Bush-style conservatives.
?????"I'm just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the=
=20
state's [authority] over its own land," said Lynch of the PUC.
?????The issue is already heated in California. Communities in southwestern=
=20
Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas & Electric's attemp=
ts=20
to use eminent domain to obtain private land for 31 miles of transmission=
=20
lines. The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energ=
y=20
officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for priva=
te=20
acreage.
?????Bush also proposed a unified, private national electricity grid, an id=

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year=20
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top=

out in 2001 as prices stabilize.=20

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad=
=20
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by=20
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
?????Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares=
=20
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts a=
nd=20
money managers say.
?????Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's=
=20
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 200=

than in 2001, analysts estimate.
?????That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will =

peaks--or head lower.
?????Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rockete=

many energy stocks have stalled this year.
?????The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related=20

six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.

y,=20
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 t=
o=20
$67.99 on Thursday.
?????By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
?????Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief=
=20
investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choos=

to find good buys today in the energy sector.
?????"We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because=20
they're the better bargains," he said. "And at this point the good news loo=

fully priced into the services and equipment group."
?????After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took=20
profits earlier this year. "We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--i=

leadership days are done," he said.
?????Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. "W=
e=20
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro=
=20
trends," he said.
?????For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that=20
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
?????Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this yea=
r,=20
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson=20
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.=

?????At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the=

price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lowe=
r=20
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy=20
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature =
of=20
the business.
?????Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interes=
t=20
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
?????Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be=20
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen,=
=20
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleu=
m=20
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich=20
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased =

cents to $88.73.
?????Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland=20
(ASH), Pennzoil-Quaker State (PZL) and Sunoco (SUN) are among the refining=

stocks with reasonable valuations and plenty of upside, he said.
?????Ashland eased 17 cents to $43.50 Thursday, Pennzoil-Quaker added 5 cen=
ts=20
to $15.96 and Sunoco rose 98 cents to $41.45.
?????Some money managers prefer to leave the traditional oil and gas stocks=
=20
for others--in favor of alternative energy issues.
?????John Hammerschmidt, manager of Turner New Energy & Power Technology=20
Fund, likes the potential of companies such as Energy Conversion (ENER),=20
which is seeking to develop cheaper and sturdier solar panels, and AstroPow=
er=20
(APWR), another solar firm.
?????Energy Conversion jumped $3.53 to $31.28 on Thursday while AstroPower=

leaped $3.38 to $54.93.
?????In the fuel cell industry, Hammerschmidt pointed to Ballard Power=20
Systems (BLDP), whose products are being used in clean-running buses in Los=

?????Ballard jumped $8.37 to $57.60 and FuelCell rose $4.98 to $85.28.

Municipal Utilities Seek Exemptions From Blackouts=20

By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and=
=20
have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the=
=20
federal government today to exempt them from blackouts.
?????Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid =
in=20
California, and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled=20
out--just as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages.
?????Most Californians pay large, investor-owned utilities like Southern=20
California Edison Co. for power. But about a quarter of households, from th=
e=20
tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital, are billed for electricit=
y=20
by cities, counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit=20
utilities. There are 30 "municipal" utilities.
?????Four of them--serving Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale and the Imperial=
=20
Valley, east of San Diego--are independent of the state power grid and do n=
ot=20
face any outages. But the others are required by contract to give electrici=
ty=20
back to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the grid, by=
=20
participating in rolling blackouts--although they have plenty of power to=
=20
serve their customers.
?????"It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs," said=20
California Municipal Utilities Assn. attorney Tony Braun.
?????These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions=
=20
behind the deregulation of California's electricity market and the power=20
shortage.
?????"We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and=
=20
that we don't have the right--nor does anyone else--to take it away from th=
em=20
when they need it," said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans. "Our=20
customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t=
o."
?????Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon,=20
which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts.
?????Vernon's public utility has 2,000 customers, all but 30 of which are=
=20
industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants. T=
he=20
city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with=
=20
electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state, said Jorge=
=20
Somoano, Vernon's assistant director of resource management.
?????FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the=

campaign. Up to half, including Riverside, are expected to either file thei=
r=20
own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon, said Washington attorne=
y=20
Bonnie Blair, who represents municipal utilities in Azusa, Banning and Colt=

?????Even the campaign's supporters are unsure whether it will succeed. Bla=

acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal=

challenge to FERC, which is expected to decide on the issue by mid-June. An=
d,=20
she said, municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don=
e=20
enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis.
?????Some cities with municipal utilities, such as Anaheim, are not plannin=
g=20
to join the campaign.
?????Marcie Edwards, general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities, said the=
=20
relationships between municipal utilities and Cal-ISO are too complicated t=
o=20
make a clean break. She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed=
=20
entirely on the large investor-owned utilities--including this summer's=20
energy crunch. And until that can be proved, she said, municipal utilities=
=20
still have an obligation to support California's power grid.
?????"It's not right to go either way 100%," she said. "The fact remains th=
at=20
municipals still have an obligation to serve."
?????Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through=20
agreements with Cal-ISO that call for them to share electricity in an=20
emergency.
?????Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for=
=20
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, or other sudden and monumental=20
problems, such as a plane running into a transmission line.
?????"The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient=20
supplies," Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC, does not=
=20
constitute an emergency.
?????"The obligation to share in [rolling blackouts] did not contemplate=20
situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to=
=20
provide resources to serve their customers," Blair said. "If they are force=
d=20
to participate in rolling blackouts, the effect is that the ISO is taking=
=20
energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively=
=20
giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it."
?????Jim Detmers, Cal-ISO's vice president of operations, said the=20
organization plans to fight the campaign. He said emergency provisions of=
=20
Cal-ISO's agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy=
=20
crunch.
?????Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would=
=20
increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha=
ve=20
their own electricity distribution. He compared the exemption request to a=
=20
homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbor's because he wants to kee=
p=20
his water for himself.
?????"What we're dealing with is an overall shortage," Detmers said. "We wa=
nt=20
to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyone's lives are=

at risk."
?????Ronald Nunnally, Edison's director of federal regulations and contract=
s,=20
said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of=
=20
the power grid to which they are connected.
?????"The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole, if you will,=
=20
under all circumstances," he said.
?????Blair said those arguments don't hold up. Indeed, she said the municip=

utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits=

Bush proposed last week. The discussion inevitably turned to California.=20
"They've bankrupted the biggest utility in the state, destroyed the state's=

=20
surplus in a harebrained scheme to try to use the state to purchase power,"=
=20
the vice president told Tim Russert of NBC's "Meet the Press."=20
A spokesman for Davis responded that the vice president's remarks yesterday=
=20
were "grossly misinformed" and meant to divert attention from the=20
administration's neglect of the state and its power woes.=20
"The Bush administration has refused to address California's problem, and n=
ow=20
they're washing their hands of it," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.=20
The tit-for-tat remarks culminated a week that has seen an escalation in th=
e=20
war of words between the Democratic governor and the Republican White House=
.=20
The two administrations are increasingly engaging in a blame game as they=
=20
confront a worsening crisis with enormous political stakes for both sides.=
=20
Responding to critics -- including Davis -- who say the White House has don=
e=20
little to help California, the vice president pointed the finger back at th=
e=20
state's top Democratic official.=20
"They knew over a year ago they had a problem, and Gray Davis refused to=20
address that problem," Cheney said. "(They) kept putting it off and putting=
=20
it off and putting it off, with the notion that somehow price caps could be=

maintained.=20
"Now, today, where are they in California? Well, rates are having to go up.=

The PUC just had to increase the rates themselves in California. They've go=
t=20
rolling blackouts, they've had some already. They'll have them across the=
=20
state this summer," Cheney said.=20
Cheney's remarks referred to the state's purchases of almost $6 billion wor=
th=20
of energy, which began after the major utilities could no longer afford=20
skyrocketing wholesale prices for energy.=20
Earlier this month, the Democrat-controlled California Legislature approved=
 a=20
bill, opposed by GOP lawmakers, to issue $13.4 billion in bonds to repay th=
e=20
state's general fund to avoid making deep cuts in other state programs.=20
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON
"That's the governor keeping the lights on," Maviglio said. "Because of the=
=20
failure of the federal government to act (to impose price controls), the=20
state had to move to keep the lights on."=20
Cheney's comments came just days after Davis sharply criticized Bush's ener=
gy=20
plan, saying it wouldn't help California consumers facing rising energy=20
bills.=20
"Mr. President, you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one wh=
o=20
can solve it," Davis said in a letter released to the press. "With all due=
=20
respect, Californians want to know, Mr. President, whether you're going to =
be=20
on their side."=20
Davis also suggested that by refusing to ask federal regulators for price=
=20
caps, Bush was effectively allowing price-gouging by oil and gas producers =
in=20
his home state of Texas. Cheney dismissed the allegation last week as=20
"goofy."=20
CALIFORNIA A BAD EXAMPLE
In speeches on his energy plan, the president has mostly used California as=
=20
an example to the nation of what not to do. He warned last week that the=20
state's blackouts were a preview of what other states could face if the=20
country doesn't boost energy supplies.=20
Some California Republican leaders have warned Bush, who will visit Souther=
n=20
California later this month, to soften the administration's rhetoric on the=
=20
energy crisis to avoid being seen as unsympathetic to the state's plight.=
=20
Cheney explained yesterday that the administration opposes even short-term=
=20
price controls because they could discourage energy suppliers from selling=
=20
energy into California and building more plants in the state.=20
"In the final analysis, it's going to be the private sector's response that=
=20
generates the power we're going to need long-term," Cheney said.=20
The vice president did offer an olive branch to Davis, noting that both=20
Democratic and Republican lawmakers approved the state's deregulation=20
legislation, precipitating the state's energy problems.=20
"In fairness to Governor Davis, the screwy regulatory scheme they put in=20
place was supported on both sides of the aisle out there," Cheney said. "Bu=
t=20
he was the one who was in charge when it went haywire."=20
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who followed Cheney on CBS' "Face the Nation"=
=20
yesterday morning, put the blame back on the White House. She recalled that=
=20
President John F. Kennedy called steel company executives into his office=

when they were accused of price gouging. She urged Bush and Cheney to do th=
e=20
same with energy suppliers.=20
"You have the vice president sitting there, sounding like an oil man," Boxe=

Commission and former czar of energy conservation science at Lawrence=20

Department.=20
Undaunted by the changing political winds of the past three decades,=20
scientists at the lab have continued designing energy-conserving=20
technologies, even though, at first glance, the new technologies don't look=
=20
that exciting.=20
NEW LIGHTING TECHNOLOGIES
Witness, for example, the lamps being tested at the post office in Rodeo. T=
he=20
lamps are long, thin tubes that aim light directly onto each carrier's=20
mail-sorting station, rather than wastefully spreading it all over the plac=
e.=20
It's a simple innovation, yet it reduces energy costs for lighting by up to=
=20
70 percent, Lawrence Berkeley researchers have calculated.=20
Likewise, they have recently invented a new type of high-performance,=20
energy-efficient table lamp that "could greatly reduce the current power=20
problems we have in California while increasing the quality of the lighting=
,"=20
says researcher Michael Siminovitch of the Berkeley lab.=20
The lamp consists of compact fluorescent lights that can be manipulated to=
=20
direct light in different directions -- toward the ceiling, for example. Th=
at=20
allows the users to fine-tune lighting conditions to their precise needs,=
=20
overcoming common complaints about the dimness and poor design of first-=20
generation power-saving lights.=20
The new lamps use only one-fourth as much energy as a 150-watt incandescent=
=20
table lamp or a 300-watt halogen lamp. Unveiled in March, they are being=20
field- tested by the lab in collaboration with the Sacramento Municipal=20
Utility District (SMUD), Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and=20
Electric.=20
LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES
Looking farther into the future, the old-fashioned incandescent light bulb=
=20
may be challenged by electronic LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, commonly us=
ed=20
for VCRs and alarm clocks. Those dim little lights may eventually be made=
=20
bright enough, and white enough, to begin replacing traditional lighting=20
sources.=20
One problem: the refraction or bending of light. Everyone has seen what=20
happens when one inserts a straw into a glass of water -- the submerged=20
portion of the straw appears to bend. In the semiconductor materials used i=
n=20
LEDs, much of the internally generated light is bent so much that it reflec=
ts=20
back into the LED -- that is, it can't escape. Hence, present LEDs don't em=
it=20
enough light to attract a large commercial market.=20
However, engineers at Lawrence Berkeley and elsewhere are designing new LED=
s=20
that would emit far more light. One of them is physicist Steve Johnson, who=
=20
is confident that LEDs can eventually be made brighter than ordinary light=
=20
bulbs. He points out that colored LEDs are already used in some traffic=20
lights.=20
By mixing together LEDs that emit different wavelengths of light, one could=
=20
create a white light-emitting LED, Johnson says. (White light is a mixture =
of=20
all other optical wavelengths.)=20
Johnson maintains LEDs could make a difference to the energy bill.=20
"One-third of our energy used in commercial buildings goes into lighting=20
those buildings. So anything we do to reduce the lighting bill is going to=
=20
help the energy crisis."=20
SUPER-EFFICIENT APPLIANCES
All sorts of strategies are being tried in labs all over the country.=20
Forget to turn off the iron before you drove out of town? Appliances that c=
an=20
be switched off remotely, via computer modem, are being developed by the=20
Media Lab at MIT as part of its "Kitchen Sync" project.=20

d=20
homes in which the appliances will switch themselves on to perform=20
nonessential work -- say, washing the clothes -- only when there's no risk =
of=20

Super-efficient refrigerators that use "magnetic" refrigerants are being=20
tested at Ames Laboratory, a federally financed lab in Ames, Iowa.=20
Scientists there are using "magnetic cooling" methods to replace the=20
compressed gases deployed by typical refrigerators. Physicists have long=20
known that some materials get hotter when magnetized and cool off when=20
demagnetized.=20
Even today's refrigerators consume energy far more efficiently than they on=

did.=20
Federal energy standards for refrigerators that took effect in July 2000=20
require that they burn only one-fourth as much energy as did their=20
predecessors, 25 years ago, Rosenfeld notes.=20
Even better, he adds, modern refrigerators are bigger and don't use=20
chlorofluorocarbons, chemical compounds that are believed to damage the ozo=

layer, which shields the Earth from cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation.=

Oakland -- Already seeing red over rising utility bills, Oakland residents=

have found themselves mired in red tape when they have sought energy=20
alternatives such as solar power.=20
It can take up to eight weeks and cost more than $1,000 to get the required=

city permits to install solar panels.=20
But the City Council is expected to change that tomorrow when it considers =
an=20
emergency ordinance, proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown, to eliminate design=20
review requirements for renewable energy installations including solar pane=

and wind devices.=20
"Energy is an issue on everybody's plate these days. . . . We want to make =

easy for people to get their permits and get their panels," said Gary Patto=
n,=20
the city's deputy planning director.=20
Oakland officials said they know of no other city taking similar steps to=

promote alternative energy generation, although cities throughout the Bay=
=20
Area and the state are increasingly looking to renewable energy sources.=20
San Francisco, for instance, is considering placing solar energy bonds on t=

property and could provide low-cost loans for homeowners and businesses to =
do=20

sources for residences.=20
The Oakland measure, which would remain in effect for two years, also would=

As Californians already hit by the state's energy crunch face the prospect =

=20
growing number of inquiries from residents interested in installing solar=

panels, Patton said.=20
The city also has heard complaints about the cost and time it now takes to=

Gary Gerber, president of Sun Light & Power in Berkeley, said he complained=

when he learned that it would cost more than $1,200 to install a solar syst=

on a home in the Montclair area. The project is on hold, awaiting the new=

"The process didn't really fit our situation. . . . It's pretty cumbersome=

Gerber said.=20
City officials "responded beautifully" in drafting a "solar-friendly" polic=
y,=20
he added.=20
Calvin Wong, director of building services, said the city has received a=20

only a few applications before the energy crisis hit. "We anticipate a lot=

Gerber said he gets five to 10 calls a day from interested customers. He ha=

"I don't think solar panels have been a significant issue for (Oakland) up =
to=20
now," said Councilman Dick Spees, who backs the proposed change. "We want t=
o=20
encourage it by making it simple, direct and less costly."=20
Oakland also is exploring installing solar panels on city buildings.=20
A household solar unit -- which can heat water or produce electricity=20
directly -- can cost $10,000 to $30,000, although state rebates can reduce=
=20
the price by half. President Bush's energy plan, released last week, propos=
es=20
a 15 percent tax credit for residents who install solar panels.=20
Patton said the "main target" of Oakland's emergency ordinance was solar=20
panels, but it would apply to other "renewable energy production facilities=

Currently, design review for such installations can cost between $397 and=

Under the proposal, design review would be waived once an owner submits=20

Gov. Gray Davis blasted President Bush's energy strategy yesterday, saying =
it=20
will fail to rein in galloping energy prices and insinuating that Bush's=20
close ties to the oil industry are behind his unwillingness to regulate=20
prices.=20
Davis, in delivering the Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address=
,=20
called on Bush to place a cap on wholesale energy prices, which, he said, a=
re=20
imperiling California's economy.=20
"I urge you to stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise=
=20
the federal government's exclusive responsibility to ensure energy prices a=
re=20
reasonable," said Davis.=20
California consumer advocates and utility officials alike endorsed the call=
=20
for rate caps.=20
Bush has rejected such caps, although in his radio address yesterday, he=20
noted that the average family energy bill has climbed by 25 percent over th=
e=20
past three years.=20
"That's a hardship for every family," he said. "We need to act to protect=
=20
family budgets."=20
His prescription, however, was not for restricting how much energy producer=
s=20
can charge, but for increasing energy production by building more power=20
plants and drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.=20
Yesterday, Bush put into action by executive order two of his=20
recommendations, including ordering federal agencies to speed permit=20
approvals for new plant and pipeline construction. Still other proposals,=
=20
such as tax credits for hybrid vehicle purchases, will require congressiona=
l=20
action.=20
"It's time to leave behind rancorous old arguments and build a positive new=
=20
consensus," Bush said in the radio address. "With new technology, sound=20
regulation and plain good sense, we can expand our energy production while=
=20
protecting the environment."=20
Last spring, Davis said, California was paying an average of $30 for a=20
megawatt of power. By last week, the price had spiked to nearly $2,000 per=
=20
megawatt.=20
"What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by=
=20
the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas," =
he=20
said.=20
Davis criticized Bush's argument that limiting energy prices will deter=20
producers from increasing the supply of energy.=20
"That's as ridiculous as saying we need to pay dairies $300 a gallon to=20

Power juggling ramped up price=20
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment=20

Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by=20
throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages,=20
according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy=20
industry workers.=20
Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also=
=20
wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns=
=20
that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are=
=20
supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle.=20
The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990=20
megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was=
=20
unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four=20
times as much as a year ago.=20
Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters=
=20
another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to=
=20
September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third.=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, sai=
d=20
last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant=20
shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages th=
e=20
state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means =
of=20
constricting supply.=20
But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only wer=
e=20
generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed=
=20
to the plants' deteriorating condition.=20
"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for t=
he=20
ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit outpu=
t,=20
he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game=
=20
something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units=
=20
up."=20
Unusual phone calls=20
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy In=
c.=20
say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early=
=20
last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's=20
headquarters in Houston.=20
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations=20
schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease,=
=20
then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as=
=20
many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down an=
d=20
electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room=20
computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call=
=20
to ramp the units back up.=20
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, w=
ho=20
only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear=
=20
being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market=20
change."=20
The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a=
=20
number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in=
=20
earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one=
=20
of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market.=20
"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading=
=20
floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl=
=20
Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that=
=20
agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to=
=20
demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability."=
=20
Corporate denial=20
Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism t=
o=20
game the California energy market. They and other power companies, includin=
g=20
AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have=
=20
asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging,=20
decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs.=20
While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as=20
frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the=
=20
instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance.=20
"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California=
=20
market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an=20
operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders),=
=20
they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within=
=20
an hour."=20
Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers=
=20
in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it=
=20
first.=20
The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but=20
Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used=
=20
beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the=
=20
plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the gr=
id=20
managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one=
=20
of the operators. "Not for an individual unit."=20
Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment=
=20
on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation=
=20
into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source=20
familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to=
=20
have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair busines=
s=20
practices laws.=20
Invisible practice=20
How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught?=
=20
One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually=20
invisible to regulators and grid operators.=20
When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certa=
in=20
amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an=
=20
average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot=20
price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total=
=20
amount of energy required.=20
The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after thei=
r=20
output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO.=
=20
Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electrici=
ty=20
rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again,=
=20
the output was back at the expected level.=20
Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that i=
f=20
the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and=
=20
remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the=20
price was low, output was brought down and kept down.=20
The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of=20
individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more=
=20
aggressive than others.=20
"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they=
=20
would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price woul=
d=20
go up.=20
"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'=
d=20
say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say,=20
'Bring it down again.' "=20
Rapid changes=20
These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15=20
minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from=
=20
minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California=
=20
Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of=
=20
the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, whi=
ch=20
also reduced wear and tear.=20
"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the=
=20
brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on=
=20
the units."=20
ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on=
=20
gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather=
=20
than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when=20
companies were withholding power.=20
But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in=20
driving up energy prices.=20
A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day=
=20
period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list o=
f=20
plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage los=
t=20
among those companies.=20
Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted f=
or=20
more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their=20
generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capaci=
ty=20
from all sources.=20
Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state=20
generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It=
=20
was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va.=
=20
(278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261).=20
Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000=20
megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough powe=
r=20
for 1.4 million homes for one hour.=20
Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days=
,=20
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an=20
operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the=
=20
result of legitimate equipment failures.=20
Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of=20
repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five=20
California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so=
=20
the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand.=20
But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at=20
Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previousl=
y=20
reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was=
=20
operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit=
=20
offline because of the problem.=20
Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant =
to=20
keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for=
=20
Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary=20
maintenance.=20
Ramping may be rampant=20
Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source=
=20
familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs=
=20
obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. A=
nd=20
an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dyne=
gy=20
said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling=
=20
calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in=20
Minneapolis, he said.=20
Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo=
=20
were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and=20
denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market.=20
In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's=20
Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of t=
he=20
"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring.=20
One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple=
=20
method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that=
=20
price was not met.=20
On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to b=

Planning ahead for blackouts=20
Business, services plan for summer crises.
By LOIS EVEZICH
Aliso Viejo News
No sooner did Aliso Viejo become the newest city in Orange County than
California was hit with an energy crisis, threatening rolling blackouts
across the community. Energy issues have already taken a priority with the
council-elect and the city manager.
"We've had some meetings to familiarize ourselves with the situation," said
Interim City Manager William Woollett. "We've hired an engineering firm to
take a look at what kind of organization we need and what kind of budget we=
=20
must have for this issue."
Woollett added that they haven't done anything specific yet, as Aliso Viejo
is not a formal city until July 1.
Hilary McAllister, head librarian at the Aliso Viejo branch of the Orange
County Public Library, said, "All the branches have a plan. We plan to
continue checking out books, only doing the work by hand, as long as it is
safe. Safety is the main issue, and if that is a concern we might have to
close."
Branches in the library system received instructions, said McAllister, and
much of what they decide will have to do with how much warning time they
have.
"We're hoping the power company will warn us," she said.
The library, at 1 Journey, has been exempt from blackouts so far, even when=
=20
other areas in Aliso Viejo were hit. McAllister isn't sure if that has
anything to do with their location right across the street from the fire
station.
Fluor Corporation, with a large facility in Aliso Viejo, which houses 2,300
employees in its corporate headquarters and the five-building campus a
block away, is well prepared for a blackout, according to Lorie Serrato,
media representative.
"We even have blackout kits for the elevators," said Serrato. "They include
bottled water, snacks, and flashlights." She didn't know if there were also
tranquilizers included for those who are claustrophobic.
"We're getting used to taking the stairs," she said. "And we're learning to
save our work on computers more often. That's important."
Barnes & Noble experienced a blackout this winter. For safety reasons,
customers were asked to gather at the front of the store, and business went
on, though not as usual. Customers who knew what books they wanted to buy=
=20
asked employees to find them, and sales were registered on calculators.
For safety reasons, customers were not allowed where there was not adequate=
=20
light.
Barnes & Noble has cut lights in the back room to save energy, and set the
air conditioners to slightly higher temperatures.
Wendy Mortensen, skating school director at the Ice Chalet at 9 Journey,
said, "We've been told that we are on the same power grid as the Sheriff's
Substation and the Fire Department, and that we won't lose power."
Mortensen said that in 90 minutes, not much would happen to the ice, and if
there is a blackout, there is enough light during the day.
"We are only running half the lights," said Mortensen. "And we keep the
offices and the hallways dark to conserve energy."
United Parcel Service is tight-lipped about conservation measures. They
consider it proprietary information, as the measures give them a
competitive edge.
Overall, the company said they can work during blackouts, though it takes a
little longer. The facility does not have much activity during the peak=20
energy hours, but if it should happen during heavy work loads, the facility=
=20
can transfer the work to other shifts, or to another UPS facility.
UPS in Aliso Viejo is part of the Edison "Beat the Peak" program, designed
to help companies conserve and prepare. The facility has motion sensors in
the offices, and all employees have flashlights and other equipment as a
safety precaution.
Kmart was awarded a $2 million grant from the California Energy Commission =
in=20
February. It used some of that money to retrofit the Aliso Viejo store with=
=20
energy-conserving store lights that reduce consumption by 40 percent.
The project is still under way, with expected completion in the next severa=
l
weeks. Kmart also has uninterruptible power sources it uses as backups, in=
=20
case there is a blackout. These backups provide 40 minutes worth of energy,=
=20
used for the pharmacy and the cash registers. In the event of a blackout, t=
he=20
store would close for new customers, but could still service the customers=
=20
already in the store.



















Is price gouging root of crisis?=20
The president is "allowing the price-gouging energy companies, many of whom=
=20
reside in Texas, to get away with murder," Gov. Gray Davis said on Thursday=
=20
in response to a George W. Bush energy plan that doesn't call for caps on t=
he=20
price of electricity sold by out-of-state generators to California.=20
This remark captured the essence of the Davis approach to the energy=20
problems: Blame everybody else, call for government price controls even=20
though they historically have reduced the supply of energy, and use divisiv=
e=20
and even conspiratorial rhetoric.
On the same day Governor Davis was blasting the Bush energy plan, his=20
appointee who runs the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told a=
=20
newspaper that power generators purposefully keep their plants idle to jack=
=20
up prices. Attorney General Bill Lockyer said that he found evidence of wha=
t=20
Ms. Lynch called "artificial shortages."
We're interested in seeing the evidence, of course. But it looks suspicious=
ly=20
like politicians are using the "power-gouging" theory as a way to bluster=
=20
rather than come up with concrete solutions. It also is a way for those who=
=20
are ideologically hostile to deregulation - perhaps cynical of business and=
=20
capitalism in general - to demonize merchant generators and pave the way fo=
r=20
a government takeover.
No doubt, wholesale electricity prices have skyrocketed. Prices zoomed from=
=20
$200 a megawatt hour late last year to nearly $2,000 last week, according t=
o=20
the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports that plant shutdowns are=
 a=20
cause of the price spike.
Yet a number of analysts have found the price-gouging theory to be dubious.=
 A=20
Dow Jones Newswire column analyzed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dat=
a=20
on the amount of forced outages over the past two summers. Yes, there were=
=20
nearly four times as many plant closures by plants owned by five big=20
producers in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. But, as writer Mark Golden=20
pointed out, outages for all plants - including municipally owned ones and=
=20
small Qualifying Facilities that have no incentive to game the system - wer=
e=20
658 percent higher in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. The writer notes tha=
t=20
"four of the Big 5 are either constructing big new generators in California=
=20
or have applied for permits to do so. That would seem to fly in the face of=
 a=20
withholding strategy."
An April paper co-authored by William Hogan, a professor at the John F.=20
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, could not prove there=
=20
wasn't manipulation, but explained, "it is unlikely to be the dominant fact=
or=20
and may not even be significant."
The bigger issue, the Hogan paper argued, is the "seriously flawed"=20
restructuring system that caused the electricity market collapse. "[T]he=20
principal policy focus should be on fashioning workable solutions for the=
=20
other more serious problems in the market design that relate to the=20
underlying causes of the market meltdown."
Other analysts argue that, to whatever degree price-gouging has taken place=
,=20
it is solely the fault of the retail price caps and other government rules=
=20
that have distorted the market.
The large number of shutdowns has not been the result of any conspiracy, th=
e=20
power generators say, but the result of needed maintenance on facilities th=
at=20
have been overworked. Many of these are older plants that require more=20
shutdowns for maintenance than new ones.

Calif. Utilities Make Accusation



LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -=20
There is evidence that a ``cartel'' of power
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to increase
energy prices, the head of the California Public Utilities
Commission said. An energy official called the allegation
``idiocy.''


PUC President Loretta Lynch told the Los Angeles Times on
Thursday that her agency and the state attorney general's office
are probing plant outages that she said created ``artificial
shortages'' that contributed to skyrocketing power prices.


``There are instances where plants could have produced, and they
chose not to,'' Lynch said. ``And it is clear that there are
instances that plants, when called to produce, chose not to
produce.'' She said that happened even when plants were obligated
to do so under special contracts with utility companies and the
state.


Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum, dismissed Lynch's allegations as ``the height of idiocy.''


Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting
within the rules of the state's deregulation system. The reason
many plants have been down in recent months, Ackerman said, is that
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of
heavy summer demand.


``My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so
their competitors can make money,'' said Ackerman, who represents a
trade association of large power producers.


But Lynch said the probe has produced enough information for the
PUC and attorney general to take legal action next month against
some power generators. She did not identify them, and the exact
nature of the legal action is still under review, she said.


Investigators conducted interviews and reviewed subpoenaed
records, obtained after legal battles with the power companies, to
gather evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns, Lynch
said.


Power plants where unplanned shutdowns have happened also were
visited to examine operations and maintenance records, Lynch said.


Power prices have gone from $200 a megawatt hour in December to
as much as $1,900 last week, and plant shutdowns have been a key
factor in the soaring prices.


``I would argue it's no accident,'' Lynch said. ``That in fact
it's due to the coordinated behavior of a cartel.''


Lynch said one suspicious pattern has emerged: When operators of
the state's electricity grid declared a Stage 1 alert, which means
that electricity reserves had dipped below 7 percent, plants that
didn't need repairs were suddenly pulled off-line.




PG&E Targets Business Customers for Energy Reduction; Utility Steps Up=20
Efforts to Encourage Conservation; Awaits More State Funding



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -=20
In conjunction with
its customer education campaign called "The More You Know About
Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need," Pacific Gas and Electric
Company has stepped up its efforts to update business customers on the
energy crisis and provide tools to help them conserve energy -
especially in the coming months when power shortages are likely.


The utility is also working with state officials to determine how
best to use the additional funding for conservation and energy
efficiency which is contained in SB5x, signed into law by Governor
Davis on April 11.


The California Independent System Operator has forecast power
shortages of 600 to 3,700 megawatts between now and the end of summer.
Shortages that significant may result in blackouts for millions of
Californians. With little new generation available in time for summer
peak use, along with a continuing reduction of hydroelectric power
from the Pacific Northwest, Californians must adopt rigorous energy
conservation habits if outages are to be minimized.


"The energy crisis has taken its toll on all of us, with higher
energy costs and blackouts, but we recognize that our business
customers are especially hurt because they use a lot of electricity
and outages not only mean a loss of productivity but can damage
expensive, sensitive equipment," said Bev Alexander, Pacific Gas and
Electric Company vice president over energy management programs.
"Since businesses account for about half of customer electricity
consumption, their efforts to conserve have a great impact on
statewide energy use. So, we want them to utilize all the tools
available to reduce their energy use."


Pacific Gas and Electric Company offers advice and incentives to
help consumers make their businesses more energy efficient. Rebates
are available for installing more efficient lighting, HVAC,
refrigeration and other mechanical equipment. The utility has budgeted
$62 million for business energy management programs in 2001. The
funding comes from ratepayers via the Public Purpose Programs charge
on all customers' utility bills and is not impacted by the company's
Chapter 11 proceedings.


In addition, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has proposed to the
CPUC how it could spend approximately $35 million to support
business-related energy efficiency programs from SB5x funds, which set
aside $800 million in taxpayer dollars to encourage residential and
non-residential energy conservation.


The utility also is encouraging customers to take simple steps
such as turning off lights and equipment and adjusting thermostats to
reduce the air conditioning load.


"On a hot summer day, 40 percent of California's energy use is air
conditioning and commercial lighting, " Alexander said. "For example,
if commercial office buildings turned out every other light and set
their thermostats to 75 degrees, we could save roughly 3,500 megawatts
or the equivalent of seven large power plants. Measures like these
could virtually prevent blackouts this summer."


To educate business customers on the energy crisis and steps they
can take, the utility holds informational workshops throughout its
service area, sends newsletters, includes bill inserts, utilizes paid
advertising, the Internet and news stories. Business customers can
obtain information about energy efficiency programs by visiting
www.pge.com/123 or calling the Business Customer Center at
1-800-468-4PGE.


The business outreach program is just one element of Pacific Gas
and Electric Company's customer education campaign called "The More
You Know About Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need."


Note to reporters and editors: for details on the available
programs, please also see the fact sheet entitled: "Energy Efficiency
Programs for Business Customers."


ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS


FOR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS


In March 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company launched a
customer education campaign entitled "The More You Know About
Conserving Energy, the Less Energy You Need." Along with advertising,
the Internet and news stories, staff from the utility are holding
workshops throughout the service area to educate business consumers on
the seriousness of the problem and what they can do to conserve.


--  With demand for electricity expected to climb in the coming


months and little new generation available, the California


Independent System Operator is forecasting severe power


shortages that will likely result in blackouts for thousands


of Californians.


--  The only way to reduce the threat of blackouts is for all


consumers to reduce their electricity usage. Because Pacific


Gas and Electric Company's 500,000 commercial customers


account for about half of the power used, the business


community has the ability make a big impact with its


conservation efforts.


Programs Available for Business Customers


For 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has enhanced its energy
efficiency programs for business customers to achieve both energy
savings and demand reduction. The company has budgeted $62 million in
2001 to provide energy efficiency programs for business customers, and
is hoping for additional funding to come from SB5x, which the Governor
signed on April 11. The CPUC is currently reviewing how to allocate
the funds.
