I think we should let people in the legislature know about this and see if 
one or more of them can get their hands on it.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.
