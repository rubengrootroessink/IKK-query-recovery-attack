     HI E204 team -

     As we (minus Jeff) discussed last night, we won't meet this w-end
     since Shawne and Pat have their Public Policy presentation on Tuesday.
      However, we should all probably read through the problems and be
     prepared to meet to discuss sometime next week.  I will be at Haas on
     Wednesday night manning a table at the s-t-s job fair.  How does next
     Wednesday in Berkeley sound?

     We should probably also carve some time out next weekend to meet.  I
     know I am completely booked Sat all day (California AIDS ride crew
     training).  I can meet on Sunday or Sat after 5pm.

     What does everyone else's schedule look like on Wednesday night and
     next weekend?

     I'm hoping this is all quick and painless!

     Thanks,
     Carolyn
