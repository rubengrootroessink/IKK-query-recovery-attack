EXECUTIVE SUMMARY=20
? California Senate's MOU Debated in State Assembly
? Coordinating the California Legislature=20
? CPUC's Rate Setting Authority In Question
? Highlights from the SoCal Investor Conference Call

MOU
As reported earlier, SB 78XX (the leading SoCal rescue adopted by the CA=20
Senate) has undergone minor amendments by the California Assembly.  Three=
=20
important revisions on the bill are:
? In regard to commercial rates, the assembly has now left open the=20
definition of large or "industrial users" by eliminating the previous 500=
=20
kWh+ usage requirement.  This change could enable the Assembly to categoriz=
e=20
either smaller or larger consumers into the industrial/commercial user stat=
us=20
? The bill would not become effective unless SB 39XX is signed into law.  S=
B=20
39XX  (authored by Sen. Speier) is regarding the CPUC=01,s authority over=
=20
utilities and generators in California; it places certain generation that w=
as=20
purchased by Reliant, Dynegy, etc. from the utilities after deregulation=20
under PUC authority.
? The State=01,s purchase of the SoCal Ed. transmission lines has been remo=
ved.

AB 82XX was also revised by the Assembly with many of the deleted provision=
s=20
duplicate in SB 78XX, such as the conservation lands and the option to buy=
=20
the transmission lines.  Additionally, AB 82XX can not be enacted unless SB=
=20
1XX (the windfall profits bill) is signed.  The joining of 78XX to SB 39XX=
=20
and of 82XX to 1XX is very likely a method by which the Assembly is=20
pressuring the governor to sign these other bills, which otherwise might no=
t=20
have been enrolled.  However, the joining of these bills makes their passag=
e=20
more difficult.  The remaining provisions of AB 82XX are as follows:
? Renewables Portfolio
? Direct Access
? Ratepayer Refund Account (changed the name to Ratepayer Benefit Account)
? Balancing Account for SCE procurement of power
? DRC replaced with non-bypassable charge option for MOU.  This includes=20
reference to balancing account, recovery of reasonable procurement costs, a=
nd=20
the prohibition of reasonableness review on contracts by PUC.

Putting the MOU to a Vote
The Speaker feels that everything in these bills has been discussed already=
,=20
so nothing is really new. Hertzberg met with advisors Wednesday night (10:0=
0=20
pm) to decide if the Assembly will convene on Friday. It probably has a lot=
=20
to do with the ability to get enough members' support of these measures and=
=20
willingness to go back to Sacramento. Many are vacationing; some in other=
=20
countries. If there is an Assembly session on Friday, he plans to have an=
=20
informational hearing on the measure today.  If the Assembly=01,s session f=
ails=20
to convene Friday, it is unclear what he intends to do.  On the other side =
of=20
the equation, it is unlikely that Senator Burton will bring the Senate back=
=20
into session to approve this bill.  The Senate won't even consider it until=
=20
it comes back from recess, but the Assembly feels it is their responsibilit=
y,=20
thereby putting the onus back on the Senate. Apparently there is really no=
=20
coordination between the leadership of the different houses.
While SB 78XX and AB 82XX are the most publicized bills, neither bill will =
be=20
the actual legislative vehicle for these provisions.  The proposed content =
of=20
these bills will be amended into other bills which are further along in the=
=20
process, thereby eliminating the need to waive a number of rules and hold=
=20
numerous hearings.  This will speed up the process. Apparently the Speaker'=
s=20
office has not yet identified the actual bills that will be used. But they=
=20
hope to find bills that are so far along in the legislative process that if=
=20
the Assembly passes the bills they will not be able to be amended in the=20
Senate.  It does appear that the Assembly does intend to send these through=
=20
as two separate bills, though, with the SB 78XX provisions in one bill and=
=20
the AB 82XX provisions in another.

CPUC, Rate Setting Authority or Rate Setting Minority
Recently, the California Assembly has pursued a legislative provision that=
=20
would enable lawmakers to abrogate the CPUC=01,s rate-setting authority and=
 hand=20
over that power to the California legislature.  Politically, this gives the=
=20
Governor the ability to say, if rates increase automatically, that he did n=
ot=20
approve of the rate increase, and there is nothing he can do about it.  But=
=20
it also gives Wall Street buyers of California=01,s revenue bonds assurance=
s=20
that no matter what the need, there will always be enough revenue to back=
=20
revenue bonds payments; thus deniability to ratepayers and certainty for=20
bondholders. =20

Were this provision to pass, the CPUC would still retain oversight of rates=
=20
for the investor owned utilities.  As for DWR, under the draft rate agreeme=
nt=20
proposed by the CPUC, it contains a mechanism for the Commission to use in=
=20
setting electricity rates that satisfy DWR=01,s =01&revenue requirement.=01=
8 DWR=01,s=20
revenue requirements include bond-related costs, operating costs (such as=
=20
power purchase costs), and administrative costs.  AB1X provided for=20
energy-related bonds to be sold by the state to support DWR=01,s power=20
purchases.  Because power contracts require DWR to pay for power before it=
=20
makes bond payments, and DWR must sell power to obtain revenues, the=20
rate-setting mechanism in the rate agreement also applies to DWR=01,s power=
=20
purchases not just its bond payments. Note that if the Commission adopts a=
=20
rate agreement, it becomes irrevocable.=20
? -The draft agreement also includes a provision stating that the CPUC will=
=20
take the DWR at its word as to its retail revenue requirements.
? The agreement would require that the CPUC set rates meeting DWR=01,s=20
requirements in either 30 or 90 days. The 90-day mechanism applies whenever=
=20
DWR submits a revenue requirement. The 30-day mechanism applies when DWR=20
anticipates or actually draws on its reserves.=20
? The rate agreement includes an enforceable covenant by the CPUC specifyin=
g=20
how the Commission will set rates to meet DWR=01,s revenue requirements (wh=
ich=20
includes both bond costs and operating costs). =20

If the CPUC=01,s draft rate agreement is approved, there will be no legisla=
tive=20
or PUC oversight of any of those costs, and no opportunity for public comme=
nt=20
for as long as bonds are outstanding.  If a rate agreement can be avoided,=
=20
there will be opportunities to review and alter the agreement=01,s demand=
=20
management and administrative costs.  Either way, power contract costs rema=
in=20
an obligation of DWR and cannot be altered except by mutual consent of DWR=
=20
and the contractor.

SoCal Edison Investor Conference Call
The following are notes from the SoCal Edison conference call with holders =
of=20
defaulted debt, 24 July 2001, 1:30 PDT:

? In order for California to sell their revenue-bonds with an investment=20
grade rating, two criterion must be met; 1) there must be a rate-supported,=
=20
dedicated revenue stream in place and 2) the legislature must have the powe=
r=20
to override of the CPUC's rate setting authority and raise rates if=20
necessary.  The second criterion, however,  faces significant opposition fr=
om=20
the California State Constitution.
? Regarding the DWR rate requirement, Craver, the spokesperson for SoCal, =
=20
stated that SoCal is evaluating the numbers, particularly on the DWR side. =
=20
He stated that if you accept their output of models and numbers, it appears=
=20
this requirement would fit within the existing rate structure.  However, "w=
e=20
need to remember that deregulation started with forecasts that proved to be=
=20
wrong".  Therefore, this is "risky" in that SoCal is faced with "fixed=20
revenues and floating costs."  Unlike DWR, SoCal has no ability to adjust=
=20
rates based on costs, making floating natural gas prices a risk.
? Prudential asked, if based on the Hertzberg legislation, the sale of the=
=20
transmission assets is now off the table.  SoCal responded that this is=20
correct.  Prudential asked if SoCal could then anticipate more=20
securitization, i.e., be securitized for all but $500 million with an optio=
n=20
to buy the transmission assets at book for 5 years.  SoCal responded that i=
t=20
was "unclear what the pricing [of the transmission assets] would be, but=20
there would be an option" for the state to purchase the transmission assets=
.
? Prudential asked about the status of the remaining (non-legislative)=20
implementing decisions on the MOU and if the legislation (78XX and 82XX)=20
contains them.  SoCal responded that there are 3 outstanding issues remaini=
ng=20
for implementing the MOU:
 1) Ratemaking for the utilities' retained generation:  The PUC is holding=
=20
hearings on this issue this week.  These hearings have slowed the process. =
A=20
decision is expected by the end of August.
 2) A procurement plan for the utility: This plan is before the PUC.  SoCal=
=20
suggested the PUC may be waiting to see what passes the legislature before=
=20
acting on this point.  Regardless, the company needs an "adequate balancing=
=20
account with an automatic rate trigger."
 3) Clarification on the utility holding company's position regarding 1st=
=20
priority:  On this front, the PUC asserted its jurisdiction over all three=
=20
utilities and their holding companies.  The three holding companies have=20
challenged this decision.  Commissioner Bilas has written a draft decision =
in=20
favor of the challenge; a final decision is expected as soon as Thursday.=
=20
This would clarify that the utilities have first call on investment from th=
e=20
holding companies, but that the holding companies are not obligated to pay=
=20
the debts of the utilities.
? Deutsche Bank asked if, in SoCal's numbers reported to date, it was=20
assuming the charges for ancillary services.  SoCal responded that DWR had=
=20
confirmed as of 18 January that it would pick up these charges.  These=20
charges would otherwise amount to $800 million - $1 billion in additional=
=20
revenue requirement for the utility.  Based on FERC rulings, SoCal had not=
=20
been counting on paying these charges, so they are not reflected in the=20
company's numbers.  However, SoCal will be paying grid management and uplif=
t=20
charges.  They anticipate paying "some portion" of these charges.  This cou=
ld=20
potentially require an amended URG filing.
? Citigroup asked where Edison stands on the Edison Mission Energy issues. =
=20
Edison responded that they are "working on new facilities on the bank side.=
"=20
The current facilities expire on October 10th or 11th.  Edison indicated it=
=20
is in the process of finalizing sales of approximately 1,000MW of=20
non-strategic assets.  They are in negotiations with the final bidders exce=
pt=20
for Hopewell, which is done.  There is no specific timeline on when the dea=
ls=20
will be announced, but it is a matter of days to a week.
? Appalucia Management asked if, on SoCal's generation, DWR is assuming a=
=20
cost-plus or retail rate.  SoCal responded that it uses cost-of-service bas=
ed=20
rates.  The return on the 12/31/00 rate basis is approximately 4 1/2 cents.=
 =20
The $72.77 stipulated covers SoCal's generation, its contracted generation,=
=20
QF costs (which were quoted as the most significant portion) and=20
uncollectables.  This is driven by gas costs for the QFs.  Revenue is fixed=
=20
at $73.00.
