Subject: Attorney General May File Amicus in UC Case Against Enron

Sue Mara (who's having computer problems today) just informed me that she's 
heard a rumor floating around that Lockyear (sp?), the CA Attorney General, 
or someone from his office, will file an amicus brief with the court today 
supporting UC's action against us.  We'll try to get more info and report 
back.  Vicki/Mike/Bob:  I'm assuming that you folks and/or our attorney's 
will be there, so we'll get the details of any such appearance by the AG.

Best,
Jeff
