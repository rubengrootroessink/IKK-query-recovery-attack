Dear SVMG Member:

I need your help.

We will only limit the impact of this summer's Energy Crisis if all
Californian's make gigantic strides to reduce energy use.  With that in
mind, Governor Davis and the Legislature have passed the most aggressive
package of energy conservation incentives in the history of our Country.

Please note below a list of ways your employees - as residents - can save
money by saving energy.  I hope you will strongly consider relaying the
following e-mail message to all of your California employees.


SAVE MONEY BY SAVING POWER

As you know, California is in the midst of an Energy Crisis that is
threatening our state, the health and welfare of our citizens, and our
economy.  Fortunately, there are specific steps we can take - as businesses
and individual citizens - that can help us avoid rolling blackouts and their
devastating impacts this summer.

You may not be aware that Governor Davis and the California Legislature have
passed the most ambitious conservation incentive program in the history of
our nation.  This $1 billion package will help you - as a resident - to save
money while saving power.

Please note the information below to take advantage of these opportunities.
Along with the web site links below, please visit the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group web site - www.svmg.org - for specific energy
conservation steps you can take at home and at work that will help save
power, save you money, and save our State's economy in the process.

Thank you for your help.

* CARE Program: The PUC administers a low-income energy assistance
program for electric and natural gas service customers. Known as California
Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE), the program includes both discounts of
15% on electric and natural gas bills, and a residential weatherization
program.

GOVERNOR'S RATE PROPOSAL:

The Governor's proposal is designed to accomplish multiple goals, including
protecting consumers from extreme market prices by securing long-term
electricity contracts and implementing a tiered rate structure to reward and
encourage conservation. Approximately 53% of California households will not
experience any rate increase. The next 23% of residential customers will
experience about a 10% average increase. Residential customers who use the
most electricity (i.e., significantly more than 130% of the "baseline"
figure listed on each customer's bill), will experience a rate increase of
24% on average.
