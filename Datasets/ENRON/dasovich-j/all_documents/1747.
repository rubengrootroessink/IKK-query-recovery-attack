Paul, Tim, and Jeff,
I want to thank you again for offering me such a great opportunity.  Merrie 
and
I were very close to taking the job and had already picked out a school for 
the
kids and a few neighborhood options.  As I said, it was the potential new PJM
opportunities that cause us to turn it down.  However there is more to the 
story
that I should explain because I've accepted a job with PG&E in Maryland and 
that
may look bad from your perspective.  Unfortunately for me, after PJM's major
re-organization announced last week, the PJM positions were less desirable 
than
I had hoped.  I have been recused from many of my monitoring duties for a 
while
following PJM's code of conduct and I took the opportunity to talk to former
colleagues who are now at PG&E.  Due to the code of conduct, I'm either on the
job market or not, there's no in between, so I hope you understand that I 
needed
to consider my options all at once.  I met with PG&E and they immediately made
an offer for a position in a group doing mostly analysis and some policy if I
want it which is perfect.  You all know how much we want to be in Washington
because of our families and most of our friends.  They want me to quit this 
week
since I'm prevented from doing any work.  The Enron offer started this ball
rolling and initially we were only considering that.  People say I'm crazy to
turn it down which is probably true.  I hope you were able to find someone
suitable for your position.  If you're still looking, I know one top-notch
person FERC who would be perfect and who is outdoorsy and single so he might
jump at the opportunity to be in Portland.  His name is Paul Sotkiewicz
(pronounced Sutkee-evich), PhD econ from Minnesota, not "pointy headed" as 
Jeff
would say.  I wish you all the best.  Tim and Jeff I hope we can stay in touch
on GSPP-related issues.  They have the school moving in very positive
directions.  I'll give you my contact information when I have it.
Rob
