Gang,
?
Apologies for the spam, but I need your help (again).??I am a  second year 
MBA at Haas and my company?is broadcasting the Texas (15) -  Texas A&M (6) 
tennis match tomorrow.? Akamai?is our distribution  partner, but we are 
encoding at different bit rates this time; so, we need  additional 
data.??Also, we are formatting for Windows Media ONLY this  go around.? (Why, 
you ask.? Well, I kept waking up in the middle of  the night with a voice in 
my head saying, "Microsoft will assimilate you.?  It is futile to resist..."? 
We junked the Real Player.)
?
Anyway, it would be a HUGE help to us if you would take a few minutes to  
watch the broadcast, and then submit an online questionnaire about your 
viewing  "experience."? We get much better?data from people who are 
proficient  in using computers (i.e. Haas students), so?we appreciate any 
help you can  offer us.
?
The match starts tomorrow (Saturday) at 11:00 here on the west coast, and  
will go on for about 3.5 hours.? You can see it at www.universitysports.tv .? 
Ten  minutes of viewing (or attempted viewing!) would be plenty for our  
purposes.? But, the match should be pretty entertaining if you want to  stick 
around and watch.? It features two top-ranked college teams?who  are?heated 
rivals.? You can read a short write up on the match and the  broadcast from 
USA Today:
