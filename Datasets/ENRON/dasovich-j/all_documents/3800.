WPTF is submitting a K-A filing.  It supports Hebert's proposal but added m=

On refunds, WPTF is completely consistent with our filing. It argues:

2000 rates.  =20
? When a market clears at or below the soft cap, there should be no refund=

=09=09 Subject: Enron's Response Today - Key Point to Focus On

As I've been thinking about our response today, I would like Enron to focus=
=20
on making sure that the California (WSCC) markets are as good a possible fo=
r=20
business over the next 15 to 24 months.  Following that idea, I think that=
=20
the key points are (1) clarifying/raising the soft cap and (2) reducing the=
=20
burden/risk of the prospective refund period.

I know that we had discussed leading off with the debate over market power =
/=20
retroactive refunds, but I think that (a) FERC is not inclined to do much=
=20
more on this issue, (b) FERC wants to fix the market as much as it can give=
n=20
the current political realities, and (c) if retroactive refunds become an=
=20
issue, we still have our full compliment of resources to later fight this=
=20
fight.

I would recommend that the pleading and Alan's testimony be modified to bri=
ng=20
these issues to the top of the ticket.   We should still include all of our=
=20
other arguments.

Finally, I want to make sure that Enron is taking the right position by=20
quietly supporting a $250/Mwh soft cap with safe harbor fixes?  Sue Mara, c=
an=20
you please try and find out what EPSA, IEPCA, and WPTF are going to file?  =
I=20
want to make sure that we are in the ball park on this issue but not gettin=
g=20
too soft.
