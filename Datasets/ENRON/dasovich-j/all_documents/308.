A quick download on our conference call:  We agreed to split the larger group 
up into 3 working groups.  The 3 of us are in the southern group.  (I, for 
one, would be happy if all future meetings were held in Mexico City or San 
Francisco.)  By Feb 29, we are to circulate to the larger group a report on 
existing commercial problems along the US/Mexico border, e. g. continuing 
difficulties with El Paso Electric and moving power across the border, and 
recommendations for their solution.  Those recommendations could be much 
farther reaching than just a complaint action against the utility.

It is my impression that there could be significant opportunities if we could 
move more power south across the border, but that there is real intransigence 
on the part of the utilities on this side.  I have no idea what the situation 
is on the other side of the border.

Why don't we trade emails and voicemails over the next few weeks and try to 
schedule a conference call the week of Feb 14?  That will give us about 2 
weeks to get a written report together and to follow up on our brilliant 
discussions.   If you have a better idea, let me know.
