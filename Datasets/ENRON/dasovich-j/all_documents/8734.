Not sure if you guys are on his mailing list, but Sal is working with a
group to try to politically exploit the situation out there to weaken Davis
& Co. I believe he has been able to get some corporate funding from some
companies who have been on the other end of the Governor's attacks. A friend
who works with Sal called to ask if I thought Enron would be interested. I
told him I highly doubted it but to talk to the SF office or Rick if he
really wanted to pursue it.

 RE:     California's Energy Crisis

            What You Should Know About Public Utilities Commission President
Loretta Lynch

Attached please find a report on California's Public Utilities Commission
President (PUC), Loretta Lynch.   An appointee of Governor Gray Davis, she
serves as the Governor's key energy advisor.

During her tenure on the PUC, California's energy crisis has spiraled out of
control - leaving ratepayers, taxpayers and shareholders on the hook for
billions of dollars.  If only Governor Gray Davis and his political
appointees had acted last year, the costs and damage to California could
have been, if not averted, substantially mitigated.

After becoming more familiar with Ms. Lynch and her background, it becomes
quite apparent that she was and remains totally unqualified for the
extraordinarily important job she holds.  More disturbingly, it is also
painfully obvious that her principal responsibility is to provide political
cover to the Governor - as she did for President Clinton and his wife in the
Whitewater scandal - rather than working to solve California's energy
crisis.

The result has been a disaster for the people of California, while Gray
Davis has hidden behind his advisors issuing edicts of blame against
everyone and anyone imaginable.  It is time for the Governor to stop hiding
behind a political screen of cover, and demand Loretta Lynch's resignation.
If he is unable or unwilling to take such action immediately, the State
Legislature should itself take action and remove her from office as they are
constitutionally empowered to do.

After reading this report, you will no doubt agree that Ms. Lynch does not
measure up to the standards of competence, temperament and experience that
we need as the President of the California Public Utilities Commission.

Please feel free to share this information with others who may be
interested.  Should you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter in
greater detail please do not hesitate to call our office at (916) 441-3734.
