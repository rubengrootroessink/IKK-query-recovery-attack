Sandy:  yes; it is a loss as both Rogan and Bilbray would have voted with us 
on restructuring.    Lewis would not give up Appropriations where he is a 
Cardinal.   Herger would not give up Ways & Means.  Rohrabacher would have to 
give up International Relations which might be a possibility we could check 
out.  But, do you believe Rohrabacher would be free-market on electricity 
issues????  He is awful on free trade issues and supports sanctions.  The 
National Foreign Trade Council gave him an "F" score.  

But, hence, herein lies the problem.  Some of the best in the delegation are 
already on top-tier Committees and will not move while those willing to move 
might not be good on our issues.  Other ideas?????  Thanks.

with Rogan gone, the delegation suffers, the  two that you mentioned are 
definite possiblilites..would Lewis, Rohbacher or Herger have any 
interest..they might be good..
