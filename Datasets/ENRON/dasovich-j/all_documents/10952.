From a legal standpoint, they did not raise any new arguments - basically 
they state that our turning back the universities is costing the states 
money.  Everything depends on whether the  judge is likely to rule 
politically or legally.  As you know, we did not force the state to buy 
power  for customers - they decided to do so themselves.   If you like, I 
will send you a copy of the brief.

Thanks.  Any view on the likelihood that the brief will have weight?
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, this was filed last week.  The hearing is this morning. We are waiting 
for a report from Bob and  Mike, who are in SF.  The Asst AG  may be arguing 
at the hearing today.

Subject: Attorney General May File Amicus in UC Case Against Enron

Sue Mara (who's having computer problems today) just informed me that she's 
heard a rumor floating around that Lockyear (sp?), the CA Attorney General, 
or someone from his office, will file an amicus brief with the court today 
supporting UC's action against us.  We'll try to get more info and report 
back.  Vicki/Mike/Bob:  I'm assuming that you folks and/or our attorney's 
will be there, so we'll get the details of any such appearance by the AG.

Best,
Jeff
