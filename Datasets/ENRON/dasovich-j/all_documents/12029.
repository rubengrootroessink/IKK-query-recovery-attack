Wanda Curry had call with SCE Thursday afternoon on PX credit calculations.  
They will provide some more breakout of data to further explain things - 
gross PX credits (calculated on interim basis, post 1/19 using embedded gen, 
Qfs, ISO costs) before reduction to reflect new PE methodology.  During the 
call, Wanda became aware that SCE's proposed new method is a backdoor way to 
limit the PX credit to embedded cost of generation.   This is why we 
protested the Advice Letter.  It's just up to the PUC now to resolve the 
issue.
