Attached is the draft that we've discussed.  Few points:

It's a draft.  It would benefit from more tinkering.
It takes our core messages (what's the problem?  what's the solution?) and 
tries to weave in current events, understanding that by the time you're 
giving the presentation it may need to be further modified to correspond with 
rapidly changing circumstances and events.
It's frank but (hopefully) measured in describing the mess that is 
California.  It's set up so that it's easy to modify the more pointed 
statements.
Leaves plenty of room for you to tailor the presentation to particular points 
that you'd like to make, or data and/or information that you'd like to 
include.
I didn't have ready access to charts and graphs to back up the stats used in 
the text of the presentation, but I'm sure that it will be relatively easy 
for someone in Houston to pull that together (e.g., may want to poach a bit 
from Belden's presentation to include some PNW hydro stats (which I've also 
attached), or from ISO website to show load-resource balance info).
Though I'll be on vacation, I'll be checking in on voicemail and email, so if 
you have any questions, or need something additional to get the presentation 
ready, just let me know.
I may be in an airplane on Monday during both the leadership call and the 
newly restructured California call.  Otherwise, I'll be trying to make those 
calls dailywhile I'm away. 
And Jim, I'll also be available to participate in any calls regarding 
Calger's proposed deal with CDWR.
Finally, when the darn thing prints out, it prints borders around the 
heading/title box and the text box, though I don't know why.  Tried just 
about everything to get rid of them.  May want to have a PP guru in Houston 
see if (s)he can disable the boders.
Best,
Jeff
