Dear SVMG Member -

One of our business organization partners, PIBA, will be conducting its own
Energy Conference this Thursday, May 3.  While we will be holding an Energy
Summit on Friday at Synopsys, I want to continue to keep you apprised of all
opportunities to provide tools to get through this crisis.  So, especially
for anyone who cannot attend SVMG's Summit on Friday, please note the
details below for PIBAS's summit.

Best Wishes,

Carl

As the California energy crisis has deepened, organizations of all kinds
are struggling to keep ahead of energy management operating and planning
risks.  This 
 day workshop will focus on Successes and Failures of the
current energy management infrastructure, and will deliver some best
practices and practical planning solutions which organizations can employ
today to improve their energy management strategies.  Unlike other sessions
and conferences on this important topic, our session will be
practice-based, deliver usable tools, and provide you with a chance to put
your questions directly to experts and colleagues who have dealt with the
challenges of the Energy Shortage on the front lines.

We will open with an interactive session on energy sources, selection, and
"how we got here."  We expect this session will be led by Lynne Jimenez of
KGO-Radio.

We will then have a one-hour session on Best Practices in designing
buildings to avoid energy crises.  This discussion will include Ken Perkins
of Shaklee, and a second private sector building operator.

Our third session will focus on Breakdowns in the permitting and energy
sourcing and approval process, with Bob Thurmond from Cisco Systems and
Mary Tucker from the City of San Jose.

We will close with a roundtable discussion of Solutions and the Road
Forward, to include representatives of the City of Santa Clara, the League
of Women Voters, and Bill Smith from EPRI.  Ms. Jimenez will facilitate
this closing session.
