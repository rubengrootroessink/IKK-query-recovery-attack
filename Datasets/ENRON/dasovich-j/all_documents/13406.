Jeff & Alice:
I do not think I forwarded this to you earlier. I hope all is well. I'm
still leasing Bentley but, the Saturday AM classes have been completely
cancelled. I haven't yet determined another option.

I hope to see you at Kari's.
Madeleine

I thought you might like to know about this web site (below) built to
help save the stables in Golden Gate Park. Please visit the site and do
what you can to help. The site enables easy access to the mayor and the
supervisors.

It would be great if stables received an infusion of capital and became
a first class facility, baring this it would be great to at least keep
horses in the park to keep riding accessible for children in the city.

Please also spread the word that there are many older/beginning horses
looking for peaceful homes. Please let me know if I should contact any
stables directly to determine their interest in adopting these horses.
Thank you,
Madeleine
PS Lori and Kari the barn is eternally grateful for you taking Hobbs,
Yorkie and Oscar.
