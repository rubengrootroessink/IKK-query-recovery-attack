Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton and Assembly Speaker Robert
Hertzberg held a press conference moments ago to announce the joint
filing of a lawsuit against FERC.  The lawsuit will seek to mandate FERC
to prospectively limit the amounts charged by generators and marketers
and establish a refund program for recouping over-charges.  The suit
will be brought either in California District Court or the 9th Circuit
Court within the next seven days.  They expect the suit to be resolved
within the next three months.  The attorney handling the case will be
Joseph Cotchett who has agreed to represent the Legislature for $1.

I will fax a summary of the lawsuit to Houston, San Francisco and
Portland.  If anyone else would like a copy please let me know by
e-mail.
