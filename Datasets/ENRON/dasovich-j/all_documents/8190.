Dear EvMBA students,

Please ignore this message if you did not apply for the summer
international program.

Unfortunately, very few of the 56 people who applied managed to provide me
with their e-mail addresses, hence the need for this spam message.

For those of you who applied, please note that you were asked for some
specific information. Without this information your participation in the
program can not be decided:

1. The semester level that you are currently (January 2001) enrolled in.
(47 out of 56 provided this.)
2. Your e-mail address (25 out of 56 provided this.)
3. Your preferences for program (53 indicated a first preference, 27
indicated a second and only 8 indicated a third.) At a minimum please
indicate your first preference. If no second preference is indicated you
will ONLY be considered for the first preference.

In order to proceed I would like those of you who did not provide complete
information to do so as soon as possible. Once I have complete information
we will establish a priority list for each program.

A total of 5 people who have participated previously have applied to
participate again.

Each program will enroll a maximum of 15 participants, for a total of 30.
With 56 applicants we will thus not be able to accommodate everyone. We
will, however, establish a waiting list. In 2000, we moved a total of 9
applicants from the initial waiting list into actual participation.

We have not yet made a determination between the Latin America and Pacific
destinations. Demand exceeds places for both. Given the recent (over the
last few weeks) increase in unrest in Jakarta  we are reconfirming the
reasonableness of this destination.

Future messages will be sent to a specific e-mail alias.

Regards,

Sebastian
