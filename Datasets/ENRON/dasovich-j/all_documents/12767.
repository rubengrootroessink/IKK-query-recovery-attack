Subject: Judge's Ruling against Ratepayers Committee
Importance: High


There will be no Official Committee of Ratepayers in the PG&E bankruptcy 
case.  Judge Montali issued his order today granting PG&E's motion (in which 
our Creditors Committee joined), vacating the appointment of the Ratepayers 
Committee.  
The Judge ruled that the Bankruptcy Code does not grant the ratepayers 
standing as they are not creditors of PG&E, and that there is no statutory 
authority on which an official ratepayers' committee could be based.  The 
State Attorney General is capable of addressing consumers' interests in the 
bankruptcy case.  Individual ratepayers are always free to seek to intervene 
later on particular issues in which they have an interest.  The Judge made 
clear that "having an interest in a result (as all ratepayers do) does not 
rise to the level of having a claim as defined by the Bankruptcy Code."  He 
noted that "the Bankruptcy Code, and the bankruptcy court, were designed to 
resolve debtor-creditor problems; state agencies are where issues such as 
rates for electricity are handled....[T]he estate...should not be burdened 
with matters likely to be resolved elsewhere."  The ratepayers can take their 
issues to the CPUC or another forum where regulatory issues are heard.
Please call us should you have any questions. 
Regards, 
Allan
