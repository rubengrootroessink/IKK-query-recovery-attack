Robert Michaels is proposing a consultant study looking at the California 
electricity chaos (see attached).  It is roughly a $100,000 study before 
printing and distribution costs with a delivery date of December 1.  The 
study would also involve Ken Malloy's Center for the Advancement of Energy 
Markets.

I think Robert would do a good job but raise these issues:

1) This is expensive.  It is at consultant rates and is not an academic study 
where a think tank can get the professors to do something at less cost

2) Malloy is pretty heavy into this at a cost of $14,400 of about 40% of 
Michaels.  His NARUC connections are very important, and we would want him on 
the popularization side, but this is too much.

3) The study might need a co-author with lots of academic credibility to join 
Robert as good as he is.

I'm glad that we have this proposal--it will force us to think about what we 
want, who does it, and how it should be distributed.  We should also think 
about how much industry money we could gather to fund such an effort (it 
should be large given the stakes).

Can you provide your impressions so I can get back to Robert?
