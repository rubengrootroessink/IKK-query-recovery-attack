Dear Colleague:

I am writing to tell you about a free universal website you can use for
all your online coursework and professional services at the University of
California, Berkely. The site provides state-of-the-art Virtual Classrooms
that you can freely join or teach, which include syllabus development and
use, online scheduling, real-time chat, dedicated threaded discussions,
file sharing, online study groups, test generation, online grading, and
grade book accounting. Click here to use it now:

http://universalclass.com/business/business/index.htm?gc=14879

The site also allows you to upload your resume/curriculum vitae,
conference announcements, job postings, and other information of interest
to you and your colleagues within the department of Business and around
the world. The site is freely accessible to all students and faculty at
colleges and universities worldwide.

As you can see, this website only provides free services. We are not
trying to sell you something. The purpose of my e-mail is to inform you of
its location. If you want more information, please contact me. Otherwise,
I will not contact you again as a non-response means unsubscribe.

UniversalClass is dedicated to faculty and students at institutions of
higher education in the United States and abroad. It has over 300
departments specializing in nearly every academic area. To select a
department that interests you, click here:
