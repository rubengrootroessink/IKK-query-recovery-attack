Bush Expected To Act Soon To Fill FCC Chair; Transition Team Discusses Agen=
cy=20
Changes

With most of his decisions regarding top cabinet-level positions out of the=
=20
way, President Bush is expected to begin shifting his attention to selectin=
g=20
lower-level political appointees, including the FCC chairman and the=20
administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information=20
Administration (NTIA).

Late last week speculation was rife that a decision on the FCC top spot was=
=20
imminent, with a handful of insiders even predicting that a new chairman=20
could be appointed over the inaugural weekend or at the beginning of this=
=20
week.

One factor that several GOP insiders say could spur quick action from the=
=20
White House is the prospect of having Democratic Commissioner Susan Ness=20
assume the chairman=0F's duties.  As the most senior Commissioner at the FC=
C,=20
Ms. Ness would slide into that role absent an interim appointment by the=20
president, notes one longtime FCC observer.  =0F"And that just doesn=0F't s=
it too=20
well with a Republican administration,=0F" the source said.

Most Washington insiders expect Commissioner Michael K. Powell to be named=
=20
interim chairman, as no Senate confirmation is needed for a sitting=20
Commissioner to assume that post.  =0F"Mr. Powell is viewed by many as some=
one=20
who can get the FCC up and running without a learning curve,=0F" an industr=
y=20
source told TR.

But the question of who gets the permanent FCC job has been the topic du jo=
ur=20
for most telecom industry watchers.  Sources say Texas Public Utility=20
Commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood III has been positioning himself for th=
at=20
role, but Mr. Powell also is considered a front-runner for the position if =
he=20
wants it.

Under one scenario floated by a GOP insider, President Bush would name Mr.=
=20
Powell interim chairman and then, later on, nominate Mr. Wood as permanent=
=20
chairman and a new Democrat to replace Ms. Ness.  Ms. Ness=0F' term expired=
 in=20
June 1999; she currently is serving under a recess appointment that=20
then-President Clinton made late last month (TR, Dec. 25, 2000).  She may=
=20
continue in her position until a replacement is nominated by President Bush=
=20
and confirmed by the Senate, or until the end of the current congressional=
=20
session.

L. Ari Fleischer, a Bush transition team spokesman who was slated to become=
=20
White House spokesman after the inauguration, gave few clues during a Jan. =
19=20
press briefing about where the incoming administration stood on naming new=
=20
agency heads.  Asked by TR whether a timetable had been developed for=20
appointing a new FCC chairman, Mr. Fleischer replied,  =0F"That will happen=
 in=20
due order as those announcements are ready.=0F"

A spokesman at the Commerce Department=0F's NTIA said former Administrator=
=20
Gregory L. Rohde hadn=0F't made any decisions about his future plans.  As a=
=20
political appointee under former President Clinton, Mr. Rohde stepped down=
=20
from his post last Friday.

=0F"The wireless community wanted him to stay on at NTIA to help oversee th=
e =0F`
3G=0F' [third generation] initiative, but so far there=0F's been no indicat=
ion=0F"=20
that President Bush plans to renominate Mr. Rohde to be NTIA administrator,=
=20
the NTIA spokesman told TR.=20

Mentioned as possible candidates to succeed Mr. Rohde at NTIA are Earl=20
Comstock, a partner at the Washington law firm of Sher & Blackwell and a=20
former aide to Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska); James Derderian, former House=
=20
Commerce Committee staff director and a member of the NTIA transition team;=
=20
and Kevin Martin, who oversaw communications policy issues for the Bush=20
transition team.

FCC Transition Team Gathers

A Jan. 17 meeting of the Bush administration=0F's FCC transition team may h=
ave=20
failed to produce a name and a timetable for replacing Mr. Kennard.  But=20
numerous industry participants described the meeting as a productive first=
=20
step in smoothing out some of the rough edges at the FCC=0F-particularly th=
e=20
pace at which the Commission makes decisions and its role in reviewing=20
mergers.

Participating in the Jan. 17 meeting, sources say, were nearly all of the F=
CC=20
=0F"transition advisory team=0F" members (TR, Jan. 15) and officials from t=
he Bush=20
administration=0F's =0F"in-house=0F" transition team:  Mr. Martin; former R=
ep. Bill=20
Paxon (R., N.Y.), who is chairman of the transition advisory committee; and=
=20
Rebecca Armendariz, project director-FCC transition team.

Speaking briefly with TR last week, Ms. Armendariz described the meeting as=
 =0F"
good=0F" and =0F"productive=0F" and said it was the =0F"first and last=0F" =
time that the FCC=20
advisory team would meet with Bush transition officials.  Ms. Armendariz al=
so=20
reported that the FCC advisory team had grown to a total of about 42 member=
s,=20
which is =0F"six to eight=0F" more than was posted on the Bush-Cheney trans=
ition=20
Web site (http://www.bushcheneytransition.com) as of Jan. 19.

An advisory team member who didn=0F't want to be identified said the meetin=
g=20
lasted about one and a half hours and mostly focused on changes in general=
=20
FCC procedures.  =0F"There wasn=0F't much time for a lengthy discussion on =
specific=20
points, and they didn=0F't mention any names=0F" of potential chairman nomi=
nees,=20
the source said.  =0F"But there was a sense that things need to be speeded =
up at=20
the FCC, and [that] there ought to be less FCC involvement in the=20
merger-review context,=0F" the source reported.

Meanwhile, documents circulated among the FCC advisory team members show th=
e=20
Bush transition team sought feedback from the advisers on the following six=
=20
subjects:  (1) the top five issues facing the FCC; (2) what rules and/or=20
policies are in most need of reform; (3) what management, administrative or=
=20
procedural issues need to be addressed; (4) what can be done to expedite th=
e=20
FCC=0F's decision-making process; (5) what significant challenges will the =
new=20
administration and FCC face with respect to Congress, public perceptions, o=
r=20
the press; and (6) what organizational changes should be considered early i=
n=20
the new administration.

Participants in last week=0F's meeting were given a chance to go over paper=
s=20
containing their FCC =0F"wish lists,=0F" sources report, and the Bush trans=
ition=20
team =0F"seemed to be interested and listening.=0F"  Still, one source desc=
ribed=20
the meeting as =0F"light on substance=0F" and doubted whether =0F"anyone ha=
d even read=20
our paper yet.=0F"=20

Jay Kitchen, an FCC advisory team member and president and chief executive=
=20
officer of the Personal Communications Industry Association, told TR he was=
=20
encouraged that finding more spectrum for third-generation (3G) technology =
=0F"
was near the top of everybody=0F's list.=0F" =20

PCIA=0F's paper to the Bush team stressed the need to =0F"speed up the towe=
r-siting=20
process=0F" and ensure that wireless carriers =0F"receive all the interconn=
ection=20
rights they are due under=0F" the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Mr. Kitch=
en=20
said.

Progress & Freedom Foundation fellow Randolph J. May, also a member of the=
=20
FCC advisory team, called the Jan. 17 meeting =0F"productive=0F" and said i=
t gave=20
the Bush transition team a =0F"good chance to offer their views on what the=
y=20
thought were the most important and pressing=0F" issues at the FCC.  =0F"At=
 the top=20
of my list,=0F" Mr. May told TR, =0F"was changing the strategic focus of th=
e FCC=20
toward becoming a market deregulator.=0F"

SBC Communications, Inc., recently submitted a paper to the Bush team=20
recommending, among other things, =0F"closing the reciprocal compensation=
=20
loophole=0F" and =0F"ensuring that the marketplace regulates broadband Inte=
rnet=20
service,=0F" an SBC spokesman told TR.

SBC also proposed eliminating the =0F"duplicative review of mergers=0F" tha=
t=20
carriers face at the FCC and Department of Justice.  But SBC didn=0F't spec=
ify=20
which review should be phased out.  =0F"That=0F's the policy question that =
needs to=20
be answered by the new administration,=0F" he said.

Even telecom interests that weren=0F't represented on the FCC transition=20
advisory team have forwarded their telecom agendas to the Bush=20
administration. =20

In a letter sent to President-elect Bush on Jan. 18, the National Telephone=
=20
Cooperative Association advised him to appoint FCC commissioners who =0F"
understand rural America=0F" and give =0F"considerable thought to rural=20
representation=0F" at NTIA.

The Association for Local Telecommunications Services has submitted a paper=
=20
calling the =0F"the failure=0F" of incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs=
) to=20
open their networks one of the =0F"three greatest market failures that stym=
ie=20
full, effective competition.=0F"

=0F"According to the FCC, after almost five years, the ILECs have opened th=
eir=20
networks to competitors in only two states,=0F" ALTS wrote.  =0F"As a resul=
t,=20
[competitive local exchange carriers] have great difficulty interconnecting=
=20
with the Bell company networks to provide advanced services.=0F"

The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association has had =0F"extensiv=
e=20
conversations=0F" with the Bush team about spectrum management issues, wire=
less=20
location privacy principles, repealing the 3% federal excise tax on telepho=
ne=20
bills, and moving from intercarrier compensation for wireless calls to a =

bill-and-keep=0F" regime, a CTIA spokesman told TR last week.

FCC Focuses on International Detariffing, Intercarrier Compensation in=20
Biennial Review

The FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline=
 a=20
broad range of Commission rules, including those governing intercarrier=20
compensation for terminating telecom traffic, wireless licensing terms and=
=20
renewals, and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange=
=20
carriers.

The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan. 17 in Common Carrie=
r=20
docket 00-175.  The biennial regulatory review provisions of the=20
Communications Act of 1934 require the agency in even-numbered years to=20
decide whether given rules remain in the public interest, the FCC said. =20

The FCC doesn=0F't have to take final action repealing or modifying the rul=
es in=20
the even-numbered years, it said.

The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revis=
ed=20
version of the September 2000 staff report on the biennial regulatory revie=
w=20
(TR, Sept. 25, 2000).  The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare=
=20
rulemaking notices on the following:

=0F=07   Identifying alternative approaches to inter-carrier compensation =
=0F"that=20
are more consistent with the long-term development of competition=0F";

=0F=07   Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incu=
mbent=20
local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate=20
subsidiaries;

=0F=07  Simplifying FCC review of the =0F"average schedules=0F" used in det=
ermining=20
certain telcos=0F' costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier=20
Association, Inc.=0F's revenue pools; and

=0F=07  Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the=20
administrative costs of the association, which was created by FCC directive=
=20
to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers.

The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the=20
following streamlining efforts:

=0F=07  Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange=
=20
services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carrier=
s,=20
=0F"including commercial mobile radio service providers and U.S. carriers=
=20
classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliations=0F";

=0F=07 Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing=
=20
processes;

=0F=07 Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licens=
es, to=20
save processing time;

=0F=07 Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and=20
assignments of international facilities authorizations under section 214 of=
=20
the Communications Act of 1934; and=20

=0F=07 Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers.

The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking=
=20
notices to pursue the following streamlining goals:

=0F=07 Considering whether to eliminate restrictions =0F"on the aggregate a=
mount of=20
broadband PCS (personal communications service), cellular, and specialized=
=20
mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any market=0F";

=0F=07 Extending license terms beyond 10 years and implementing automatic o=
r=20
default renewal procedures to avoid late-filing problems;

=0F=07 Considering partially privatizing the site-by-site, frequency-by-fre=
quency=20
licensing process for the private and common carrier microwave services;

=0F=07 Bringing the technical and operational rules=0F-including radiated p=
ower=20
restrictions=0F-for cellular service, PCS, and general wireless communicati=
ons=20
service into conformity with each other;

=0F=07 Considering whether any of its part 22 (cellular) rules are obsolete=
 as a=20
result of competitive or technological developments; and

=0F=07 Bringing its radio frequency emission regulations into compliance wi=
th the=20
International Telecommunication Union=0F's radio regulations.

And the Commission asked its Office of Engineering and Technology to prepar=
e=20
rulemaking notices to address the following issues:

=0F=07 Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminatin=
g=20
ambiguities in equipment test procedures, including authorization procedure=
s=20
for transmitters that operate both in the U.S. and overseas; and

=0F=07 Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum ab=
ove 2=20
gigahertz.

The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new=
=20
rules, it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review t=
o=20
evaluate existing rules.  It stopped short, however, of adopting any criter=
ia=20
in binding rules or procedures.

The FCC rejected a proposal the U.S. Telecom Association had offered in=20
comments on the September staff report (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).  USTA had asked=
=20
the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified a=
s=20
unnecessary during biennial reviews.

Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain=
=20
flexibility, the FCC directed all bureaus and offices =0F"to prioritize=20
rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of=
=20
various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of=20
comments received=0F" in response to the planned rulemaking notices.

Issuing a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said t=
he=20
FCC shouldn=0F't view the biennial reviews as =0F"a burden to be endured or=
 a hoop=20
through which we must dutifully jump every other year.=0F"  He added, =0F"A=
s the=20
Commission moves forward, it is my sincere hope that we will devote=20
full-time, year-round staff to this endeavor.

Furchtgott-Roth Says Departure Of Kennard Won=0F't Bring Deadlock

Although the departure of FCC Chairman William E. Kennard leaves the agency=
=20
temporarily with four members=0F-two Republicans and two Democrats=0F-Commi=
ssioner=20
Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth doesn=0F't expect the agency to be deadlocked.

=0F"A lot is made about the political divisions=0F" at the FCC, he said Jan=
. 18=20
during his monthly briefing with reporters.  =0F"But I really don=0F't see =
it at=20
all.=0F"

About 90% of the FCC=0F's votes over the past three years have been unanimo=
us,=20
Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.  Only about 2% or 3% have been 3=0F-2 votes, he=
=20
estimated.  So it=0F's unlikely that many votes will be deadlocked with the=
 two=20
Republicans=0F-Mr. Furchtgott-Roth and Michael Powell=0F-voting against Dem=
ocratic=20
Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, he said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth commended then-Chairman Kennard for not trying to push =
=0F"
11th-hour=0F" initiatives before leaving the agency.  =0F"A lot of people w=
ere=20
worried that some things might be railroaded through,=0F" he said.  =0F"Cha=
irman=20
Kennard has been very principled about this, not trying to do a lot of=20
11th-hour rules.=0F"

Meanwhile, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said, the FCC had made =0F"significant progr=
ess=0F"=20
in its second =0F"biennial review=0F" of its regulations.  The Telecommunic=
ations=20
Act of 1996 directs the FCC to review its regulations every two years and t=
o=20
eliminate or revise any rules that are no longer necessary or in the public=
=20
interest. =20

Last week, the FCC issued a report on what rule changes it would propose as=
 a=20
result of its second biennial review (see separate story).

The report represents a =0F"substantial improvement over the really patheti=
c=20
effort that was done two years ago=0F" when the agency conducted its first=
=20
biennial review (TR, Jan. 4, 1999), Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth also reiterated his complaints about the FCC=0F's=20
coordination with other agencies in reviewing mergers and related license=
=20
transfers.  Regarding the proposed Deutsche Telekom AG=0F-VoiceStream Wirel=
ess=20
Corp. merger, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth disagreed with the FCC=0F's decision to p=
ut=20
its review on hold while the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal=20
Bureau of Investigation probe national security concerns (TR, Dec. 25,=20
2000). =20

He said it would be inappropriate for the FCC to impose conditions on the=
=20
merger that are requested by DoJ and FBI.  That, however, has been the FCC=
=0F's=20
practice in past merger reviews, he said.

UWB Operations Feasible In 3=0F-6 GHz Band, NTIA Says

Ultrawideband (UWB) devices likely can operate in spectrum between 3 and 6=
=20
gigahertz without harming incumbent users, including fixed satellite servic=
e=20
(FSS) operators, according to test results released last week by the Nation=
al=20
Telecommunications and Information Administration.  But NTIA said that step=
s=20
to mitigate interference probably would be necessary.

NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last=
=20
year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore=20
allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part 15 of its=

Results Will Aid Decision Making

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said at a Jan. 18 news conference that=

the test results =0F"will form the basis of negotiations between NTIA and t=
he=20
FCC to develop a final rule that will permit the development and availabili=

of ultrawideband technologies.=0F"

UWB devices use precisely timed pulses of radio frequency (RF) energy sprea=
d=20
across a wide swath of spectrum at extremely low power.  Proponents of the=
=20
technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications, including law=
=20
enforcement, fire and rescue services, the military, medicine, education, a=
nd=20
home and office local area networks (TR, Sept 18, 2000).  They say it won=

But aviation groups, the GPS and satellite industries, and others have=20
expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems. =
=20
They=0F've asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show t=
hey=20
won=0F't cause such interference.

In its tests, NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices =
on=20
federal air-route surveillance radar, airport surveillance radar, and air=
=20
traffic control beacon systems.

Based on the results of those tests, NTIA engineers developed mathematical=
=20
models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems, includin=
g=20
those operating between 3100 and 5650 megahertz, or 3.1 and 5.65 GHz.  The=
=20
tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range, although limits=20
might need to be placed on power levels, distance, and pulse-repetition=20
frequency.  However, there=0F's a question about whether UWB devices would =
have=20
a =0F"big enough window=0F" to operate if restrictions are imposed, Mr. Roh=
de said.

Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users (3.7=0F-4.2 GHz), micr=
owave=20
landing services (5.03=0F-5.091 GHz), and Doppler weather radar (5.6=0F-5.6=
5 GHz). =20
For FSS systems, =0F"the worst-case situation=0F" with regard to interferen=
ce =0F"
would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna=20
elevation angle of 5 degrees,=0F"  NTIA=0F's report said.  There would be m=
uch less=20
interference potential for FSS systems on tops of buildings or with higher=
=20
elevation angles, it said.

=0F"However, at this time uncertainty exists as to the effect of UWB signal=
 duty=20
cycle on the performance of FSS earth stations which have digital signal=20
processing,=0F" the report said.  =0F"This information would assist in esta=
blishing=20
the UWB signal peak power limit; NTIA study is continuing on this important=
=20

Regarding microwave landing services, UWB operations at power limits=20
currently permitted for part 15 devices may exceed the receiver interferenc=
e=20
protection standard.  More analysis of the effect on such systems is needed=
,=20
NTIA said.

Tests on systems operating between 900 and 1610 MHz and 1610=0F-3100 MHz=20
suggested there could be significant interference problems with incumbent=
=20
systems, NTIA officials said at the news conference.

But NTIA=0F's report indicated that UWB operations below 3.1 GHz were possi=
ble. =20
It said that while UWB operations in that spectrum =0F"will be quite=20
challenging,=0F" mitigating factors =0F"could relax restrictions=0F" on UWB=
 devices.

It also said that UWB emission levels would have to be significantly reduce=
d=20
to guard against interference.  And it concluded that further studies are=
=20
needed to assess degradation of existing systems, as well as relative level=
s=20
of noise, interference, and =0F"clutter signals.=0F"

Mr. Rohde said NTIA engineers used existing standards for determining the=
=20
potential interference of UWB devices.  =0F"Obviously this is going to be a=
n=20
area that=0F'll be the subject of a lot of debate. . .as to what really is =
the=20

Findings Draw Praise

NTIA=0F's test results drew praise from the UWB industry.  Officials of Tim=
e=20
Domain Corp., a leading marketer of UWB technology, said they were still=20
reviewing NTIA=0F's findings.  But they indicated they were happy the tests=
=20
showed the devices could share non-GPS spectrum.

=0F"While we have questions regarding some of the conclusions made by NTIA,=
 we=20
are pleased that the test results confirm that compatible operation of UWB=
=20

 full=20
confidence that the FCC will impose appropriate regulations and power limit=

e added.

Last year, Time Domain questioned NTIA=0F's testing methods, saying they mu=
st=20
reflect real-world conditions to be accurate (TR, Sept. 4, 2000).

Another developer of UWB devices, Fantasma Networks, Inc., also hailed the=
=20
test results.  =0F"We are confident that our deployment of ultrawideband=20

Angelos Amends Lawsuit Against Wireless Industry

As expected, noted plaintiffs=0F' attorney Peter G. Angelos has entered the=
=20
legal fray against the wireless industry over the safety of mobile phones. =
=20
Mr. Angelos has filed an amended lawsuit on behalf of a Maryland doctor who=
=20
claims that using a mobile phone caused his brain tumor (TR, Aug. 7 and Dec=
.=20
25, 2000).

The lawsuit, filed last week in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, seeks=
=20
$375 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages.

The lawsuit says the industry failed to conduct adequate testing on the=20
health effects of mobile phones and warn consumers about known risks.  The=
=20
industry =0F"manipulated the results of other testing, concealed evidence t=
hat=20
[mobile phone] radiation is harmful and suppressed scientific and medical=
=20
research,=0F" the lawsuit alleges.

According to the lawsuit, the medical and scientific communities have been=
=20
aware of the biological effects of radio frequency (RF) exposure since the=
=20
1920s.  The wireless industry was or should have been aware of evidence of=
=20
such health hazards, the lawsuit alleges.

Michael F. Altschul, vice president and general counsel of the Cellular=20
Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is named in the lawsuit,=
=20
said he hadn=0F't seen the amended complaint.

=0F"Regardless of who the lawyer is. . .the legal requirements remain the s=

Mr. Altschul said.  The plaintiffs have to show a link between RF radiation=

exposure and cancer, he said, and =0F"that science just isn=0F't there.=0F"=
  Spokesmen=20
for Motorola, Inc., and Verizon Communications, Inc., which also are named =
as=20
defendants, have made similar points.

Last week=0F's amended lawsuit, Christopher J. Newman et al. v. Motorola, I=
nc.,=20
et al. (case no. CCB-00-2609) was filed after U.S. District Judge Catherine=
=20
C. Blake last month dismissed a number of the counts in the original filing=
=20
but gave the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint.  The wireless=
=20
industry had succeeded in moving the case from Baltimore City Circuit Court=
=20
to federal court.

Mr. Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has won major cases against th=
e=20
asbestos industry and represented Maryland in litigation against the tobacc=
o=20
industry.  John A. Pica, a lawyer in Mr. Angelos=0F' Baltimore firm, has be=
en=20
quoted saying Mr. Angelos plans to file 10 lawsuits this year against the=
=20
wireless industry.  Messrs. Angelos and Pica could not be reached for comme=

Bob Gordon, a consultant to Baltimore attorney Joanne Lynch Suder, who file=
d=20
the original lawsuit on behalf of the Maryland doctor, said Mr. Angelos=20
agreed to be the co-counsel in a number of cases that Ms. Suder planned to=

Meanwhile last week, German researchers said there could be a link between=

NTIA Proposes Reimbursement Procedures For Relocated Government Spectrum Us=
ers

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is proposing=
=20
procedures for relocating federal government spectrum incumbents to other=
=20
bands to make way for commercial users.  Among the issues to be decided are=
=20
the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and=
=20
which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement.

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said the rules could bolster a high-lev=
el=20
effort to identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) wireless=
=20
services.  Then-President Clinton launched the initiative by executive=20
memorandum in October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan=
.=20
8).

As part of that effort, NTIA is studying the possible use of the 1755=0F-18=
50=20
megahertz band, which is used heavily by the Defense Department.  The FCC i=
s=20
analyzing use of the 2500=0F-2690 MHz band, which is used mostly by multich=
annel=20
multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service=
=20
operators.

NTIA=0F's proposed rules would cover such future reallocations, Mr. Rohde s=
aid=20
at an industry-government meeting on the 3G plan last week.  He said he hop=
ed=20
the final rules would be released this summer.

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 required privat=
e=20
entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or=
=20
modifying their systems because of reallocation.  The notice of proposed=20
rulemaking NTIA released Jan. 17 suggests ways to implement that mandate. =
=20
Comments are due March 19 with replies due April 18 in docket no.=20
001206341-0341-01.

In its rulemaking notice, NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government=
=20
spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technicall=
y=20
possible in their present bands.

If the incumbents are not required to relocate, under what conditions shoul=
d=20
they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for an=
y=20
system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing? NTIA asks.  For=
=20
example, it asks, should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the ba=
nd=20
on a noninterference basis with 3G systems?

NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a =0F=
"
comparable facility=0F" is available for a reasonable period of time.  It=
=20
defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operationa=
l=20
capabilities as the original spectrum.  NTIA suggests using four factors to=
=20
determine comparability:  (1) communications throughput, (2) system=20
reliability, (3) operating costs, and (4) operational capability.  It seeks=
=20
comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient.

NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement. =
=20
It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs,=20
including a mandatory negotiation period, third-party mediation, and=20
nonbinding arbitration.

NTIA seeks comments on what type of cost-sharing plan to adopt and asks=20
whether a =0F"band manager=0F" or some other entity should serve as a clear=
inghouse=20
to administer the plan.  And it wants input on whether it should =0F"sunset=
=0F" a=20
cost-sharing plan five years after any auction of former government=20
spectrum.  The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectru=
m=20
with classified frequency assignments.

At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the=
=20
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, NTIA identified 255 MHz of spectrum that can b=
e=20
reallocated from federal government to private use.  The bands identified f=
or=20
which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are 216=0F-220 MHz=
,=20
1432=0F-1435 MHz, 1710=0F-1755 MHz, and 2385=0F-2390 MHz.

The FCC has proposed allocating the 1710=0F-1755 MHz band for 3G services. =
 In=20
addition, Mr. Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the 1755=0F=
-1850=20
MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the 3G initiative.

Rohde Uncertain of Effort=0F's Future

At last week=0F's 3G meeting, Mr. Rohde said he didn=0F't know if the Bush=
=20
administration would make any changes to the 3G effort, which is operating =
on=20
a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for 3G spectrum b=
y=20
Sept. 30, 2002.  But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings=
=20
with Bush transition team staff members.  =0F"I can=0F't predict what=0F's =
going to=20
happen=0F" beyond Inauguration Day, Mr. Rohde told reporters.

The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA, James Derderian=
,=20
a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee, couldn=
=0F't=20
be reached for comment.  But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce=20
secretary earlier this month, Donald L. Evans said the Bush administration=
=20
was committed to finding 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).

Industry Expresses Frustration

At last week=0F's meeting, several industry representatives expressed=20
frustration that they didn=0F't have access to data they said they needed t=

NTIA-established working groups are reviewing the bands.

The 3G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released i=
n=20
March, with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in Ju=

Rick Kemper, director-wireless technology and security for the Cellular=20
Telecommunications & Internet Association, said determining the cost of=20
relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible=
=20
requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how=

they are being used.  But he said that data wasn=0F't available.

Donald Brittingham, director-wireless policy for Verizon Wireless, said he=

was concerned that the final band studies wouldn=0F't reflect all the indus=

But he urged industry officials to continue participating in the process,=

Diane J. Cornell, associate chief of the FCC=0F's Wireless Telecommunicatio=

=0F" and=20
she urged industry engineers to focus on technical issues concerning band=

Ms. Cornell also said industry should submit comments in response to NTIA=

Antenna-Rule Violations Prompt Proposed Forfeitures of $327K

The FCC and its Enforcement Bureau have proposed that two wireless carriers=
=20
and two tower companies pay $327,000 for violations of its antenna rules.

The largest proposed forfeiture was against American Tower Corp. for 36=20
violations in 14 states and Washington, D.C.  The FCC has ordered the=20

Fifth Circuit Joins Chorus On State Immunity Issue

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans), echoing thre=
e=20
other appellate circuits, has ruled that the U.S. Constitution doesn=0F't=
=20
protect state utility commissions from federal judicial review of their=20
decisions regarding carrier interconnection agreements.

In a two-to-one decision issued Jan. 16, the Fifth Circuit rejected 11th=20
Amendment immunity claims raised by the Louisiana Public Service Commission=
=20
during proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed by AT&T Corp.  AT&T was=20
challenging the PSC=0F's 1997 arbitration decision regarding its interconne=
ction=20
agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.

Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed state commission=
s=20
to review, approve, and, when necessary, arbitrate carrier interconnection=
=20
agreements.  The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission=
=20
determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropria=
te=20
federal district court to the review the carrier agreement.

In AT&T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. (case=
=20
no. 99-30421), the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Cou=
rt=20
in Baton Rouge.  The lower court had held that the 11th Amendment to the U.=
S.=20
Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees. =
=20
(AT&T had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit).

The 11th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts=
. =20
But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the U.S.=
=20
Supreme Court in its 1908 decision in Ex parte Young.  The Ex parte Young=
=20
doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoin=
g=20
violations of federal law.

The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their=
=20
constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the=20
interconnection dispute under the provisions of the 1996 Act.  The court al=
so=20
ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to AT&T=0F's request for=20
prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that AT&T had=20
argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections 251 and 252=

of the Act.

The appeals court reversed the district court=0F's ruling and remanded the =

for further proceedings.  Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote the opinion a=
nd=20
was joined by Judge Henry A. Politz.  Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented from t=

majority=0F's opinion.

Finding Echoes Other Circuits

Appeals courts in the Sixth, Seventh, and 10th Circuits already have held=
=20
that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to=20
state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements (TR=
,=20
April 5 and Oct. 25, 1999; and Jan. 24, June 26, and July 31, 2000).  Last=

fall, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising =
in=20
the Sixth Circuit (TR, Oct. 9, 2000).

In his dissent, Judge Smith cited the U.S. Supreme Court=0F's 1996 decision=

Verizon Adds Data To Boost Massachusetts InterLATA Bid

Officials at Verizon New England are counting on new data to satisfy=20
regulators=0F' concerns about its application to provide interLATA (local a=
ccess=20
and transport area) services in Massachusetts.  Early last week, Verizon=20
again asked the FCC to allow it to enter that market; late last month, the=
=20
company withdrew a similar pending application it had filed last fall.

The officials are hoping the new data will answer questions regulators rais=

about last fall=0F's application, including whether the telco provides=20
nondiscriminatory access to DSL (digital subscriber line)- capable loops (T=

Dec. 25, 2000).

Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a Bell company mus=

obtain FCC approval before providing in-region interLATA services.  The FCC=
=20
must determine whether the company has met a 14-point =0F"competitive check=

of market-opening mandates laid out in the Act.

Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon=0F's senior vice president-external affairs and pu=

nondiscriminatory access to lines other DSL providers lease from us, as wel=

FCC Gets =0F`Ahead of the Curve=0F' With Inquiry on Interactive TV

Although the market for high-speed interactive TV (ITV) services is in the=

collecting information on the status of the ITV market and whether it shoul=

The FCC issued the notice of inquiry in Cable Services docket 01-7 because=

docket 01-7 proceeding by March 19 and replies by April 20.

The inquiry seeks comment on what services constitute ITV services, how the=
y=20
will be delivered, and other questions about the status of the ITV market. =
=20
The FCC acknowledged that it was =0F"difficult to specify a definition=0F" =
for ITV=20
services because of the technological and business changes in the new=20
industry.  It sought comment on its initial characterization of ITV as a =
=0F"
service that supports subscriber-initiated choices or actions that are=20
related to one or more video programming streams..=0F"

The FCC asked about the technical resources or =0F"building blocks=0F" a=20

e=20
major building blocks:  (1) a video stream, (2) a two-way high-speed Intern=
et=20
protocol connection, and (3) specialized customer premises equipment.

=0F"To assess the possibilities for discriminatory behavior and what enforc=

=20
future, it is important to understand clearly how ITV providers will delive=

their services to consumers, including what type of contractual arrangement=
s=20
will govern,=0F" the FCC said.

It also asked whether cable TV providers would have the =0F"superior platfo=
rm=0F"=20
for distribution of high-speed ITV service and sought comment on the ITV=20
capabilities of direct broadcast satellite providers and digital subscriber=
=20
line service providers.  The FCC also sought comment on the legal=20
classifications of ITV services, what public and statutory objectives ITV=
=20
rules would promote, and what authority the FCC has over such services.

The notice states that the Cable Television Consumer Protection and=20
Competition Act of 1992 directed the FCC to adopt rules =0F"limiting the sh=
are=20
of cable capacity that could be used for commonly owned content and requiri=
ng=20
vertically integrated cable programmers to provide their content to rival=

the =0F"same factual predicates that Congress cited in the 1992 Cable Act w=

to apply to a distribution platform delivering ITV services, then some=20
regulation of those distribution facilities might be warranted.=0F"

The notice also asks for comment on how the FCC could implement rules to ba=
r=20
providers of multichannel video programming from discriminating against=20
unaffiliated ITV providers.  It asked for comment on how nondiscrimination=
=20
rules should be enforced.  It suggested that ITV providers and cable TV=20

Analysts See Shifting Alliance As BellSouth Sells Qwest Stock

It was the rumor du jour 21 months ago:  BellSouth Corp.=0F's purchase of a=

The transaction satisfies both companies=0F' needs, analysts said.  It give=

Qwest, on the other hand, gains the opportunity to boost its stock value, M=

Quinton said.  =0F"Qwest=0F's management is clearly sending a signal to the=
 market=20
that the company=0F's stock is undervalued at current levels,=0F" he said.

The sale of 22.22 million Qwest shares back to Qwest will leave BellSouth=

with 52 million shares, or a 3% stake in Qwest.  BellSouth agreed to hold=
=20
those shares until Jan. 16, 2002, except for 11 million shares it can sell=
=20
after Feb. 16, 2001.

Qwest probably will not be the buyer if BellSouth decides to sell those 11=

help BellSouth sell the shares to Qwest=0F's independent pension fund, but =
Qwest=20
can=0F't buy any more shares without running the risk of hurting its credit=

Qwest management consulted credit-rating agencies and decided $1 billion =

Nacchio said.

Two credit-rating agencies agreed.  Qwest intends to fund the purchase by=

Qwest filled almost 98% of it service orders for 2000 on time, Afshin=20

Last week, Qwest also unveiled permanent line-sharing agreements with=20

WorldCom To Pay Users $88M To End Overcharging Lawsuit

WorldCom Corp. has agreed to pay $88 million to customers who claim they we=

While the company admits no wrongdoing, it has agreed to compensate custome=

2000.  Under the terms of the settlement, WorldCom also agreed not to raise=

Court Rejects AT&T=0F's Appeal In Reseller Discrimination Case

A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court=0F's decision directing AT=
&T=20
Corp. to pay $2.1 million in damages for discriminating against a reseller =
in=20
favor of its own retail customers.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York) last week said=

there was enough evidence to support a Manhattan federal district jury=0F's=

finding that AT&T had favored its own end-user customers in providing=20

The appeals court rejected AT&T=0F's claim that the district judge should h=

of the Second Circuit held that there was sufficient evidence to support th=

The appeals court also rejected AT&T=0F's argument that the district court =

erred in instructing the jury that AT&T bore the burden of proving that its=
=20

In its original claim, NCA charged that AT&T delayed resale orders for up t=

But some analysts don=0F't give the company much hope.  Globalstar is about=

Even before Globalstar=0F's announcement last week, Credit Suisse First Bos=

The transaction still needs additional state regulatory approvals, and=20
WorldCom is facing a lawsuit from Digex minority shareholders seeking to=20

Level 3, SBC Reach Agreement On =0F`Recip Comp=0F' Rate Scheme

 a=20
two-tiered reciprocal compensation scheme designed to resolve disputes abou=

payments for terminating dial-up calls to Internet services providers (ISPs=

The agreement covers 13 states and sets two rates, one for =0F"in-balance=

nsidered=20
in balance if the carriers=0F' ratio of originating to terminating traffic =
is=20
3-to-1 or less; it is out of balance if the ratio is more than 3 to 1.

Although rates vary by state, the companies said the average rate for=20

out-of-balance traffic is $0.0018 per minute (retroactive to Sept. 1, 2001)=

New Entrants Will Prolong IXC Price Wars, Analysts Say

The financial future of interexchange carriers (IXCs) continues to be cloud=

analysts say.  That pressure will intensify=0F-and will begin to affect dat=

service, too=0F-as new entrants like Global Crossing Ltd. and Level 3=20
Communications, Inc., finish building networks and Bell companies gain=20
permission to offer in-region interLATA (local access and transport area)=

service, they predict.

=0F"We are deeply concerned about the incumbent long distance companies,=0F=
" said=20
Daniel P. Reingold, managing director-equity research for Credit Suisse Fir=
st=20
Boston Corp.  New entrants will be able to offer cut-rate service because=

their next-generation networks cost less to run than older networks, Mr.=20
Reingold said Friday, Jan. 19, during a conference call with clients.

Rosemarie Kalinowski, an analyst for the credit-rating agency Standard & Po=

Incumbents like AT&T Corp. and WorldCom, Inc., are building new Internet=20

t the=20
pricing pressures and compete head-to-head with the new entrants,=0F" she s=
aid=20
during a teleconference earlier in the week.

Managers at incumbent IXCs apparently were in a state of denial or were=20
caught off guard by a steeper-than-expected decline in rates, Ms. Kalinowsk=
i=20
said.  They mistakenly thought they could correct the situation by cutting=
=20
rates=0F-and thereby reducing their profitability, she said.

Although Mr. Reingold advised investors to steer clear of most incumbent lo=
ng=20
distance carriers, he said he thought Sprint Corp. might increase in value=
=20
because of a potential merger with Qwest Communications International, Inc.=
 =20
He said he expected a Qwest-Sprint merger to be announced in the next 12=20
months.

Merger activity in general may increase under a Republican administration,=
=20
Mr. Reingold asserted.  But some combinations will remain difficult or=20
impossible because traditional antitrust laws and the Telecommunications Ac=
t=20
of 1996 will stand in the way, no matter who is in power, he said.  For=20
example, he said, recent speculation that a Bell company might buy WorldCom=
=20
is misguided; the regulatory hurdles are simply too high.

But Mr. Reingold said he thought a merger of SBC Communications, Inc., and=
=20
BellSouth Corp. might be possible in a few years=0F' time.  Those companies=
=20
already have merged their wireless units to form Cingular Wireless.  Bell=
=20
companies are well positioned for the current economic climate because they=
=20
typically outperform the stock market during recessions, he said.

Bell companies also will benefit from the turmoil in the competitive local=
=20
exchange carrier (CLEC) industry, whose inroads into local markets have=20
slowed as a shortage of funds has forced CLECs to cut back, Mr. Reingold=20
said.  =0F"I don=0F't believe the CLECs are going away,=0F" he said.  =0F"H=

FCC Suggests Streamlining Carrier-Change Process

The FCC has proposed rule changes that would make it easier for carriers to=
=20
sell or transfer exchanges.  The existing rules require carriers to get an=
=20
FCC rule waiver or obtain permission from all their customers before=20
switching them to a new service provider.=20

The Commission is considering an alternative scheme to its current =0F"
subscriber selection change=0F" rules as part of its =0F"biennial review=0F=
"=20
proceeding.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the FCC to conduct=
=20
reviews of its regulations every two years and to eliminate or revise those=
=20
rules that it finds are no longer necessary (see separate story).

Under section 64.1120 of the FCC=0F's current rules and section 258 of the=
=20
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, a carrier must obtain and verify a=
=20
customer=0F's permission to change his or her service provider.  Those rule=
s are=20
designed to deter =0F"slamming,=0F" or the authorized switching of a custom=
er=0F's=20
preferred carrier.=20

In a third further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Comm=
on=20
Carrier dockets 00-257 and 94-129, the FCC said it receives numerous reques=
ts=20
a month from carriers seeking waivers of those rules in order to complete=
=20
transactions involving transferring customer accounts to another carrier.

The Commission suggested an =0F"expedited process=0F" for such carriers whe=
reby the=20
carrier would be required only to notify its customers of the upcoming chan=
ge=20
and to provide them with an opportunity to switch carriers.  Comments are d=
ue=20
on the rulemaking notice 21 days after it is published in the Federal=20
Register.  Replies are due 10 days later.

Under the FCC=0F's proposal, the acquiring carrier would be required to not=
ify=20
the affected customers 30 days before the close of the transaction.  The=20
Commission is seeking input on the 30-day interval as well as the kind of=
=20
information that should be included in the notification.  It also proposed=

Verizon Wireless Asks FCC To Delay 700 MHz Band Auction

Citing a host of concerns, Verizon Wireless has asked the FCC for another=
=20
six-month delay of the auction of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band, which=
=20
is scheduled to begin March 6.  The auction has been delayed three times=20
already.

In a Jan. 18 letter to Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Thomas J.=
=20
Sugrue, Verizon asked that the sale be postponed until September.  The lett=
er=20
was signed by John T. Scott, Verizon Wireless=0F' vice president and deputy=
=20
general counsel-regulatory law.

Mr. Scott said that if the auction was held as scheduled, potential bidders=
=20
wouldn=0F't have enough time to assess their spectrum needs because a reauc=
tion=20
of =0F"C=0F" and =0F"F=0F" block PCS (personal communications service) lice=

ongoing (see separate story).  =0F"Short form=0F" applications for the 700 =

auction are due Feb. 2, under the current schedule.

=0F"If the 700 MHz [band] auction begins on the current schedule, there wou=

no time for companies that are bidding in the PCS reauction to reassess the=
ir=20
business plans and develop bidding strategies for [the] 700 MHz [band=20
auction],=0F" Mr. Scott said.

The FCC immediately sought comments on Verizon=0F's request.  Comments are =
due=20
Jan. 24 and should reference DA 01-143.

Package Bidding Rules Cited

Mr. Scott also said carriers need more time to prepare because of new packa=
ge=20
bidding rules that will be used in the auction (TR, July 10, 2000).  He als=
o=20
cited continued concerns over when winning bidders would be able to build o=
ut=20
systems to use their newly licensed frequencies.  Similar concerns were cit=
ed=20
by the wireless industry when they successfully petitioned the FCC to move=
=20
the 700 MHz band auction from September 2000 to March 2001(TR, Aug. 7 and 2=
1,=20
2000).

Carriers had complained about the uncertainty of when the spectrum would be=
=20
available.  TV broadcasters with licenses for channels 60=0F-69 now occupy =
large=20
chunks of the spectrum and don=0F't have to leave until 2006 at the earlies=
t as=20
part of the transition to digital TV.

Mr. Scott said the uncertainty over when incumbent broadcasters would leave=
=20
the spectrum was still an issue.  He also noted that the FCC hadn=0F't yet=
=20
adopted proposed band-clearing mechanisms for those frequencies.  Even if=
=20
such mechanisms were adopted immediately, 700 MHz band auction bidders woul=
dn=0F'
t have time to use them, he said.

Mr. Scott also mentioned the high-level government-industry effort to=20
identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) services (see=20
separate story).  He noted that the 700 MHz band could be used for such=20
offerings and said the FCC should not auction that spectrum until it issued=
=20
an order allocating 3G bands.  That order is expected this summer.

=0F"There remains considerable uncertainty about the process for the auctio=
n,=20
the availability of the 700 MHz band itself, and the availability of=20
alternate spectrum,=0F" Mr. Scott said in the letter.  =0F"As a matter of s=

spectrum-management policy, this spectrum should not be auctioned until the=
se=20
issues are resolved.=0F"

=0F"Conducting the auction before prospective bidders are able to make the=
=20

assignment of this spectrum and ultimately disserve the public interest,=0F=
" he=20
added.  =0F"Greater certainty will enable the 700 MHz band to realize its f=

A spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association told=
=20
TR that Verizon Wireless=0F' request to delay the auction =0F"is legitimate=
=0F" and=20
said the trade group planned to file comments in support of a postponement.

During a briefing with reporters last week before Verizon Wireless=0F' lett=

was submitted (see separate story), Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth=
=20
said he had opposed the previous delays of the auction and would oppose any=

Ex-RSA Cellular Licensee Meets Judicial Skepticism

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington expressed=20
skepticism at a former cellular licensee=0F's argument that the FCC wrongly=
=20
revoked its license for =0F"lack of candor.=0F"  Alee Cellular Com-municati=
ons had=20
falsely maintained that all of its partners were U.S. citizens.

The judges appeared to agree with the FCC=0F's contention that substantial=
=20
evidence showed the licensee=0F's partners knowingly deceived the agency to=
=20
retain a rural service area (RSA) license for Catron, N.M.  The license was=
=20
awarded by lottery in 1988, when noncitizens were barred from holding an=20
ownership stake in FCC licensees.

Hearing oral arguments in Alee Cellular Commun-ications v. FCC (case no.=20
99-1460) Jan. 16 were Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards and Judges Douglas H.=20
Ginsburg and A. Raymond Randolph.

In 1992, FCC Administrative Law Judge Walter C. Miller ruled that Alee had=
=20
told the Commission falsely that all of its 14 partners were U.S. citizens=
=20
when it knew one wasn=0F't (TR, Jan. 11, 1993).  The finding was part of a=
=20
broader proceeding in which Mr. Miller found that nearly two dozen cellular=
=20
license applicants, including Alee, had agreed to share with each other the=
=20
revenue earned using RSA licenses.  Those =0F"risk-sharing agreements=0F" w=
ere a=20
violation of FCC rules, the ALJ found..

The FCC=0F's review board upheld Alee=0F's license revocation in 1994.  In =
1997,=20
the full Commission upheld the decision, saying Alee=0F's =0F"lack of cando=
r=0F"=20
required the revocation (TR, June 9, 1997).

Alee:  License Revocation Unfair

Alee attorney Philip J. Mause told the court that the FCC arbitrarily and=
=20
capriciously relied on Mr. Miller=0F's findings about the credibility of=20
witnesses that had testified in a hearing on the risk-sharing agreements. =
=20
Mr. Mause said Mr. Miller compiled no written record of his judgments about=
=20
the witnesses to indicate why he found them credible or incredible.

Mr. Mause also contended that the FCC rejected substantial, credible eviden=
ce=20
that showed that Alee=0F's partners hadn=0F't intended to deceive the Commi=
ssion=20
regarding the noncitizen partner.  He also said the agency=0F's decision wa=
s not=20
supported by substantial evidence.

Even if there was such evidence to indicate a lack of candor, Mr. Mause sai=
d,=20
the punishment of license revocation was too harsh considering that (1) Ale=
e=20
reported the infraction to the agency and (2) other licensees in similar=20
situations had received more mild sanctions.

But FCC attorney Joel Marcus told the court that before upholding the licen=
se=20
revocation, the Commission conducted an independent review of the case, in=
=20
which it arrived at the same conclusion Mr. Miller had.

Mr. Marcus said the agency=0F's decision was supported by substantial evide=
nce. =20
=0F"That standard is easily met here,=0F" he said, citing the testimony of=
=20
witnesses and documentary evidence.

Mr. Marcus also said the rule violations by other licensees were not as=20
severe as Alee=0F's.  He added that agencies are given broad deference in=
=20
developing sanctions for rule violations.

The judges seemed to agree with the Commission=0F's argument.  =0F"It looke=

But they urged the FCC to take a cautious approach, recognizing that they=

(ALTS) offered at least a step toward resolving the simmering disputes=20
between CLECs and IXCs over access charges.

Seeking additional comments in its long-running proceeding in Common Carrie=
r=20
dockets 96-262 and 97-146, the FCC late last year asked parties to address=

(1) the need for a =0F"rural exemption=0F" to any benchmark established for=
 CLECs=0F'=20
interstate access charges, and (2) the extent of abuses by CLECs in setting=

The Association for Communications Enterprises (ASCENT) reiterated its call=
=20
for the FCC to adopt =0F"safe harbor=0F" ranges for CLEC access charges; ch=

within those ranges would be deemed reasonable and lawful.

ASCENT said there was =0F"significant merit=0F" to the ALTS proposal (TR, J=

The FCC=0F's proposal to reduce service-quality reporting requirements for=

Competitive carriers and small to midsize ILECs took issue with the FCC=0F'=

=20
that large ILECs must follow.  And state regulators in particular worried=

that reducing the amount of available service-quality data could hamper sta=

Overall, most parties commenting last week on the proposal criticized it fo=

The biennial reviews are aimed at reducing regulations that are no longer=

ILECs Not Enthusiastic

Incumbent local exchange carriers applauded the FCC=0F's plan to reduce the=

rulemaking notice, including the FCC=0F's proper role in collecting the dat=

The U.S. Telecom Association said the FCC=0F's proposal would increase the =

The FCC should determine what the federal interest in service-quality=20

SBC Communications, Inc., was skeptical of the FCC=0F's proposal to use ARM=

to the public in an accessible format and doesn=0F't allow customers to com=

a wide range of carriers, SBC said.=20

The Independent Telephone & Telecommunications Alliance, which comprises=20
midsize ILECs, strongly objected to the FCC=0F's proposal to extend=20
service-reporting requirements to all its members.  The FCC currently=20
requires only ILECs that are regulated by a price cap mechanism to file=20
service-quality reports.

ITTA objected to the FCC=0F's introducing the proposal during a biennial re=

Imposing such conditions on carriers that serve less than 2% of the nation=

CLECs, IXCs Want More Data

Most CLECs had harsh words for the FCC=0F's proposal to extend service-qual=

Rohde:  Spectrum Management Holds Key Challenge for Future

Mr. Rohde also cited NTIA=0F's efforts to bridge the =0F"digital divide,=0F=

Technology Opportunities Program, and its work with the FCC to improve=20
telecom access on tribal lands.   NTIA has revitalized its Minority=20

Looking to the future, he stressed the importance of allocating 3G spectrum=

NTCA Makes Push for MAG Plan, Lifting Caps on Universal Service

Policy-makers need to realize that even though rural telcos serve only a=20
small percentage of the telecom market, their operations cover nearly 40% o=
f=20
the nation=0F's land and, in many cases, they=0F're entering multiple lines=
 of=20
business.  That=0F's the message the National Telephone Cooperative Associa=
tion=20
is carrying to the FCC and Congress as it seeks to garner more federal=20
support for some of its pet projects.

On Capitol Hill, NTCA plans to revive its legislative push to eliminate cap=
s=20
on the amount that individual carriers are eligible to receive in universal=
=20
service support, says Chief Executive Officer Michael Brunner.  The=20
association is considering broadening that proposal to include a broadband=
=20
tax credit plan, he says.

At the FCC, the group=0F's most pressing concern is getting quick adoption =
of=20
the multiassociation group (MAG) plan for overhauling the interstate access=
=20
charge system for telcos operating under rate-of-return regulation, Mr.=20
Brunner tells TR.  An edited transcript of our conversation follows.

TR:  What are NTCA=0F's top priorities for the 107th Congress?  Should we e=
xpect=20
to see your proposal from the last Congress to lift the universal service c=
ap?

Brunner:  The answer is yes.  As you know, we were instrumental in working=
=20
with [Sen. Conrad] Burns [R., Mont.] in getting that bill introduced in the=
=20
last session.  Obviously that=0F's a priority again, as the Rural Task Forc=
e has=20
sort of come up with half a loaf in recommending an index cap.

We see the Rural Task Force plan as better obviously than the current=20
situation, but we see it causing a problem down the road.  For example, if =
a=20
lot of acquisitions occur=0F-and I think they will=0F-then there=0F's going=
 to be a=20
need to upgrade all those lines. =20

The current cap won=0F't be adequate to do that, and we hope the Commission=
,=20
under any circumstances, wouldn=0F't go below what the Rural Task Force is=
=20
recommending.

TR:  That effort garnered bipartisan backing from key U.S. senators last=20
session.  What=0F's your strategy for expanding congressional support for i=
t in=20
the 107th Congress?

Brunner:  One way to do that might be to go back to the drafting of the=20
Telecommunications Act of 1996, when Congress really understood that we hav=
e=20
to give equal weight to the twin goals of competition and universal service=
. =20
Our feeling is that this Commission and the past Commissions, perhaps, may=
=20
have given more weight to competition and less to universal service.

It=0F's real clear in the statute that Congress thinks those issues are equ=
ally=20
weighted, and whether or not people like it, things cost more in rural=20
America.  If we really want to bring broadband services to all Americans, w=
e=20
can=0F't do it without some kind of support. =20

And if Congress is saying on the one hand, =0F"Deploy advanced services,=0F=
" it=20
seems odd to say on the other hand, =0F"We=0F're going to limit this cap, l=
imit the=20
support.=0F"

Rep. Nathan Deal [R., Ga.] was our key guy in the House on this last year,=
=20
and Sen. Burns in the Senate.  We=0F're working with a lot of other people,=
 too,=20
to see if we can=0F't be more comprehensive this time around.

For example, another key component of our plan could be some kind of tax=20
credit or a low-interest [Rural Utilities Service] loan.  And rather than=
=20
have one bill address this part and one for that part, we may have all of=
=20
those wind up in one comprehensive package.

On the broadband tax credit plan, the idea is to develop. . .a bill that=20
would enable carriers to claim a fairly substantial credit for deploying=20
broadband services to rural areas.  We don=0F't want it to be technology-=
=20
specific, where you end up with something that seems to favor one technolog=
y=20
over the other.

I don=0F't want to be too specific because we=0F're still working with a nu=
mber of=20
our own members to work out the details.  We don=0F't have a perfect packag=
e=20
yet. . .and I don=0F't think it would be hugely expensive.  We realize no o=
ne=0F's=20
going to go for a big spending bill, especially with the economy sort of=20
turning right now, or potentially turning.

But we=0F're still moving forward on this.  Our annual meeting will be held=
 the=20
first week in February, and that=0F's when we=0F're really going to start h=
ashing=20
out some of these things and talking about some overall policy resolutions.

TR:  One thing you haven=0F't mentioned is a deregulatory approach to broad=
band=20
service deployment.  Why?

Brunner:  We really haven=0F't been drawn to that approach for a lot of rea=
sons,=20
one being that we think a broadband tax credit bill is a more targeted=20
approach that really gets at the issue.  If the policy-makers really want t=
o=20
deploy broadband services nationwide, and they say they do, this is the way=
=20
to help us to do it.

TR:  Staying on the congressional front, what=0F's NTCA=0F's reaction to Fr=
ed Upton=20
[R., Mich.], who has limited telecom experience, being named chairman of th=
e=20
House Energy and Commerce Committee=0F's telecommunications subcommittee?

Brunner:  We=0F're excited about Fred Upton being in that role.  He does ha=
ve=20
some rural parts to his district; in fact, some of our own commercial telco=
=20
members are up there=0F-Bloomingdale Telephone Co. of Bloomingdale, Mich., =
and=20
Climax Telephone Co., of Climax, Mich.

Also, the ratio now in the House is about 14 urban members to one rural=20
member.  So whenever you get a person with some rural territory in a key=20
telecom policy-making slot, NTCA is thrilled.  We think that Mr. Upton will=
=20
do a good job and hope he=0F'll be sensitive to NTCA=0F's issues.

TR:  I understand that you=0F've been consulting with members of Congress a=
bout=20
the MAG plan and that some senators have asked the FCC to put it on the fro=
nt=20
burner.  What kind of time line do you have in mind for action on the MAG=
=20
plan?

Brunner:  We want to move it quickly.  We=0F've spent a lot of time, as hav=
e=20
other trade associations, getting our members on board.  It was a grueling=
=20
process, and I think the product=0F's pretty good.  So our feeling, at this=
=20
point, is that we really want the whole thing adopted as is.

We=0F're not comfortable backing off any part of it.  If the Commission doe=
s=20
back off or review it, then we reserve the right to say, =0F"Stop, and let=
=0F's=20
look at it again.=0F"

The main thing is keeping the process moving.  It=0F's easy for things to g=
et=20
bogged down in the regulatory or congressional processes.  We have many=20
friends on Capitol Hill, mainly in the Senate, where so many members have k=
ey=20
rural areas in their state.  The main message right now is, =0F"Let=0F's ke=
ep the=20
MAG plan moving.=0F"

Most people think it=0F'll probably take six months to a year to get the wh=
ole=20
thing through.  The other wild card, to some extent, is the Rural Task Forc=
e=20
report, which is moving along on a fast track.  There=0F's some commonality=
=20
between those two.  Our dream=0F-although we thought it probably wasn=0F't =
super=20
likely=0F-was that the Commission would just simply adopt the MAG plan as i=
s.

TR:  What about the expected turnover at the FCC?  How do you see that=20
affecting the Com-mission=0F's consideration of the MAG plan?

Brunner:  It could go a bunch of different ways.  You could get someone=20
coming in who says, =0F"A lot of real smart people spent a lot of time on t=
his,=20
and rather than reinvent the wheel, I=0F'm more inclined to support it.=0F"

Or you could get someone else who says, =0F"I don=0F't understand all this,=
 and I=20
want to start from square one and take my time.=0F"  We just don=0F't know =
who the=20
players are going to be.  I expect some of the current Commissioners still=
=20
will be there.

TR:  Most believe Commissioner Michael K. Powell will be tapped to fill the=
=20
vacant chairman seat, at least initially.  Have you gotten any feedback fro=
m=20
his office about his position on the MAG plan?

Brunner:  Not really.  We=0F've visited the staffs of all the Commissioners=
, and=20
most of them weren=0F't real specific on [the plan].  So we certainly want =
to=20
give him and others the benefit of the doubt.  We hope they would view it=
=20
favorably.  I think everyone will respect the work that went into it, even =
if=20
they don=0F't agree with it.

TR:  Let=0F's talk about your recent white paper recommending that universa=
l=20
service =0F"high-cost=0F" support be =0F"nonportable=0F" [TR, Jan. 15].  Ho=
w did you come=20
to this conclusion, and where do you go with it?

Brunner:  What we=0F've got there is a study with some actual data.  It sho=
ws=20
that introducing competition in rural areas is ultimately going to lead to=
=20
less broadband technology deployment. =20

Our next step is to try to convince regulators that artificial competition=
=20
doesn=0F't work.  If there=0F's an actual market for more than one carrier,=
 then=20
indeed consumers might benefit.  But there aren=0F't great public benefits,=
 as=20
we see it, to artificially creating competition where markets don=0F't=20
ordinarily permit competition as a matter of course.

Our point is that sometimes the regulators try to take an urban solution an=
d=20
inject it into rural America.  It makes sense to induce competition in=20
downtown areas like Los Angeles or Chicago, where the average Bell company=
=20
has anywhere from 130 to 150 customers per mile.  But we only have four or=
=20
five or six per mile=0F-very small numbers.

We would argue that it=0F's hard for one carrier to really make it in these=
=20
markets.  And if they force a second one or a third one in, it splits up th=
e=20
business even more, and no one=0F's going to have the wherewithal to delive=
r=20
broadband services.

One of our main themes on Capitol Hill and at the Commission is that=20
policy-makers need to appreciate the fact that rural areas are different. =
=20
Most policy-makers, as you might imagine, have an urban background. . .Our=
=20
job is to continue to try to educate people about the differences between=
=20
urban and rural areas.

We=0F've done that with some success.  For example, we=0F've had several of=
 the=20
Commissioners come out and speak at our meetings, spend time with our=20
members, talk with them one-on-one.  [Commissioner Harold W.]=20
Furchtgott-Roth, for example, came out and visited a small telco with us.  =
We=20
really look for opportunities to give them a greater appreciation of these=
=20
kinds of things.

Going back to Congress, we also want to really caution people not to reopen=
=20
up the Telecommunications Act or to pass a new Act until some of the key=20
rural issues are resolved.  We=0F're now going on five years since passage =
of=20
the Telecommunications Act, and some of our members still can=0F't plan bec=
ause=20
they don=0F't know about [the outcome of] access charge reform.  As you kno=
w,=20
our members get better than 50% of their revenues from access charges.

The biggest decisions for the new Commission will be on high-cost support a=
nd=20
access charge reform.  Both the MAG and the Rural Task Force plans have=20
touched on that.

TR:  Switching gears to the incoming Bush administration, how do you forese=
e=20
the Department of Agriculture=0F's Rural Utilities Service [RUS] developing=
 over=20
the next few years?  Will there be major changes?

Brunner:  Actually, to be honest, no one knows.  My sense is that the RUS n=
o=20
longer is the political issue it used to be because when people look at it,=
=20
they=0F're seeing that the cost of that program is so minute.  It=0F's some=
where=20
around $6 million or $7 million in interest subsidies for about $600 millio=
n=20
in loans.

And everyone thinks it does work well; there=0F's never been a default.  So=
 I=20
don=0F't sense we=0F're going to have an effort, as was made in the Reagan=
=20
administration, to really cut back on some of these things.  I could be=20
totally wrong, but my sense is it has enough respect and support on both=20
sides of the aisle.

Plus, the lending no longer is simply for the same =0F"plain old telephone=
=20
service=0F"; it=0F's now for some new things.

TR:  Let=0F's talk about NTCA=0F's membership.  What kind of efforts are un=
der way=20
to accommodate some of your members=0F' non-ILEC [incumbent local exchange=
=20
carrier] operations?

Brunner:  Many years ago there were questions about how our members would=
=20
adapt to change in competition.  My sense is that they=0F're adapting quite=
=20
well, as almost all of them are in multiple lines of business.  They=0F're=
=20
becoming Internet service providers, many of them are in the cable TV=20
business, most of them have wireless or broadcast satellite operations, som=
e=20
are resellers, and many are becoming CLECs [competitive local exchange=20
carriers].

They=0F've gotten into multiple lines of business, so they are becoming, in=
 a=20
lot of ways, more than ILECs.  We=0F've broadened our approach to assist th=
em in=20
some other areas.  So it=0F's a very active membership, some more than othe=
rs.

We have a new initiative called C3A.  It=0F's really an effort to get membe=
rs=20
who are thinking more competitively to get together and perhaps aggregate=
=20
their businesses with things like volume discounts. =20

I=0F've been very pleased with our membership=0F's willingness to grow and =
change. =20
For a while I thought they just might want to keep doing things the same ol=
d=20
way that has always worked for them.  But they really are changing.

We=0F're not the biggest player.  We=0F're only about 5% of the industry, b=
ut it=20
really is a critical 5%.  We represent roughly 40% of the land in this=20
country, but it=0F's a unique and critical part.

We would just really hope that the policy-makers would make it a priority t=
o=20
understand that the 5% we serve is as important as the whole.  That=0F's=20
something that some people miss.
