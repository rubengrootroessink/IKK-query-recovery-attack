Jeff,
I'd be happy to copy you on what I'm filing regarding QF energy pricing. I'd 
appreciate the same courtesy. I have no idea what Ken Lay is advocating in 
California becuase no one has ever sent me any information. I know he has 
been in California because of the conference calls, but don't know his 
message.
Hap
