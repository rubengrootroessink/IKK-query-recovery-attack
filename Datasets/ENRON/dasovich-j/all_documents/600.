I reviewed the articles on Global Photon for more detail, and found 
references to the following contracts:

6/7/00 $100 million contract with Alactel to build a fully integrated 
submarine and terrestrial Dense Wavelenthg Division Multiplexing network in 
California (a 2000 km network called the Global West Network)

4/19/99 Tyco International Ltd.'s Tyco Submarine Systems Ltd. unit signed a 
$93 million supply contract for Global West, a five segment fiber optic 
undersea cable system that will connect major cities along the California 
coast.  TYC said an operations, administration and maintenance contract will 
bring another $50 million, and two optional segments could increase the value 
by an add'l $25 million

The permits obtained to begin the project are referenced in a press release 
on the company website.  There is no other supporting evidence of these 
contracts or any other, nor further mention of Global Photon's Global West 
Network project.

Ethan,

Thanks for the research.  My cursory review of the articles turned up one 
interesting fact: they claim that GP has signed a $100 mm contract with 
Alcatel - a euro telecom company.  Please:
Re-review the articles to see if that is correct and any other contracts you 
can find.
Try to double check the press releases by looking at alcatel's published 
financials if any.

This is a pretty low priority thing.  Try to have it done by Friday afternoon.

Thanks,

Brian


PS: How is it going with Matt J?
