Internet Daily for Wednesday, June 6, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com

Dot-com closures ease a bit in May

The number of Internet companies closing their doors in May
slipped to 54, down from  58  in April, according to
Webmergers.com, a company that helps Net firm buyers and sellers
get together. At least 493 Internet companies have folded since
January 2000, said the San Francisco-based firm's chairman, Tim
Miller, with 55% of these shutdowns occurring in the first five
months of this year. Companies that sought to do business in
e-commerce account for nearly half of all shutdowns to date, but
Miller said the shakeout is spreading to new sectors, such as
Internet consulting firms and providers of dialup or DSL Internet
access.

Netscape's new new thing

The company formerly known for its Web browser is shifting its
strategy to become a portal like Yahoo and Lycos . "Six months
from now, you won't consider Netscape to be a browser company,"
Netscape President Jim Bankoff told Reuters. Instead, the AOL
Time Warner subsidiary is becoming content-intensive, featuring
many of its parent company's entertainment artists and
publications. Bankoff said a brand advertising campaign for the
site would begin later this year. Lydia Loizides, an analyst at
Internet research firm Jupiter Media Metrix, said she's been
waiting for such a move. "It's not going to be Netscape but
rather Netscape.com," Loizides said in the Reuters report, adding
that she wouldn't be surprised if Netscape began subscription
services offering special Time Warner programming or software.

AOL's Leonsis: Microsoft talks continue

Microsoft and AOL Time Warner  are continuing discussions about
whether America Online access software will be included in
Microsoft's new XP operating system, according to AOL Vice
Chairman Ted Leonsis. Speaking at the Internet Content.Net
conference in Los Angeles, he said there has been some "give and
take," Dow Jones reported. He denied strongly criticizing
Microsoft for bolting its instant messaging features to the
operating system. "I never said it was anti-competitive," he
said. Leonsis also tried to dispel discouragement about  Internet
business. "Is this the end of a boom? No, it's just getting
started," he said.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
New wrinkle on Web phone calls

Net2Phone announced Wednesday a new service enabling consumers to
place and receive telephone calls over broadband networks without
a PC. Subscribers plug their standard telephone into a device,
which then connects to a cable or DSL modem. "Our new VoiceLine
service enables anyone with a broadband connection to add
secondary-line capability in their home without incurring a
monthly line fee, with lower calling plans than traditional phone
services offered today, all through your telephone," said Scott
Sobel, the Newark, N.J.-based company's vice president of
broadband services and solutions.

Compaq slashes price of Net appliance

Compaq Computer cut the price of its iPAQ Internet access device
by $200 and said it will include six months of free MSN access in
the deal, a $132 value. A spokesman for the company conceded
sales of the two iPAQ models have been less than expected. "We've
learned our lessons, and we're trying to increase the appeal for
this young category that we still believe is a viable one,"
spokesman David Albritton told CNet News. This is the second
price cut for the year-old iPAQ product line, with the entry
model now priced at $299.
