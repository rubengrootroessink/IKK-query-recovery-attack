Solar Power System; State and City Officials Encourage Corporate Sector to=

Use Solar Power

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Neutrogena
Corporation, a Johnson &amp; Johnson company, and the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power announced today, the completion of a
200-kilowatt $1.4 million solar power system at the company's
headquarters, located near LAX.


The system was made possible through the LADWP Solar Incentive
Program that substantially lowers the purchase price of such systems
for the municipally owned utility's customers.


The solar system covers 24,000 square feet of roof area and will
help reduce the company's energy consumption by approximately 20
percent monthly.


"This is the type of leadership the people of California need from
the corporate sector to successfully meet the energy consumption
demands in the State," said Dr. Woodrow Clark, senior policy analyst,
energy and reliability for California Governor Gray Davis. "I commend
the LADWP for their promotion of solar energy, and strongly encourage
other companies to follow Neutrogena's lead in using solar power."


Neutrogena received a $1 million Solar Incentive or rebate from
LADWP. Its system utilizes Siemens Solar panels and was designed and
installed by the PowerLight Corporation.


"This new solar power system is an example of the innovative ways
the City and local businesses are working together to conserve
energy," said Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn. "Using solar power will
lead to a cleaner environment in Los Angeles, and I urge other
corporations to follow suit."


"This is truly remarkable; a single company has installed a solar
system that provides power equivalent to that used by 100 average size
Los Angeles homes. And by doing so, it frees up that energy for use
elsewhere. At a time when every kilowatt counts, this is a major
breakthrough," said Ruth Galanter, chair of the Los Angeles City
Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Neutrogena
headquarters is located in Councilmember Galanter's district.


"Being a good corporate citizen is very important to Neutrogena
and Johnson &amp; Johnson," said Michael McNamara, president of Neutrogena
Corporation, "and this is a very tangible representation of our
commitment to bettering the cities where we work and live. And we're
grateful to the LADWP, who brought this program to our attention and
assisted us every step of the way."


According to Angelina Galiteva, LADWP Director of Strategic
Planning, "The Neutrogena system will eliminate more than 513,000
pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, which is the equivalent of
taking 53 automobiles off Los Angeles streets. We can all breathe a
little easier, thanks to LADWP customers such as Neutrogena."


Through its Solar Power Program, LADWP offers its residential and
commercial customers an Incentive payment or rebate of $3 or $5 per
watt for solar electric systems, in order to make these systems more
affordable. To date, LADWP has received Solar Incentive requests that
total over $2.7 million dollars. The Department goal is to encourage
the installation of 100,000 solar systems in Los Angeles by 2010, and
to install up to 1.5 megawatts of power each year for the next five
years.


In addition to the customer incentive program, the LADWP is
installing solar systems at 35 municipal buildings every year for the
next five years. Most city library branches and many park facilities
will receive the solar installations.
