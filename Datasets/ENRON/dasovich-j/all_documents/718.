Coordinating committee,
Here are my notes from the meeting.  The address list above is the current 
group
so we can continue by e-mail by replying to this group until people are ready
for another call.  I don't think the Dean needs to hear all of the back and
forth.  Lee Friedman has kindly agreed to advise and participate.

Open questions:
-do we want to join with the business school for this event?
-should we push the date back?
-what is your top 5 list of speakers?
-any comments on what we agreed on or revisions to the minutes?

This is really moving!  Thanks everyone.
