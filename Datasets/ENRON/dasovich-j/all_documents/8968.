Jeff,

I had the pleasure of working with you last year in the PG&E and SDG&E
settlements, when I was with United Energy.

Currently, I am with a Company called Stuart Energy Systems Corporation,
which specializes in the production of hydrogen through electrolysis for
zero-emission fuel applications. We are in the process of putting together a
proposal to fuel a number of hydrogen buses for AC Transit, and are looking
for a supplier of electricity who can provide green sourced electricity for
a fixed period of time. The project itself will be very high profile and
likely provide an opportunity to input into municipal and state renewable
policies.

I think that there may some synergies which would certainly warrant
discussion on this matter.

Yours truly,


Brian Dingwall
