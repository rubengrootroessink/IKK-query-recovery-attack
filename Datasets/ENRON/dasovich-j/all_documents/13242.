This is from my friend Jane in Texas - these phrases are pretty funny and I
am sure we can all incorporate them into our everyday conversations!



I am sending this only because I have actually heard several of these in
conversation over the years. Come to think of it, Jack may have used
some of these phrases.


Subject: Whitehouse Language

New language for the press corp and others at the
White House to get used to. The White House is not
just getting a new team, but a whole new language.
George W. Bush will be bringing with him many friends
from Texas, and for anyone not born in the Lone Star
State, the Texan accent and the cowboy colloquialisms
can seem a bit strange.

Here is a guide to a few of the more colorful
expressions they might encounter:

1. The engine's runnin' but ain't nobody driving = Not
overly-intelligent

2. As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party (self-explanatory)

3. Tighter than bark on a tree = Not very generous

4. Big hat, no cattle = All talk and no action

5. We've howdied but we ain't shook yet = We've made a
brief acquaintance, but not been formally introduced

6. He thinks the sun come up just to hear him crow =
He has a pretty high opinion of himself

7. She's got tongue enough for 10 rows of teeth = That
woman can talk

8. It's so dry the trees are bribin' the dogs = We
really could use a little rain around here

9. Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it
can fly = Appearances can be deceptive.

10. This ain't my first rodeo = I've been around
awhile.

11. He looks like the dog's been keepin' him under the
porch = Not the most handsome of men

12. They ate supper before they said grace = Living in sin

13. Time to paint your butt white and run with the
antelope = Stop arguing and do as you're told

14. As full of wind as a corn-eating horse = Rather
prone to boasting

15. You can put your boots in the oven, but that
doesn't make them biscuits = You can say whatever you
want about something, but that doesn't change what it is.

16. Yankees are kinda like hemorrhoids, they're not too
bad when they come down and go back up, but they're a
real pain in the butt when they come down and stay.
