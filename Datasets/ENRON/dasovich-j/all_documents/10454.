Jeff,

I work with Tom Briggs here in Washington, DC.  He forwarded your email 
regarding the Enron's offers to CA utilities (bottom email).  I was hoping 
you could write me a quick explaination of what that chart is talking about.  
Both Tom and I were a bit confused about what was trying to be relayed.

Thanks!

Jim,
here are the articles I found regarding offers made from Enron.  Sorry, I 
placed these in your chair on Friday, and I didn't realize that you were not 
in the office.

Any luck on public information about offers last year?

Jim

Jim:

Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the 
utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to 
the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and 
Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only 
offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get 
more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks 
would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the 
offers that had prices attached when submitted. 

Best,
Jeff
