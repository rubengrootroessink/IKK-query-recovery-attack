Hey Gang,

It looks like we finally have a date to talk with some folks at EBS about 
commercial opportunities. Since scheduling a meeting has been exceedingly 
difficult,,
I've decided to settle for a conference  call. I hope you are available this 
Wednesday, May 3, 2000 at 3pm Houston time to speak with Matt Harris and some 
broadband folks.  If you can't make it don't sweat it but if you can that 
would be great!  The call should take no more than 1 1/2hrs.  Dial in 
instructions are as follows: 

1-800-998-2462  PIN Code 4139211
