The poll results, obtained by interviewing a cross-section of 1,015 adults=

"We are virtually in the same kind of fiscal environment that we were in a=

In recent years, the state has regularly borrowed money through one-year=20

What's the hang-up?
Clotheslines save energy and money, but they are considered unsightly by so=

and are banned in many areas
By Mary Lynne Vellinga
Bee Staff Writer=20
(Published May 21, 2001)

Rising electricity rates have prompted Stacey Swett to seriously consider=
=20
taking a step she finds somewhat distasteful: hanging a clothesline in her=
=20
back yard.=20
"I don't really like the looks of them, but you have to get past that; we=
=20
have a huge issue here with our SMUD bill," Swett said.=20
The California Energy Commission touts clotheslines as a nearly cost-free w=

to conserve electricity. Statewide, clothes dryers burn about 1,000 megawat=
ts=20
of electricity on a hot summer day, which could be enough to avert a blacko=
ut=20
on days when state power supplies are tight. An electric dryer costs about=
=20
$130 a year to run. A retractable clothesline will set you back about $14.9=
9.=20
People appear to be getting the message. Hardware stores report a sharp ris=
e=20
in clothesline sales since the energy crisis hit. People are "going back to=
=20
the old way of doing things," said Dave Haskin, owner of Broadway Hardware =
in=20
Sacramento.=20
But the old way of doing things doesn't sit so well in some newer=20
neighborhoods. Where Swett lives, in midtown, she can decide for herself=20
whether to take the plunge and pin up the bloomers. But in many newer=20
neighborhoods -- those governed by homeowners associations -- the practice =
is=20
not allowed.=20
Swett works for the management company that runs the homeowners association=
=20
for the gated, Pocket-area subdivision of Riverlake. In Riverlake, it is=20
against the rules to hang your laundry where your neighbors can glimpse it.=
=20
The same is true in Gold River, Rancho Murieta, Laguna West and Los Lagos,=
=20
the mansion-studded Granite Bay enclave where Sacramento Kings stars Chris=
=20
Webber and Jason Williams live.=20
"People think (clotheslines) are unsightly," said Dan Kocal, owner of the=
=20
Folsom-based Kocal Management Group. His company manages the homeowners=20
associations for 70 communities in the Sacramento region. Not one of them=
=20
allows clotheslines unless they are shielded from neighbors' views below th=
e=20
fence line or behind a special enclosure.=20
When people buy into planned communities such as Gold River, Los Lagos or S=
un=20
City, they agree to certain rules designed to keep the neighborhood looking=
=20
neat and uniform, Kocal said.=20
"You agree that you're only going to park in the garage, that you're not=20
going to hang out clothes and that you're not going to paint your house=20
purple," Kocal said.=20
Clotheslines that can be seen from neighboring yards are banned by virtuall=

homeowners associations, said Richard Monson, president of the Pasadena-bas=
ed=20
California Association of Homeowners Associations.=20
"We choose to live in neighborhoods that don't hang these things out," Mons=

said.=20
A few weeks ago, Monson was quoted as saying that the sight of hanging=20
laundry is "akin to graffiti in your neighborhood." Cartoonist Garry Trudea=
u=20
since has devoted an entire week of his Doonesbury strip to lampooning=20
neighborhoods that don't allow clothes to be hung out to dry.=20
Now, Monson chooses his words more carefully. "When we talk about areas of=
=20
communities that are less desirable, we often associate those with=20
undesirable items that are in proximity to the buildings," he said. He stan=

Brian Rosebrock, a supervisor at the new Home Depot in Elk Grove, doesn't=
=20
understand the stigma. When he was growing up in a rural area outside New=
=20
York City, his mother always dried the family's clothes on the line.=20
Rosebrock, 40, still likes the smell of sun-dried clothes. He hangs his=20
jeans, socks, sheets and other cotton items in the back yard of his Rosemon=
t=20
house.=20
"It's just laundry. Everybody is a little uptight here," he said of=20
Californians.=20
He may have a point. Bruce Hackett, professor emeritus of sociology at the=
=20
University of California, Davis, said Californians harbor more negative=20
attitudes toward clotheslines than do people in the Midwest, where line=20
drying is more of a tradition.=20
About 10 years ago, Hackett did a survey of 45 UC Davis students and 35=20
single-family households in Green Bay, Wis. At the time, some students livi=
ng=20
in married housing on the UC Davis campus were upset that they had to walk =
to=20
an isolated, screened area next to the trash bins to hang their laundry.=20
"The housing office said clotheslines make the place look like a tenement,"=
=20
Hackett said.=20
The attitude in Wisconsin was markedly different.=20
"On wash day, there were just clotheslines everywhere, which is something y=
ou=20
don't find here," Hackett said. "One woman told me that when you move into =
a=20
new home it's not really your home until your clothesline is up and your=20
clothes are on it."=20
In the wake of student complaints, the university eventually changed the=20
policy to allow the use of retractable clothes lines in the housing area,=
=20
Hackett said.=20
Leaders of several Sacramento-area homeowners associations said they couldn=
't=20
think of any instance in which a homeowner has asked permission to hang a=
=20
clothesline or has gotten in trouble for using one.=20
"I don't know of anyone who has a clothesline," said David Brickell,=20
president of the Los Lagos Estates Homeowners Association. He said the Los=

To save energy, the subdivision has started turning off its entrance founta=

Monson, head of the statewide association, argued that there are many ways =

said.=20
"The issue is not clotheslines, the issue is conservation, and hom=0F'eowne=

Dan Walters: One year later, we know it wasn't just a simple game of golf


(Published May 20, 2001)

California will mark -- but certainly not celebrate -- an anniversary this=
=20
week. It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over S=
an=20
Diego, and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power, San=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co. began charging its customers high, market-oriented=
=20
rates for juice.=20
It was the beginning of the California energy crisis, or at least of public=
=20
and political awareness that something was wrong. And a year later, every=
=20
aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse. We are paying 10 times as muc=
h=20
for power as we were two years ago. We have amassed more than $20 billion i=
n=20
private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consume=
r=20
power rates. And we face potentially life-threatening summer blackouts.=20
Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year. They g=
o=20
back to decisions in the 1970s to stop major power plant construction and=
=20
rely on conservation and alternative generating sources. And they include a=
=20
momentous decision in the mid-1990s to adopt a "deregulation" plan that was=
=20
an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the=
=20
mercy of out-of-state generators. Of more currency is what was and wasn't=
=20
done in the last 12 months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled, and perha=
ps=20
uncontrollable, firestorm.=20
Gov. Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays=
=20
golf, "one hole at a time." Unfortunately for Davis, and for the state, it=
=20
was not a golf game, but one of three-dimensional, and perhaps=20
four-dimensional, chess. To manage the crisis effectively, the Democratic=
=20
governor needed the ability, either personally or through trusted aides, to=
=20
pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole.=20
The golfing approach was evident from the beginning, as Davis dealt with on=
ly=20
the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved, rather than=20
embracing it wholly and actively. Private and public energy experts warned=
=20
that what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and=
=20
proposed that the 1996 "deregulation" be suspended, that rates be raised=20
slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into=
=20
long-term supply contracts to stabilize the market. But Davis and his=20
handpicked state Public Utilities Commission president, Loretta Lynch,=20
stalled for time.=20
Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced, the PUC voted 3-2 to=20
authorize long-term supply contracts at about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour --=20
slightly higher than wholesale prices had been, but ridiculously cheap by=
=20
contemporary standards. Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price=20
escalation and quickly locked up long-term supplies, but Lynch denounced th=
e=20
commission action as "a wrong turn" that could lead to higher consumer bill=
s,=20
and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by Davis.=20
Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively, Davis, Lynch an=
d=20
the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego, rolling back retai=
l=20
rates without addressing either supply or cost issues. Within weeks, privat=
e=20
utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesal=
e=20
costs skyrocketed.=20
Last summer's failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment. It=
's=20
clear now, for example, that it was a mistake for the state to continue=20
buying power at sky-high rates when the utilities had exhausted their credi=
t.=20
Having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the=
=20
market would bear.=20
A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud, but didn't, Davis =
is=20
busily rewriting history and blaming others, principally Republicans, for t=
he=20
dilemma. But the governor cannot, or should not, escape the responsibility=
=20
for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf, or like so=
me=20
routine political dispute, and thus failing to apply the aggressive and=20
sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset.=20

Panel pulls the plug on county utility plan=20



Backers blame SDG&E for bill's demise in Assembly committee
By Bill Ainsworth=20

May 22, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- An Assembly committee yesterday thwarted a bipartisan effort =
to=20
ease the way for San Diego County to form a municipal utility district that=
=20
backers say would bring residents cheaper and more reliable power.=20
Proponents of the plan said San Diego Gas & Electric and its parent company=
,=20
Sempra, engineered a political power play that ensured defeat of the=20
proposal. The utility was the main opponent.=20
"Their lobbyists just got on this thing and killed it," said Bill Horn,=20
chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, who attended=20
yesterday's hearing before the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee.=
=20
"They did a tremendous disservice to residents of San Diego County."=20

But a lobbyist for Sempra told the committee that forming a municipal utili=
ty=20
wouldn't solve the energy crisis because it would do nothing to increase th=
e=20
supply of electricity.=20
"We're not in the middle of a utility crisis," said lobbyist Cindy Howell.=
=20
"It's a generation crisis."=20
The bill, which would have applied only to San Diego County, had strong=20
bipartisan support from local officials, including state Sens. Steve Peace,=
=20
D-El Cajon, and Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who took the unusual step of=20
personally testifying before an Assembly committee.=20

But the proposal earned just three of the 10 votes needed to clear the=20
committee. All of the votes came from Republicans.=20
The bill's author, Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido, blasted the=20
stockholder-owned utility company for opposing the bill.=20
"They simply don't want a threat to their ability to make as much money as=
=20
they can on the backs of San Diego ratepayers," he said.=20
Proponents say forming a public utility would allow residents to tap cheape=
r=20
sources of power, especially future hydroelectric power planned by the San=
=20
Diego County Water Authority.=20
They argue that controlling some power plants could reduce the county's=20
dependence on expensive electricity now purchased by SDG&E on the wholesale=
=20
market. That, in turn, could lead to lower utility bills.=20
During the current energy crisis, communities with publicly owned power,=20
including Los Angeles and Sacramento, have paid much lower energy bills tha=
n=20
communities served by investor-owned utilities.=20
But current state law makes it difficult to create a local municipal utilit=
y=20
because it requires a majority of voters to endorse the plan in an election=
=20
in which at least two-thirds of registered voters turn out.=20
As a practical matter, that means approval likely would occur only during a=
=20
presidential election when voter interest is high.=20
Peace said the current law was written for a reason: to protect privately=
=20
owned utilities.=20
"The law was written on purpose by this Legislature to make it almost=20
impossible to form a municipal utility district," he said.=20
Wyland's legislation, Assembly Bill 206, would have changed the law to allo=
w=20
majority-vote approval in the new district, without regard to how many vote=
rs=20
turn out.=20
A proposal to create a municipal utility would have to go through months of=
=20
local hearings before it could be placed on the ballot. Wyland said he didn=
't=20
expect the new agency to replace SDG&E but merely to give residents more=20
options over the long term.=20
Initially, Sempra opposed the bill because it would have given the new publ=
ic=20
agency the power of eminent domain to take over transmission lines and othe=
r=20
facilities owned by SDG&E.=20
At the hearing yesterday, Wyland offered to strip eminent domain power from=
=20
the new agency.=20
But Howell, the Sempra representative, still opposed the plan and argued th=
at=20
there is no reason to change the voting requirement in the current law.=20
Forming a utility district, she said, is a significant step that should=20
require high voter turnout.=20
The bill also drew opposition from unionized employees of Sempra.=20
Committee chairman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, voted against the bill, sayin=
g=20
it was vague and that San Diego legislators should get a better idea of wha=
t=20
they want to do.=20
He left open the possibility that he would support a proposal to allow the=
=20
county to buy power but not to form its own utility.=20
Wright, widely considered an ally of the privately owned utilities, receive=
d=20
$16,500 last year in contributions from Sempra, according to the Secretary =
of=20
State's Web site.=20
Other members of the committee objected to the proposed structure of the ne=
w=20
utility, which would be governed by a nine-member board of two supervisors,=
=20
two San Diego City Council members, three council members from county citie=
s=20
and two public members.=20
The proposal seemed to turn the political parties' positions on public powe=
r=20
upside down.=20
The measure failed to win any votes from Democrats, who enthusiastically=20
endorsed a new state power authority that allows California to finance, buy=

75% say power woes 'very serious'=20

May 22, 2001=20
The overwhelming majority of Californians now regard the state's electricit=
y=20
crisis as a serious problem, but say they have not yet been greatly=20
inconvenienced by it, a new Field Poll has found.=20
The nonpartisan statewide survey found that while people believe the=20
electricity problem is real, they believe it stems more from an attempt by=
=20
energy companies to drive rates up than from an actual shortage.=20
They are also far more worried about soaring electricity bills than the=20
threat of blackouts.=20
And Californians offered contradictory views as to whether electricity=20
conservation can head off blackouts this summer. They believe all electrici=
ty=20
consumers -- residents, businesses and government -- can reduce their usage=
=20
enough to avert blackouts. But they also say they already have cut back the=
ir=20
own usage about as much as they can.=20
In January, the Field Poll surveyed public attitudes about the growing=20
electricity crisis. At the time, 58 percent characterized the situation as=
=20
"very serious." Now, the percentage of the population that considers the=20
situation "very serious" has grown to 75 percent.=20
Californians also hold a rather cynical view of the crisis. Thirty-six=20
percent say they believe it is the consequence of an electricity shortage,=
=20
but 59 percent say it was caused by energy companies seeking to increase=20
profits.=20
The Field Poll is based on telephone interviews with 1,015 California adult=
s=20
conducted between May 11 and Sunday. According to statistical theory, the=
=20
poll would be accurate 95 percent of the time within a margin of error of 3=
.2=20
percentage points.=20
So far, the ill effects of the electricity crisis are ones Californians see=
m=20
to be willing to live with. But they worry that will not be the case much=
=20
longer.=20
Eleven percent said they had been inconvenienced "a great deal" by blackout=
s.=20
But looking toward the summer, 34 percent said they expected blackouts to b=
e=20
a major inconvenience.=20
Likewise, 19 percent said the electricity rate increases averaging 10 perce=
nt=20
that have taken effect have been a very serious problem for them. If rates=
=20
were to go up another 10 percent, 36 percent would regard that as a serious=
=20
problem.=20
Opinion is divided over the merits of recent rate increases approved by the=
=20
state Public Utilities Commission. Forty-one percent called them justified=
=20
and 52 percent called them unjustified.=20
"It's not overwhelmingly panned, which I suppose is about as well as could =
be=20
expected on an issue like this," said Mark DiCamillo, associate director of=
=20
the Field Poll. "It's almost like a tax increase. The public doesn't want i=
t;=20
it's just whether they think it's justified or not."=20
Looking ahead, 28 percent say blackouts are the greatest threat posed by th=
e=20
electricity crisis. But more than twice as many, 67 percent, say they are=
=20
more concerned about escalating electricity bills.=20
By a significant ratio, 61 percent to 34 percent, Californians believe=20
additional conservation measures by all electricity users can eliminate the=
=20
need for summer blackouts.=20
But when it comes to their own electricity consumption, they say they alrea=
dy=20
have cut back significantly and can't do much more.=20
Californians say they have reduced their household electricity usage by an=
=20
average of 8 percent. They said they could cut back by another 4 percent in=
=20
their homes without causing serious problems.=20
"If the state is looking and the governor is looking for redoubled efforts,=

it's going to be painful because the public thinks we can do a little bit=

'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a=20

Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank=

the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour=20
forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected.
?????It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses,=20
government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probab=
le=20
blackout in their area.
?????Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air,=
=20
but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more tha=
n=20
10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via=20
wireless communications such as pagers.
?????Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses,=20
particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were=
=20
costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political=20
pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that =
is=20
expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies o=
f=20
electricity.
?????If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's,=20
Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making=
=20
increased notification crucial.
?????With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-strick=
en=20
Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the=20
agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700=
=20
megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility=20
industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted tha=
t=20
California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer.
?????"The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know=
=20
they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them,=
=20
they will check in," said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who=20
serves on the Cal-ISO board.
?????Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board=
=20
meets Thursday. But a Web page called "Today's Outlook" on the agency's=20
Internet site, www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour,=
=20
how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there=
=20
is a predicted surplus or shortfall.
?????Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electrici=
ty=20
conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections=
=20
and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergenc=
y=20
that is expected.
?????A "power watch" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages,=
=20
and a more serious "power warning" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3,=
=20
which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power=20
reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.)
?????Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of=20
probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric,=
=20
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In=
=20
addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media,=
=20
Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on=
=20
"blast lists," or massive computer databases that it will assemble.
?????"The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we shoul=
d=20
be deploying high-tech solutions," said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley=
=20
Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest=

for better notification. "Every time California goes black, the economy see=

?????Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving ju=
st=20
two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react.
?????"A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is=

?????Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the mos=

?????"It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual=

?????In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California'=

Carl A. Wood said in announcing the procedure for applying for blackout=20
exemptions.
?????The PUC already exempts a fairly lengthy list of those whose services=

stations and acute-care hospitals.
?????Energy experts are predicting blackouts this year ranging from a total=

of 20 hours at the most optimistic to 200 hours or more, based on such=20
factors as historic patterns of electricity usage, forecasts for hot weathe=
r=20
and expectations of diminished hydroelectric imports from out of state.
?????Any new business exemptions, which would start no sooner than August,=
=20
would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety.=20
?????That means a business would not be granted an exemption from outages=

just because it fears revenue loss, Wood said at a Los Angeles news=20

Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency=20
Power: Lawmakers try a new idea: a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose dang=
er=20
to people, law enforcement and even water supply=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy=20
regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursin=
g=20
homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fig=
ht=20
crime, and the state's drinking water supplies.
?????Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes =
a=20
new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California'=
s=20
energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer.
?????A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to set "just and reasonable" wholesale power rates as a way of=
=20
ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by=20
veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem=
=20
John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman=20
Oaks), and the city of Oakland.=20
?????"A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in=20
California," the draft says. "The public health, safety and welfare of the=
=20
state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences =
of=20
rolling blackouts and punitive prices."

?????Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats
?????Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have=
=20
been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a=
=20
way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion=20
buying electricity since January.
?????In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will=
=20
stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people "are=
=20
left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and=20
electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."
?????"Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men,=
=20
women and children with disabilities," the suit says. "They represent an=20
imminent threat to life, health and independence."
?????Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of=
=20
Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said=
=20
the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC.
?????Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law Scho=
ol=20
in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck=
=20
Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers=
=20
had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he=
=20
became convinced the suit had merit.
?????"Let's face it," said Kelso, a Republican, "this is the single most=20
important issue that the state faces for the next six months."

?????Watching the Water Supply
?????The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the=20
implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health=20
Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The=
=20
warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give t=
o=20
consumers.
?????"If the water looks cloudy or dirty," the warning says, "you should no=
t=20
drink it." The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water=20
quality, they can boil it or add "eight drops of household bleach to one=20
gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."
?????Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that "i=
f=20
an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hou=
r=20
blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking wat=
er=20
because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially=

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The operator of California's electricity grid is=
=20
offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint, planning to give t=
he=20
public a half-hour's warning before shutting off the lights.=20
Beginning May 30, the Independent System Operator also plans to issue=20
warnings similar to weather advisories 24 hours before expected blackouts.=
=20
Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning,=
=20
saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a=
=20
last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have=
=20
also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars=
=20
and other criminals.=20
"Definitely, it's a good idea," said Shirley Starr, a racetrack employee in=
=20
the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead. "If I know it's going to happen, I won'=
t=20
defrost the refrigerator or something."=20
Like some business customers and consumer groups, she wondered if 30 minute=
s=20
warning would be enough.=20
"A lot of people, if they are at work, a half hour isn't going to do any=20
good," Starr said.=20
"I think it should be more than 30 minutes," said George Aguilar, an animal=
=20
control officer in El Monte. "It should be at least eight hours."=20
Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular=20
feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort=
=20
at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to=20
power air conditioners on hot days.=20
The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence=
=20
that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the=
=20
public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to anoth=
er=20
neighborhood.=20
Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the=
=20
state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left=
=20
without stoplights, trapped people in elevators, and caused business losses=
=20
by bringing production lines to a halt. People with home medical equipment=
=20
like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning.=20
The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: I=
t=20
will issue a "power watch" or "power warning" that will give notice the gri=
d=20
could be headed toward blackouts.=20
The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any=20
blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods=
=20
will be hit.=20
"It's better than no notice," said John Handley of California Independent=
=20
Grocers.=20
He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and=
=20
even move items to cold storage if necessary.=20
"Once the power goes out, we can't ring anyone up," Handley said.=20
Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted witho=

risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce, said Brad Ward, president a=

For example, a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piec=

time and the piece would be ruined.=20
"This is really, really good news," Ward said.=20

In adopting the biggest rate increase in California history, the Public=20

at an accelerated pace."=20
Because electricity rates have been linked to baseline usage, this once-=20
esoteric calculation has taken center stage in California's energy mess.=20
BASELINE USAGE
The baseline usage figure -- included on PG&E bills -- was devised nearly 2=
0=20
years ago to define the amount of fuel "necessary to supply a significant=
=20
portion of the reasonable energy needs of the average residential customer,=
"=20
according to the Public Utilities Code.=20
It includes several variables, such as climate, time of year and type of=20
fuel.=20
However, the last time regulators tabulated baseline numbers was in 1994,=
=20
meaning that the figures on most people's bills no longer reflect actual=20
power consumption.=20
"This was pre-computers, pre-Internet and pre- a lot of other things that a=
re=20
now in the house," said Richard Bilas, a Republican PUC member who opposed=
=20
last week's rate hike.=20
The average baseline for most households is about 250 kilowatt hours per=20
month, according to the 1994 numbers. To be exempt from rate hikes, a=20
household thus would need to use no more than 325 kilowatt hours.=20
However, regulators and utilities now say that actual power usage for the=
=20
typical home is at least 500 kilowatt hours per month -- well above most=20
people's baseline amounts.=20
"It's not possible to stay within 130 percent of that," Bilas said. "I know=
 I=20
can't do it."=20
NEW BASELINE CRITERION
With regulators set to begin re-examining baseline numbers Thursday, the=20
Senate Energy Committee is seeking ways to make the tabulation more equitab=
le=20
by adding a new criterion to the figure: household size.=20
Now, a family of five with computers, electronic games and almost round-the=
-=20
clock power consumption would have the same baseline as the bachelor living=
=20
next door who is rarely home.=20
That disparity would be addressed by a bill to be submitted today by Sen.=
=20
Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who wants household size to be a factor in=
=20
determining baseline, with the baseline limit rising in proportion to the=
=20
number of people in the residence.=20
"Baseline is a totally unfair measure of the number of people in a=20
household," she said. "Families are severely impacted."=20
Robert Herrell, Speier's staff director, said state authorities would rely =
on=20
"self-certification" for each household to accurately report its number of=
=20
occupants -- essentially, the honor system.=20
"The last thing you want to do is create baseline police," he said.=20
"Hopefully, people wouldn't game the system."=20
But Akbar Jazayeri, director of revenue and tariffs for Southern California=
=20
Edison, said that even if regulators succeed in adjusting baseline figures =
to=20
better reflect household size and usage levels, this only would increase th=
e=20
number of ratepayers who can stay within 130 percent of revised limits.=20
"That means more people would be exempt from rate increases," Jazayeri=20
observed. "There would be less revenue from ratepayers, so you would have t=
o=20
get other people to make up for it."=20
In other words, another rate increase.=20

The overwhelming majority of Californians say the state's power crisis is=

manipulating shortages, results of a new Field Poll show.=20
"In the public's view . . . this is a manufactured crisis -- not a real=20

yesterday. "That cynicism permeates a lot of things. . . . The public is no=

California adults was conducted May 11 to Sunday.=20
CONSUMPTION, CONSERVATION
In what may be the first such tally of statewide conservation efforts,=20
California residents said they reduced their power consumption by an averag=
e=20
of 8 percent -- an effort motivated by the energy crisis.=20
The new poll results also dramatized that Californians are "very attentive"=
=20

themselves for the effects of increased rates and power outages.=20
But so far, it is not the politicians who are the object of their wrath -- =

is big energy, DiCamillo said.=20
"They're the bad guys," he said. "But (in the public's view) no one has bee=
n=20
able to stop them. No one is winning this."=20
The findings of the latest Field poll:=20
-- Three quarters of the Californians polled deemed the energy crisis "very=

WHAT LIES AHEAD
DiCamillo said the poll results confirm how deeply Californians fear what m=

Sacramento -- Californians will receive 30 minutes' warning that blackouts=
=20
may be imposed -- enough time, it is hoped, to get out of the elevator or=
=20
through a dangerous intersection, the state's power grid managers said=20
yesterday.=20
The California Independent System Operator also will provide a daily power=
=20
forecast 24 hours in advance so residents and businesses can plan for=20
blackouts the same way people prepare for severe storms.=20
"We want a system that is proactive," said Carl Guardino, an ISO board memb=
er=20
and president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. "When the last few=
=20
rolling blackouts hit there was as little as two minutes' warning. Two=20
minutes may be fine in a football game, but it's not fine for California's=
=20
economy or safety."=20
ISO officials also said they are examining high-tech ways of quickly=20
spreading the word about impending blackouts to homeowners and businesses=
=20
through mass e-mails, faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages.=20
The plan, detailed in a report issued yesterday, still falls far short of=
=20
other proposals being pushed in the Legislature. Lawmakers have suggested=
=20
scheduling blackout days months in advance and having California join with=
=20
other Western states to form a "buyer's cartel" that would refuse to pay fo=
r=20
power when prices become too high.=20
"It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainly=
=20
better than two," said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray. "No matter how y=
ou=20
slice it, this summer is going to be miserable. The question is whether we=
=20
want to have planned misery or unplanned misery."=20
A spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association,=20
which commissioned a recent report that found unplanned blackouts could cos=
t=20
the state economy $21.8 billion, said the ISO policy changes will be a=20
tremendous help to many businesses.=20
"In this electrically unreliable world, any notification manufacturers can=
=20
get is good," said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the association. "While 30=
=20
minutes won't be enough for some, for most manufacturers it will be=20
sufficient. " The ISO will wait for guidance from the governor and lawmaker=
s=20
regarding more complicated issues such as the creation of scheduled=20
blackouts, said Michael Florio, an ISO board member and official at The=20
Utility Reform Network.=20
"There are bigger public policy ramifications," Florio said.=20
The ideas will be discussed in greater detail at an ISO board meeting=20
Thursday. Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the changes are just=
=20
updates of policies already in place.=20
WARNING OF 'PROBABLE' BLACKOUTS
The 30-minute advance-notification system, scheduled to go into effect earl=
y=20
next month, would warn of "probable" blackouts, including the amount of loa=
d=20
that will have to be curtailed in each service area.=20
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning,=
=20
saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a=
=20
last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities also=
=20
have resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars=
=20
and other criminals.=20
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most=
=20
current information about how much electricity is being used and how much i=
s=20
available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that=
=20
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail.=20
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan=
=20
their operations, said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley.=20
Also planned by the ISO is a "Power Watch/Power Warning" system that would=
=20
provide a 24-hour notice of high-demand days.=20
Under the two-tiered system, a "Power Watch" would be declared whenever a=

ng=20
blackouts this summer, lawmakers are hard at work trying to find ways to ma=
ke=20
the outages easier for power customers to cope with.=20
The idea of a buyer's cartel, the subject of a Capitol hearing today, would=
=20
have California -- in partnership with other states -- set a firm ceiling o=
n=20
what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not one=
=20
dime more.=20
The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the=20
cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, could potentially curtail the=20
exorbitantly high prices the state has been paying for electricity.=20
The trade-off would be the likelihood of more frequent blackouts than if th=
e=20
state continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.=20
The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such=20
things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers=
=20
would be built in, supporters said.=20
DESIGNATING BLACKOUT DAYS
Meanwhile, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, will introduce a bill today=
=20
that would require the state's utilities and Public Utilities Commission to=
=20
designate days for potential blackouts to each block.=20
For example, a customer located in Block 3 of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. =
's=20
service area could be told in advance that power will be turned off June 5 =
if=20
blackouts are needed that day.=20
"Right now, every day is a potential blackout day," Briggs said. "This way=
=20
people would know when their potential days are."=20
On alert=20
-- When demand is high, the ISO will forecast peak demand, power supply and=
=20
weather 24 hours in advance.=20
-- A "power watch" will be issued when it is likely the grid will reach Sta=
ge=20
1 (system is within 7% of running out of power) or Stage 2 (system is withi=
n=20
5% of running out of power).=20
-- A "power warning" will be issued when there is at least a 50% chance of =
a=20
Stage 3 alert (demand is within 1.5% of supply).=20
Who calls a blackout?=20
Engineers in Folsom at the Independent System Operator keep watch on the=20
state's power consumption. When they determine that energy reserves have=20
dipped below 1.5 percent of available capacity, the ISO can order utilities=
=20
to start cutting juice. Officials said this week they would give 30 minutes=
'=20
notice before blackouts begin. The ISO tells the utilities exactly how much=
=20
power to cut.=20
Q: Who decides who gets blacked out and for how long?=20
A: That's up to the utilities. PG&E has divided its 4.5 million customers=
=20
into 14 blocks; each block is darkened for one to two hours at a time. The=
=20
blocks are defined by PG&E's network of circuits rather than by geography.=
=20
Thus, neighborhoods in San Francisco, Oakland and Pleasant Hill can be=20
blacked out simultaneously.=20
Q: How many users are blacked out at once?=20
A: Each of PG&E's 14=20
blocks represents about 550 megawatts of electricity. (A megawatt is enough=
=20
electricity to power 1,000 homes.) If PG&E is told to cut more than 550=20
megawatts, it can shut down two or more blocks at a time. PG&E also can bla=
ck=20
out smaller portions within each block if the ISO's requirements are for le=
ss=20
than 550 megawatts.=20
Q: How is power shut off?=20
A: This is a straightforward matter of shutting off circuits in a power=20
substation by computer or sending a crew to flip the switches by hand.=20
Q: How many days of blackouts have we had this year and how many customers=
=20
have been affected?=20
A: A total of 3,035,000 customers have been blacked out in the six days of=
=20
rolling blackouts since Jan. 1, 2001.=20
Q: Which block of customers will be blacked out next?=20
A: Some or all customers in Block 1.=20
Q: How do I know what block I'm in?=20
A: Look for the words "Rotating Outage Block" followed by a number on your=
=20
bill. If it says Block 50, you share an electrical circuit with a hospital,=
=20
police station or other "essential service" that is normally exempt from=20
service cuts.=20
Q: What should I do when the lights go out?=20
A: Power experts advise:=20
-- Turn off all lights and appliances to prevent damage-causing power surge=
s=20
when service is restored. Leave one light on to indicate when the electrici=
ty=20
is back.=20
-- Use caution when driving because traffic signals may be out. Treat all=

case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau.=20
-- When the power returns, turn on one appliance at a time to prevent power=

But a market-based question has also entered the conservation debate. Would=
=20
we save power if it were priced in a different way?=20
Most consumers don't realize that the wholesale price of power changes at=
=20
various times of day. Prices spike when demand is high, say on summer=20
afternoons, and fall at night when most offices have closed.=20
But most of us pay a constant price per hour, whether we use expensive hour=
s=20
or cheap ones. So we have no incentive to conserve power during hours of hi=
gh=20
demand.=20
Market-based pricing is intended to get you to think twice before using pow=
er=20
during those expensive peaks. There are three main approaches to this today=
:=20
CHANGING THE FIXED PRICE. Many utilities today charge more in the hot summe=
r=20
months than in the winter months. Georgia Power goes further -- raising you=
r=20
summer price as you use energy more. In the winter, your rate for extra=20
kilowatt-hours declines.=20
VOLUNTARY TIME-OF-USE PROGRAMS. You pay the most for power during weekday=
=20
hours and the least on weekends and overnight. Oregon will introduce a=20
statewide time-of-use program in October. Niagara Mohawk in Syracuse, N.Y.,=
=20
has 4,000 consumers on time-of-use.=20
Ahmad Faruqui of the industry's Electric Power Research Institute estimates=
=20
that a well-designed time-of-use program could cut residential peak demand =
by=20
about 2.5 percent. In California, that could reduce energy costs by 12=20
percent over the summer.=20
So far, however, these programs haven't persuaded many people to run their=
=20
washing machines at night. Saving $20 or $30 isn't worth the hassle, says=
=20
Mike O'Sheasy, Georgia Power's manager of product design.=20
REAL-TIME PRICING. Here, the utility varies your price per kilowatt-hour=20
during the day, as its own prices change. Using a "smart meter" and "smart=
=20
thermostat," you could program your water heater or air conditioner to turn=
=20
off automatically during times when power costs the most. Many businesses=
=20
already pay on real-time.=20
How consumers like real-time pricing remains to be seen. Georgia Power trie=
d=20
it 12 years ago and dropped it.=20
But Gulf Power in Pensacola, Fla., rolled out newer technology last year an=
d=20
thinks it has a hit. About 1,500 customers are already online with 400 more=
=20
on the waiting list, even though the smart meters cost them $4.53 a month.=
=20
"People like the control over their power bill," says Gulf's Margaret Neyma=
n,=20
general manager of marketing. She says customers are saving 15 percent,=20
which more than covers their participation cost.=20
Puget Sound Energy in Bellevue, Wash., has enrolled more than 420,000=20
customers in a smart-meter program. They've been getting reports, showing=
=20
when they use power the most and what it costs to deliver.=20
This month, the utility started tying its smart meters to time-of-use=20
pricing. Customers pay less during night-time hours, all day Sundays and=20
holidays.=20
Consumer and environmental groups generally haven't supported market-based=
=20
pricing for homes. They blame high prices, in part, on market manipulation=
=20
and don't want the power sellers to profit from it.=20
They have a case. But blackouts and brownouts amount to a sales pitch for=

Blackout alerts, forecasts proposed=20

Mercury News=20


Under pressure to give more notice before pulling the plug, California's=20
power grid managers Monday proposed issuing alerts a half-hour before=20
blackouts and forecasting the likelihood of outages a day in advance.=20
The Independent System Operator's proposal heartened business leaders who s=

unexpected rolling blackouts have cost them millions of dollars.=20
But the proposal disappointed consumer advocates and some lawmakers who hop=
ed=20
grid officials would consider their suggestion to schedule rolling blackout=
s=20
days or weeks in advance.=20
Grid officials compared their proposal to the weather forecasts that alert=
=20
Midwesterners to tornadoes, and cautioned that the predictions are subject =
to=20
change.=20
``It's akin to a severe storm watch and a severe storm warning,'' said Greg=
g=20
Fishman, spokesman for the ISO, which will consider the proposal Thursday.=
=20
``We try to give as much hard information as soon as we can. But there are=
=20
days where those things are going to change very quickly.''=20
Business leaders said a half-hour warning, even if it's a false alarm, woul=
d=20
be better than the two to six minutes they got during the last round of=20
rolling blackouts in April.=20
``We're happy with what the ISO is trying to do,'' said Gino DiCaro,=20
spokesman for the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ``It=
's=20
making a bad situation a little better.''=20
But critics said the proposal changes little and, with frequent blackouts=
=20
expected this summer, urged the state to instead schedule them in advance.=
=20
``It's actually quite distressing and disappointing,'' said Michael Shames,=
=20
executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, which proposed=
=20
scheduling blackouts. ``If the public is looking for better information on=
=20
blackouts, they'll have to look elsewhere.''=20
State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, whose energy committee is=20
considering notification issues today, agreed.=20
``It's not the report I was expecting, but 30 minutes of notice is certainl=
y=20
better than two,'' Bowen said.=20
The idea of scheduling blackouts is gaining ground among state lawmakers, w=
ho=20
say it would let people know when to expect outages and also force down=20
runaway power prices by dampening demand.=20
The grid operator didn't propose scheduled blackouts because lawmakers=20
haven't yet agreed on the concept.=20
``It's in the talking stage,'' Fishman said. ``There's nothing firm.''=20
Rolling blackouts, in which utilities cut power from one block of customers=

To date, two-thirds of consumers say they're more concerned about power=20
prices than rolling blackouts, according to a Field Poll released today. Bu=

``People in general are much more willing to tolerate blackouts if they kno=

they're going to happen,'' said Guy Phillips, energy aide to Assembly Speak=

Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz.=20
The nature of the electric system makes advance notice of blackouts=20
difficult, grid officials said. California is so short of power that weathe=
r=20
changes and power plant shutdowns can dramatically affect the outlook.=20
On Monday, the state avoided blackouts amid soaring temperatures because of=
=20
power imported from other states and cooler weather in Southern California,=
=20
said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. That could change as Southern Californ=
ia=20
heats up today and Wednesday, but blackouts aren't expected, barring a sudd=
en=20
plant failure or drop in imports, she said.=20
National Weather Service forecasters expect a high of 90 degrees in San Jos=
e=20
today, with a low in the upper 50s tonight.=20
Under Monday's ISO proposal, grid managers would commit to issuing a=20
30-minute notice of ``probable interruptions,'' identifying the affected=20
utilities and how much power they must cut. It still would be up to the=20
utilities to determine which areas would be affected.=20
The ISO also would issue 24-hour grid advisories. If the ISO expects a Stag=
e=20
1 or 2 emergency the next day, grid managers will issue a ``Power Watch.'' =
If=20
there is a 50 percent or greater chance of a Stage 3 emergency the next day=
,=20
the ISO will declare a ``Power Warning.''=20
In addition, the ISO would bolster the ``system conditions'' report on its=

and forecast demand. Customers also would be able to sign up for hourly=20
e-mail updates.=20
ISO officials also are looking into contracts with notification services=20
offering to alert customers to grid conditions by request through phones,=

``We spent the last four months designing this with businesses for=20

`Chance to do something'=20
``Every time the lights go out, companies see red,'' Guardino said. ``Half =
an=20

officers to intersections. You can power down assembly lines.''=20
Others say that's not enough.=20
``I want 30 days' warning,'' said Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, who=20
plans to introduce a bill today that would schedule each utility outage blo=
ck=20
for a day when blackouts are possible.=20
That would help farmers, who must have power on specific days for water=20
delivery and crop processing, Briggs said.=20
State Sen. Dede Alpert, D-San Diego, has a bill scheduled for discussion=20
today calling for the state to set a ceiling on what it will pay for power=

and to schedule outages the next day if there aren't enough sellers at that=
=20
price.=20
Guardino said the ISO isn't ruling out scheduled blackouts, but is concerne=
d=20
that such an approach could result in unnecessary outages.=20
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, believes the ISO proposal is=

``Doing everything we can to let people know what's likely to happen is=20

The Orange County Register
With the lights and air conditioners set to go out in summer blackouts,=20
everyone is scrambling for more energy production. That's why nuclear power=

is back - cleaner, safer and more efficient.=20
President Bush set the tone in his 163-page energy plan released Thursday,=

nuclear power.
Nevertheless, advances in technology, years of experience and other factors=

should make nuclear energy a serious candidate for responding to=20

through the history and the potential of this powerful energy producer.
Nuclear accidents
The heyday of the American nuclear power program was the 1950s through 1979=
,=20
when the Three Mile Island meltdown in Pennsylvania led to an end to new=20
plans for nuclear power. "The Three Mile Island accident destroyed the=20
reactor, but the core itself remained confined. Radioactive gases were=20
vented, but there is no accepted evidence that this harmed the public,"=20
writes John McCarthy, a Stanford professor of computer sciences with an=20
extensive Web site on nuclear power:=20
www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/nuclear-faq.html.
The last American nuclear plant opened in 1996 at Watts Barr in Tennessee, =
23=20
years after its construction was given the OK. No new plant construction ha=
s=20
been approved in America since 1977.=20
In 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Soviet Union (now Ukraine)=20
exploded from high-pressure steam (not a nuclear explosion), spewing out=20
radiation and casting further doubts on the future of the American nuclear=
=20
program, although no American nuclear reactor ever had anything close to th=
e=20
shoddy socialist design of the Chernobyl plant.
"At the end of 1998 there were 9,012 civilian power reactor years of=20
experience throughout the world, and Chernobyl is the only nuclear power=20
plant accident harming the public," McCarthy notes on his site. Put another=
=20
way, excluding Chernobyl, nuclear power plants have never harmed the public=
.=20
Irrational fears
Contributing to the anti-nuclear atmosphere were such films as 1979's "The=
=20
China Syndrome," starring Jane Fonda and 1983's "Silkwood," starring Meryl=
=20
Streep. And let's not forget one of the funnier skits on "Saturday Night=20
Live" in 1979, in which Dan Aykroyd played President Jimmy Carter, who=20
becomes irradiated touring "Two Mile Island" after an accident and grows in=
to=20
The Amazing Colossal President.=20
In California, sentiment was set by then-Gov. Jerry Brown, whose chief of=
=20
staff was Gray Davis, now California's governor. "Well, it's not completely=
=20
clear to me what a reasonably scientific position is on nuclear power -=20
except to say that where there are other potentially less destructive=20
alternatives, it doesn't make much sense to rush to increase dependency on=
=20
nuclear power plants. In California there are alternatives such as=20
conservation, cogeneration combined cycle, geothermal and solar energy. In=
=20
the aggregate they make it possible to slow down the growing use of nuclear=
=20
power," Brown told biographer Orville Schell in Brown, published in 1978.
Foreign countries don't share America's phobia about nuclear power, which=
=20
provides 78 percent of France's electricity, compared to 20 percent in the=
=20
United States and 16 percent in California. America has 103 operating=20
reactors out of 435 worldwide.
Surfin' San Onofre
"You'd catch 'em surfin' at ... San Onofre," harmonized the Beach Boys in=
=20
"Surfin' USA." And the surfers still ride the waves right in front of the=
=20
nuclear power plant, which has been operated in complete safety since 1968.=
=20
The first nuclear reactor built was decommissioned in 1992 and is being=20
dismantled. The two remaining, newer reactors - the large cones visible as=
=20
you drive by on the I-5 freeway - are licensed to operate by the federal=20
Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2022, spokesman Ray Golden told me, and=
=20
could be running until 2042 if an extension is granted.
Put another way, if the state had just three more nuclear sites the size of=
=20
the one in San Onofre, there would be no blackouts this summer. The state i=
s=20
expected to be short 5,000 megawatts. San Onofre's two reactors together=20
produce 2,240 megawatts of power. (1,000 megawatts serves about 1 million=
=20
homes.)
California's only other nuclear plant is the Diablo Canyon facility, which=
=20
opened in 1985 and provides 2,190 megawatts of power.=20
Last Wednesday I toured the San Onofre plant. Bechtel workers were fixing o=
ne=20
turbine, on which an electrical circuit breaker had shorted out in February=
=20
and caused a fire. The turbine should be fixed by sometime in June, in time=
=20
for the summer energy crunch.
It should be noted that the turbine is not the reactor. The turbine rotates=
=20
and creates electricity the same as at any other kind of plant, so the fire=
=20
didn't come close to causing problems for the reactor.
The nuclear fuel the reactor uses costs about $30 million a year, Golden=20
said. That works out to a cost of "less than 3 cents a kilowatt hour," he=
=20
said, but couldn't be more specific because of company policy. That compare=
s=20
to a cost of 3 cents to 4 cents a kilowatt hour for natural gas.
Regulatory hoops
Despite the safety and need for nuclear power, there are a number of hurdle=
s=20
to building new plants, especially in California:
lWaste disposal. Currently, all American nuclear plants store their nuclear=
=20
wastes on site, such as the large concrete bunkers I saw at San Onofre. The=
=20
waste has to be stored for 10,000 years. They're awaiting the potential=20
development of the Yucca Mountain, Nevada, waste site, on which $7 billion=
=20
already has been spent for studies by the U.S. Department of Energy. The si=
te=20
already was the location of 100 nuclear bomb tests.=20
The site will be ready "at the earliest in 10 years," Barbara Byron, nuclea=
r=20
waste policy adviser for the California Energy Commission, told me.
In the meantime, California law stipulates that "no nuclear fission thermal=
=20
powerplant ... shall be permitted land use in the state" until the U.S.=20
government develops a "means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste."
Another problem is that President Carter shut down America's only nuclear=
=20
waste processing plant in the late 1970s, which would have recycled most of=
=20
the waste, immensely relieving the problem. In March, Sen. Pete Domenici of=
=20
New Mexico introduced S. 472, the Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assuran=
ce=20
Act of 2001, which would develop a new waste reprocessing facility.
lEarthquakes. The state's unstable geology adds to the risk and cost of=20
building plants here.=20
lWater. The state's lack of water makes it difficult to site new plants.=20
Byron said nuclear plants use "two and a half times as much water as other=
=20
plants."=20
lIn a deregulated market, companies are less likely to pay the $2 billion t=
o=20
$5 billion a new nuclear plant is estimated to cost, Byron said. How does=
=20
that compare? The Electric Power Supply Association told me that it's=20
difficult to estimate the cost of building and running a new plant, whether=
=20
it uses nuclear, natural gas or some other power. However, the costs of som=
e=20
recent natural gas plants have ranged from $600,000 to $800,000 per megawat=
t=20
of installed power, or as much as $800 million for 1,000 megawatts of power=
.=20
And given that new natural-gas plants range from 50 to 1,500 megawatts,=20
there's more flexibility in designing and financing projects.
New technologies
But the technology keeps moving forward. One thing that should keep costs=
=20
down is standardized nuclear-plant designs, an idea that has kept prices=20
reasonable in France. In the past, each nuclear plant in America was=20
basically designed as a unique unit.
Since 1997, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulates all nuclear=
=20
plants in America, has approved three new advanced designs: The Advanced=20
Boiling Water Reactor design by GE Nuclear Energy, which generates 1,300=20
megawatts; the System 80+ design by Westinghouse (formerly ABB-Combustion=
=20
Engineering), which generates 1,300 megawatts and is similar to that used a=
t=20
San Onofre; and the AP600 design by Westinghouse, which generates 600=20
megawatts.
"Nine other reactor designs have been submitted for NRC review, however onl=
y=20
two - the AP1000 and the Pebble Bed Module Reactor - are being actively=20
pursued at this time," the NRC reports on its Web site.=20
www.nrc.gov/OPA/gmo/tip/fsadvancedrx.html
The AP1000 is a more powerful version of the AP600. But the Pebble Bed desi=
gn=20
is new and is called "politically correct" by those working on it, Andrew=
=20
Kadak told me; he's a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technolog=
y=20
in the nuclear engineering department. He said the new technology is=20
"high-efficiency, helium-cooled." It runs at lower temperatures than=20
traditional nuclear plants and "uses a different type of fuel. It produces=
=20
less energy per cubic meter. Essentially there's no chance for melting=20
because of the lower power density they generate. You could put them near=
=20
population centers because of their safety."Each plant would generate about=
=20
100 MW, or about one tenth of current plants. Construction planned for a=20
plant in South Africa will run $100 million. Even if the cost were double i=
n=20
America, he said, "it's still very competitive for natural gas." The South=
=20
African plant will produce power at a cost about 1.6 cents to 2 cents per=
=20
kilowatt-hour, "about half what natural gas cost two years ago" when natura=
l=20
gas prices were stable; the price comparison is even better today, since=20
natural gas prices have more than doubled.
Kadak said the concerns over emitting gasses into the environment, the high=
=20
cost of other fuels and a changing political climate make nukes feasible=20
again.
Kadak said that the Pebble Bed design can be up and running within four yea=
rs=20
once a site is approved.
When will we go nuclear again?
"For the first time in a long time it looks like it might be starting up=20
again," Fred Smith told me about nuclear power construction; he's head of t=
he=20
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington think-tank that advances new=
=20
thinking on economic matters. "Sooner or later we will have a waste=20
facility," he said of the Yucca Mountain site. "The nuclear option is far=
=20
more viable than most people thought. The anti-nuclear campaign has passed=
=20
its peak. But it will take time. I think within the decade we'll have a new=
=20
nuclear plant. That wasn't true two years ago."
Moreover, natural gas - which will power most of the new plants coming onli=
ne=20
in California - will continue to be scarce. "We haven't drilled for it,"=20
Smith said. "It's hard to transmit. We'll have to build more pipelines. It'=
s=20
not easy to ship from abroad."
By contrast, nuclear power's fuel prices are almost constant.=20
What's short-circuiting the construction of nuclear power? The same thing=
=20
that has caused the electricity and other energy crises: politics. Even=20
though nuclear plants would alleviate concerns (real or imagined) about=20

environmentalists remain opposed, including the Sierra Club and the Green=

The Sierra Club Web site includes several resolutions opposing nuclear powe=

The 2000 Green Party platform called for "the early retirement of nuclear=
=20
power reactors as soon as possible (in no more than 5 years)."
Legislation
In the California Legislature, Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino=

introduced Assembly Bill 1492, which would have allowed the construction of=
