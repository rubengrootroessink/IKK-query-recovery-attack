Hi saritha sundaresan,

Thanks for joining Evite!

With your new Evite Membership, you can:

* Send Invites for your next get-together, track RSVPS, get maps and

Caution: May Be Habit-Forming - All the Invites you send or receive are 
stored on your 'My Evite' page. It's fun to keep checking your Invite as 
guests RSVP and leave comments - once you try it, you'll never go back to 
email or phone tag when you want to get people together!
