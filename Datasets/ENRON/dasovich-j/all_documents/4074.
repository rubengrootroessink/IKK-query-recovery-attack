I assume you are referring to the IEEE effort to develop a standard for the 
interconnection of distributed resources (IEEE P1547).  I was following this 
development but have since reduced my efforts in this area.   The status is 
that they are working to get an approved standard released in the 3rd quarter 
of 2001.

Is anyone from Enron involved in the IEEE discussions for uniform standards 
for interconnection?
