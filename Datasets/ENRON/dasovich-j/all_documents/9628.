Meihong  Xu
Principal, Softbank Corp  AuthorYes, she is a VC in the valley, but is also 
a? Co-author of the International Best-selling  Book,?DAUGHTER OF CHINA A 
True Story of Love and  Betrayal. Well here is?one of the  book reviews...??
?
It is early September 1988. First lieutenant  Xu Meihong, a young graduate of 
China's elite intelligence corps, is assigned to  spy on suspected American 
operative Larry Engelmann. The roguish, blue-eyed  professor instead opens 
Xu's eyes to the wonders of freedom and democracy. They  fall in love, dodge 
the bad guys, escape China and end up happily ensconced in  paradise (read 
California). 
This is no Hollywood movie script. Like most  stories flooding out of China 
over the past decade, it is unbelievable, but  true. Daughter of China is the 
latest of a rash of Chinese women's biographies  to hit the bookshelves. 
Cynics may groan, but with no good reason. While the  autobiography fits the 
"scar memoir" mould, it also offers an insider's look at  a bumbling and 
brutish People's Liberation Army and the petty power games played  by party 
leaders. 
Xu's revelations about the PLA's inner  workings also are engrossing. She 
tells of a failed plan to build a mock  American city--complete with 
American-style cinemas, cars, gas pumps,  restaurants and credit cards--to 
better train officers to blend in should they  be posted to the United States 
on intelligence missions. But above all, Daughter  of China is a thrilling 
tale told with intelligence and  compassion.?? (excerpt from "Loving the 
Enemy" by  Angela Leary, Far Eastern Economic Review, Aug 5,  99)
