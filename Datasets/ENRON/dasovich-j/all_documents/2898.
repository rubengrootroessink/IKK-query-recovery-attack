Hi Sue:

I am pleased with this approach. I will ask my assistant Beverley Ashcroft to 
put together  a list of participants with phone numbers and time difference 
indication. I suggest following people:

Jane Wilson 
Michael Grimes
yourself
Donald &/or Scott 
Mark Schroeder (provided that he is interested in this)
Wayne Gardner 

We will have to find a time scheme which will allow us to talk to each other 
at a convenient time.

Following the list of topics as presented by Donald in Vancouver, I suggest 
to start with dividing up the issues and nominate 'rapporteurs'.
The rapporteurs can then report on work progressed at our next off site 
meeting (in Greece?)

international tax issues
what regulatory issues does the blockbuster deal bring about ?
what are the regulatory risks involved with bandwidth trading ?
how can the global approval process be harmonized ?
CLEC issues
development of a coherent licensing strategy in target markets 

I copied some more people into this mail, in order to get the discussion 
started.

Best regards

Jan

Hi Jan,

I think your suggestion of establishing regular communication between our 
groups is a very good one.  Maybe we should start with a monthly conference 
call.  The quality of video conferencing between London and Houston doesn't 
seem to be very good, and I think it is quite expensive.  Should we try just 
doing a phone conference to see if that is adequate?

What do you suggest for the date and agenda for our first call?  Perhaps we 
could further refine the scope, participation and timeframe for the working 
groups.

I look forward to working with you.  Kindest regards,

Sue

Hi Sue,

I hope that you are doing well. I would like get some communication between 
the different areas of business started. Maybe we could meet up once in a 
month or bi-monthly. Donald had suggested to set up some working groups and 
suggested some areas of interest for us. I would like to come back to this 
suggestion.

I  wonder whether we do not have a telephone/video conference on the possible 
issues for the working group and present progress  reports on issues on our 
next meeting in 3 months time. The aim is to improve communication in general 
and to help us structure future meetings.

Let me know what you think. We could then push things forward together.

Best regards
