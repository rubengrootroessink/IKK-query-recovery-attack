I think we definitely need clarification on the July date, but we should 
defer to Tom Riley on approaching UC/CSU for help.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: DASR Update  

The attached indicates that UC/CSU are still not fully back to DA.  Does it 
make sense to try and get their help in making sure that the legislation does 
not limit their return to DA?  What is our current relationship with that 
customer?   

Also, does anyone have any problems with Govt Affairs using this information 
when we are asking for "clarification" on the July 12 date?  It may be 
helpful to highlight for the key legislative members exactly who they are 
hurting with their decisions.

Thanks,

Jim
