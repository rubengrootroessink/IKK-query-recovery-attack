Jeff/Leslie/Barry---attached is a quideline that we developed on what our 
"global" message on price risk management would be as we talk to PUCs across 
the country and was intended to address the issue in both power and gas 
markets.  It's a good starting point and should obviously then be tailored to 
each state's situation.

I am happy to jump on a call to discuss.  I will be in Michigan on Monday, 
but could be available between 9:30 and 12:00 eastern.  (6:30-9:00 
pacific--sorry Jeff!!).  If you could leave me a voice mail about what time 
to talk and whose number to call that would be great.  #612-339-4599

If we decide to talk later in the week, I am not open on Tuesday until about 
3:30pm central but Wednesday I'm pretty much available all day.

I can make time.  Let's try to let Leslie vacation.  Also, I'm having a memo 
prepared that should be ready first thing Monday AM on the CA Commission's 
policies regarding utility use of hedging instruments.  Just let me know when 
you'd like to talk.

Best,
Jeff
