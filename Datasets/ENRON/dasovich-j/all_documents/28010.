State Controller Kathleen Connell, a member of the board, proposed that the=

The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by=20
Proposition 13, but the state is able to place higher values on the=20
properties.=20
Supporters of the move say the state could collect $70 million to $100=20

But the board's staff, while acknowledging that the state could extract mor=

said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of pow=

Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for ne=

has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.=20
"The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes.=

The agency's response to the Western power problem "raises serious question=

about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy=20
markets" not only in the West but across the rest of the country.=20
The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day,=

Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the=20
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on=
=20
overcharges and other issues.=20
Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by pow=
er=20
generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings=
=20
and the matter remains in dispute.=20
"To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,"=20
complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this=
=20
month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9=20
billion.=20
"They must be required to give us back our money," said Davis. "It is=20
unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked=
=20
our state for up to $9 billion."=20
The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000=
=20
and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis. "Power=20
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market," h=
e=20
said.=20
Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the=20
problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional=
=20
megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of=

this summer. "Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable=20

Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that=20

WASHINGTON =01) California Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans=

Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an=
=20
alleged $9 billion scheme to bilk the state's electricity consumers.=20
Testifying in front of the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis=20
demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order power=
=20
companies to refund the overcharges. But the governor also found himself=20
obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis' own policies triggered the state=
's=20
energy crisis.=20
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved=
=20
in California's plight. With both parties preparing for next year's=20
congressional elections, the subtext of Davis' testimony appeared to involv=
e=20
a recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of=
=20
several California races.=20
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thomps=

of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, as he greeted Davis who=

Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 millio=
n=20
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that=20
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis.=20
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power=
=20
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.=20
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise=
=20
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.=20
Saying that he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the fire" on the refun=
d=20
issue, Davis complained to the committee, "It is unconscionable that the=20
commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for=

up to $9 billion."=20
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground wit=

"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"=

observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American=20

Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC=20
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the=

However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of=20

the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep=

think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."=
=20
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.=20
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance=20
warnings of the crisis, including a 1998 report foreseeing an imminent ener=
gy=20
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of=20
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.=20
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you=20
concern?"=20
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson,=
=20
and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now=20
widely recognized as having been seriously flawed.=20
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.=20
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power=20
companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by=

dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's=
=20
power infrastructure.=20
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight bac=

He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a l=

Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal=20



Council worried about financial burden
By Brian E. Clark=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 21, 2001=20
POWAY -- Citing financial risks, the City Council has pulled the plug on a=
=20
proposed $40 million power plant in the South Poway Business Park.=20
Though there was no formal vote, Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim=
=20
Bowersox -- who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant -- that his staf=
f=20
should not spend any more time or money on the project.=20
So-called "peaker" plants are small, less-efficient plants that can produce=
=20
up to 50 megawatts of electricity. Usually they run only several hours a da=
y,=20
when demand is greatest.=20
At the council meeting Tuesday night, Cafagna said he saw little reason to=
=20
invest in the plant, especially since there are no guarantees that Poway=20
could claim any of the power it produced.=20
Instead, he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep. Duncan=20
Hunter, R-El Cajon, that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owne=
d=20
by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague=
=20
the state this summer.=20
If the council had chosen to proceed with the peaker-plant proposal -- an=
=20
idea it first explored in March -- it would have had to pay San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric Co. up to $30,000 to go through the application process. An=20
additional $70,000 would have been authorized for a consultant.=20

?????As unwelcome as the killer bees, as hyped as "Pearl Harbor," the big,=

bad summer of 2001 officially arrived today and--did someone forget to turn=

?????After months of dread, the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright=

note. Despite several days of summer-like weather, there was barely a whisp=

about blackouts. The state that couldn't plug in a night light in January=

h=20
electricity to spare.=20
?????For the moment, power supplies look healthy. Wholesale electricity=20

down, apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign. And=20
California officials appear to have won their months-long battle with the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which imposed price and supply contro=
ls=20
on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night.
?????All in all, an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be=
 a=20
dreadful summer. So why aren't California energy officials blowing up=20
balloons for the big end-of-crisis party?
?????"We are not out of the woods," said Richard Sklar, the state's energy=
=20
supply czar. "We are not out of the woods on price, and we are not out of t=
he=20
woods on availability."
?????His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the state's=20
electrical market. So far, California's supply-demand balance is coming=20
closer to best-case predictions than to the worst. But it is a delicate=20
balance.
?????On Wednesday, with temperatures hovering around summer norms, operator=
s=20
of the statewide power grid managed to maintain--if just barely--the 7% of=
=20
operating reserves they strive for. When reserves dip below that, the state=
=20
begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventuall=
y=20
lead to blackouts.
?????Total electricity use in the state peaked about 4 p.m. at 39,156=20
megawatts--a high for the year, but well below the state's all-time record =
of=20
45,884 megawatts, which was set on July 12, 1999.
?????State officials credit conservation with shaving off about 4,000=20
megawatts, an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or =
no=20
blackouts on most days.
?????"There is no doubt in my mind that conservation . . . has led directly=

to the situation that we're in now," said Mike Sloss, who tracks conservati=

for the California Energy Commission.
?????Richard Roher, who crunches conservation numbers for the commission,=
=20
said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by abou=

11%.
?????There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation. Afte=
r=20
months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state=
=20
as much as 15,000 megawatts of electricity at a time, most plants are now=
=20
online and outages were down to 4,300 megawatts Wednesday.
?????Most small, alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement thi=
s=20
week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison, putting=
=20
that vital segment of the state's energy production back in business. And i=
n=20
the next two weeks, the state's first two new major power plants in a decad=
e=20
are scheduled to open, adding more than 1,000 megawatts to the power=20
stream--enough to serve about 750,000 typical homes.
?????State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling, which limits=20
prices in the 11-state Western region and requires generators to sell=20
available power to California, will ease the situation further.
?????"Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds, price-wise a=
nd=20
supply-wise," Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for California's grid=20
operator, said Wednesday.
?????For all the positive signs, no one is predicting that the state will=
=20
weather the summer without blackouts. No one knows how many power plants wi=

break down. Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians' best=20
intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave.
?????While the past few days have been hot, they haven't been searing. It w=

81 in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, 94 in Riverside, 102 in Sacramento=
,=20
109 in Palm Springs--toasty, but far from the hottest weather any of those=
=20
places can expect this summer.
?????Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states, whose ability to sell=
=20
power to California depends in part on their own energy needs. Electricity=
=20
use generally rises with the thermometer, because air conditioners use more=
=20
power than most other appliances.
?????"If it gets hot in California, and it's also hot in the Northwest . . =

and it's hot in Phoenix, we could run into some significant problems," said=
=20
Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers=

Assn., a trade group for power plant owners in California.
?????The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the=

those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhi=

?????So the summer of 2001 could still be interesting. And it may begin wit=

a blackout after all. For weeks now, an e-mail campaign has spread through=

Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants=20
Proposal: Levies on property currently are made by counties. The revenue=20
would increase, say proponents of change.=20

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--State tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that=20
could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in=
=20
taxes next year.
?????The five-member Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert=20
jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants th=
at=20
produce more than 50 megawatts. Under the board's proposal--which faces=20
public hearings before it takes effect--the state would seize from counties=
=20
the authority to tax these plants.
?????State control could potentially enrich government coffers, because the=
=20
state would tax the plants based on their fair market value, while counties=
=20
tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a 2%=
=20
annual inflation rate.
?????Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has=20
skyrocketed in the past year, as the price of wholesale electricity soared =
in=20
the malfunctioning market created under California's 1998 deregulation plan=
.
?????Under deregulation, utilities sold 22 power plants to private companie=
s,=20
many of them based out of state, for a total of $3.2 billion.
?????"They are making exorbitant profits," said Lenny Goldberg, executive=
=20
director of the California Tax Reform Assn., a nonprofit group largely fund=
ed=20
by unions. He called the power plants "vastly underassessed."
?????Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell=
=20
said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax=20
revenue, but because California itself could soon build power plants or own=
=20
power lines under plans pushed by Gov. Gray Davis.
?????"We may not be getting the best value through the current system," sai=
d=20
Connell, "especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in=20
California.=20
?????"It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under th=
e=20
same assessment system," she said.
?????For many decades, the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on=
=20
power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the stat=
e.=20
But in 1999, after the launch of deregulation, the tax board voted to allow=
=20
counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by=20
Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that limits property taxes for=20
homeowners and businesses.
?????The board's vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that=
=20
could lead to a reversal of that 1999 decision.
?????Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the=
=20
Board of Equalization to take no action. Under the current system, cities=
=20
with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue, which is=20
generally split among local governments and schools.
?????Long Beach got about $55,000 a year in property tax revenue when the=
=20
state was assessing taxes, said city Controller Barbara Hennessy, but now=
=20
gets nearly $1 million a year.
?????Shari L. Freidenrich, treasurer for Huntington Beach, said a reversal =
of=20
the board's tax method could cost the city--home to a major power plant--$1=
.5=20
million a year in property taxes.
?????A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-Sa=
n=20
Francisco) would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the sam=
e=20
proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over=
=20
power plant assessments.
?????Goldberg, of the California Tax Reform Assn., argued that allowing the=
=20
state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue=
=20
for the entire state.
?????As an example, he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay own=
ed=20
by Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey=
=20
County at least an additional $10 million in property taxes last year under=
=20
the proposed method of assessment. The plant, valued by the county at $362=
=20
million, is probably worth about $2 billion given market conditions, Goldbe=
rg=20
said.
?????The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation=
=20
of power plants in 1998, those plants became businesses no different from a=

Washington -- President Bush's top federal energy regulator told a Senate=

panel yesterday that he would consider denying power generators the right t=
o=20
charge market prices for electricity.=20
If carried out, the suggestion by Patrick Wood, one of Bush's two new=20
appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, would mark a stunni=
ng=20
about-face for an agency that until Wood's arrival had resisted heavy=20
intervention in California's electricity market.=20
Such a move would hand a huge victory to Gov. Gray Davis, who earlier in th=
e=20
day told the Government Affairs Committee that FERC should order power=20
generators to pay California=20
$9 billion in refunds for alleged overcharges.=20
Davis arrived in Washington for what had initially been billed as star=20
testimony urging FERC to impose price caps. After federal regulators approv=
ed=20
a form of price controls on Monday, Davis swiftly pivoted to demand that FE=
RC=20
order generators to pay refunds.=20
"It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies=

Lieberman promised Davis that he would pressure regulators to order the=20

But it now appears that FERC may be much more amenable to Davis' complaints=
=20
than it was little more than two weeks ago, before Wood was sworn in.=20
In his first action at the agency, Wood, the former head of the Texas Publi=
c=20
Utilities Commission, was a chief catalyst behind a 5-to-0 vote by FERC=20
Monday to impose a sweeping price ceiling on electricity throughout 11=20

penalties in addition to refunds.=20

Peter Hero, president of Community Foundation Silicon Valley. ''Our goal is=

The survey released yesterday showed that most agencies have already=20

to dip into reserves to pay utility bills.=20

``I think the party has gotten a lot quieter,'' said Severin Borenstein,=20
director of the University of California Energy Institute.=20
The federal controls for the first time limit market prices throughout the=

That's a far cry from daily prices that averaged $200 to $400 and at times=

Prices have been falling since late May as power plants returned to operati=

from scheduled maintenance, cool weather dampened demand and hydro-electric=

imports exceeded expectations. The state's long-term power contracts also=

contributed to the decline.=20
But as rising temperatures threatened blackouts this week, daily prices for=

Northern California held at a modest $94 per megawatt-hour, according to=20
Bloomberg News Service, less than a third of the cost during similar=20
shortages in May.=20
Power contract prices for electricity delivered later this summer and next=

``They know there's going to be a ceiling on prices and that's bearish=20

Expectations were much higher just two months ago. Predictions of routine=
