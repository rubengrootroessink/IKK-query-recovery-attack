Attached please find a draft of a Govt Affairs Update that Tim Belden has 
asked us to keep (Mary Hain has worked on it).  It will help the Desk and our 
group keep up with what is going on.  I've asked Marcie Milner to try and 
manage the report (but everyone needs to update their stuff).  We can talk 
about this at our next meeting.  If you have comments on format, etc. please 
let Marcie know.  

Jim

PS Marcie , this has some changes that weren't on the last one.
