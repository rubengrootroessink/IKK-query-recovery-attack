Thanks for the note.  I am forwarding it on to our analyst and associate 
recruiting program leaders.  We may have already filled the summer spots (we 
also cut  down the number  a bit this year to ensure a higher quality 
experience), but we will be out looking for a large number of permanent hires 
in the Fall.

Dear Steve:

Jim Bushnell and I are teaching a course called "Energy Market Strategies
and Policies" this semester.  The course is cross-listed between the Haas
School of Business and the Energy & Resources Group at UC Berkeley.  The
syllabus for the course is attached.

We have 43 graduate students in the course, most pursuing a masters degree
in business or energy & resources, though there are also a few PhD
students.  These are very smart students -- many of whom already have
experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the course puts them
in a position to immediately contribute to any energy-related organization
that they would join.

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May.  If Enron has openings that you would
like to advertise to these students, please send me the job description
(or the URL for it)and I can forward it to the class list.

Jim and I think this is a very strong class, and many of the students are
interested in making a career in either the business or the public policy 
side of
the energy industry.  We're hoping to provide the connections to help make 
sure
they find the best job matches possible.

Sincerely,
Severin
