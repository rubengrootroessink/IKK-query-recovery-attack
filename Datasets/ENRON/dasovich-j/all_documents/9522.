Thanks very much for getting back to us.  So if I understand the bottom 
line:  1) the customer was mistakenly put back to SoCal (due to the dual 
service territory character of the customer's facilities), 2) the customer 
will be returned to our service, 3) the customer's contract with us expires 
on 5/31, and 4) the customer will have the option of re-signing with us, or 
returning to SoCalGas when the contracts ends on 5/31?  If I've confused 
anything, please let me know.  And thanks again for helping track down the 
info.

Best,
Jeff

Upon research, it was discovered that this customer has two active meters in 
two different Utilities (PG&E, and SOCAL) under the same contract.  This is 
the reason for the confusion.  For tracking purposes, we "break-out" meters 
by LDC in order to assign our customers to reps familiar with a particular 
LDC. Those customers that have multiple LDC's under the same contract are 
assigned to the same rep.  This allows the customers to speak to the same 
individual for all of their accounts.

Unfortunately the site in question was identified in error as a single site 
only.  The site in PG&E was assigned to Dennis Harris, while the site in 
SOCAL, because of the low usage, was identified for transition to SOCAL.  
This was not our intention.  The data has been realigned and Dennis Harris 
now has access to both records.  

I spoke to Dennis regarding this issue, and he will contact the customer, 
explain why it occurred, stop the transition to SOCAL for this site, should 
the customer choose to; as well as coordinate a renewal for this customer 
going forward, as their current agreement is to expire 05/31/01.

Jeff:

Here is some more useful information.  Sarita Sarvate of the CPUC spoke to
the woman in person.  The school in question is the Providence High School
in Burbank, California (not Ontario), operated by the Sisters of Providence.
Ms. Kathy Pentalio (sp?) at 818-846-8140 wrote to the CPUC asking about the
school's options after receiving phone and letter notification that their
gas service would be terminated by Enron.  Apparently the Sisters also
operate a hospital which is also served by Enron.  Ms. Pentalio indicated
that she was told that the school would no longer be served on the same
contract as the hospital (claimed to be an attractive 86 cents/th rate)
because the school's load was so small that it was a core customer, while
the hospital was a noncore customer with a larger load.   Neither Ms.
Sarvate nor Ms. Pentalio was clear if the school was served as a core
aggregation customer or as part of the Sisters of Providence noncore
contract.  Ms. Pentalio claimed she spoke with Enron employees Dennis Harris
in Dublin, Ohio as well as Roger Pons in New Mexico.  She indicated that
service would be terminated on June 1, 2001 and she is looking for
alternative sources of gas.

Sarita Sarvate of the CPUC Energy Division would like to understand the
specifics of this case, but her main concern, and the purpose for sending a
letter (if she does send one) is that Dynergy has told her that a number of
small noncore businesses are being returned to the utilities by marketers
because they no longer meet credit requirements.  She assumed that must be
true with Enron as well.  I indicated to her that she should never assume
that we are doing what Dynegy is doing and that we would respond and advise
her if there was any significant trend of noncore customer turnbacks.  The
Commission's concern, which I know you understand, is that it is phasing out
the core subscription schedule (and has a moratorium on switches to the
SoCalGas core subscription schedule) therefore leaving no place for such
customers to go if they cannot contract with a replacement aggregator.

Please advise me of what you discover about this matter and we can talk
further about a response to the CPUC.   Thank you.
