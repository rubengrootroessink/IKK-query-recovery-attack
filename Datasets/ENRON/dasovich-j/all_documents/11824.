Jeff:

I have been looking at your numbers and I have a few questions.

1).     If we look at this from the stand point of the Time shareholder's,
we do not really need to worry about the make-up of Time-Paramount after
the merger.  Since this is an all cash deal, the purchase price will be
given to Time's shareholders.  This amount needs to be above the DCF of the
Time-Warner deal for us to suggest it.

2).     As for the taxes maybe Mark can shed some light on the
issue.  During the acquisition phase the only taxes that will be paid will
be the capital gains paid by Time Shareholders.  Paramount will not pay
taxes on the purchase.  Paramount's tax position will improve due to the
increased debt payments.  Looking at it from Time shareholder's we really
don't care do we?  Maybe I am wrong.

Otherwise everything looked good.  I like the common sized balance
sheet.  I should be home all day tomorrow.  Call me at 925-362-0210 and let
me know how I can pitch in.

Dylan
