As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX 
credit payment and DA suspension issues, and vote only on DA suspension on 
Thursday.  This gives more time to work on a SCE PX credit stipulation.

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1. Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's 
request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2. Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  
Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC 
decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on 
Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the 
Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim
