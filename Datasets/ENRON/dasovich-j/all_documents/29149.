Got the California PUC to agree 1) not to place rate-cap related surcharges 
on Direct Access customers in SDG&E's service territory, and 2) not to impose 
3 cent rate increase on DA customers in PG&E and Edison service territories.
Got the PUC to delay votes threatening to suspend, or end, Direct Access in 
California.
Got Senators Dunn and Burton to agree to postpone vote on Senator Dunn's 
report recommending that the full Sentate vote to 1) find Enron in contempt 
and 2) impose steep fines pending compliance by Enron.
Got the PUC to postpone a vote which would have 1) amended the way California 
applies the "PX Credit" and 2) harmed EES' financial position.
Provided the California Assembly Speaker with analysis supporting a 
core/noncore electricity market structure in California, which the Speaker 
then embraced as his own and established a working group in an attempt to 
implement the proposal in California.
Helped reach an agreement with Edison to delay a PUC proceeding in which the 
Administrative Law Judge could have forced Enron to submit commercially 
sensitive information.
Helped get California policymakers to agree to 1) raise prices in order to 
return the IOUs to creditworthiness; 2) establish a "demand buy-down" 
proposal; 3) focus on the need to expedite plant siting and construction; and 
4) enter into long-term contracts to reduce exposure to price volatility.
Worked with PR and Ken Lay to persuade California's business leaders to get 
involved in the effort to resolve California's energy crisis.
