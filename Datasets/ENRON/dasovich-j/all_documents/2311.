Where do we stand on proposing a broader solution to the problems in this=
=20
case?  I am worried that the only leverage we have right now (utility=20
undercollection) is going to be taken up on its own and we will still have=
=20
the other issues (e.g., price cap reductions, rate cap problems, hydro, etc=
.)=20
to fight.

Subject: Edison and PG&E Emergency Motions - - - ALJ Ruling Just Issued



Last week you were sent an email which discussed the October 4 emergency =
=20
motions of Edison and PG&E to modify the end of rate freeze decisions.?  On=
=20
October 5, Edison filed an ex parte request for the immediate suspension of=
 =20
the effective date of portions of D.99-10-057 and D.00-03-058.??On  October=
=20
6, PG&E filed its support of Edison=01,s request for immediate  suspension =
of=20
the effective dates of the decisions. The motions were filed  because of th=
e=20
significant undercollections which are being accumulated in their  purchase=
d=20
power accounts.
?
A ruling has just been issued by ALJ Minkin which directs parties to file =
=20
responses to Edison=01,s and PG&E=01,s ex parte requests for immediate susp=
ension =20
of certain portions of D.99-10-057 and D.00-03-058.? The judge says, "In =
=20
effect, Edison and PG&E have moved for a stay of certain aspects of these =
=20
decisions.? Consistent with Rule 45(f), responses to motions must be filed =
=20
and served within 15 days of the date that the motion was served, unless th=
e =20
administrative law judge sets a different date.? Therefore, responses to =
=20
Edison=01,s and PG&E=01,s requests must be filed and served by October 20, =
 2000."
?
She also notes that the utilities' financial information must be provided  =
by=20
October 17 and provides that, "Parties have the opportunity to comment on=
=20
the  financial information provided by the utilities and the emergency=20
petitions  (including the amended petitions) by October 30."
?
This suggests that the filing due on the 20th could be primarily  procedura=
l,=20
dealing with the propriety of the Commission issuing a stay of  previously=
=20
approved decisions.? The filing on the 30th would then deal with  the=20
substance of the emergency requests, as well as making any comments on the =
=20
financial data provided by the utilities.? This would provide more time to =
=20
review the financial data and work out the details of any "counter proposal=
" =20
which ARM might want to make.? However, we could also deal with substantive=
 =20
issues in the 10/20 filing.? We should discuss this soon and determine what=
 =20
course ARM would like to pursue.
?
A copy of the ruling is attached for your information.
