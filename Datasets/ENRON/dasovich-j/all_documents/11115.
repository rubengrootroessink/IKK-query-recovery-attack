Subject:??????? Giants Game - May 13th - Please Respond ASAP 

To celebrate the end of another semester (and the Program for some), I looked 
into purchasing a block of tickets to a SF Giants game at Pac Bell Park.? We 
have the opportunity to purchase up to 90 tickets at $16/ticket for the game 
against the New York Mets on Sunday, May 13th at 1:05pm.? Seats are in the 
View Reserved Area (i.e., upper deck).

* * Please let me know ASAP how many tickets you would like. * *? 

Feel free to invite friends and family as well.? I will place the order based 
on your initial response, so only respond if you are definitely interested.? 

GO GIANTS!
