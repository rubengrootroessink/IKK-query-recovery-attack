Ken Lay put a call in today to Scott McNealy.  His office called back to find 
out what specific bill included direct access.  When I called back, they put 
me in touch with Mavis Toscano, who's in Sun Microsystems' state and local 
government affairs office.  She's Scott's point person on public policy, and 
she's been working on the energy issue.  Mavis had done some checking and no 
one had heard anything about direct access.

Sun is active in three main trade associations: the Chamber, the American 
Electronics Association (AEA) and Technet.  None of those organizations said 
their members were asking for direct access, but Mavis promised to put calls 
in to them and get direct access on the radar screen.  Although she said 
they're not inclined to send letters, Mavis said she'd make some calls into 
the legislators, specifically Bowen.
