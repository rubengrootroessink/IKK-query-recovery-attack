Court dismisses suit alleging gasoline price-fixing


Updated: June 14, 2001 - 11:35 a.m.=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court dismissed a class-action suit=
=20
Thursday alleging major oil refineries colluded to gouge consumers for=20
cleaner-burning gasoline.=20

The unanimous court said the suit did not provide enough evidence to suppor=
t=20
allegations that nine major oil companies in California conspired to limit=
=20
supply and fix prices.=20

In ruling that the case cannot go to trial, Justice Stanley Mosk said that=
=20
the 1996 suit presented evidence that the petroleum companies may have=20
possessed the motive, opportunity and means to unlawfully conspire.=20

"But that is all. That is not enough," Mosk wrote for the court.=20

The suit alleged that the state's largest refiners decided to share=20
confidential information and hold back on supplies of reformulated gasoline=
=20
after the state required refiners to make gasoline that would not create as=
=20
much pollution as previous formulas.=20

The case was granted class action status in 1997. The following year, a San=
=20
Diego County judge tossed out the case, siding with the oil companies who=
=20
said evidence was insufficient to persuade a jury.=20

Then, that judge, David Danielsen, reversed his own decision. The companies=
=20
appealed and in January 2000, an appeals court concurred with the judge's=
=20
initial decision.=20

The oil companies sued were Atlantic Richfield Co., Chevron Corp., Mobile O=
il=20
Co., 76 Products Co., Shell Oil Co., Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc.,=20
Tosco Corp., and Ultramar Inc.=20

The case is Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., S086738.

The five-member California Public Utilities Commission faces a lengthy=20

"I believe the patience of (Edison's) creditors is wearing very thin," he=

Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the Legislature and the=20

Davis and Edison signed a "Memorandum of Understanding" on April 9.=20
The commission plans to address several items in that MOU at the meeting=20
Thursday, including a decision on delaying a review of how much Edison=20

On Wednesday, the PUC voted 5-0 to approve a version of a deal that Edison=

these plants keep churning out power as they look to collect more than $1=

The commission-approved plan offers stable rates for five years to generato=

Small generators have said they will suspend their lawsuits against Edison=

at least 15 percent of what it owes to qualifying facilities.=20
"If they pay back what they owe us, the lawsuits would be dismissed and the=

Such incremental charges are separate, of course, from his home utility bil=

"It's getting ridiculous," said Hogue, who was waiting yesterday afternoon =

"We didn't have a choice because our gas and electric bill has gone from=20
$4,000 a month to $10,000 a month," Bruce Ross, the manager at Boulevard=20

company's surcharge. "They cuss at you and hang up the phone."=20
San Diego-based Jack in the Box is among companies that have opted to raise=

prices instead of imposing surcharges.=20
Primarily because of higher energy costs, the firm hiked the prices of its=

"Really, I feel like we've done our fair share," Davis said referring to th=

?????DWP is looking to beef up its investigation staff, which totals six=20

nearly 1,000 scofflaws, billing them more than $3.2 million for stolen powe=

?????They include the working poor, the unemployed and retirees for whom=20
electricity is becoming increasing unaffordable. Mobsters and marijuana=20

legitimate businesses and rich people do it too.
?????The DWP once nabbed an L.A. stockbroker who siphoned $9,000 worth of=

?????FERC's new power crisis policy, to be unveiled at a special board=20
meeting Monday, is expected to move closer to the fixed price caps sought b=
y=20
California leaders. FERC's version would allow electricity prices in the We=

?????However, the plan was still a subject of intense internal debate=20

?????As California has already learned, tinkering with power markets is no=

d=20
consequences.
?????For Hebert, 38, a proud Mississippian and avid free-market advocate,=
=20
growing impatience with FERC on Capitol Hill is not the only problem. He=20
risks losing a working majority on his own commission if the two new member=

intervention. That would isolate and embarrass Hebert, who is already in a=
=20
difficult spot because of persistent rumors that Bush will replace him as=
=20
chairman with newly appointed Commissioner Patrick H. Wood III.
?????"What we see here is someone who is a strong noninterventionist=20
Republican who has found himself in a position where he has to abandon that=
=20
to some extent," said James J. Hoecker, immediate past FERC chairman in the=
=20
Clinton administration. "Chairman Hebert . . . doesn't have to be a=20
weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing."
?????FERC, which functions like a national public utility commission, is=20
charged by law with assuring "just and reasonable" rates for wholesale=20
electricity. Last year, the commission made a formal finding that prices in=
=20
California were neither. But the modest "price mitigation" measures it=20
adopted were widely criticized as mere nibbling around the edges.
?????Not so, says Hebert. "I don't think there is any doubt that the=20
commission's plan is working and is bringing down prices," he told reporter=
s=20
this week. He condemned what he called "the ideology of price caps."
?????The two new FERC members, Wood and Nora M. Brownell, have not offered=
=20
ringing endorsements of FERC's actions to date. During Senate confirmation=
=20
hearings last month, they indicated they favored closer, tighter scrutiny o=

industry. Wood, past chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and a=
=20
confidant of the president, signaled in interviews that a return to=20
regulation would be preferable to dysfunctional markets that deprive=20
consumers of the benefits of competition.
?????"No tool is off the table, even if it's a bad tool," Wood told the PBS=
=20
program "Frontline."
?????The two newcomers sounded more like Massey, the commission's lone=20
in-house critic, than like Hebert, the market purist. In April, when the=20
commission first adopted price limits, Massey pointed out flaws that FERC n=
ow=20
seems poised to address.
?????For one, he said, the limits only applied during power emergencies. "T=
he=20
evidence is persuasive that the problem [of unfair prices] exists 24 hours =
a=20
day, seven days a week," Massey said. "I have no confidence that prices wil=
l=20
be just and reasonable during all hours."
?????Massey's view was voiced by many others as Wood prepared to assume his=

new job on the panel. Wood told The Times in an interview that he heard=20
complaints from Republicans as well as Democrats.
?????Prominent among the Republicans demanding more aggressive action by FE=
RC=20
is Rep. Doug Ose of Sacramento, author of a bill calling for round-the-cloc=

?????Massey was no longer a voice in the wilderness.=20
?????In fact, how he votes and what he says Monday will be closely watched =

Capitol Hill and in California, particularly by Democrats looking for an=20
early signal of the plan's credibility. "His viewpoint is considered very=

highly," said Howard Gantman, a spokesman for Sen. Dianne Feinstein=20
(D-Calif.).
?????As Massey's stock rose, Hebert's portfolio was in growing jeopardy.
?????The Democratic changeover in the Senate improved the prospects of pric=

?????"The debate has changed from doing nothing to mitigation to doing=20

decided to make a bold move. On Monday, he announced that he would convene =

?????"Price mitigation appears to be a way to avoid using the words 'price=

?????FERC sources said the options being discussed include round-the-clock=

?????Air quality officials are concerned that may entice companies to=20

because FERC is scheduled Monday to consider expanding the price limits to=

?????"Nobody else that we can figure out would benefit from this" but power=

?????Ironically, power plants no longer are required to buy and sell credit=

to exceed the standards after Gov. Gray Davis granted them special relief=

earlier this year. Nonetheless, power companies, among others, continue to=
=20
actively trade the credits on the open market. That practice, air quality=

officials say, is driving up the costs of the credits and making it harder=
=20
for other industries to buy them.
?????Because of increased electricity generation, the price of pollution=20
credits traded in the Los Angeles region has risen astronomically in the pa=
st=20
year. Credits that traded for about 25 cents per pound of pollution a few=
=20
years ago now fetch roughly $40 per pound.
?????Mike Scheible, deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources=20
Board, says the federal order also creates incentives for generators to use=

boost the amount they can charge for electricity when rate limits affect=20
pricing.
?????"It's unfair to make California ratepayers pay more for electricity to=

mitigate their emissions. It doesn't pass the straight-face test for being=

?????Since California power prices began to escalate last year, third parti=

?????Carol Coy, deputy executive officer at the AQMD, said one company,=20
Phoenix-based Pinnacle West, reported a $412,500 air emissions credit=20

?????Company spokesman Alan Bunnell said the transaction was perfectly lega=
l=20
and not dissimilar from other trades that routinely occur in the emissions=

trading market.
?????But state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the Senate select=
=20
committee inquiring into the matter, said wholesalers often blame the cost =

the credits in part for the high price of electricity. He said he is=20
concerned that there has been "a laundering of NOx [nitrogen oxide] credits=

that's driving up the cost of both the credits and electricity. Nitrogen=20
oxide is a smog-forming gas caused by fuel combustion.
?????"It actually would be beneficial for energy companies to have those=20

?????Air quality officials aired their objections on Thursday before Dunn's=

Demands by the state's oil refineries for protection from rolling blackouts=

yesterday in releasing a draft decision to grant the exemption.=20
While the recommendation from PUC Commissioner Carl Wood still faces a full=

consider it a promising development in their intense lobbying campaign to=

"This is a very good step," said Scott Folwarkow, spokesman for the Valero=

The industry has repeatedly issued warnings that gasoline prices would soar=

Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Chevron Corp. warned that it would=

Gov. Gray Davis has also urged the PUC to designate petroleum refineries as=

services are needed for public health and safety.=20
A Davis spokesman declined comment on the draft decision last night.=20
Skilled-nursing facilities and water agencies have joined oil refineries in=

By the agency's own standard, at least 40 percent of the electrical load mu=
