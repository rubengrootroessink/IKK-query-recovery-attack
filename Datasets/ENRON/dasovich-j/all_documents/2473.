How  about  if the term  purchase also includes  the purchase of  an option 
to kick in  if a  floor price of  X  occurs 
 in the market?
This  would insulate  customers  from the   worst high  cost  situations  in 
event of  spiking prices  and/or  plunging prices.  You  will  still hit the 
customers  with the spike on the   20 percent  uncovered  by the contract  
but  at least  the  80 percent   wuold  be   better  managed  against  the   
worst  price  swings.  Is  this  what  we  basically  espouse anyway?
