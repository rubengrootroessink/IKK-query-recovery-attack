student services that are normally available during the fall and spring
semesters are not available during the summer.

Students are responsible for the purchase of all required books.  We will
have the books available here in the office, but you will need to pay for
them yourselves by check.

Videotaping:
Videotaping services are not available.

Transportation:
Transportation shuttles are not available during the summer session.  Free
parking is not available during the summer session.  Carpooling is an
option and we'll provide class lists.

Office Hours:
The Evening MBA Office is open 9:00 am - 6:00 pm during the summer months.

The Career Center, Library and Computer Center will be available to you and
we'll update you with the hours in May.

On Monday, April 2, the enrollment forms will be available for the summer
course.
DEADLINE to register:  Friday, April 27.

See you,
TJ
