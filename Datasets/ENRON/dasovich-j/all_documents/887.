Subject: EPSA Meeting

The EPSA meeting in Chicago was successful.  In addition to numerous 
stakeholders, the press was there in full force. It became clear that 
deregulation is not complete, and that the problem is not deregulation -- but 
continuing unnecessary regulation. 
    
Commissioner Massey's speech on why competition is necessary was actually 
quite good.  His message is approximately 90 percent consistent with Enron's 
on the wholesale level (He even called for Federal siting authority.).  He 
sees price caps as a stop gap only and votes for them as a last resort.  
However, he still contradicts himself when he questions the use of single 
price auctions because they do not work as intended; but, he comments that 
PJM is working.  I and others will work with him to make sure he 
understands.  

I spent time with Mike McLaughlin (Director of Corporate Applications) and 
Rob Cupina (Director of Rates, Central).  We spoke about the RTO filings due 
October 15.  I shared my concern that some of the RTO filings may be 
incomplete and asked what actions FERC may take if the filings are 
deficient.  Mike indicated that the RTO filings will be processed by the rate 
offices of the three regions (east, central and west) in Dan Larcamp's group 
(OMTR).  He believes that Order 2000 will become as "voluntary" as Order 436 
was.

If you would like to discuss or have particular questions, please do not 
hesitate to call -- 202.466.9150  JOE
