> Austin, Texas, December 11, 2000..... Green Mountain Energy Company, a
> leading provider of cleaner and renewable electricity, today filed its
> application with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to become a
> Retail Electric Service Provider. Green Mountain Energy Company is the
> first green energy company to apply for a license in Texas. The company
> hopes to provide cleaner and renewable electricity to Texans when the
> market opens to competition in a pilot program this June.
>
> Dennis Kelly, CEO of Green Mountain Energy Company, said,  "We are looking
> forward to bringing Green Mountain Energysm to our home state of Texas.
> Most people don't realize that the generation of electricity is the
> largest cause of industrial air pollution in the U.S. We think that when
> Texans learn of the connection between clean air and clean energy, they
> will look for a simple way to purchase electricity that includes clean
> renewable sources like wind, sun and hydropower."
>
> "Green Mountain Energy Company is pleased to submit our application to the
> PUC. We are looking forward to the prospects of doing business in Texas
> and we are excited to see regulatory rules being put in place to promote
> competition, creativity, and innovation in the marketplace," said Gillan
> Taddune, Texas Regional Manager for Green Mountain Energy Company. "The
> PUC has worked diligently to ensure that customers will reap the benefits
> of competition. That is good not only for companies entering the market
> but for all of Texas."
>
> Green Mountain Energy Company, headquartered in Austin, is currently doing
> business in California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey and plans to expand
> nationwide as deregulation spreads. As a member of the Alliance for Retail
> Markets, Green Mountain Energy Company has been actively working with
> other potential retail electric providers to develop a fair and
> competitive market in Texas.
>
> Since its inception, Green Mountain Energy Company has been committed to
> using the power of customer demand to bring about the development of new
> renewable energy projects. To date, the company has spurred the
> development of five new renewable projects, which represent vital steps to
> begin to reduce air pollution caused by electricity generation. A summary
> of the five projects is as follows:
>
> * April 22, 1999 - A 43kW solar power plant in Conshohocken,
> Pennsylvania is the largest solar generation facility in the state.
> * July 28, 1999 - Three 700kW Wind Turbines in San Gorgonio Pass in
> California, the first new turbines built due to customer demand.
> * October 19, 1999 - A 132kW solar power plant located in Hopland,
> California.
