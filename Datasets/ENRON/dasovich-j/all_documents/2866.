Subject: CSO - Haas MBA Job Fairs Begin in November - Resume Drop
Deadline



The Haas Career Center sponsors several job fairs throughout the year.
Approximately a dozen companies with career and/or summer internship
opportunities
come to the BankAmerica Forum area during the 12:30pm-2:00pm break on the
event day.
All MBA students are welcome to come meet the representatives.

The first two job fairs are scheduled for November 15th and 29th (followed
by fairs in February and March).  While most companies that attend are
high-tech,
a variety of industries are invited. Companies registered so far for the
November
fairs range from start-ups to Cisco and Lucent. Levi Strauss and Acer
Technology Ventures
are planning to come in the Spring. As the participant lists are finalized,
we will send them out to you.

One of the facets of the job fair is that we provide the participating
companies with a
mini-resume book of students planning to attend the event. This is provided
to the companies
in advance so that they may contact the students if they desire.

If you are interested in having your resume included in this book to be sent
to the
participants of the two November job fairs, please email it to
"recruiting@haas", labeled
in the subject section "Nov Job Fair - Career Position" or "Nov Job Fair -
Summer Intern"
as applicable BY WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 1ST AT NOON. We can't guarantee that
resumes received
after the deadline will be included.  A separate book will be generated for
the Spring job
fairs.

Rich Wong
Account Manager, Technology
