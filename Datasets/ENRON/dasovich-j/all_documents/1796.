COMPUTER & ELECTRONICS PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
As technology continues to outpace our satiation with new gadgets and
increasing connectivity leads to increasing amounts of waste material,
producers must continue to refine strategies for effectively taking
responsibility for the entire life-cycle of their products. Challenged to
meet ever-more stringent demands from environmentally concerned
stakeholders, leading thinkers from Xerox, Philips, Mitsubishi Electric and
Pitney Bowes will share their innovative solutions to high tech product
stewardship, providing models which can be used broadly across many
industries.

THE NATURAL STEP
The Natural Step framework is a guide to thinking and acting in harmony wit=
h
the earth's cyclical processes. It provides a pragmatic framework that can
be used to guide social, environmental, and economic actions. It acts like =
a
compass that can point individuals and organizations in the direction they
want to go. Based on systems thinking, it recognizes that what happens in
one part of a system affects every other part, often in unexpected ways.

THE FUTURE OF ENERGY
Fuel cell technology and renewables are being developed to meet consumer
demand for more sustainable energy sources. Which are most valuable and cos=
t
effective? How have these new technologies been implemented in corporate
campuses? What direction will the future of energy take? Hear responses to
these questions from leading scientists and energy managers.

BIOMIMICRY
"Biomimicry", coined by best-selling author, Janine Benyus, is created from
the Greek bios, (life), and mimesis, (imitation). Nature becomes a model fo=
r
designs and processes which can provide for more efficient, adaptable,
creative and resilient enterprise. Nature is viewed as a mentor we can lear=
n
from, and as a measure of our innovations: what works, what is appropriate,
what lasts.

CLIMATE NEUTRALITY
Global climate change has emerged on the environmental radar screen as a
potentially devastating consequence of economic and industrial expansion.
Today there is perhaps greater interest in the inventorying of greenhouse
gas emissions by corporations than there has ever been for a voluntary
environmental initiative. Hear how companies have successfully addressed
this topic with initiatives such as emissions trading, climate neutral
certification and increased resource efficiency.

CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY PRACTICE (C.A.P.)
Today, you serve not just shareholders, but a diverse community of
stakeholders as well. You don't just add value to products. You add values.
You're held responsible not just for your own actions, but for the actions
of your suppliers and your customers, your entire supply chain, anywhere in
the world. The objective of Manning Selvage & Lee's CAP is to protect and
enhance the value of your brand. Not through spin, but substance.

THE FOUR SEASONS OF BUSINESS
Spring is a time of planting many varieties of seeds. Summer's climate
encourages rapid growth of these new organisms. Fall is the season for the
development of a select few of those organisms creating more elaborate
interconnections. And winter is the time for reflection and  creative
destruction and renewal, opening space for a new generation of seedlings. S=
o
go the seasons of nature's ecosystems and the seasons of business. Learn ho=
w
to identify the different seasons of your enterprise and apply the
appropriate management practices for optimal productivity.

SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTING
For the first time ever, assets under management in socially responsible
portfolios have exceeded $2 trillion, linking almost one in every eight
dollars under management in the U.S. with screened portfolios, shareholder
advocacy and community investing. As the financial marketplace expands to
meet SRI potential, traditional social screens are being re-evaluated, new
criteria are being created and the overall screening, activism and
investment impacts of SRI are being examined. Hear examples and approaches
from leading investment managers in the field.

BUSINESS ETHICS
Businesses now face a constellation of interests - market, social, and
environmental - for which the ability to continue adapting and regenerating
has become the central issue. From local communities to global financial
markets, from entire industries to the quality of air and water, executives
are influencing the sustainability of their operating environment. Learn ho=
w
an emerging new ethical code encompassing a company's responsibility for
society and the environment is closely linked with profitability and long
term organizational sustainability.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES
There is no shortage of theoretical solutions to current questions of
environmental and social sustainability for business. But what happens when
organizations move toward implementation? Hear practical case studies and
stories from companies like Hewlett-Packard and Nike about what has worked
and what hasn't when sustainability initiatives are implemented at the
organizational level.

GLOBALIZATION: RECONCILING THE INDUSTRIAL & ECOLOGICAL PATHS
Two simultaneous trends have emerged at the beginning of the 21st century:
the increasing dominance of industrial multinational corporations and the
diminishing state of the global environment. Hear experts from diverse
disciplines converse about opportunities for addressing these dangerous
trends.
