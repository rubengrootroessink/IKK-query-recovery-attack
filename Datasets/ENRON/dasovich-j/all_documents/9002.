Value Investing, Argus Roundtable

The market is under pressure from powerful forces. On the
positive side, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates,
which could stimulate the economy. On the negative side,
the current economic environment remains weak. Is it time
for investors to turn to value stocks?
