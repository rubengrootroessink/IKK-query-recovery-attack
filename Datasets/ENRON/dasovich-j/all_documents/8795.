THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20

Plan to be spontaneous - tomorrow.=20

No Burrito next week.? I'll be in Phoenix with the other WPTF geeks enjoyin=
g=20
perfect weather, a little golf, and party time.? Those of you not attending=
=20
our general meeting in Old Town Scottsdale (shame on you), please hold down=
=20
the fort in California while we are gone.? Be sure to turn out all the ligh=
ts=20
before you go to bed.? At 11:00 p.m., every night, check to see that=20
legislators are still in session debating another mind-numbing emergency=20
session bill. Pray for our Governor, and our State-Appointed ISO Governing=
=20
Board, for they know not what they do. Give an amen to direct access=20
customers, all snug and safe in the utilities' bosom as default customers.=
=20

We really have done a bang up job, here in California.? Who do we get to ba=
il=20
out next?? It is the favorite topic of the day.? A utility bailout, that is=
=20
what today's newly approved legislation, ABX 1-1 is being called.? Society=
=20
makes choices, the utilities do what they are told at a reasonable rate of=
=20
return, and investments that might have been made in new electric generatio=
n=20
facilities were deferred, and deferred.? It's not a utility bailout that we=
=20
are witnessing, but, rather, a California bailout.? We are bailing out our=
=20
own dirty mess for not providing sufficient generating capacity.=20

Have you wondered in these last few weeks why everything went south at the=
=20
same time?? I have thought about this a lot, and have determined there are =
no=20
good explanations.? What are the odds that a capacity shortage, a draught,=
=20
and ultra-high natural gas prices would occur at the same time?? Well, just=
=20
as the utilities like to say with each missed payment, these are forces=20
beyond our control.? Let the waves hit the beach, and what survives the=20
storm, survives.? Everything else must perish.? There is no electric tooth=
=20
fairy to bring back the California PX, or the tens-of-thousands of direct=
=20
access customers returned to default service this week.=20

The Western Governors, the US Congress, and the President's cabinet have al=
l=20
taken photo op shots at the issues.? I don't think those meetings will add=
=20
much to the pile of solutions to our thorny problems.? Who knows, maybe the=
=20
WSCC will get a mandated price cap.? Would we endorse a price cap, even at=
=20
$2,500? I don't know.? Some of you might support that, whereas others would=
=20
stay the course.? No price caps.? Of course, I don't understand how a price=
=20
cap of $1,000, say, the same cap used in other regions of the country, can=
=20
help us in the West.? The economic impact we have witnessed has come about=
=20
from prices well below $1,000/MWH.=20

The People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ Stop the Bleeding Bill=20

ABX 1-1 was signed into law today.? It is the most curious piece of=20
legislation.? Legislate in haste, and repent in leisure.? The Governor=20
claimed in his press release, "This measure offers our best hope of avoidin=
g=20
electricity rate increases in future years. We will now put together a=20
portfolio of low-cost contracts. With new contracts for alternative and=20
renewable energy sources, it is my hope and expectation that we can live=20
within the existing rate structure."? I have read the bill several times, a=
nd=20
I don't see how it is even remotely possible to avoid electricity rate=20
increases.? Someday, I want to be Governor.? Then, I will have the freedom =
to=20
make up the truth as I go along, and voters in the State will blindly belie=
ve=20
me.? That's the job I want.=20

Here is the gist of the bill.? First, that DWR will enter into long term=20
contracts to cover PG&E's and SCE's net short position.? The first round of=
=20
bids yielded less than 2.500 MW of power.? Hardly enough, by a factor of=20
four, I reckon, to cover the net short positions of both utilities..? Next,=
=20
the power delivered by those contracts will be delivered to California's en=
d=20
use customers utilizing the poles and wires of the utility distribution=20
companies (UDC). Each utility's? cost for the delivered power (own=20
generation, QFs, bilateral deals, DWR purchases, and ancillary services) in=
=20
excess of the generation component of the UDC's rate will be called the=20
California Procurement Adjustment.? The PUC has the authority to pass on so=
me=20
or all of the California Procurement Adjustment to customers for the energy=
=20
consumed in excess of 130% of customers' baseline quantity.=20

That sounds to me like a rate increase.? The first block of monthly=20
consumption, and 30% above that will not be charged for the new Adjustment.=
?=20
All monthly consumption above that level will get a pro rata share of the=
=20
Adjustment.? The DWR purchases will be backed by state-issued bonds, the=20
maximum of which can not be "an aggregate amount greater than the amount=20
calculated by multiplying by a factor of four the annual revenues generated=
=20
by the California Procurement Adjustment, as determined by the [PUC] pursua=
nt=20
to Section 360.5."? The media was reporting a $10 billion bond bailout for=
=20
the utilities, but I don't see how they derived that number.=20

Currently, PG&E and SCE are accumulating a bill for their net short positio=
n=20
of $1.2 billion per month.? The average system load is 30,000 to 33,000 MWs=
,=20
and the average purchase price for the spot energy being purchased is aroun=
d=20
40?/kWh.? Assuming that long-term contracts would price the power at, say, =
8?
/kWh, and at least half the net short position could be covered utilizing=
=20
long-term contracts, the monthly cost for the net short position would be=
=20
around $720 million, and the annual figure would be $8.6 billion.? Let's=20
allocate the annual cost of $8.6 billion over the energy consumed above the=
=20
"baseline" quantity.? I have heard that 78% of the energy consumed by=20
customers of the three IOUs is above the baseline quantity.? We'll assume=
=20
that 66%, or 2/3, of the energy consumed is above 130% of the baseline=20
consumption level.? The annual energy delivered by the ISO is roughly 210=
=20
TWh, and, therefore, 2/3 of that is 140 TWh.? The average cost per=20
"applicable" kWh of uplift in a customer's bill would be 6.1?/kWh, thereby=
=20
roughly doubling the current generation component of the current frozen=20
rates.=20

Of course, the additional revenue collection isn't expected to keep up with=
=20
the cost of the net short position. Electricity costs will fall off as gas=
=20
prices ease, and more supply comes on line.? However, it is breathtaking to=
=20
observe that for the kWh that are bearing the uplift, the ?/kWh rate increa=
se=20
for residential customers is about 50%, and blended with the 130% of baseli=
ne=20
energy, the rate increase is about 35%.? That's a lot of math to get to the=
=20
same percent increase the utilities were claiming they needed to satisfy th=
e=20
revenue shortfall!? A thirty- percent increase in my PG&E electric bill wou=
ld=20
add between $50 to $80 to the monthly tab.? I am beginning to wonder why we=
=20
Californians are making such a fuss.? Falling interest rates on my=20
variable-rate home mortgage will probably boost my after-tax income $300 to=
=20
$400 per month. Hell, I gladly would pay a higher electric bill plus an=20
additional $5 to $8 per month to assist those consumers on fixed income or=
=20
otherwise unable to absorb the cost increase.=20

Are we properly focused on the right problem?=20

Another flea on this legislation is the suspension of new direct access=20
customers during the time that DWR is procuring energy.? The bill states, "=
 =01(=20
the right of retail end use customers =01( to acquire service from other=20
providers shall be suspended until the department no longer supplies power=
=20
hereunder."? Voila.? Not only do we get a rate increase, but our ability to=
=20
choose an alternative energy supplier is hereby waived.? I would think the=
=20
average Californian would be outraged by that dictate.? Of course, most=20
Californians didn't know that they had a choice.? Therefore, the legislatio=
n=20
made a grand leap forward by lowering our opportunity set to be in line wit=
h?=20
expectations.=20

I wonder what the Legislature will do next week?=20

The People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ They Wrote to Me=20

On Monday, the LA Times published my first Op Ed.? I attempted in that piec=
e=20
to compare our role as electricity marketers and producers to lending=20
institutions that offer home-loan mortgages in various risk-adjusted=20
instruments - variable-rate loans, fixed rate loans, etc.? The comparison i=
s=20
less accurate than apt.? However, I think we, as an industry, get too focus=
ed=20
on things about which the public cares little.? Does the public need to=20
understand how banks arbitrage loans in order for a consumer to obtain a ho=
me=20
loan?? Does the public need to understand the workings of the internal=20
combustion engine to drive a car? So, I tried my level best to describe how=

the consumer should view our side of the demand-supply interaction.=20

I included in the article my e-mail address.? I wanted to get a feel for th=
e=20
thoughts of people who would make the effort to write.? Even though there=
=20
were only a handful of responses, I was pretty much taken aback by the tone=

of the letters.? The edge in their language was sharp.? They generally=20
distrust our industry, sometimes confusing us with utilities.? I would=20
characterize their thinking as "first assume you suppliers and marketers ar=

RC=20

I attended the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) annual meeting in=
=20
Palm Desert this week.? It was a really nice event, and the speakers were=
=20
excellent.? Among the guests was former FERC Chairman, Jim Hoecker.? I=20
chatted with him about our dilemma in California regarding the=20
State-appointed ISO Governing Board, and he admitted that we must do all we=
=20
can to give the FERC Staff more spine.? I was thinking about a steel rod, a=
nd=20
the FERC staff in a compromising position, but more on that later.=20

I asked Citizen Jim what he was going to do for a living, now that he is ri=

d=20

Mr. Lockyer, California's Attorney General, who did not attend the EPSA=20
conference, filed in our case against FERC to appear as Amicus Curiae (I am=
=20
not a Latin scholar, but that means Strange Friend) before the DC Circuit=

Court of Appeals. For cases involving high-voltage electricity, I think the=

before the Court.? The ordeal took 30 minutes, and the judges asked pretty=

Letters=20
?@@@ A Few Thoughts by George Sladoje=20

I asked California PX CEO George Sladoje to write a letter to the Burrito=

expressing his thoughts at this difficult time.? Here is what George wrote.=

"The final indignity was our attempt to fight the arbitrary, discriminatory=

Jimmy Thomas, who is recently retired from Dynegy=20
? "Although I did not work with Kent closely, the few personal encounters=

"Kent will be missed, but I know his smile is still infecting all around=20
him..........in an eternal way now."


From SCUG buddy, and Dynegy friend Jolly Hayden.=20
? ".....? I have so many good memories of Kent, his sense of humor, his wit=
,?=20
and his unbelievable intelligence.? I learned so much from him.? He kept me=

=20
single topic and often did via phone calls and email.? His passion was=20
phenomenal, he loved this stuff.? It was a privilege and honor to have know=
n=20
Kent these last few years."


From Max Bulk of the California PX=20
? "I was shocked to read about Kent.? While I didn't know him as well as yo=
u,=20
I highly respected him and thoroughly enjoyed his company.? His ability to=
=20
inject humor into dry and often confrontation situations was wonderful.? Hi=
s=20
passing is truly our loss.=20

"One memory to share: It was one of the CMR meetings, towards the end of th=
e=20
process I think, where the ISO was introducing subjects willy-nilly with=20
almost no forethought.? Kent had been particularly vocal in his condemnatio=
n=20
of the more ridiculous proposals and when he took the mike ISO staff visibl=
y=20
winced.? Kent, never losing his smile, tore into Kellan about the rapid=20
timeline and apparent disorganization.? As he neared his crescendo, he said=

From Dynegy's Dave Francis=20
? "I have often commented that this business is still about people.? While=
=20
our coworkers may come and go, the bonds of friendship carry over time and=

Greg Blue, former Chair of WPTF wrote the following.=20
? "One of the most cherished moment I had with Kent was in one of his first=
=20
weeks of employment at Dynegy he was able to join us at a Dynegy sponsored=
=20
golf tournament.? Coming from the CPUC they did not get to participate in=

lessons.=20

?"Kent also had one thing that you cannot teach.....enthusiasm!"


Written by Jeff Roarke of Mirant (formerly Southern Energy)=20
? "You know, given everything that has been going on in the power markets,=
=20
this just seems to be part of it all.? One more thing.? Kent was always a=
=20
huge presence at the meetings that I went to.? But as we know, those=20
stakeholder meetings are gone forever, too.??? Combine it with the death of=
=20
the PX, and it is a very sobering set of circumstances."


Finally, Dennis Flaherty, formerly of Dynegy, and now with Cynergy, wrote a=
=20
long letter, of which a part I have included here.=20
? "Over a couple of beers in the Sacramento Hyatt bar one evening, [Kent] a=
nd=20
I philosophized on life:? [His] conclusion was that we should not be sadden=

by our departure from this world, but instead, we should embrace the=20
departure thinking that the person isn=01,t gone but instead the person=01,=

=20
departed us I ask all whom you left in this world to remember you, our dear=

?A final note for Burrito readers.? I will be asking the WPTF Board of=20
Directors to honor Kent by naming an award in his name. The Kent Wheatland=
=20
Award will be given to special people in our industry who share the passion=

Kent had for doing the right thing, and persisting under any set of=20
circumstances, both favorable or unfavorable.? I hope that Gregg Wheatland,=
