UPDATE FROM EBS OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

Since its inception just two years ago, Enron Broadband Services has made=
=20
significant progress toward achieving our ambitious goals of being the=20
leading=20
provider of premium broadband content and the largest buyer and seller of=
=20
bandwidth on a global basis.  We are extremely proud of the company=01,s=20
accomplishments and equally optimistic about the future of EBS.

The market for bandwidth intermediation and risk management is developing=
=20
more quickly than anticipated =01) faster than the markets for natural gas =
or=20
even=20
electricity had developed.  Global Trading and Risk Management has already=
=20
executed more than 600 transactions this year, far exceeding the 321 total=
=20
transactions executed in 2000. The Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), with
its first-of-a-kind pooling point infrastructure, is in place to provide th=
e=20
physical=20
backbone and switching platform to support EBS=01, emerging bandwidth and=
=20
related trading operations.

Likewise, EBS has developed a superior technical and commercial platform to=
=20
digitally deliver entertainment on-demand.  While we have terminated our=20
relationship with Blockbuster because of their inability to secure content,=
=20
we=20
remain confident that EBS will be successful in independently acquiring=20
content=20
commitments and developing distribution partnerships for this exciting new=
=20
business.

EBS will continue to evolve as we build upon our presence in the bandwidth =
and
network services market.  While the market for broadband services in the U.=
S.=20
and globally has undergone significant change in recent months, the demand=
=20
for=20
broadband services continues to grow dramatically and EBS has the skills an=
d=20
strategy required to be successful long term.

To better focus our efforts and respond to the market, we have made some=20
organizational changes to enable us to effectively execute our strategy and=
=20
efficiently grow EBS.  These changes are outlined below and a current=20
organizational chart is attached.

David Cox, formerly Managing Director of Content Origination, has been name=
d=20
Chief Commercial Officer, reporting to the EBS office of the chair.  This n=

=20
EBS=20
commercial teams.

Digital Content Services, formerly Content Origination, is now led by Frank=
=20
Bay=20
with Rich DiMichele and Ed Smida.  Rich will focus on the development of th=
e=20
content risk management business.

Stewart Seeligson is now leading an expanded Wholesale Origination unit=20
combining=20
media transport opportunities that Stewart has been developing in the=20
broadcast=20
industry and opportunities that Ted Seitz has been pursuing with traditiona=
l=20
carriers,=20
ISPs, and network service providers.  This new origination team will focus =
on=20
executing highly structured transactions with significant value in the=20
wholesale market.

John Echols now leads the Enterprise Origination unit with Jim Crowder, Mat=
t=20
Harris,=20
and Brad Nebergall.  Bryan Burnett also has joined the Enterprise team from=
=20
Enron=20
North America=01,s Industrial Markets group.  John=01,s group will focus on=
=20
intermediation=20
opportunities with technology, financial, and corporate customers.

Dale Surbey has joined EBS from Enron North America to lead the Structuring=
=20
group. =20
Brad Richter will move to Jeff Donahue=01,s Corporate Development team to p=
ursue=20
M&A and large, structured transaction opportunities.

Joe Edwards is leading the newly formed North American middle markets group=

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES
Please welcome the following new employees to EBS:

Starcom voices interest, though industry remains skeptical=20
Enron Media Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with=
=20
its plans to=20
create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space.

In a recent letter to Starcom's clients, CEO Renetta McCann said the=20
Chicago-based media=20
company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal.

"Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry, we=
=20
find Enron's plan=20
intriguing," McCann wrote. "Clearly, Enron proposes breaking the rules of h=
ow=20
media can be=20
bought and sold."

Last year, Enron Corp., the $30 billion financial risk management company=
=20
previously associated=20
with the energy industry, created EMS to market "price-risk management" pla=
ns=20
to advertisers=20
and media-service companies. In addition, Houston-based Enron seeks to=20
execute $1 billion in media=20
buys by year's end, though a representative declined to release information=
=20
about any possible deals.

In this volatile economy, marketers and media agencies could use Enron's=20
ability to hedge the risk=20
of media costs as far as five years ahead, said Edward Ondarza, a vp for EM=
S.=20

Up to this point, the only way marketers could cushion risk is by "buying=
=20
forward" via the upfront,=20
he added. "We want to create a year-round upfront by developing a media=20
exchange [between=20
advertisers, media agencies and networks]," he said.

Despite Enron's pitch, Starcom has received little feedback to the letter=
=20
from its clients, said Kevin=20
Gallagher, vp and director of local investments for Starcom, which claims=
=20
$4.3 billion in billings=20
and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft. "We're always open to new=
=20
ways of doing=20
business, and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of what's going on," h=
e=20
said. "But we are=20
not engaged in any business with Enron. It was and remains merely=20
exploratory."

Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enron's business model, because =
of=20
possible legal issues=20
and the novelty of the concept. But they acknowledge that eventually Enron'=
s=20
approach will become=20
commonplace.

"In theory it's great, but the practice is more difficult," said Jon Mandel=
,=20
MediaCom chief negotiating=20
officer. "There are some big issues that need to be worked out."

In the first quarter, Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the=
=20
amount of bandwidth than it had in=20
the previous quarter, the unit of energy giant Enron Corp. announced=20
Tuesday. =20

The subsidiary showed a loss of $35-million in the quarter on revenues of=
=20
$83-million, the results being=20
attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points.

President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed 580=20
transactions in the quarter, more than=20
double the level of the previous quarter. More impressive was the seven-fol=
d=20
increase in transacted bandwidth=20
this quarter: 43,400 Terabytes versus 6,005 Terabytes in the fourth quarter=
. =20
Enron is =01&making excellent=20
progress in creating a commodity market,=018 Skilling said. =20

Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter, for a total of=
=20
120.  Of that number 70%=20
of the customers are carriers or network service providers, a spokeswoman=
=20
told BMR, adding that half of=20
the deals done in the quarter were with that group.



Bandwidth intermediation/trading was the other key driver, with 580=20
transactions posted during the=20
quarter, a significant ramp-up from 232 reported 4Q:00 and 320 for all of=
=20
2000. In our view, we are=20
way past the question =01&Can bandwidth be commoditized?=018 and are enteri=
ng the=20
period of rapid=20
growth in commodity volumes which precedes the all-important emergence of=
=20
profitability.  In the=20
energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas and power in both the=20
United States and=20
Europe, the commodity volume growth phase lasted 1-3 years before=20
profitability emerged. We=20
see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market, which from a commodity=20
perspective =01&looks,=20
acts and feels=018 like electricity and natural gas, to perform any differe=
ntly=20
from these commodities.=20
We are entering Year 2 of the period of rapid volume growth. The next=20
catalyst in our view, will=20
be for Enron to announce a reasonably =01&date certain=018 for profitabilit=
y, much=20
in the same manner=20
as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago. We think that date=
=20
could be late 2002=20
or early 2003.

Excerpts:

...Enron's vice president and broadband trader, Paul Racicot, says Enron=20
alone could enter into 2,000=20
trades this year, but some analysts don't expect volumes to reach much more=
=20
than that in the entire market.=20
And while liquidity on such major routes as Los Angeles/New York and New=20
York/Miami will improve=20
substantially, 2001 will likely be remembered as the year progress was made=
=20
on issues whose resolution=20
was critical to the long-term health of the market.

...Probably the best-known proposal to promote network connectivity in the=
=20
context of the emerging=20

e=20
pooling points, or switching and=20

become so controversial that Enron seems almost apologetic about its plans =
to=20
add 14 new points this year.

says Paul Racicot, vice=20
president of bandwidth trading at Enron. =01&But we'll trade anywhere, thou=

he added.

Racicot is sensitive to criticism that behind Enron's pooling points is an=
=20
effort to control the broadband=20
market information flow.  =01&Enron's goal is to promote connectivity, not =
to=20
use pooling points as means=20
of gaining access to information about trading flows,=018 he says. =01&The =

market liquidity for broadband trading. The importance of this cannot be=20
overstated. A very high degree of=20
connectivity will be needed for a deep and liquid broadband-trading market =
to=20

According to Racicot, connectivity will develop rapidly this year =01* spur=

not just by Enron, but also by
third-party developers.
