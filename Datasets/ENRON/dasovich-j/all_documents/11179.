SEA POWER & ASSOCIATES WIN HAAS SOCIAL VENTURE COMPETITION  Sea Power &=20
Associates, which converts ocean wave energy into electricity, emerged as t=
he=20
grand-prize winner of the second annual Haas Social Venture Competition on=
=20
Saturday, April 14. The nationwide competition is organized entirely by Haa=
s=20
MBA students.

To compete successfully, participating teams had to demonstrate sustainable=
=20
profit potential, have a quantifiable social or environmental bottom line=
=20
incorporated into its mission, and show a demonstrably greater impact of it=
s=20
social return on investment (SROI) than existing firms in the industry.=20

Sea Power & Associates, which won the $10,000 first prize, aims to provide=
=20
renewable energy for the emerging economies of the island communities in th=
e=20
Pacific as well as Hawaii, thus offering a cost-competitive non-polluting=
=20
alternative to diesel generation.=20

"Electricity generated from ocean wave energy will reduce the greenhouse ga=
s=20
emissions that contribute to global warming," said Mirko Previsic, CEO of S=
ea=20
Power & Associates, whose patented system consists of a buoy driven by the=
=20
up-and-down motion of the waves, which converts the ocean wave energy into=
=20
electricity. "For each yard of coastline in Northern California we could=20
power 20 American homes."

Aprotea Biochips, which has developed technology to provide a rapid and=20
easy-to-use protein measurement system to enhance drug discovery, won a=20
$2,000 prize for best management team. The team includes individuals with=
=20
extensive experience in business, law, biology, biochemistry, and=20
engineering, and has the winning combination of deep domain experience,=20
passion for the business, and the wherewithal to execute.=20

Prisma Microfinance, Inc., garnered a $2,000 prize for best SROI analysis.=
=20
The venture provides micro loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world.=
=20
Its business plan quantified a positive social impact in terms of job=20
creation, income generation, and community development.

In addition to the cash prizes, all three winners will have their plans=20
circulated in the Investors' Circle, a national network of 150 social=20
investors. Business schools represented on this year's winning teams includ=
e=20
Haas, University of Washington, and Thunderbird.

"The competition is a lens that broadens our view of the bottom line," said=
=20
Jerome Engel, executive director of the Haas School's Lester Center for=20
Entrepreneurship & Innovation, who advised the organizing committee of Haas=
=20
MBA students. "It includes social and environmental values as well as=20
shareholder value."

In its second year, the competition attracted 33 participating teams from 1=
5=20
business schools, including Cornell, Columbia, Kellogg, Michigan, Stanford,=
=20
and Yale for its nationwide contest of social ventures. All teams were judg=
ed=20
by a group of 17 leading social venture investors, venture capitalists, and=
=20
social venture practitioners.

Several participants in last year's competition have made great strides=20
toward becoming sustainable businesses. Ripple Effects and Xtracycle, who=
=20
shared last year's second prize, are in business. Ripple Effects develops=
=20
award-winning learning software, while Xtracycle sells super-cargo size=20
sport-utility bicycles.

 WILLIAM HAMBRECHT TO RECEIVE LESTER CENTER LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD=20
William Hambrecht, the legendary investment banker who brought us Apple=20
Computer, Genentech, and the OpenIPO, is the 2001 recipient of the Lester=
=20
Center Lifetime Achievement Award at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.=
=20

The award will be presented by the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship &=20
Innovation at the UC Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum on Thursday, April 26, in=
=20
Arthur Andersen Auditorium.

Hambrecht is best known as the co-founder of the firm Hambrecht & Quist who=
se=20
west-coast style investment banking helped launch some of Silicon Valley's=
=20
greatest success stories. In 1981, the firm managed the initial public=20
offerings of Apple, Genentech, and People Express. By 1997, Hambrecht & Qui=
st=20
had worked with over 700 companies, including Adobe Systems, Advanced Fiber=
=20
Communications, Apollo Computer, Convergent Technologies, Evans & Sutherlan=
d,=20
Read-Rite, Sybase, VLSI Technologies, and Xilinx.?=20

In 1996, Hambrecht & Quist managed the IPO of Boston Beer, maker of Samuel=
=20
Adams Boston Lager, that inspired Hambrecht to brainstorm the possibility o=
f=20
IPOs that are open to the public. Boston Beer CEO Jim Koch insisted on maki=
ng=20
25 percent of the IPO shares available to his market, the people who drank=
=20
his beer. The idea meant taking a significant portion of the shares away fr=
om=20
institutional investors, the industry's mainstay. In addition, opening the=
=20
IPO to individuals required shipping six-packs to the stores with little=20
forms attached that allowed consumers to make a bid to buy a piece of Bosto=
n=20
Beer.

However, the new approach demonstrated its business potential when the $10=
=20
million IPO in 1996 was oversubscribed by $30 million - all from individual=
=20
investors. The question was how to streamline the process. Answer: the=20
Internet.

In 1997, Bill Hambrecht decided to start a new firm WR Hambrecht + Co. that=
=20
uses the Internet to create an open system for all investors -- from=20
individual consumers to the largest institutional investors -- to have equa=
l=20
opportunities to make bids for IPO stocks, thus the name OpenIPO. OpenIPOs=
=20
are not only open to small investors but are built on a Dutch auction model=
=20
where the investors, not the investment bank, set the price.=20

WR Hambrecht + Co.'s most recent IPO included Peet's Coffee and Tea, a smal=
l=20
Berkeley coffeehouse. Peet's was the 5th Internet-based public stock offeri=
ng=20
led by WR Hambrecht & Co. in the past 3 years.

In awarding the Lifetime Achievement Award, the Lester Center for=20
Entrepreneurship and Innovation is able to bring outstanding innovators and=
=20
entrepreneurs to the Berkeley campus. The Lester Center hopes that this kin=
d=20
of interaction among academics, students, and practitioners will foster=20
entrepreneurial success for individuals and the community as a whole.

Previous winners of the Lester Center Lifetime Achievement Award include: =

+Arthur Rock, the original venture capitalist behind Silicon Valley's very=

 SIX TEAMS ADVANCE TO FINAL ROUND OF UC BERKELEY BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION =
=20
The Haas School of Business today announced the selection of six teams to=
=20
compete in the final round of the UC Berkeley Business Plan Competition. Th=
e=20
finalist teams have developed ideas ranging from biotech to medical devices=
=20
to software and wireless technology. They will compete for more than? $90,0=
00=20
in cash and prizes, including a $50,000 first prize.

Over 65 venture capitalists, angel investors, and successful entrepreneurs=
=20
served as judges and evaluated the submissions. Another 26 entrepreneurs,=
=20
professors, and other professionals served as mentors to the teams that=20
qualified for the first round and helped the teams develop their plans.

By bringing ventures led by UC Berkeley students and alumni in touch with=
=20
Silicon Valley's community of entrepreneurs, VCs, and technology companies,=
=20
the competition serves as a springboard for the university's most innovativ=
e=20
ideas and technologies.

This year's team are already well on their way to success. Aprotea has=20
already won a prize for best management team in the Haas Social Venture=20
Business Plan Competition. Two more teams also made the MBA Jungle contest=
=20
finals, one as an alternate and one as a competitor. Finally, one team, whi=

has asked to remain anonymous, was forced to drop out of the contest after=
=20
the Executive Summary round after receiving substantial funding for its pla=
n.

Access to top venture capitalists and business leaders through the=20
competition may result in additional financing; to date, seven of last year=
's=20
teams have secured more than $95 million in funding.

The competition will culminate on Wednesday, April 25, 2001, with a final=

public presentation of pitches from the six finalists and the announcement =

the first, second, and third place winners, as well as the People's Choice=

 GOLDMAN SACHS ECONOMIST ON THE BRAVE NEW BUSINESS CYCLE: WHERE IS THE U.S.=
=20
ECONOMY HEADING?  William Dudley, managing director of Economic Research at=
=20
Goldman Sachs and one of the nation's leading economic forecasters, will=20
speak at Haas on Tuesday, April 24, from 5:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in Cheit=20
Hall, room C230.=20

This event is free and open to the entire UC Berkeley community. Seating is=
=20
first-come, first-served.=20

In his talk, Dudley will discuss the outlook for the U.S. and global=20
economies and offer his assessment of whether the U.S. economy is likely to=
=20
fall into recession now that the investment boom has gone bust.=20

"Bill Dudley is an extraordinarily perceptive analyst of the global economi=
c=20
scene," says Professor Janet Yellen who will host the lecture. "He was one =
of=20
the first forecasters to see that structural changes associated with the ne=
w=20
economy had altered the nature of the business cycle.? He also recognized=
=20
that the U.S. investment boom could go bust--that the 'Brave New Business=
=20
Cycle' could have a dark side."

Director of the U.S. Economic Research Group at Goldman, Sachs & Co. since=
=20
October 1995, Dudley was named Managing Director in 1996.? He is responsibl=
e=20
for the economic and interest rate forecasts for the US and also oversees t=
he=20
Canadian economic research effort.? He has briefed the Federal Reserve Boar=
d=20
on several occasions and is a member of the technical consultants board to=
=20
the Congressional Budget Office.

Dudley has frequently appeared on television programs such as CNN and the=
=20
Nightly Business Report (PBS) and is often quoted in business periodicals=
=20
such as the Economist, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The=20
Washington Post, and the Financial Times. Dudley received his Ph.D. from th=
e=20
University of California, Berkeley in 1982.

professional accomplishments at the upcoming annual faculty debate.=20

Come to the Arthur Andersen Auditorium at 4:00 p.m. on Friday, April 27, an=
d=20
bear witness to the carnage as Rose and Lyons debate, "Currency Unions in t=
he=20
new Millennium: After Europe, are Asia and Latin America next? Should they=
=20
be?" Past debates have had Rose and Lyons pounding on one another,=20
mercilessly. The contenders will be controlled only by the verbal barbs of=
=20
the moderator, Prof. Janet Yellen.=20

In preparation of the fierce debate, the contenders submitted the following=
=20
statements.  ?"Some people believe that the earth is flat. Others believe=
=20
that there is no link between smoking and lung cancer," says Rose, who is=
=20
arguing in favor, "I'm not suggesting that Professor Lyons is an ivory-towe=
r=20
theorist who's out of contact with reality ... but then again I'm not=20
suggesting that he isn't."

To this, Prof. Lyons countered: "Professor Rose has really lost his mooring=
s=20
on this one. It's just impossible to follow his logic on the topic. Fuzzy=
=20
thinking. Very fuzzy." He added, "I'm not suggesting that Professor Rose's=
=20
thinking is always fuzzy. Occasionally a clear-minded thought does arise.=
=20
This is not one of those occasions."
