Groovin' Peer-to-Peer
They may not be able to tell you what it is, exactly, but they agree it's
going to be really big.
The man who invented Lotus Notes is back in the news after three years in
deep stealth mode with his new company, Groove Networks. Groove will be
taking the wraps off today at Internet World, and outlets ran stories about
Ray Ozzie's new thing. It's a platform for peer-to-peer communications - so
the reporters describing it sounded collectively like the blind men with the
elephant. Among the sound bites they collected from analysts: "Ray Ozzie is
Napsterizing Notes" (Michael Schrage in the New York Times); "This could be
the next killer application for the Internet" (Esther Dyson in the Wall
Street Journal); "Has the potential of being the AOL instant messaging of
the business community" (David Marshak in the Boston Globe).
Most outlets waited until today to run their Groove stories, but Techweb
posted yesterday noon. Consequently their story was filled out with quotes
from patent filings and the comments of anonymous sources, one of whom spoke
"before he realized his nondisclosure agreement had not expired." Reporter
Barbara Darrow got on-the-record comments from analyst Judith Hurwitz and
from Dan Bricklin, one of the fathers of the spreadsheet (and Ozzie's former
boss).
Groove's software will be available for free download starting today, and
most of the coverage centered on the give-it-away business model.  The Wall
Street Journal's William M. Bulkeley alone detailed the version Groove plans
to sell to businesses. The Globe's Hiawatha Bray quoted an Aberdeen Group
analyst thus: "It's a successful technology in my estimation, but the
business model is a little less secure."
