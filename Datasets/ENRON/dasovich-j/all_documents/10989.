4. Work or Stay Home? The New Parents' Dilemma
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Should you stay home with a young child or return to the 
workforce? Clearly it's a personal choice. However, the 
financial realities of working vs. staying home - in terms of 
taxes, childcare expenses, retirement and college savings, and 
other criteria - are big factors. Our contributor, a new parent
who has worked through these decisions with her husband, 
analyzes the economics of working vs. staying at home.

5. Hot Tips vs. Homework
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
It's happened to all of us: the "hot tip" on a stock that 
sounds like a can't-miss buy. Or is it? Well, no matter how 
"hot" that tip seems to be, you have to do your homework before
taking action. This article suggests how to keep tips, rumors 
and market gossip in context, and how to conduct your own 
fact-based research on the Web, including the vast resources at
schwab.com.

6. Buying a Home? What a Difference a Year Makes!
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Whether you're purchasing a first home or trading up from an 
existing residence, you may find pleasant surprises in the 
mortgage market, according to Joe Kennedy, president of E-Loan. 
Mortgage rates have declined to two-year lows, helping home 
shoppers borrow more than they could just a year ago, says 
Kennedy. Are you curious to know how much home you can afford? 
Visit the Schwab Mortgage CenterTM, provided by E-Loan or click
here to utilize E-Loan's powerful mortgage affordability tool.
