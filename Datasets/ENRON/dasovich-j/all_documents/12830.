Calif Controller:State Behind On Long Term Contract Buys  ????
Updated: Monday, May 21, 2001 04:41 PM?ET ?????=20
?
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California State Controller Kathleen Connell said=
=20
Monday that she anticipates the state will need to issue $4 billion in=20
revenue anticipation notes in February, because a $13.4 billion revenue bon=
d=20
issue in mid-August will not be enough to cover power purchases.=20

The state is likely to spend more on spot market purchases than the=20
administration has anticipated because the price of summer power will be=20
higher than expected and because the state has secured fewer long-term=20
contracts than expected, she said.=20
? ????
"The administration projected we'd spend $925 million for long-term contrac=
ts=20
in the first six months (of 2001). We've now spent only $36.4 million on=20
long-term contracts of a total $5.1 billion spent on energy purchases - les=
s=20
than 1%," Connell said.=20

It is unlikely that an additional $890 million in long-term contracts will=
=20
flow through her office in the next five weeks, Connell said.=20


Gov. Gray Davis' energy plan assumes that 32% of all power needs through 20=
01=20
will be met through long-term contracts, with 40% met by long-term power in=
=20
the summer months, Connell said.=20

However, the state has not secured as many long-term contracts "as we would=
=20
hope to see," and many of the contracts cover periods before July 1 or afte=
r=20
Sept. 30, Connell said.=20

Connell said she had received 25 contracts with 17 generators thus far.=20

One of Davis' energy aides said that there were seven more contracts for=20
summer reliability and peaking power on their way to the controller's offic=
e.=20

He added that the controller was basing her evaluation on somewhat old=20
information, as there is a time delay between when deals are done and when=
=20
the controller is notified.=20

"I don't doubt the controller is accurate in what she is seeing, but the=20
billing is done in arrears," Davis energy aide Joseph Fichera said on a=20
conference call. "For example, April contracts are billed by May 20."=20

The controller said her analysis reflects checks written as of May 17.=20

A $5 billion rate increase approved last week for utilities may not provide=
=20
adequate revenue to the CDWR, Connell said.=20

"We may be short as much as $1.7 billion in revenues to cover the projected=
=20
expenses of the CDWR," Connell said.=20

The state is now dipping below its cash flow into borrowable resources and=
=20
will exhaust those resources by the end of August, making a timely revenue=
=20
bond issue crucial, Connell said.=20

Connell added that she will hold hearings in June to determine whether=20
generating plants formerly owned by utilities are being assessed for proper=
ty=20
taxes at an appropriate level.=20

"Given (the generators') record profits, we will review whether there needs=
=20
to be an additional assessment," Connell said.=20
