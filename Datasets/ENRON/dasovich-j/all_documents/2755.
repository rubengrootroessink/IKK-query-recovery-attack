Sorry to bother you all again, but I have received limited response to my
inquiry for course recommendations for your fellow evening students.  I was
hoping to include these recommendations in a Student Advisory Committee
Newsletter I was hoping to distribute before registration for next semester
begins.  Thus, if you have any recommendations, please take just a few
moments to send me an e-mail with your thoughts.

Thanks,
Mike Plumb
SAC Chair
