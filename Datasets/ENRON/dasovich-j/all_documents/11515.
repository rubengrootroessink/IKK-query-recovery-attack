Unless anyone objects- how about my office at 12 noon.  Address in the
signature
below.  I'll be in the conference room (Presido) by the receptionist.  Bring
some food- we have a free soda dispenser so drinks are on me.

I can meet anytime, anywhere tomorrow ALTHOUGH Zoe will be with me when we
meet.  I hope that won't be a problem.  I am heading off to school soon so
just let me know the final decision and I'll be there.  Mark - I'll send
revised slides tonight after class.

Greetings all:
I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to
all this evening.  I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.  Apologies.
But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to
ensure that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what
slides they're responsible for presenting, etc.  What about lunch tomorrow
(we're all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?  Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff

I do not have everything yet.  Still need info from Anil and Jeff with all
the
numbers.  Carolyn, would you mind condensing into 2 slides a summary of the
acquisition events.  Similar to all the slides you have already done but
just
condensed.  I think that would be it.

Wednesday morning works for me.  I'm going to a Giants game in the evening.

Early Wed works for me. Wed night is fine too.
Also, I'll be sending Mark the slide on comps
later today.
