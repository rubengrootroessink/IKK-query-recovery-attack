Jeff, thanks for the response.  Consider yourself a member of Project 
Boomerang.  I suggest that we try to talk sometime Monday and I can fill in 
some of the detail on this effort.  I did hear that the lawsuit was filed 
under Section 5 of AB1890.  Does that make any sense to you ?  I will call 
you Monday morning to discuss the project and the role that you can play to 
help the effort.

Thanks


Frank

Frank:

Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  We're finalizing a deal to (among 
other things) have Socalgas unbundle its in-state transport, storage and 
balancing, sell off the transport and storage rights in an open season and 
create a secondary market for each.  They will also permit trading of 
imbalances on their system.  The deal's getting finalized today.    (Paul, 
your pal Joe Karp has joined the deal.)

The deal is currently scheduled to take effect beginning April 1, 2000.  
Stephanie Miller's been kept in the loop.  May be something that folks might 
want include in due diligence w.r.t. to any gas contracts tied to the QFs.

Your questions:

1.  I am aware that the PUC just filed suit at FERC against El Paso for 
selling about 1.2 Bcf/day of gas capacity into California to Merchant Energy, 
but hadn't heard about a suit regarding the QFs.  I will find out and let you 
know.

2.  Yes, I am in a position to follow the debate and keep you informed.  I'm 
assuming that your are up to speed on the debate as of today.  If not, let me 
know and I and/or Paul can fill you in.

If there's anything else, don't hesitate to holler.  (415.782.7822).  Good 
weekend to you both.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, as you may know we are conducting due diligence on 11 california QF's 
that El Paso Merchant Energy purchased from Dynegy on Feb 1 of this year.  we 
are considering the purchase of 50% of El Paso's interest.  In discussions 
with Paul he suggested that I get you involved with the transaction.  Two 
things come to immediate attention.

I heard that the PUC has filed suit against El Paso relative to these 11 
assets.  What do you know about this ?
NOw that the CPUC is trying to implement terms of AB 1890's section 390 alot 
of questions and methods are surfacing about calculations of payments to 
QF's.  Are you in a postion to follow this debate and keep me informed during 
the process ??


Thanks

Frank
