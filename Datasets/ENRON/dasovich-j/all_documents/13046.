Few escape blame for crisis in poll

Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months,=20
according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.=20
And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's powe=

Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except "residential energy=

Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January=

when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave=

"The public sees themselves as conserving energy," said Field Poll Director=

In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41=20

from only 22 percent.=20
But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and=

handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think=20
Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The po=

of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle.=20
"All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin=

New views emerging on power
More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau=20
(Published May 23, 2001)

If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when =
to=20
break out the candles or send the workers home.=20
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and=
=20
giving businesses and residents ample warning.=20
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer=20
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the Californ=
ia=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid.=20
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a=
=20
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the=20
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light=
s=20
would stay on.=20
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which "ever=
y=20
day is a potential blackout day."=20
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a=20
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the=
=20
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask=20
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers' cartel."=20
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state woul=
d=20
gut it out with planned blackouts.=20
"Let's use the blackouts against the generators," Michael Shames, head of t=
he=20
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utiliti=
es=20
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for=
=20
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes.=20
"Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel=
=20
could work," Shames said.=20
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about th=
e=20
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power=20
blackouts, with definite notice right before.=20
"There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i=
s=20
likely to be jeopardized," Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said =
he=20
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea=
=20
of a system like Chicago's.=20
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at=
=20
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the=20
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will g=
o=20
beyond ISO's.=20
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking=
=20
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts=
=20
might increase the number of outages.=20
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute=20
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to=20
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the=
=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibl=
y=20
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.=20
"Obviously, there are trade-offs," Rothrock said.=20
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f=
or=20
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in=
=20
recent months.=20
"It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush,=
=20
we're going to handle this ourselves,' " said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove=
.=20
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo=
ne=20
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier.=
=20
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food=
=20
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go.=20
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day th=
at=20
their electronic gates might be closed.=20
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange fo=
r=20
backup power generators, he said.=20
"We would be very interested in it," said Ed Yates, senior vice president o=
f=20
the California League of Food Processors.=20
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring so=
me=20
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day=
.=20
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, h=
e=20
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food.=
=20
"It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult=20
situation," he said.=20
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two=
=20
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have =
to=20
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went abo=
ve=20
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said.=
=20
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when=
=20
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora=
ry=20
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a=
=20
sick relative to be moved.=20
"If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult=
=20
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departmen=
ts=20
and ambulances get where they have to be," Davis said.=20
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed t=
he=20
idea yet, but say it's worth a look.=20
"It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts," Rothrock said.=20

Rep. Anna Eschoo, D-Palo Alto, said Tuesday that if the Bush administration=

As for the meeting with the business leaders, Fleischer said, "The presiden=

"This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection=

On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe=

At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican=

Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it'

May 22, 2001=20
Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't s=
et=20
any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying=20
electricity north of the border.=20
"Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in Californ=

for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it," Martens said=20
after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American=
=20
Energy Conference in La Jolla.=20
Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most=20
immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three=
=20
plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send=20
electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal=20
activity.=20
One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export=
=20
all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Dieg=
o=20
company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because th=
e=20
facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that=
=20
supply electricity to the Mexican market.=20
Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are=20
interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.=20
Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the=20
border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and=
=20
public health and safety.=20
In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the=20
environment and local communities.=20
But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California=20
projects to serve California consumers.=20
"I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnectin=
g=20
lines to transmit the electricity that is produced," he said.=20
With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission=20
interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja=20
California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of=20
electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California=
=20
plants -- let alone any additional facilities.=20
Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the=20
interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali,=
=20
spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit=20
electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substatio=
n=20
in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana.=20
Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California=
=20
plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms cou=
ld=20
not be reached yesterday.=20
Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the=
=20
California grid system presents another obstacle.=20
To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California=
=20
grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has fo=
r=20
transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic=
e.=20
"It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico," said=20
district spokesman Ron Hull.=20
The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant=20
construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the=
=20
facilities.=20
Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja=
=20
Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants=

in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The=20
pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities.=20
"It's fully subscribed," said Clark. "In the future if there is enough=20
demand, the compression could be increased."=20
Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural=
=20
gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas=

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring=

that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit,=
=20
according to a top administration official.=20
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System=20

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis=20
Poll rates Bush worse than Davis=20

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has=20
handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their=20
energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows.=20
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush=
=20
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey.=20
"Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings=
"=20
when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are=20
handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the=
=20
Field Poll.=20
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent rating=
s=20
skidding for anyone connected with the energy business.=20
"Everyone has gotten tarred," DiCamillo said.=20
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric=
=20
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or ve=
ry=20
poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked=
=20
almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor=
=20
category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
to the same level.=20
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked=
=20
with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are=20
supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said.=20
"To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue=
,=20
" he said, "I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal.=
"=20
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect=
=20
the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are=20
indications that that strategy may not work forever.=20
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job=
=20
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new=
=20
survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jump=
ed=20
to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January.=20
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It=
=20
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.=20
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their=
=20
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe=
=20
residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding t=
o=20
the problem, up from 26 percent in January.=20
"People think they're making an effort to conserve," DiCamillo said. "In th=
e=20
public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be=20
doing."=20
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousne=
ss=20
of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or mor=
e=20
before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it=
=20
will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity.=20
"The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for=
 a=20
long haul," DiCamillo said. "The state hasn't been able to fix the problem =
in=20
a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen."=20
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that=
=20
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to=
=20
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if=20
businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts=
.=20
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state,=20
DiCamillo said.=20
"This is recognized as a major statewide issue," he said. "People think it=
=20
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live."=20

Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of=20

y=20
owners of backup generators to produce electricity.=20
The proposal, one of several options the governor is considering, would pay=
=20
for diesel power -- which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than=
=20
the cleanest natural gas power plants -- when electricity supplies are=20
stretched.=20
``If backup generators were to be used, it would only be as a last resort t=

California's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around=
=20
the state several times this year, with more anticipated when hot summer=20
weather prompts people to use air conditioning.=20
If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they would produce=
=20
about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine times the=
=20
pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, according to sta=
te=20
Air Resources Board data.=20
And the state would get only about 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1=
=20
percent of the state's peak power needs -- from the backup generators. That=
=20
would be enough to power about 550,000 homes.=20
``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' said Ellen Garve=

executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency. ``It's on=

issues of California's energy crisis -- one that state regulators plan to=

wrestle with today.=20
Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators, from geothermal to=
=20
gas-fired co-generation plants, battling California's utilities and state=
=20
price controls they say are crippling them. These small generators, owed=20
about $1.5 billion, supply up to a third of California's electricity.=20
At least 25 have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills. Four ha=

sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged=

with motions from at least 19 small generators, including Oildale. In many=

The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of California's energy crunc=

of its 10 anxious employees, but those of more than 150 employees at the=20

own back yard, they say. Gas-fired co-generation plants, which provide powe=

efficient producers in the state. And many of the small generators harness=

dependence on high-priced natural gas.=20
``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while we're paying=

state. ``This is really a major blunder.''=20
The immediate crisis started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained.=

That's when PG&E told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity=20
delivered in December. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz=20
said, which halted the plant's supply.=20
Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine.=20
The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over=

It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for=20
electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too low for business, some=

The commission's position has been that the small generators should abide b=

their existing contracts, said commission attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the=20

"Edison is going to survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Publi=

Dean Vanech, president of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot =

=20
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign=
=20
to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief=
=20
executive of Edison International.=20
"Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson said in a recent interview. "We=20

more power plants. The latest proposal would require the state to sell bond=

to pay off Edison's debts and give the state the option to buy the=20

Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdin=
gs,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensi=
ng
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewate=
r
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. Th=
e
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


"The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region," said Curt Hildebrand, vice president a=
nd
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  "We look forward=
 to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center."


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


"We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,"
Hildebrand added.  "We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible."


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the officia=
l
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental an=
d
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops =
and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  =

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gra=
y
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving=20
construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

"California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapo=
n=20
is
to build more power plants," Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natu=
ral
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which ha=
s
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than=
=20
they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants an=
d=20
the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax=
=20
