 Jeff,

I got this from http://www.socalgas.com/candi/prices/pricing_monthly1.shtml

Farther back, MRW (actually, I) gave information to Michael Wong which I 
think has monthly WACOGs in it.

About this month's natural gas prices...
        
The procurement price increased by about 8.996 cents per therm from November, 
2000 to December, 2000. This net increase is due to the commodity gas price 
increasing by 12.681 cents per therm, plus a decrease in the Regulatory 
adjustment of 3.685 cents per therm. 

The increase in prices is generally due to the high demand caused by cold 
temperatures throughout the country combined with reduced flowing supply.

rates.
