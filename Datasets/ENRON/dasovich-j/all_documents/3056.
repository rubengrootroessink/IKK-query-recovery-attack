Stuck in the Bozo Filter
Reputation management -- How startups can escape fuzzy
branding and bad media relations

Wells Fargo Room, Haas School of Business


ABSTRACT

Startups can't cross the chasm or ride the tornado weighted down with fuzzy
branding and bad media relations. There is no denying the power of good
public relations to launch a company from the ground up, build the brand
and support a company's business and marketing plans over time. But in
today's fast-moving economy, clutter abounds. News about a company is often
ignored if it doesn't have a big number attached to it, tell a bigger story
or have a unique twist. Editors and writers filter out pitches and releases
that sound alike. How to break through the clutter? In this talk, we will
review the nine easy ways to kill a startup with PR, see "worst of PR"
examples the media hate and learn a few secrets of proper positioning --
methods companies have used to make a difference with intelligence and
personality.
