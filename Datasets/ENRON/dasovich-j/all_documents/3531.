B.O.  you hearing any reviews?  i think it opened this week, or last week?
And I think Cameron's got it right, you guys on the 29th, me and P. Dub-yah
on the 6th.  Hey, I saw the menu that Nancy sent around.  Is she cooking on
her own birthday?

Hey, I'm just wondering, when are we slated to go see Woody, Sean, Nick and

Hope all's well,
