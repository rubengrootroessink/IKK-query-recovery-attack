Location Chronicle Pavilion in Concord
Event  American Independent Celebration with fireworks
RSVP Due 6/29/01

Hello everyone,
Hope the summer is going well and you are fully enjoying your time off.  To
once again help you with your recreation activities, we've planned another
summer social event.  On July 4th at the Chronicle Pavilion in Concord is
the American Independent Celebration with fireworks.  It's a patriotic
family event with the California Symphony performing all your favorite
American tunes (from Star Wars to the William Tell Overture).  They also
have appearances from kids choirs and individual singing artists.  Last year
they brought a horse and cowboy on stage during one of the Lone Ranger
songs.  It's a great event for kids and the family, and the finale with
fireworks and real cannon fire will bring a patriotic tear to even the most
masculine of men.

The prices are $29 for lower reserved seats and $24 for general admission.
General admission for this show includes lawn seating and the upper seats.
Ages 13-18 are only $14 for general admission and children under 12 are
free.  The show starts at 8:00 pm, so it leaves plenty of time to celebrate
at a friend's BBQ and then mosey over to the Pavilion to finish the night
off.  And best of all,  there will be a section in the center lower lawn
(prime spots!) reserved for the Haas group, so you don't need to arrive
early for good seats.  This spot will be staked out by Cindy - as she will
be there early as part of the symphony.  Her family and friends shoot the
cannons in the finale.  Depending on security, she may also be able to give
tours of the authentic turn-of-the-century cannons to the children of the
group.

Reply to Tony with RSVP's by 6/29/01.  Again, we would appreciate if you buy
your
tickets directly through the Chronicle Pavilion at (925) 676-8742, or
through Ticketmaster at (925) 685-8497.  However, please do RSVP so that we
may help with carpools, general organization and know how large a spot to
reserve on the lawn.
