Dear SVMG Member Company Representative -

We need a Host Site for a major Energy Summit on May 4.

As you know, we partnered last month with San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales,
County Board of Supervisors Chair Jim Beall, and each Santa Clara County
Mayor on an Energy Summit.

To meet the ambitious conservation and load management goals necessary to
help fend off rolling black-outs this summer, all fifteen cities and the
county agreed that we should partner on a second Summit, as soon as
possible, to gain quantifiable commitments from both the public and private
sector to reduce energy use in Silicon Valley.

The location for the second Summit - slated for Friday, May 4, from 7:15am
until 12 noon, needs to accomodate 150-200 people.

I NEED YOUR HELP.  We need a Member Company to host this important gathering
of public and private sector leaders, which includes a space to seat 150-200
people, along with light refreshments.  In addition, we will have numerous
state and federal legislators, and probably a lot of (positive) media
interest.

If your company can accomodate such a gathering, and you would be willing to
serve as our host site, please let me know asap.  We hope to have "save the
date" flyers out by this coming Friday, April 6.  I apologize for this short
notice, but with summer fast approaching, we need to move as expeditiously
as possible.

Sincerely,

Carl Guardino
