"Jazz on a Summer's Day, the FABULOUS documentary featuring
performances from the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival is playing on the big
screen in Berkeley!!! It's at the Fine Arts Cinema (at 2451 Shattuck 
@ Haste) from the 23rd to the 29th at 9:10 p.m. daily. 

Forget the Woodstock film - this is the first live concert film and is
unanimously considered to be the best. In my opinion, Mahalia
Jackson's closing performance is worth the price of admission alone,
but in addition it features Louis Armstrong, Thelonious Monk, Art
Pepper, Chuck Berry (I think) and a whole bunch of other legends. 

Even better, it's part of a double feature, with "Louis Prima:! T! he
Wildest" at 7:30 p.m. daily. I haven't seen this, but it promises to
be a blast too - to hell with the Gap commercials - see the original
"Jump, Jive An' Wail" swing master whom everyone from Brian Setzer to
David Lee Roth ripped off. He also wrote "Sing, Sing, Sing" that was
popularized by Benny Goodman.



MBA '02-ers, I will not spam your whole class again. The "music"
mailing list is used to send out information about upcoming live
music events in the area, and often coordinate ticket purchases,
rides, etc. 

If you'd like, subscribe to the list in the usual way - either mail

subscribe music

in the body of the message to "majordomo@haas", or do so over the Web.
