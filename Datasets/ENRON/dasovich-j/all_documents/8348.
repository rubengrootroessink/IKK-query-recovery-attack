Wine and Romance

Everybody seems to agree that wine and romance go hand in hand, so we=20
asked our Wine Team - a seasoned group of experts boasting 150 years=20
of collective experience - exactly why and how love and wine are=20
linked. Here are their professional observations.=20

Lee Codding:
Wine is made with care and passion, which can't help but transmit=20
itself to the drinker. It's only natural for wine to have a central=20
place in romance, because love is an essential ingredient in=20
its production.=20

Peter Granoff:
Candy may be dandy and liquor quicker, but nothing extends a romantic=20
moment like a fine wine.=20

Maire Murphy:
When we describe wine, we describe its body, texture, taste, and=20
experience. That, in itself, is romantic.=20

Diana Jacklich:
Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy,=20
seductive, smooth, velvety, and lush? Because wine is one of the last=20
legal sybaritic pursuits.=20

Carolyn Dempsey:
Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance, which lift the spirit=20
and return us to what really matters. Whether it's the nourishment of=20
breaking bread and sharing stories, or simply the nurturing nature of=20
wine itself (which eases the mind and soothes the soul), it's about=20
taking time to savor the beautiful.=20

Maire Murphy:
There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a=20
woman's navel. If that isn't romantic, what is?=20

Julian Davies:
Of course, no woman in her right mind would drop her laundry without=20
half a bottle of '47 Cheval Blanc down her....=20

Peter Granoff:
Wine lovers are wrong when they say that great wine is like sex.=20
Great wine is sex. The delicacy and tenderness involved in opening a=20
fine old bottle of wine is a kind of foreplay, and great wine, like=20
the act of love, engages us on many levels: sensory, emotional,=20
and intellectual.=20

Diana Jacklich:
"The soft extractive note of an aged cork being withdrawn has the=20
true sound of a man opening his heart" (William Samuel Benwell).=20

Jeff Prather:
Wine makes us giddy with youthful energy; it makes us feel warm and=20
fuzzy; it causes us to say silly things and mean them; it reduces our=20
inhibitions; it's a sensual magnifier; it's a powerful muse; it makes=20
everything taste better. Oh, did I say wine? Well then, wine must be=20
bottled love.=20

Peter Granoff:
Romance engages all the senses -- as does a fluted glass of=20
Champagne, especially when savored by candlelight. It's a sensory=20
treat in all respects: It sparkles like the eyes of your beloved,=20
offers the same delight to the nose as the object of your affection,=20
and when you bring it to your lips....=20

Taking Peter's cue, Tim Gaiser provides further dining advice:
If Champagne is our most romantic wine, there's no better occasion=20
than Valentine's Day for a Champagne dinner. It enables you to (1)=20
serve everything at the same time and (2) not do any cooking=20
whatsoever. Just pick up a bottle or two of your favorite bubbly,=20
plus an assortment of caviar, cheeses, pates, fresh shellfish, smoked=20
trout/salmon/scallops, chocolates, and any other finger food that=20
strikes your fancy. Invite that special someone to the table, open=20
the first bottle, and simply let nature, romance, intimate=20
conversation, true love, and amateur wrestling take their course.=20

full selection of Champagne and sparkling wine.

In the Cork Boards: Red Wine and Headaches

Does wine make your head hurt? It does for MJBNYC. "Whenever I drink=20
California wine ... a migrane is triggered and I wind up in severe=20
pain," he wrote recently on the wine.com Cork Boards. "Does anyone=20
know what is present -- or not -- in CA wine that initiates my bad=20
reaction?" Cork Boarders have already presented a variety of=20
theories. Click here to join the discussion.=20
