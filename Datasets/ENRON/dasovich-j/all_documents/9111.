Steve,
In your absence, I left a voicemail for Guillermo yesterday pertaining to 
some information that I'm not certain Gruma was fully aware of when we met 
Monday.

Late last month, the CPUC decided to waive interruptible rate program 
penalties, except that they "fully expect all interruptible customers to 
voluntarily respond to the maximum extent feasible."

In essence, our interpretation is that this makes Gruma's response to an 
interruption completely voluntary, however, as we discussed Monday, the 
California supply-demand imbalances will remain for some time, and the 
utilities will likely resort to rolling black-outs if the now voluntary 
interruptions (or other measures) don't relieve the situation.  We recommend 
that Gruma confirm our interpretation directly with Edison.

I have a hard copy of the CPUC's decision with a brief cover note from 
Edison, if you're interested.  It's probably also available on a CPUC website.
Please call me if questions, or we can discuss further on our Tuesday 
conference call.
George
