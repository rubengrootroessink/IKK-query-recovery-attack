On  Friday, Socalgas?filed a protest to the emergency application we filed 
on  Thursday which asked the CPUC to exercise its authority under Public 
Utility  Code section 2774 and order Socalgas to provide use with emergency 
assistance to  avert core gas supply shortages.? Socalgas asserts (1) section 
2774 does  not apply to gas shortages arising from financial difficulties; 
(2) the  emergency assistance we requested would jeopardize its financial 
viability and  ability to provide gas service to its own core customers; (3) 
the requested  relief would be an unconstitutional taking of its property; 
and (4) PG&E has  not exhausted its own remedies -- in particular, the 
protest complains that  PG&E wants Socalgas to act before PG&E diverts 
noncore gas  supplies.? Socalgas states it plans to ask a federal court for 
injunctive  relief to prevent CPUC issuance of the requested order.?
