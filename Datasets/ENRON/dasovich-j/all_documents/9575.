Guys --

Spoke with Dave Duran (lead dealmaker) about Project INGA.  He is considering 
purchasing fleet of QFs.  Exposure to CA - SCE.  Need to make sure that we 
understand the deal model and regulatory / bankruptcy assumptions.

I've asked John Neslage to get with RAC Underwriting (Chip Schneider) to make 
sure that we see the economics.  Please help John as much as possible.

Thanks,

Jim
