London and the presentation were good- only changes were a few updates. 
Thanks for your help!

OK, now that I have your attention, were the draft slides on the "California 
Status" presentation of any use?  I'm asking because I'm working with Paul on 
the California briefing package and biz plan and we're going to add some form 
of that presentation to the briefing package.  Jim made some refinements for 
the presentation that he did and he's going to forward his version to me.  If 
you made improvements, it would be helpful to have your version as well.  No 
big deal.  Just let me know.  

What do you think of London?

Best,
Jeff
