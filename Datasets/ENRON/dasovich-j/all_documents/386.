Jeff: Talked with Steve and Anita -we do need an Income Statement for
the CLEC (ETI); we can delete "residential" reference in the Application
and say "telecommunications services"; we do need to keep reference to
UNE's as explanatory language re Enron's provision of services; Please
let us know if you have further thoughts. Thx, Jeremy
