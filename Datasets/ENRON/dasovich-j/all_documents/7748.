Wine Team Picks: Peter Marks on Rising Italian Whites

Many Americans view Italian white wines the way they view Italian=20
cars: They made a splash, only to falter in later years. The problem=20
was reliability. Friends who owned one of these gems (we're talking=20
about the cars here) came to believe that Fiat stood for "fix it=20
again, Tony." As for the wines, the good news is that they're now=20
easy-to-drink and better than ever. Here are a few of my=20
current favorites.=20

Champagne with Popcorn, Potato Chips ... and More

How did Champagne become the beverage of choice for special events?=20
Does it have to be so? Wine.com Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser=20
tackles the tough holiday questions.=20

"Champagne became a wine of celebration for one very logical reason,"=20
Gaiser says. "The Champagne region played a central role in European=20
history, with many coronations in the cathedral at Rheims from the=20
eighth century on. Naturally, the local wine (though not the bubbly=20
version at first) was served at these momentous occasions, and by the=20
end of the 16th century, Champagne had become the wine of choice for=20
the French court, with the rest of Europe soon following suit.=20
Champagne's preeminence as a luxury beverage -- the wine of=20
celebration -- has been secure ever since."=20

Dom Perignon, a French Benedictine monk, was the first to preserve=20
the tiny bubbles in Champagne. Now that it's moved beyond European=20
aristocracy, says Gaiser, "Sparkling wines don't have to be limited=20
to special events. Their combination of light body, crisp acidity,=20
and delightful bubbles makes them wonderful aperitifs for any=20
occasion -- something like Billecart Salmon Champagne Ros,, for=20
example, is just right to rev up the palate for a good meal."=20

Once the food arrives, Gaiser recommends a bubbly such as the 1990=20
A.R. Lenoble Blanc de Blancs, Grand Cru Champagne as the perfect foil=20
for fresh shellfish and caviar. This is also an appropriate role for=20
nonvintage sparkling wines like the Maison Guinot Cremant de Limoux=20
Brut Cuvee Imperial. Such sparklers are surprisingly good with two=20
decidedly unroyal foods: potato chips and freshly popped (not=20
microwaved) popcorn. Sound ridiculous? Try it.=20

"Weightier vintage Champagnes such as 1993 Charles Ellner Brut=20
Champagne Seduction work well with lightly sauced fish, chicken, and=20
veal," Gaiser recommends. "One of the all-time great food-wine=20
pairings is a good ros, Champagne such as Billecart Salmon Champagne=20
Ros, with poached salmon. The color match alone is worth the price of=20
admission, but the taste combination is utter heaven."=20
