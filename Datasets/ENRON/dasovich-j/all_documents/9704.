**************************************************************** 
Investing Strategies for Retirement, Argus Roundtable, 
Tuesday, March 13, 7:00 p.m. ET, 4:00 p.m. PT 
****************************************************************

The challenges -- and opportunities -- that investors planning 
for their retirement face are different from the obstacles 
in the day-to-day capital markets. This month's Argus Roundtable 
will discuss the impact of time (as opposed to timing) for 
retirement investors. Argus analysts will review portfolio - 
related risks such as inflation and taxes, as opposed to the 
market-related risks of recession and earnings warnings, and 
will talk about sector strategies and diversification for 
the long-term. 

We're sure you have plenty of questions about these issues, 
which you can email to the Argus panel of experts. 

We'll see you on the 13th!
