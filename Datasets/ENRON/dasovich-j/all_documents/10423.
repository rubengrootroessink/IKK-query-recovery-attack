arly last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen=20
companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline fro=
m=20
Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starve=
d=20
California.=20
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company,=
=20
which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Pas=
o=20
Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid,=
=20
in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint=20
against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer=
=20
is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its=20
sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of=20
natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity.=20
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part =
of=20
filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally=
=20
that the deal would give them "more control" of gas markets, including the=
=20
"ability to influence the physical market" to benefit the company's financi=
al=20
positions.
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal respons=
e=20
to California's complaint, said the state "grossly distorted" company=20
documents by quoting words and phrases out of context.
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the=20
natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric=
=20
power plants.
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive=
=20
abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal=20
regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry=
=20
officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor=
=20
unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximiz=
e=20
profits.
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country,=20
moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions t=
o=20
fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses.=20
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But=
=20
experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New=20
England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants.=
=20
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in=
=20
the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy=
=20
crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from=20
price manipulation and profiteering.
"They are the market maker with this pipeline," said Loretta Lynch, the=20
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggle=
d=20
to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages.=20
El Paso "sets the price in California," Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was=
=20
intentional. "It has affected the price," she said, "for everything related=
=20
to heat and electrical power prices in the state."=20
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant=
=20
"has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity" on=
=20
the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline=
's=20
owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to=
=20
other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state sa=
id=20
that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit=20
anticompetitive behavior.
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected =
to=20
make money by widening the "basis spread" =01* the difference between what =
gas=20
can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end o=
f=20
the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the pric=
e=20
of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that=
=20
pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.=
2=20
billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10=
=20
months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup=
=20
the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typical=
ly=20
is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices i=
n=20
the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas- New Mexico price in=20
December.
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusatio=
ns=20
of market manipulation are ludicrous.=20
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are=
=20
easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's=
=20
utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or=
=20
store enough gas for winter.
"The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,"=
=20
said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North=20
America.=20
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacif=
ic=20
Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso =
in=20
a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed=20
company documents.=20
"It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy=20
Corporation," the utility said in the filing, "that the business strategy E=
l=20
Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue=20
involved manipulation of price spreads."=20
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the dea=
l=20
between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on t=
he=20
agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry=20
observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon =
as=20
the agency's public meeting on Wednesday.
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said=
=20
recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent =
of=20
the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option=
=20
that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cub=
ic=20
feet of gas a day.=20
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the=
=20
chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that=
=20
their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a "gut-wrenching" decision, Mr.=
=20
Smith said, but was "a first- class gesture" to California. El Paso Merchan=
t=20
paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, unt=
il=20
May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that=20
investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.
"No doubt about it," Mr. Clark said, "we made good money."=20
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is=
=20
expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The=20
company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los=20
Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent=20
pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso=
=20
denied the accusation.
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about=20
anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created=20
soaring profits for energy marketers and traders.=20
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complain=
ts=20
to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing=20
capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline=20
companies routinely favored affiliates. "Abuses abound because of financial=
=20
windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased=20
complexity of the market," the company said.
"There are some red flags right now," said William L. Massey, a member of t=
he=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was=20
troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and=20
power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural=
=20
gas. El Paso is in all those businesses.
"What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at=
=20
work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand=20
signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of=20
affiliate abuse?" he said.=20
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed.=20
"There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse," said=
=20
Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron=20
Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of=20
America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which=20
California has brought its complaint about El Paso.
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns. It operates the=20
nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the larges=
t=20
reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal=20
Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market=20
capitalization of $32 billion.=20
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts=20
heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's=
=20
much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is=
=20
expected to earn about $1.4 billion.
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's=
=20
profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, i=
t=20
is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest=20
quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to "commodity=
=20
market and trading margins" that were enhanced by "power price volatility,=
=20
particularly in the Western United States."=20
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According=
=20
to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant wa=
s=20
awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A.=
=20
Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for t=
he=20
bid.=20
The presentation outlined what it termed "strategic advantages," including=
=20
"more control of total physical markets" and the "ability to influence the=
=20
physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position," according =
to=20
the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal t=
o=20
give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to suppo=
rt=20
financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its=
=20
risk.
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation=
=20
said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million.=20
Under the heading "Challenges," according to the sealed filings, the=20
presentation stated that storage was needed "to help manipulate physical=20
spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost."
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president =
at=20
the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an upda=
te=20
for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: "We will mak=
e=20
money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread."=20
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by=20
increasing the gas flow in the pipeline =01* the load factor =01* while inc=
reasing=20
the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it=
=20
could be sold for at the other end =01* the basis spread.
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the=
=20
unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in=
=20
months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices=
=20
in the spot market.=20
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on th=
e=20
pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in=
=20
prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Pas=
o=20
Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late las=
t=20
year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information i=
n=20
the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal=20
regulators, said California's complaint had "misconstrued and incorrectly=
=20
interpreted" what it termed "snippets of data."
