I'll add two to the list:

1  Why is the term "Legacy" often used and does it mean something other than 
"old way of doing things"


2.  Why is a business customer called an "Enterprise" customer?  Does it have 
something to do with the size of the customer?  The type of customer?  Or is 
it just a fancy name for a customer.

Here's my list of some things that I would like to learn more about:

1.  The difference between recommended standard (RS) and single-mode fiber 
(SMF) cable?

2.  What is an indefeasible right of use (IRU)?  It is like a right-of-way?

3.  What are the differences in the various capacities of cable (DS-3, 
OC-192, etc.).  Not just the amount of capacity each has, but what types of 
information are transmitted along each.

4.  What is a synchronous optical network (SONET)?

5.  What is asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)? 

6.  What is synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)?  I think this is used in 
Europe, but I'm not sure.

7.  What is a bi-directional line switched ring (BLSR)?

8.  What is throughput capacity?

9.  What does the term "long haul" mean?

10.  I still don't have a grasp of the 10% rule.  Unfortunately, I think I 
need this one spelled out in the most basic terms.

I have many more questions, but I think this is a good start.

Thanks.
