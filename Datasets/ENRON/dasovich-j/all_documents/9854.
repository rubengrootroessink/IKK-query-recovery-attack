I just spoke with Janel and we concluded that we need to better coordinate 
our use of Ken's time.  We agreed that it would be a good idea for Ken to 
cover the IEP and Direct Access Coalition calls, meetings, etc. and report 
back to us about any conclusions reached.  

All future assignments for Ken should be coordinated through Janel.
