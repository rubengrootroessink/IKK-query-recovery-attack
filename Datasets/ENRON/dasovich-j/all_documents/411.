In case this wasn't posted before...they have a customer already...the
race is on.

Vendor Casbah (http://www.casbahcorp.com) will develop online auctions
for the PetroleumPlace.com, an upstream oil and gas Net market. The
auctions
will let users place real-time bids via the Web that will compete
equally
with live, in-person, trading floor auctions.
