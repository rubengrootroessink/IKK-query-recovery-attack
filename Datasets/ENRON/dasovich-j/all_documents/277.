Attached is the unofficial version of a Siting Committee Ruling signed this
afternoon in 99-DIST-GEN(2).  The ruling established the basic framework by
which the Commission will develop recommended interconnection rules
affecting DG proponents and IOUs.  In the interest of getting this note out
today, I am using the e-mail list generated from R.98-12-015, rather than
the new list.  I will ensure that future correspondence use the R.99-10-025
service list.

The official version will be placed in the mail tomorrow and also posted on
our website.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via
e-mail or by phone.
