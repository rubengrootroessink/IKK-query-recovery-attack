> The Commission's Energy Division served today a Data Request in the
> Operation of Interruptible Load Programs Rulemaking. Most of you have
> received the data request directly from the Commission. The majority of
> the questions in the request are directed to the UDCs and the ISO
> (respondents).  There are, however, two questions (7.1 and 7.2) that are
> directed at "each appearance."  These questions deal with interruptible
> insurance and information on other states' interruptible, curtailable,
> demand responsiveness programs.  As you may (or may not) recall, a couple
> of weeks ago Bill Chen and myself attended the prehearing conference in
> this proceeding and entered appearances for Enron, New Energy, Chevron,
> Shell, New Power and Strategic Energy.  Accordingly, you have an
> obligation to respond to these two questions.
>
> The data request allows for appearances to coordinate in the presentation
> of their responses.  Thus, I am suggest that the six members of  ARM which
> are appearances in this proceeding coordinate in their responses.  The due
> date for the responses is December 15th.  I believe the best course of
> action is to have a conference call early next week to decide how to
> respond.  Then if each company could have their data to me by Monday the
> 11th, I could coordinate it and send a draft response out to everyone for
> review prior to submittal on the 15th.
>
> Please let me know as soon as possible if this course of action is okay
> with you.
