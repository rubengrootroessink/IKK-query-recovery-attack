The voyage
The real danger for Pennsylvania in  observing California's ill-fated=20
approach to electric restructuring is that it  tempts smugness, to which=20
Pennsylvania could easily fall prey, since it has  chartered a different, a=
nd=20
so far, much more successful path from monopoly to  competition. Pennsylvan=
ia=20
primarily differs from California by its sincere  commitment to create=20
genuinely competitive retail markets. While many states say  that they want=
=20
competition and have even passed laws that supposedly require it,  only=20
Pennsylvania and a handful of other states have matched their words with =
=20
pro-competition policies.
?
To deliver on its commitment of a genuinely competitive retail market, the =
=20
Commonwealth is implementing unique and specific policies that should give =
=20
customers real choices and break the dominance of incumbent utilities. Amon=
g =20
Pennsylvania=01,s more notable transition measures are much higher shopping=
 =20
credits, rejection of accelerated stranded cost recovery, longer transition=
 =20
periods, competitive default service for a portion of the non-shopping load=
,=20
and  retail rate caps that continue until at least 2004 and as late as 2010=
.=20
?
But despite the different route taken, this is no time for smugness. =20
Pennsylvania must be alert and learn from, but not follow, California's wak=
e.=20
On  electric policy, California's ship of state has sailed like the Titanic=
, =20
ignoring warnings of icebergs ahead, while maintaining high speed on the=20
open  sea.=20
?
The national press, of course, flocks to cover news of the shipwreck. As =
=20
always, bad news is more dramatic, therefore judged to be the better story=
=20
than  the good news of Pennsylvania's success. Unfortunately, the nation as=
 a=20
whole  may draw the incorrect lesson from California's voyage that electric=
 =20
restructuring is unsafe at any speed, or on any course. That would be as =
=20
erroneous an assumption as deciding, based on the Titanic's ill-fated=20
voyage,  that ocean travel is too dangerous.
?
Calm waters now, but dangers ahead
Pennsylvania,  however, would be just as incorrect to conclude that its=20
successful first three  years and ten months of transition means no more=20
icebergs lie ahead. At least  two big obstacles are now visible.=20
?
First, the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely =20
competitive primarily because no Independent System Operator (ISO) covers=
=20
the  region=01,s utility service territories. The absence of a competitive,=
=20
transparent,  and liquid wholesale market in western Pennsylvania creates a=
=20
major threat to  the success of retail competition there. Taking strong=20
action now to require  that Allegheny Energy, Duquesne Light, and=20
Pennsylvania Power join the already  functioning PJM Independent System=20
Operator will keep the transition on course  in western Pennsylvania.=20
?
Second, throughout Pennsylvania, there is now inadequate demand-side =20
response to market prices. This problem partly results from too little =20
deployment of time-of-use meters, uncertainty about terms for competitive=
=20
access  to those time-of-use meters that are deployed, and too little use o=
f=20
available  appliance control technology. In order to give customers more=20
control over their  bills and to limit wholesale market price spikes,=20
customers must be able to  change their demand in response to wholesale=20
prices.=20
?
Even though the poor state of the wholesale market in Western Pennsylvania =
=20
and the limited demand-side response to price are substantial difficulties,=
 =20
Pennsylvania's success may cause us to ignore their presence.
?
Since Pennsylvania began its transition to retail electric competition on =
=20
January 1, 1997, the Commonwealth has built the most successful retail mark=
et=20
in  the nation, and possibly the world. According to the Pennsylvania=20
Department of  Revenue (see: www.revenue.state.pa.us), electric  competitio=
n=20
has saved consumers $3 billion and will create 36,000 new jobs by  2004. An=
d=20
since January 1, 1999, 528,000 customers have chosen a competitive  supplie=
r,=20
even though high wholesale market prices this summer encouraged some,  most=
ly=20
larger, customers to return to their utility. Despite those difficulties, =
=20
more customers have switched to a new supplier in Pennsylvania than in the=
=20
rest  of the nation combined. An incredible 30 percent of Duquesne Light's=
=20
residential  customers have switched. Allegheny Energy's innovative municip=
al=20
aggregation  program and Duquesne Light's transition policies deserve much=
=20
praise for this  result. Equally noteworthy are the approximately 80,000=20
customers that have  purchased cleaner or renewable energy products, mainly=
=20
thanks to the green  trailblazing by GreenMountain.com.
?
Of course, GreenMountain.com is not alone in the marketplace. More  compani=
es=20
are actively competing for accounts in Pennsylvania than in any other  stat=
e.=20
New Internet retailers of electricity and other products like Utility.com =
=20
and OnlineChoice have entered the market. Just yesterday, The New Power=20
Company,  a joint venture of Enron, AOL and IBM, announced it had entered t=
he=20
PECO Energy  service territory and guaranteed residential customers savings=
=20
up to 25% on the  electricity portion of the bill. Between traditional=20
suppliers, Internet  retailers and green marketers, sufficient market entry=
=20
has occurred to make  competition intense at times. In the PECO Energy=20
market, as many as 19 suppliers  at one time have competed for residential=
=20
customers.=20
?
In 2000, this competitive intensity built 1,000 megawatts of new generation=
 =20
within the PJM power pool. By 2005, PJM expects another 15,000 megawatts to=
=20
be  generated mainly from natural gas power plants, which are 95% to 99%=20
cleaner in  emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide than many coal=
=20
plants. Renewable  energy technologies will provide the remaining new suppl=
y=20
that does not come  from natural gas.
?
Indeed, the year 2000 ushered in Pennsylvania's first two operating wind =
=20
energy farms. Both wind farms were financed as a result of successful=20
marketing  of renewable energy products to retail customers, primarily by=
=20
GreenMountain.com  with a helping hand from Community Energy Inc. The Green=
=20
Mountain 10-megawatt  wind farm in Somerset County is one of the largest ea=
st=20
of the Mississippi. =20
?
Through their purchases of renewable energy and cleaner energy products, =
=20
Pennsylvania=01,s families and businesses are acting powerfully to change t=
he =20
electricity industry and to reduce smog, acid rain, and emission of global =
=20
warming gases. Switching to renewable energy products to power their homes=
=20
and  businesses is the single most effective thing Pennsylvanians can do to=
=20
clean  their environment. Every residential customer that switches to a 100=
%=20
renewable  product on average prevents an amount of pollution that is=20
equivalent to not  driving 20,000 miles, taking 1.7 cars off the road or=20
planting 950 trees.=20
?
All this is indeed a remarkable record of success, of which Pennsylvania =
=20
should be proud. But to avoid peril, Pennsylvania's policymakers must=20
quickly  identify the icebergs ahead, continue forward at a safe speed, and=
=20
change course  as needed. Proceeding in this sensible fashion is easier=20
because Pennsylvania  began as early as January 1, 1997 its journey into=20
competition. By beginning  early, Pennsylvania could opt for a steady=20
transition pace and transition  periods that are long enough to allow the=
=20
development of genuinely competitive  wholesale and retail markets before=
=20
fully ending rate regulation of  generation.
?
The transition to full generation price deregulation will last until at =20
least 2005 and as long as 2010 in the various service territories. While =
=20
allowing utilities to recover approved stranded costs, Pennsylvania=20
generally  has not accelerated stranded cost recovery. To balance stranded=
=20
cost payments to  utilities, electric rates offered by those utilities are=
=20
capped. Utilities=01,  transmission and distribution rates are capped at Ja=
nuary=20
1, 1997 levels until  December 31, 2004 in PPL, GPU, and probably Duquesne,=
=20
until December 31, 2005 in  Allegheny Energy, and until Dec. 31, 2006 in PE=
CO=20
Energy.
?
Generation rates of utilities are also capped. The generation rate caps  la=
st=20
at least until 2003 and as long as 2010. Specifically, generation rates are=
 =20
capped in Duquesne until December 31, 2003, December 31, 2008 in Allegheny =
=20
Energy, December 31, 2009 in PPL, and December 31, 2010 in PECO Energy and=
=20
GPU.  The rates are normally capped at January 1, 1997 levels until 2005, a=
t=20
which  point the rate cap period continues, with modest increases allowed=
=20
during the  remainder of it.
?
Avoiding the obstacles
Although this rate of speed is  sensible, Pennsylvania must make an immedia=
te=20
course correction to ensure that,  by 2002, the service territories and=20
customers of Allegheny Energy, Duquesne  Light Company, and Pennsylvania=20
Power are served by PJM =01* an effective, approved  Independent System Ope=
rator=20
(ISO) that now serves two-thirds of Pennsylvania.  Presently, Allegheny,=20
Duquesne and Penn Power are not part of any ISO and the  absence of an ISO=
=20
makes it impossible to build healthy, competitive wholesale  and retail=20
markets in those regions.
?
To repeat, neither wholesale nor retail competition can work if all service=
 =20
territories in Pennsylvania are not part of an ISO. The ISO ensures that th=
e =20
wholesale electric market is workably competitive, the power supply is=20
reliable,  and consumers are protected from anti-competitive market=20
manipulation.=20
?
Presently, the wholesale market in western Pennsylvania is not genuinely =
=20
competitive. The poor state of wholesale competition exists because its =20
utilities are not part of an ISO that would expand the size of the market i=
n =20
which electricity could be freely traded. The Duquesne service territory in=
 =20
particular would have more choices, and possibly lower prices were it part =
of=20
a  viable ISO.=20
?
At this point, the only viable ISO that Allegheny, Duquesne Light and Penn =
=20
Power could join is PJM. Yet, no progress in requiring Allegheny and Duques=
ne=20
to  join PJM has been made since 1998, when the Pennsylvania Public Utility=
 =20
Commission (PUC) made membership in PJM or an effective ISO a condition of=
=20
the  proposed Allegheny/Duquesne merger. When the merger plans collapsed,=
=20
ISO  membership and expansion of PJM disappeared from the radar screen.=20
?
However, it is PennFuture's understanding that Chairman Quain has put PJM =
=20
expansion back on the PUC's agenda. If so, he is doing the right thing. =20
PennFuture knows that APS and Duquesne Light, in part due to Chairman=20
Quain's  prodding, will soon decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM.=
=20
Indeed, we  believe that Duquesne Light would like to become a PJM member,=
=20
but needs  Allegheny to join as well for Duquesne's customers to gain the=
=20
full benefits of  PJM membership.
?
In order to expand into western Pennsylvania, PJM itself must remove a =20
barrier by abolishing its installed capacity (ICAP) rule. Allegheny,=20
Duquesne,  and Penn Power have never adopted PJM=01,s peculiar ICAP rule. O=
f=20
course, without  ICAP the western Pennsylvania utilities have operated as=
=20
reliably or more so  than the existing PJM utilities. PJM expansion would b=
e=20
the final nail in the  ICAP coffin, yet another benefit of expanding PJM.=
=20
?
The recently announced proposed merger between First Energy and GPU creates=
 =20
another chapter in the PJM tale. GPU is part of PJM. First Energy is not. =
=20
Therein lies the seed of a possibly disastrous conflict. The First Energy=
=20
and  GPU merger will not be in the public interest and not be approved unle=
ss=20
more  competitive choices, more consumer savings, more clean energy, or mor=
e =20
demand-side response is added, or without iron-clad commitments that GPU=20
will  remain within PJM and that First Energy will join PJM.
?
Given the uncertain outcome of the ongoing informal discussions about the =
=20
expansion of PJM, Pennsylvania's officials need to let all concerned know=
=20
that,  if they do not join PJM voluntarily, they will be ordered to do so.=
=20
The PUC may  be able to do this with existing authority. If not, the=20
Pennsylvania General  Assembly must act.=20
?
The second iceberg that lies in Pennsylvania's path to electric transition =
=20
is enabling first larger customers, and eventually all consumers, to change=
 =20
their electric usage in response to market prices. All consumers must be=20
given  the ability to alter their demand in real time and before they get=
=20
their  electricity bills. They must be immediately empowered in this way, a=
nd=20
prior to  the expiration of generation rate caps.
?
Enabling retail consumers to change demand in response to market prices  wi=
ll=20
powerfully limit wholesale and retail prices. The market monitoring unit of=
 =20
PJM calculates that a 1 percent reduction (about 500 mW) in demand can=20
reduce  market prices by about 10 cents/kWh. Customer-determined demand=20
modification and  reduction is vital to protecting consumers =01* businesse=
s and=20
families =01* from  unreasonable price spikes. Increasing the ability of=20
consumers to change demand  in response to price also offers environmental=
=20
benefits from reduced emissions  of pollutants from power plants.
?
Empowering consumers to change their demand in response to price requires =
=20
installation of advanced meters that record usage hourly and appliance=20
control  technology. Equipment that allows the remote resetting of=20
thermostats is now  available and should be made widely available to=20
consumers. So far, few, if any,  competitive suppliers are offering meterin=
g=20
services. Market forces have not  been sufficient to universally deploy=20
time-of-use meters, though Duquesne and  PECO Energy should be complimented=
=20
for widely deploying the technology in their  service territories.
?
PennFuture, therefore, recommends that Pennsylvania require the  installati=
on=20
of advanced meters by January 2004 for all commercial and  industrial=20
customers with demand greater than 50kW. By 2010 all customers must  have=
=20
their usage recorded by an advanced meter. The distribution utilities  shou=
ld=20
install meters for consumers who are not offered advanced meters by =20
competitive suppliers. Given the investments already made by Duquesne and=
=20
PECO  Energy, this recommendation is not onerous and it is achievable.
?
As important as installing time-of-use meters is ensuring reasonable access=
 =20
to those meters by all market participants. Competitive suppliers when=20
serving  customers should be allowed to lease the use of any time-of-use=20
meters that have  been deployed. Terms for leasing must be reasonable and=
=20
allow the offering of  competitive power products that allow customers to=
=20
decide whether and how to  change their usage.
?
Other recommendations
In addition to expanding PJM to  western Pennsylvania and increasing=20
demand-side response to market prices,  PennFuture recommends that a summit=
=20
of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation  be convened so that it may pu=
sh=20
for comprehensive federal legislation that would  remove barriers to=20
wholesale competition and cleaner energy on a national level.  Pennsylvania=
=20
has a lot at stake in ensuring that national markets are  competitive and=
=20
cleaner. Unfortunately, restructuring legislation is now in the  grips of=
=20
Washington gridlock. The Pennsylvania delegation can play an important  rol=
e=20
in fashioning national markets that help Pennsylvania steer clear of =20
icebergs.
?
We further recommend that PJM or the PUC investigate whether its auction =
=20
rules for the hourly spot market promote healthy wholesale competition. =20
Questions have been raised about whether the existing rules that allow the=
=20
last  unit dispatched to set the price of the whole pool are susceptible to=
 =20
anti-competitive strategic bidding. This matter is complicated and importan=
t.=20
It  should be considered carefully. The best means of doing so is to create=
 a=20
formal  process that allows all concerned parties an opportunity to comment=
.=20
Either PJM  of the PUC should create this opportunity.=20
?
Finally, the recent Pennsylvania Department of Revenue study provides ample=
 =20
reason to repeal the Revenue Neutral Reconciliation (RNR) surcharge to the =
=20
electricity Gross Receipts Tax (GRT). The RNR shrinks the purchasing power=
=20
of  the shopping credit and produces uncertainty in year-to-year supplier=
=20
offers  because the RNR changes each year to make up a deficit in direct=20
electricity tax  revenues to the General Fund. According to the Department =
of=20
Revenue, by fiscal  year 2004, sales tax and personal income tax gains alon=
e=20
from electric  competition are estimated to be over $47 million. Given that=
=20
an additional $10  million in state tax revenues would reduce the RNR rate =
by=20
one mill, and that  the decision on whether to eliminate the RNR will be ma=
de=20
in 2003, the  Legislature should consider phasing out the RNR at this time.
?
PennFuture believes that making these course corrections will avoid the =20
icebergs that lie ahead and continue Pennsylvania=01,s successful transitio=
n to =20
full electric competition.
