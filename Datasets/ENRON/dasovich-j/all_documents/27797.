Major life events often create complex money decisions for 
people who haven't been very involved in personal finance.
In  this article, we provide action steps to follow if you are

of a spouse,  divorce, or similar event. One tip: consolidate

4. You Don't Make Money Following the Crowd 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Today's tough economy still has some excellent short- and long-
term opportunities. That's the opinion of veteran investment 
manager Eugene Sit. In this probing question-and-answer, Mr. Sit 
identifies which stocks and sectors look appealing and why the 
next round of market leaders will "be a little bit like the old 
Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers."

5. Washington Turns to Stimulus
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Three developments in the nation's capital are likely to benefit 
investors, according to the Chief Strategist of Schwab
Capital Markets. One of these is the much-debated tax cut:
"If you strip away the political theater, it's clear to us that 
Washington has turned the corner from fiscal drag to stimulus."

8. Become a Smarter Option Trader with Schwab's
Unique Option Webcasts

Schwab, in conjunction with the Chicago Board Options Exchange 
(CBOE), recently hosted two Option Webcasts - online seminars 
focusing on the advantages of option trading. 

If you missed this live, you can still benefit from recordings, 
transcripts, slides and additional Q?from these programs.  
One webcast offers a round table discussion on fundamental 
strategies for the novice, while the other explores more 
sophisticated strategies for the advanced option trader.  
Both include presentations followed by extensive Q&A, and 
feature industry experts in-tune with today's volatile markets.
