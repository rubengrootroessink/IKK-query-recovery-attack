Karen-

I have attached a copy of my resume. I don't know if you were aware or not
but I am looking to pursue a position in Los Angeles.  I have spent the
first 8 years of my professional life working in Sacramento and I believe
now is a good time for me to explore other options.  I am very interested in
working in Government Relations in the private sector.  I would also be
interested in working in the Energy area.  Obviously I am no expert but I do
an elementary grasp of the issue.  If any of the IEP member companies were
looking for someone I would very much appreciate you forwarding my resume.
Please call me if you have any questions or want to talk further.  I am in
the office through Wednesday and available by cell phone 916-601-4907 the
remainder of this week and next.  I will be in Los Angeles the week of the
23rd on interviews.  Feel free to call me.

I appreciate anything you can do.
