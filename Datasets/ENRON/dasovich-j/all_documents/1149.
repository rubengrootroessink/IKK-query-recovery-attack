GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS ELECTRICITY CONSUMER RELIEF LEGISLATION
SACRAMENTO =01) Governor Gray Davis continued his commitment to easing the=
=20
burden of San Diego ratepayers by signing two major pieces of legislation=
=20
designed to stabilize the cost of electricity and streamline the siting=20
process for new power plants.=20

"One of the major achievements of this year's legislative session is our=20
aggressive response to California's energy challenge," Governor Davis said.=
=20
"My Administration did not create this problem, but we are 100-percent=20
committed to solving it. And, now, after a long, hot summer of unconscionab=
ly=20
high energy prices, relief is finally on the way."=20

AB 265 by Assemblywoman Susan Davis (D-San Diego) and Senator Deirdre Alper=
t=20
(D-Coronado) will stabilize the price of electricity for consumers and smal=
l=20
business (including schools and hospitals) in San Diego at 6.5 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. These rates will be retroactive from June 1, 2000 and extend=
=20
to December 31, 2003.=20

"In the short term, this will ease the uncertainty of San Diego energy=20
prices," Governor Davis said. "When it comes to predicting their electric=
=20
bills, San Diego consumers have been in the dark long enough. This is an=20
urgency measure. I am signing this bill today so that the PUC can take=20
immediate action at its meeting tomorrow."=20

As a result of this legislation, the average monthly bill for residential=
=20
customers in San Diego will be reduced to $68. Small businesses (all school=
s=20
and acute-care hospitals are included) will pay an average monthly bill of=
=20
$220. Medium businesses (consuming up to 72,000 kilowatt-hours a month) wou=
ld=20
also have a price cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. For large businesses,=
=20
AB 265 would allow for a negotiated payment plan with SDG&E over a longer=
=20
period of time.=20

AB 970 by Assemblywoman Denise Ducheny (D-San Diego) and Assemblyman Jim=20
Battin (R-La Quinta) will help California overcome the inadequate supply of=
=20
energy, one of the biggest obstacles to lower energy prices, by expediting=
=20
the siting process for new power plants and streamlining permitting for=20
upgrades of old facilities.=20

"Restrictions and red tape have presented a powerful disincentive to those=
=20
who would build more power generators in California," Governor Davis said.=
=20
"This bill will benefit consumers by increasing supply to meet growing=20
demand. It will also establish new programs to reduce demand."=20

Over the last three months, Governor Gray Davis' leadership has been=20

The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers=20
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between=
=20
50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to=
=20
reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.=20
On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton urgi=
