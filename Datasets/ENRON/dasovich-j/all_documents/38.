Hi Everyone,

Happy Friday! We have done the cohort assignments for spring. And I think
we accommodated all of your requests. We will do up something pretty and
put them in your mailboxes next week; but I know you are all anxious to get
your assignments, so I am attaching a list with your cohort assignment.
Please let me know if this is different that your request. If you did not
make a request, I cannot guarantee that we can make changes at this point.

Good luck studying for your finals!

Shawn
