On Friday, May 11th, the SCAQMD approved several significant changes to the=
=20
RECLAIM Program.  The key elements of these modifications are as follows:

For existing large power plants (greater than 50MW): bifurcation from the=
=20
rest of the RECLAIM market, requiring installation of Best Available Retrof=
it=20
Control Technology (BARCT) through compliance plans (to be installed no lat=
er=20
than 2003 for boilers and 2004 for turbines), and a temporary mitigation fe=
e=20
program.  Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the=
=20
payment of a mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) to the=20
District, which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction=20
projects to mitigate the air pollution effects.   These rule changes includ=
e=20
an environmental dispatch provision which requires prioritization of the us=
e=20
of cleaner emitting equipment first;
Initiation of a temporary, limited, pilot RECLAIM Air Quality Investment=20
Program (AQIP) for new power plants and structural buyers, allowing access =

mobile and area source credits;=20
Development of four new pilot credit generation rules which are voluntary a=
nd=20
are applicable to a specific type of mobile or area source emission reducti=

project, as summarized below:=20
- Rule 1631 applies to diesel-fueled captive marine vessels where the=20
existing marine engine is repowered or replaced with a new diesel-fueled=20
marine engine.=20
- Rule 1632 applies to marine vessels that are anchored in district harbors=
=20
or ports that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines to=20
provide power for lights, ventilation, loading, offloading, and other=20
"hotelling" operations.=20

auxiliary diesel engines while at distribution centers.=20
- Rule 2507 applies to diesel-fueled engines that are replaced with electri=
c=20
motors that are used to power agricultural pumps.=20

Summary of Impact of Modifications:

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) introduced these n=
ew=20
rules to reduce the impact of CA's electricity crisis ( the need to increas=
e=20
generation) on the RECLAIM trading credit (RTC) market and to do their part=
=20
to facilitate increased electricity supply.  These amendments are intended =
to=20
stabilize RTC prices by increasing supply, reducing demand, and increasing=
=20
trading information and accuracy. =20

There is one major "IF" built into these rules.  It involves the mitigation=
=20
fee program for existing large power plants.  IF the AQMD fails to produce=
=20
adequate reductions for the mitigation fee program, power producing=20
facilities would have allowances deducted from future year allocations to=
=20
cover their emissions.  In otherwords, they would be able to run at higher=
=20
levels this year, but may face severe curtailments in future years.

I do think there are a couple of noteworthy precedence within these rules. =
=20
One is the increased validity and recognition of need of alternate source o=
f=20
emission offsets.  This rule development had active participation by CARB a=
nd=20
the USEPA, who bought off on these provisions  The second is the use of the=
=20
mitigation bank for generators.  CARB has developed a similar bank for new=
=20
peaking turbines, but this program has much broader application.  And,=20
finally, this is the first time I've seen environmental dispatch provisions=
=20
codified. =20

For those of you that want more details see below.  I also have summaries o=
f=20
the rules and comments on the rules.  Please give me a call if you have=20
questions or want the documentation.  Please forward this to anyone I've=20
missed.

Power Producing Facilities

The proposed rule changes will separate power producing facilities from the=
=20
rest of the RECLAIM market while energy supply issues are being addressed.=
=20
Existing power plants will not rejoin the full RECLAIM program unless the=
=20
Governing Board, in a public hearing prior to July 2003, determines that=20
their re-entry will not result in any negative impact on the remainder of t=
he=20
RECLAIM universe or California=01,s energy security needs. The proposed rul=
es=20
would require a compliance plan for power producing facilities with capacit=
y=20
> 50 megawatts and require installation of best available retrofit control=
=20
technology at the earliest feasible date, but no later than 2003 for boiler=
s=20
or 2004 for turbines. In addition to the initial compliance plans, power=20
producing facilities are required to update information annually for 2001=
=20
through 2005 Compliance Years. Annual update reports provide AQMD with the=
=20
necessary information to access the impacts of emissions from these=20
facilities on the RECLAIM program and anticipate future demands of credits=
=20
from the Mitigation Fee Program. The proposed rules also include=20
environmental dispatch, which requires prioritization of the use of cleaner=
=20
emitting equipment first.=20
Trading would also be limited to isolate the rest of the market from credit=
=20
demands from power producing facilities. RTC purchases after January 11, 20=
01=20
could only be used to reconcile facility emissions if the RTCs are from=20
facilities under common ownership or have been generated from approved mobi=
le=20
source credit generation programs. Power Producing Facilities could sell=20
credits back to the District for a price not to exceed $7.50 per pound. Any=
=20
emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the payment of a=
=20
mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) to the District, which=
=20
will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction projects to mitigat=
e=20
the air pollution effects.=20
??????? Compliance Plans and Forecast Reports for other Facilities
For facilities other than large power producing facilities, compliance plan=
s=20
are proposed for facilities with 1999 or any subsequent year emissions=20
greater than or equal to 50 tons per year (tpy). These compliance plans=20
provide flexibility by including options for installing controls or=20
purchasing credits. The plans are being designed to allow as much flexibili=
ty=20
as possible, while requiring timely, enforceable commitments to be made to=
=20
ensure compliance. Facilities may provide several options in their original=
=20
plan submittal and can amend their compliance plans at any time. The Board=
=20
resolution directs staff to expedite review and approval of compliance plan=
s=20
and plan modifications (60 days for plans and 30 days for modification).=20
Facilities between 25 and 50 tpy emissions in 1999 will be required to subm=
it=20
informational forecast reports and update forecasts annually. Compliance=20
plans and forecast reports from the large and medium facilities will help=
=20
ensure adequate advance planning by facilities to meet the overall RECLAIM=
=20
program emission targets.=20
??????? Mitigation Fee Program
A temporary mitigation fee program through compliance year 2004 is proposed=
=20
for power producing facilities that exceed their RTC holdings. The facility=
=20
would pay $7.50 per pound of NOx to the District, which uses the funds to=
=20
achieve emission reductions from a variety of mobile source or other credit=
=20
generation avenues. The current rules require that excess emissions be=20
deducted from the subsequent year allocation to ensure that the environment=
=20
is not impacted by additional emissions. In this proposed amendment, staff=
=20
recommends the deduction of excess emissions from the second year to accoun=
t=20
for the lead time necessary for installation of control equipment at the=20
power producing facilities. When emission reductions are secured for the=20
Reserve by the District, the deduction would be credited back to the=20
facility. In addition, if the mitigation fee program achieves emission=20
reductions equal to at least 75 percent of those requested, in aggregate, b=
y=20
the second compliance year, an additional year can be granted to generate=
=20
reductions, thereby minimizing the need to further deduct future year=20
allocations.=20
??????? RECLAIM Air Quality Investment Program (AQIP)
Another short-term credit assistance program, the RECLAIM AQIP, is being=20
proposed for use by certain facilities through the 2004 compliance year. Th=
is=20
program would be available for structural buyers, such as new facilities an=
d=20
small facilities with installed controls at a minimum of BARCT. The RECLAIM=
=20
AQIP would provide structural buyers additional compliance options to reduc=
e=20
the overall demand for RTCs from the RECLAIM trading market. Facilities tha=
t=20
request participation would pay $7.50 per pound of NOx to use the RECLAIM=
=20
AQIP, if reductions are available. No deduction from allocations is propose=
d=20
for this program since emission reductions must be available prior to use.=

The District is pre-funding the AQIP program with emission reduction credit=

The Governing Board has allocated $2 million from the AES Settlement Fund t=

use to obtain emission reductions from marine vessels.=20
??????? Other Rule Changes
To help improve trade information, the proposed rules would require=20
identification of both the seller and buyer of RTCs after the completion of=
 a=20
trade. The rule includes registration requirements for pooled trading and=
=20
contractual agreements for future transfer of RTCs. In addition, timely=20
filing of trades is proposed to help facilitate market information.
