taxing e-commerce. And this week, after around 30 proposals were submitted =

commission-watchers unleashed a flurry of press releases and media events t=

of the submissions, which were called to meet a set of 18 criteria ranging=

from "meeting constitutional muster" to "radically simplifying the sales ta=

system," responded to Leavitt's plan. Also due on that date were comments t=

was being drafted. "Instead of constantly squabbling, you have important=20
groups within the commission working hard to get majority positions."=20
?????Because infighting has plagued the commission from its beginning, a=20
majority may be the most difficult endeavor many of these groups have worke=
d=20
for. The 19-member commission needs a two-thirds majority vote to approve a=
ny=20
recommendation, and the group already has shifted into pro- and anti-tax=20
factions, with only a few still undecided. The proposals are making their=
=20
rounds among the commission-members, and the next meeting is Dec. 14. While=
=20
there are a host of groups that have submitted their propositions it appear=
s=20
that three are getting the majority of the commission's attention (and one,=

specifically, because it was drafted by the group's chairman, Virginia Gov.=
=20
Jim Gilmore). Following is a synopses and analysis of the three plans that=
=20
have the best chance of succeeding:=20
=09Title: Streamlined Sales Tax System for the 21st Century (Zero-Burden Pl=
an)=20
Sponsor: National Governors' Association, National Conference of State=20
Legislatures, National Association of Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors,=
=20
Council of State Governments, International City County Management=20
Association. While the remaining member of the "Big Seven" local=20
organizations, the National League of Cities, has backed the proposal's=20
intent, it is waiting until its annual meeting in December to vote on=20
supporting it officially.
Description: The idea centers around establishing a "trusted third party," =
or=20
tax clearinghouse, to collect and remit sales taxes based on the purchaser'=
s=20
tax jurisdiction. When an online order is placed, the seller would notify t=
he=20
clearinghouse and credit card company to determine the jurisdiction of the=
=20
buyer. The third party would notify the seller of the appropriate tax amoun=
t,=20
the credit card company would collect the funds and then remit the tax to t=
he=20
clearinghouse. The clearinghouse would then distribute the funds to the=20
states and localities and would be paid by a percentage of what it collects=
.=20
The third parties would be licensed by the state and the necessary software=
=20
required of each vendor would be paid for by the state.
History: The plan was drafted after a series of marathon meetings by the=20
local organizations that argue they are jeopardized because of lost sales t=
ax=20
revenues from e-commerce. Organizers of the proposal, which is being touted=
=20
by Gov. Leavitt, say that regardless of the commission's final decision the=
y=20
will begin pushing the system to state legislatures for adoption. Under the=
=20
Internet Tax Freedom Act, no new taxes may be applied to e-commerce, but=20
existing taxes, such as sales and use taxes, are not covered. The sponsors=
=20
say they do not need the commission's go-ahead in order to implement the=20
system, which would be optional by state and would not require all 50 state=
s'=20
involvement to function. Comments: The plan is widely criticized by anti-ta=
x=20
advocates and those who believe that taxing e-commerce will stifle its=20
growth. Others say that the pro-tax movement is only supported by the=20
national government organizations and not their members, with Leavitt being=
=20
the notable exception, and criticize it for not receiving many other=20
individuals' support. But the organizations argue that unless states and=20
localities have the right to determine revenue-raising activities, control =
of=20
local services like education and law enforcement ultimately will be given =
to=20
the federal government. "Thomas Jefferson would roll over in his grave" if=
=20
that happens, Leavitt said.=20
=09Title: E-Freedom Coalition Proposal
Sponsors: The E-Freedom Coalition's membership involves over 20=20
organizations, including Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against=20
Government Waste, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Consumer Alert, Heritag=
e=20
Foundation, Progress and Freedom Foundation and State Policy Network.=20
Description: The group supports a ban on collection of sales taxes on=20
electronic commerce and the repeal of the 3 percent federal excise tax on=
=20
telecommunications. It also would ban discriminatory Internet taxation and=
=20
taxes on Internet access. The group endorses slashing local=20
telecommunications taxes and wants to see interstate telecom property taxes=
=20
reduced and controlled with federal protections. History: The E-Freedom=20
Coalition unveiled its proposal at a joint press conference with legislatio=
n=20
by House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-OH, that would ban Intern=
et=20
sales taxes. Kasich's Internet Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 3252, would make=
=20
permanent the three-year moratorium on discriminatory Internet taxes passed=
=20
in the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Fellow Ohio Republican John Boehner joined=
=20
Kasich in sponsoring the measure. Comments: Americans for Tax Reform's=20
Norquist has led the anti-tax movement on the commission. Stan Sokul, an=20
independent consultant for the Association for Interactive Media was also o=
n=20
hand to support the proposal. Advocates are promoting the plan by saying it=
=20
would protect consumers' privacy by not collecting personal information fro=
m=20
users to determine tax jurisdictions.=20
=09Title: No Internet Tax
Sponsor: Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, R, chairman of the Advisory Commission =
on=20
Electronic Commerce Description: Gilmore's proposal is almost identical in=
=20
ideology to the E-Freedom Coalition plan. He maintains Congress should ban=
=20
all sales and use taxes on e-commerce and protect businesses from state=20
income and business activity taxes simply because of their virtual presence=
=20
in a state. Gilmore also has proposed the elimination of the 3 percent=20
federal excise tax on telecommunications and has called for the federal=20
government to give states $1.7 billion each year for the lost revenue from=
=20
the repeal of sales taxes on e-commerce transactions. He also has proposed=
=20
that states be allowed to use federal welfare money to purchase computers a=
nd=20
Internet access for needy families.
History: Gilmore's outline was submitted to the policies and options paper=
=20
that the commission is preparing, not under the call for proposals suggeste=
d=20
by Leavitt. But because he is the chair of the commission and had maintaine=
d=20
that he would remain neutral, Gilmore's actions have received criticism fro=
m=20
many on the state and local side of the debate. But he has defended his=20
actions. "After hearing dozens of experts on an entire range of e-commerce=
=20
issues, I felt it was time to put forward my vision. It can be summarized i=
n=20
three words: No Internet Tax," Gilmore said in a recent speech. Observers=
=20
have speculated that Gilmore's plan could be meshed with the E-Freedom=20
Coalition's to come up with a proposal agreeable to both parties. And=20
suggestions such as the welfare provision even have appeased pro-tax groups=
,=20
which have said solutions such as those may be the most agreeable for a=20
consensus statement. Comments: The National Association of Counties and oth=
er=20
local groups remain opposed to the plan's provisions calling for the federa=
l=20
government to allot funds to localities. "The fact remains that Gilmore's=
=20
proposal means county officials will be even more dependent on state and=20
federal governments to fund their local services," said NACo's Executive=20
Director Larry Naake. "This isn't my idea of returning more control and=20
authority to the local citizen." =01*by Stephanie Lash
