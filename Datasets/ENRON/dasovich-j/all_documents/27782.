Hi Jeff,

Madeleine asked that I forward this to you at this email address.  Looks
like we may have a small group going to Mendocino in September (maybes for
Pat Scatena, Madeleine and Nora, and my husband and I are definitely going).
Let me know if you are interested.




I heard back from Ricochet Ridge (from Lari's executive assistant) that
the
weekend of September 21-23 (Friday through Sunday) would work best for
them
to host an advanced group.

We should probably confirm as soon as possible, and start looking for
accommodations, given that September is a popular time in Mendocino.

Her prices this year are $195.00 per person for an all-day ride (they
generally start at 9ish and finish at around 3:30 or 4:00).  We provide
our
own lunch, or for $10 more per person, the ranch will pack us lunch.
Four-hour rides are $125.00, and can include beach, redwoods or both.
The
all-day rides are great, because you can go a little farther and get a
nice
lunch break, usually with a view.  But another option would be to do a
four-hour ride each day, selecting either beach or forest, to reduce the
cost somewhat.

Please let me know if you can make it, and what days you would like to
ride
(Friday, Saturday and/or Sunday), and whether you prefer the all-day or
four-hour option.  When I know general numbers, we can decide if we
would
like to get a house (if any are available) or if a hotel/B&B option
would
work better.
