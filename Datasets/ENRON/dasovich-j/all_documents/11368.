Dear Silicon Valley Breakfast Club Member:

Just a reminder to join us for the April meeting of the Silicon Valley
Breakfast Club, scheduled for Tuesday, April 24, from 8:15am until 10am,
hosted by EPRI in their Cafeteria located on their campus at 3412 Hillview
Avenue in Palo Alto.

Our speaker this month is Bob Therkelsen, Manager of Special Projects
Engineering at the California Independent Systems Operator.  Mr. Therkelsen
will brief us on the ten generation facilities that have been approved
during the past 18 months and where each is in the construction process, and
the 14 generation facilities currently working through the CEC process.
Everyone agrees this new generation is a key part of the long-term solution
to the energy crisis.  Don't miss this presentation on major generation
facilities and how quickly each will come on-line!
For a map, please visit our website at www.svmg.org, under EVENTS.  Our host
requests attendees please park in the parking lot above Building 1.
