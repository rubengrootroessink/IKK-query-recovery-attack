Sure thing. Here's the pitch:

Looking for a new twist on  the California energy story?? A conflict that's 
not being  covered?

Tension is at fever pitch between the state's business community  and policy
makers/Davis Administration over the issue of direct access.  Simply put,
many forces are trying to kill direct access, which allows  businesses and
residential users to buy their energy from alternative energy  providers
instead of their local utility.? Yet for businesses this  summer, the option
to bypass their local utility if they can ink a better  energy deal somewhere
else may provide the thin margin that keeps them in  business.? And PG&E's
recent bankruptcy filing begs the question:  why not let someone else provide
power?

As California business screams  for relief, the Department of Water
Resources, legislature, utilities, some  consumer groups and the PUC continue
to erect barriers against direct  access-which has been in a state of
suspended animation since the passage of  AB1x.? Each player has its own
reasons to push for the demise of direct  access.??

A large coalition of business interests is fuming  (see direct access
coalition list below).? Already rocked by record  power prices and worried
about recession, they fear that if direct access is  not resuscitated soon
through emergency legislation, it will be one more  reason to raise prices,
lay off workers, or shut their doors.? And they  wonder: why are our state's
policymakers killing direct access at the time  businesses need it most as
they confront escalating power bills?? It is  widely assumed that the
Department of Water Resources has not contracted for  enough power this
summer to avoid paying high prices in the spot  market.? Yet, the more power
DWR doesn't need to buy because large users  have done it for themselves, the
less financial exposure the state  incurs.?

Last week, for the first time, Governor Davis suggested  that he may be
supportive of letting businesses shop for their own power, but  it is unclear
at this time how solid his support may be.? Meanwhile, the  Legislature
continues to run in circles and do everything it can to avoid  meaningful
action on this issue.? Direct access was one issue at the  center of the
fissure between Assembly Republicans when they replaced their  leadership two
weeks ago.? Senator Bowen's much-awaited "clean-up" bill,  SB 27x, has been
more than a disappointment-in fact it's perceived as  ensuring there will be
no customer choice.

But don't take my word.  Edelman can arrange interviews with the California
Chamber of Commerce,  California Retailers Association, California
Manufacturers & Technology  Association, Calpine and other organizations
fighting to preserve direct  access as well as individual
businesses/organizations who have chosen to  bypass their local utilities and
cut their own power deals in order to reap  huge savings and/or gain
certainty about their energy budgets.? These  companies include high tech,
hotel and grocery chains, school districts, and  large retailers.?

This is a timely, controversial story that needs  to be told-and it hasn't
truly been covered so far by the mainstream  media.? Please contact Erica
Manuel or Stevan Allen at Edelman Public  Relations Worldwide at (916)
442-2331 to arrange interviews or receive more  information.
