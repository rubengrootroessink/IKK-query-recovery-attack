Hello,

It's the last CATERED DINNER of the semester.  As a special treat the Wells
Fargo room just got its carpet cleaned.  It looks really neat.  If you
wanted you can eat off it, but I don't suggest it.  Plus sitting at a table
is more convenient than having to bend down to the floor to scoop up food.

Anyway, tonight's dinner is called:  DELECTABLE DELIGHTS!

It's a mysterious name, but it's got something for everyone.  I think
you'll like it.  But please, don't drop anything on the clean carpet.

Thanks.
