Dave--I suggest you run this document by Jeff Dasovich before it hits the 
street.  I would want Jeff (and possibly Mike Day) to review to be sure that 
it is consistent with our "official" regulatory message in CA.  Also, I 
wonder if Peggy has any comments.  

I'd like to see the final version after regulatory and PR have weighed in.  
Thanks.  MDS

Dave, 

Thanks for a copy.  This looks good to me, but please run this by Peggy 
Mahoney in PR and/or Mike Smith in Legal to ensure that we are totally 
"clean" in a delicate market situation.

Marty,

I heard through the grapevine that you were taking a look at the California 
market.  I have just completed a "White Paper" that I am going to use as part 
of my sales pitch for EEIS.  I have shown it to John Woodman and some of the 
gas commodity guys; who claim to like it.  I am under no allusions that any 
of this is new to you, but I thought you might want to take a look.

Dave C.
