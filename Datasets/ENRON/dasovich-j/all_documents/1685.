Okay gang,



I finally got home and hit the books.  I recorded the suggestions using
track changes in Word.

I made a couple of suggested changes to Kimberly's (just added a sentence
or two).

Jimmy, I changed some of your wording (cash sucking machine) and added a
few things that I saw in the financial reports.

Call me if there is a problem 925-362-0210.

Thanks,

Dylan
