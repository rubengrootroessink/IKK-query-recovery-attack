Thank you for your emailed registration for the Lawrence H. Summers event
on December 6, 2000.

Because your request was within the first 300 emailed registrations, you
are entitled to receive a ticket which will allow you to attend this event
in the Andersen Auditorium.  Your ticket can be picked up at the Dean's
Suite, Student Services Bldg. Room 520, on Tuesday, November 28 and
Wednesday, November 29 during office hours from 9am to 5pm.

Ticketed seating in Andersen Auditorium will be conducted on a first come,
first served basis, and late comers may need to be prepared to stand at the
back of the Auditorium.  Seating will begin approximately 30 minutes prior
to the talk.  All ticket holders will be admitted at the upper
entrance.  Prior to admittance, a queue will be formed in front of the
doors of the upper level so that early arrivers will get the first choice
of seats.

Please remember to bring your ticket to this event.

Thank you.

The Dean's Staff
