The North American energy industry is facing some of the biggest challenges
in its history. Many important decisions need to soon be made by
policymakers to smooth the transition to a competitive marketplace in order
to address these critical challenges at this crucial moment in the
development of restructured markets.

Recognizing the need for stakeholder input, the U.S. Department of Energy
and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC)
invite all public officials and industry stakeholders to attend the North
American Summit on Harmonizing Business Practices in Energy Restructuring.
The Summit will be held from November 29 to December 1, 2000, in Dallas,
Texas.

The Summit is designed to tackle the fundamental issues that lead to a
competitive marketplace.  Your expertise and participation are critical to
the success of this effort.  The Summit is designed to maximize interaction
between public officials and industry stakeholders.

As this will be the only joint meeting hosted by DOE and NARUC this year,
early registration is strongly encouraged. To register, go to
http://www.energymarkets.org.

Remarks from The Honorable Bob Rowe, President of NARUC and Commissioner for
the State of Montana, on the importance of the Summit:

"We now have a better understanding of some of the challenges we face in
energy restructuring.  The development of different business practices by
different agencies and network companies could become a significant
impediment to efficiently doing business across many different network
systems.  This is an issue not only for suppliers who must do business on
many networks but also for utilities who must increasingly face the
challenge of consolidating diverse network systems.  Obviously the main
beneficiary of harmonizing such efforts is the consumer."

Please send this email message to colleagues who would benefit from
receiving information about the Summit.
