Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plans to raise additional capital to offset 
the mounting costs of wholesale energy in the California market and complete 
the divestiture of its generation assets, allowing it to charge its retail 
customers market rates, according to filings the company has made at the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

In an 8-K filing, PGOCorp. told the SEC that its utility subsidiary may issue 
long-term debt to finance the high costs of wholesale electricity that 
plagued California's deregulated market this summer. In addition, PGOfiled an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) on Sept. 8 
requesting the authority to raise an additional $1.4 billion in short-term 
financing, it told the SEC. This would be in addition to $1.7 billion in 
short-term financing that the PUC has allowed PGOto raise, as well as an 
existing $1 billion revolving credit facility the company has used to support 
commercial paper issuance.
