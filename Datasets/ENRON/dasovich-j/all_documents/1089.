Subject: Contact with Prominent UC Berkeley Energy Economist

Greetings Dr. Gobbo:

If my memory serves, you should have arrived back in Italy, or will return 
soon.  Since we met, I have spoken with Severin Borenstein, who is intimately 
involved with California's electricity restructuring (melodrama?) and a 
renowned energy economist  at UC Berkeley.  Severin has offered to serve as a 
contact for you as you continue to take on the formidable task of 
restructuring your country's electric industry.  I've included his contact 
information below.  And, of course, if there is ever anything I can do for 
you, do not hesitate to contact me.  

All the best,
Jeff
