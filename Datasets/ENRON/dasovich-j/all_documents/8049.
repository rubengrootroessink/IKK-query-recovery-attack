Dan/Marty:  We got together (kingerski, dasovich, black, curry, smith) and 
discussed the EES presentation.  

Jeff indicated that he is incorporating many inputs from many different 
places but the presentation agrees with what he has in his most recent draft.

Jeff Dasovich is going to cc the final draft at 3PM PST today for more 
comments.  With are target of sending on to Governor at 7PM this evening,

If you have any further comments send them to me and I will incorporate them 
in comments to jeff.

Scott
