Dear Haas Community,

From 6:00 PM Friday, December 15th, until 7:00 AM  Tuesday, Jan 2nd,
portions of the  Haas  network will be shut down  for  upgrade   to
switched 100 Megabit/second service.

Areas affected by this extended outage will be the lower level of the
library, (the east end of the 2nd  floor Student Services
wing)   including  laptop docking stations in the area and all HCS lab
computers in the carrels along the east wall.  The inoperative stations
will be indicated by signs.

Should you experience any problems with computing services in other areas,
please contact   helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
