Our messages are getting a little mixed.   So .. to that end, can we have a 
day or two to:  (1) figure out whether we want a reverse auction, competitive 
bidding for PLR, a GCIM-like mechanism? and (2) rationalize the various 
mechanisms if want it all.  

I'm confident that we can rationalize all of these mechanism--e.g, we can 
limit the percentage of load put up for auction, etc. if we put our minds to 
it.  However, we haven't done so yet.  

We will discuss this tomorrow in SFO.
