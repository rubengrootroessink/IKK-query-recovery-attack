THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20

Ben Zycher from the RAND Corporation used the following line in his talk at=
=20
the WPTF General Meeting in Phoenix a few weeks ago. The story takes place =
in=20
the good ol' days of the Soviet Union when Brezhnev was Premier.? Brezhnev=
=20
and the rest of the Politburo one fine May Day were watching the tanks and=
=20
missiles pass by the Kremlin Wall, when Leonid noticed in the middle of the=
=20
parade a truck carrying a group of civilians.? He turned to Dmitri Ustinov,=
=20
the Defense Minister, and asked, "Who are they?"? Ustinov replied, "Those a=
re=20
our economists.? You just wouldn't believe their destructive potential."=20

This is appropriate for our time and our situation.? The economists descend=
ed=20
upon us when the California market was designed, but we know not from where=
.?=20
Aliens?? Since weaving conspiracy theories is a popular past time in=20
Sacramento ("We just know they are gouging us, them bullies"), I believe th=
at=20
one must do the same by following the money.? I'm not talking about the=20
campaign contributions in Gray Davis' pocket. The most money has gone from=
=20
power sales in California to the Canadian Province of British Columbia.? It=
=20
was a plot the Canadians hatched. I mean, look at Governor Davis.? He looks=
=20
kind of BC-ish.? Skinny and lanky, wimpy hair, and a hesitation in his=20
speech. He talks their language: a mix of misspelled French ("meet me at th=
e=20
centre"), English, and Eh(?).? One night in 1996, the BC government secretl=
y=20
sent us some economists by the truckload to destroy California.? The=20
utilities probably paid for the bus tickets.? I happen to know that Frank=
=20
Wolak, Chair of the ISO Market Surveillance Committee once lectured at a=20
University in Vancouver, B.C..? What more evidence do you need?? The BC=20
Government sent us cheap hydro power, sold at inflated market prices so tha=
t=20
they could do what the citizens of California wanted to do with their budge=
t=20
largess =01( build roads, schools, and hospitals. They didn't think we coul=
d=20
figure out their plot, but we did.? Now is the time for California to=20
counter-attack.? We'll send them some of our politicians, a bipartisan grou=
p=20
including a few who can add, and some of our select energy thugs from the=
=20
CPUC and the Blind Oversight Board.=20

Speaking of times and situations, there was a time when discussing the ISO,=
=20
words such as "communist" and "Nazi" were only uttered, by my pal, Carl=20
Imparato,.? We would shake our heads, and chuckle at Carl's extremism.? We=
=20
aren't laughing now.? The descriptors seem to arise again and again in poli=
te=20
conversation by a wider circle of people.? I watch with utter amusement=20
(because the alternative is retching breakfast) at the demagoguery of the I=
SO=20
Governing Board, the Market Despair Team, the Governor's office, and some=
=20
members of the California Legislature. Like an audience watching a tragedy=
=20
from hell, we scream aloud, "These people are crazy!"? And indeed, they are=
.?=20
Mr. President is not helping us at all by continuing to wrangle over who ge=
ts=20
the musical Chair at FERC =01( Bubba Curt or Bubba Patrick.? Listen to us, =
Mr.=20
President.? Let Bubba Curt keep the reigns for a year or two, and let Bubba=
=20
Patrick take a seat at the table.? We need someone with a shockproof BS=20
detector.? Someone who can honestly field a motion to dismiss the Californi=
a=20
ISO.? The time is long overdue to shoot this horse in the head.=20

Not all is evil.? This week in Houston, the resource capital of California,=
 I=20
visited the trading floor folks at Dynegy, before attending the WTPF Board=
=20
meeting.? The coolest thing I saw, besides all the neat gadgets on each=20
trader's desk, was the coffee machine.? Brother Jolly Hayden showed me how =
to=20
use it.? You pick the type of coffee you want.? The contents of the coffee=
=20
are in a shot-glass sized plastic tub with a foil top.? I picked Venezuelan=
=20
#6 Decaffeinated Waxy Crude.? The tub is placed inside the brewing machine,=
=20
and the start button is pushed.? Presto, coffee drips from the spout into a=
=20
waiting cup.? I asked Jolly, "How did the hot water get mixed into the grou=
nd=20
beans?"? He removed the tub from the machine and showed me a pin prick hole=
=20
made in the foil top, and another that was made at the bottom.? Is that nea=
t,=20
or what?=20

I would like to buy a brewing machine just like the Dynegy coffee machine,=
=20
but a little larger.? I would set up a booth in Sacramento, on the corner o=
f=20
11th and "L", and bark out to passing members of the Legislature, "Free spa=
ce=20
shuttle. Come and see life on other planets."? They would jump at the chanc=
e=20
to visit other planets.? I would seat them in the machine, push the start=
=20
button, and voila.? Dripping out would be the essence of democracy.? Don't=
=20
worry about the holes needed at the top and the bottom.? They are already=
=20
there, and quite enlarged.=20

Back to my day at Dynegy.? Trade floors might seem similar across companies=
,=20
but the small differences speak to the management style embraced by the cre=
w=20
and its leaders.? Each electric trading desk, for various parts of the=20
country, is set up a little bit differently.? For example, some desks have =
a=20
person doing asset-backed trading, but some don't.? When I arrived at 6 a.m=
.,=20
Houston time, the Eastern desk was busy in its trade day.? The Western folk=
s=20
hadn't arrived, yet.? Later, I sat with Randy LeForce of the Western desk.?=
=20
"Captain LeForce, to you", he told me.? He could talk big because Dave=20
Francis, who sits next to Randy, and hangs witty quotes from the ceiling=20
above his head ("Even a blind pig could make money in this market"), was on=
=20
vacation.? As the pace of the trading gathered steam, Randy kept an eye on=
=20
all the different people working the Western trading desk.? The Captain=20
worked it like a maestro.=20

During my visit, some Dynegy folks came up to me, introduced themselves, an=
d=20
said how much they enjoyed the Friday Burrito.? I'll tell you what.? There=
=20
are few things in life that give me as much satisfaction.? Complete strange=
rs=20
who tell you that something you do makes them feel good, well, it doesn't g=
et=20
any better than that.? Garrison Keillor, the well-known author of Lake=20
Woebegone Days, and NPR radio entertainer once said a writer should have an=
=20
audience.? Not everyone in the world should be in the audience, but an=20
audience nonetheless of some people.? I now know what he means.? And the=20
people I met on the trading floor felt like they knew me, and shared with m=
e=20
their thoughts and opinions on a lot of things.?? Often they asked me, "Are=
=20
those California people really that crazy?"=20

Since last week, you might have noticed the pace at the FERC has picked up,=
=20
somewhat.? Last Friday the FERC issued an Order on possible refunds for=20
alleged overcharges by parties selling to the ISO last January.? That was=
=20
news worthy.? Then, on Wednesday, the FERC issued an Order to remove barrie=
rs=20
to additional electric generation in the West.? The Order admits that it=20
won't change the dire situation in the West, but these are steps in the rig=
ht=20
direction.? The FERC also issued on Wednesday a show-cause order to AES and=
=20
Williams regarding the maintenance of RMR units that were called by the ISO=
=20
in April and May of 2000.? That is a serious case that we must watch=20
closely.? Also this week, the California Senate kicked off its own=20
investigation (this will be the tenth such investigation of the California=
=20
markets to uncover alleged price manipulation).? The Senate Committee will=
=20
have subpoena rights, and if I understand it correctly, they plan to subpoe=
na=20
individuals.? Sounds like a Kangaroo Court and a Three-Ring Circus, to me.=
=20
Thursday, Secretary Abraham stated in a congressional hearing that the West=
=20
would certainly experience power outages this summer. Finally, an LA Times=
=20
reporter asked me if I had heard that a small QF company had filed for=20
seizure of SCE property to satisfy an outstanding debt.? That would be step=
=20
one of the bankruptcy cha-cha.? All in all, a typical week among crazy=20
people.=20

My favorite regulator, the California PUC, issued an Order in the Utilities=

=20
the text of the order is unremarkable, the data tables bring up to date, as=
=20
of March 8, the outstanding liabilities of PG&E and SCE.=20

The PG&E commercial paper obligation due as of March 8 increased by $354=20
million since January 31, for a total default amount of $790 million.? QF=
=20
purchases increased by $280 million for the same five-week period, now=20
totaling $651 million.? The ISO payments increased $934 million, now totali=

$1.5 billion, and the direct access charge backs for negative PX credits=20
increased $214 million, now totaling $433 million.? PG&E's total default=20

The SCE balance is as follows: The commercial paper obligation that is due =
as=20
of March 8 increased by $260 million since January 31, for a total default=

amount of $401 million. SCE defaulted on a significant amount of long-term=

yet to be collected from SCE customers for DWR purchases.=20

There is little question that the QFs are taking it on the chin, big time.?=
=20
In the last five weeks, between January 31 and March 8, the defaulted=20
payments to the QF owners from both utilities has increased $630 million.?=
=20
The total QF default for both utilities as of March 8 stands at $1.5=20
billion.? Does anyone wonder why 1500 MW of QF capacity has shut down in=20
California?? Without these payments being made very soon, I would expect th=

amount of shut down QF capacity to easily double, or more.? Why would these=

Art O'Donnell, editor and associate publisher of the well-known and widely=
=20
read California Energy Market (CEM), is looking for traders willing to=20
participate in his survey in exchange for receiving an advanced copy.? The=
=20
Survey is a regular feature in CEM. The information collected by Art is=20
matched against the responses of the other people he interviews and some=20
posted sources (Pricewaterhouse Coopers; BPA=01,s daily offerings, for=20

The WPTF Board of Directors has allowed me to publicize this offering, and =

about off-peak? How has that changed since this morning? Oh yeah, why is=20
that? Anything else I should know?'"=20

The WPTF Board asked Art to explain how the information he collects would b=

protected since so many marketers and generators are under State data=20
subpoenas.? Art replied, "The Constitution of the State of California=20
provides for a blanket immunity against government intrusions for news=20

we would 1) refuse to divulge anything other than the already published=20
accounts, 2) send back a copy of the Constitution, 3) contact the attorneys=
