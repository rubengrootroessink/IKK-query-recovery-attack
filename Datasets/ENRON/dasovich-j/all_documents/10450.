		 Subject: Interconnection Meeting

On Monday, April 9th, Mona, John and I would like to meet with all of you to 
review the agreements that we have and will have selected by then for 
interconnection purposes with the various ILECs.  The meeting will take place 
in EB 4746.

We will forward specific materials to you in advance of the meeting for your 
review.  It is our objective to obtain your sign-off regarding the selected 
agreements.  In the event that there are significant issues remaining, we 
would like to chart the appropriate course of action -- i.e., either pursue 
negotiation with individual ILECs or opt-in and seek specific amendments.  

We would like to begin at 1pm.  Please reserve the duration of the afternoon 
as we have several states' agreements to review.  Also, I would appreciate it 
if you would RSVP.  Thanks.

Regards,

Lara
