Karen:

Regarding the LA Chamber, Jeff should know that So Cal Edison drives their
energy policy.  Steve Franks is in regular communication with the Chamber
staff.

The LA Chamber has lobbied Sacramento legislators urging them to support
Edison positions.

I have a call into my contact at Wal-Mart -- they didn't call yesterday.  As
soon as I hear something, I will let you know.  In the meantime, I will fax
a copy of the solutions paper to him for review.
