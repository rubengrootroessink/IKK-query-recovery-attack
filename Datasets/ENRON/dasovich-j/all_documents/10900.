Blackout Busters meeting on Tuesday, April 10,
3:00-5:00pm at EPRI Auditorium

This is not to be confused with the Business
Continuity meeting, which will continue to meet at its
regular meeting time of Mondays prior to the full
committee meeting.

At the Energy Committee meeting on Monday, April 09,
2001, Jerry Meek of Roche pointed out the urgent need
for sharing and exchanging information on how to
actually curtail demand.

Some of the Energy Committee members decided to meet
and discuss these technical issues, and possibly
conduct 'pilot' drills similar to the ones that were
conducted last year.  There is, of course, more need
to be prepared this year, and any voluntary load
reduction from any end user is going to help us all by
reducing the frequency and length of rolling
blackouts. Therefore, it is time to resurrect Blackout
Busters.

We will begin with sharing how our companies are
preparing to curtail demand, from lighting to HVAC to
other miscellaneous loads (e.g., water heaters,
elevators, etc). And in the HVAC area, where systems
configurations can be very different, how some of us
are addressing energy management.

Those of you who have interest in sharing and
exchanging experiences are welcome to this meeting. I
apologize for the short notice. If you can not attend
the meeting for any reason but have suggestions for
the group, please forward it to me for sharing, or go
to the www.blackoutbusters.com website and post it
there.

Thank you.
