Here are some comments from SCE in redline form.  I struck out Jeff's and
Barbara's sections.  I'm assuming that Delaney will insert Barbara's
revised version, and Jeff's was duplicative of Dorothy's.  Linda Sherif has
not had a chance to review the changes to the self-gen section.  She and I
discussed a new definition for (a), and her language addresses my concern.
She will be getting that language to you after she reviews with Mike Kahl.
She said she would let me know if Mike revises the language.

I wish there was more time to do a more comprehensive edit.

All-
I have merged everyone's seperate language into one document - this may be
easier to work from today, especially for those of you on the phone.

Talk to you all at 3:00.

Thanks,
Delaney
