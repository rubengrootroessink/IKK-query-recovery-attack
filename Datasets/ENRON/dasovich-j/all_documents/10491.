Aaron, here is the comparison exhibit between the current version of AB 21X
and the preferred direct access coalition draft bill. I believe it is
correct, please check it and advise me of any edits that are required.
Given Lawrence's terrible rewrite of the bill, it sounds like we should
organize a conferenceat least.  Let me know what you plan on doing.   This
is a word document, I don't know why the icon looks this way.  Call me if
you have trouble opening it.   Thanks, Mike
