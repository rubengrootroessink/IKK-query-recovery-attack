I am very, very sad to report that Dave Engelbrecht, EvMBA '00, passed away
on June 4.  Dave had a heart attack two weeks ago and was in a coma until
he passed away.  Dave was a wonderful, fun, giving, and active person,
who's commitment to charitable works was enormous.  Dave was a Vice
President at Schwab and the EvMBA Social Chair for two years while he was
in the program.  He will be sorely missed.

For those of you who knew him, I have attached, below, an announcement that
comes from Schwab.

Regards,

Diane

It is with great sadness that we mourn the passing of Dave Engelbrecht, our
colleague and friend. A memorial service will be held next Tuesday, June 12
at 4 PM at The First Unitarian Universalist Church at 1187 Franklin Street
in San Francisco. A reception will follow the service from 5 to 7 PM at the
St. Francis Yacht Club, On the Marina, San Francisco. Directions to follow.
Dave's family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, contributions be made
to the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving (Dave Engelbrecht Memorial Fund).
The Memorial Fund will establish an endowment to support scholarships at the
Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley where
Dave earned his MBA last June. As you may know, Dave was instrumental in
the creation of the Schwab Fund for Charitable Giving and served as an
officer to the Fund, in addition to his other responsibilities at Schwab.
Contributions can be sent to:
