Jim and Jeff
I received this from Mike Smith.  He also called me.  I haven't been in the 
loop on this stuff and am not sure what to do with it.

PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Mike and Sue--attached is the Excel spreadsheet of EES/EEMC trading info that 
we are considering turning over to the Cal PUC in response to the Subpoena.  
EPMI will not be turning over similar wholesale data, at least not at this 
point.

In that you have done much of the EES retail regulatory work in California, 
please let me know if you see any regulatory implications in turning over 
this info.  It seems to me that by doing so we would be at least tacitly 
admitting to the jurisdiction of the PUC to request and receive this info.  
By doing so, would we be undoing groundwork you have already laid?  Would we 
be jeopardizing our right to object to similar requests in the future?  Would 
we be opening any doors to more of this type of regulation?  My concern is 
that this info is innocuous and irrelevant now, but what about future 
requests for info that we do care about?

Also, what do the FERC info we learned on Friday and the new ISO price caps 
do to our response strategy?

Please respond asap--we need to be able to tell the PUC something in the next 
48 hours.  You can call me at 713 853 9503.  Thanks.  MDS
