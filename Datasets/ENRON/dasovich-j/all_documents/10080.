Subject:  CLEC Certification Status

We have filed for CLEC Status in all states, with the exception of NV,
UTand NJ.  UT and NJ will be filed by Monday, March 19.  NV will be filed
by Monday, March 26.  Please note that OR and WA must go through formal
application process, as opposed to letter transfer, as originally thought.
This will not delay ETI certification significantly in WA, but it will
delay certification in OR until June.  Please see below for additional
information.

Tier 1:  Applications have been filed.  CA is good to go.  NY and TX,
action is expected on or before May 1.

California-We have submitted our tariff  for ETI, which is now effective.
ETI has CLEC status and a tariff.  We are good to go on conducting business
and beginning interconnection negotiations.  Government Affairs needs to
notify the Commission when we commence operations, so please keep us
apprised.
New York-We have filed a tariff under EBS on March 1, which has CLEC
authority.  The tariff will become effective 30 days after filing.  We will
submit a letter requesting transfer of the EBS authority to ETI.  That
should require no more than 30 days for the state to act, May 1.
Texas-We filed our application on March 7.  No tariff is required.  The
protest period end March 28.  Staff will issue its recommendation on April
2.  The Commission will act on or before 5/1.

Tier 2:  Applications have been filed.  We still have to keep pressure on
VA, GA and IL Commissions to process as quickly as possible.

District of Columbia-Our application has been filed.  We should receive
approval by April 2.
Virginia-Our application was filed on March 7.
Georgia-Our application was filed on March 9.
Illinois-Our application was filed by March 5.  I have a hearing scheduled
for April 4.
Colorado-No certification required and no tariff required.

Tier 3:  MA, NJ, FL and LA are on a fast-track approval process,
early-to-mid April.  WA, NV and UT will be processed in May.  OR will take
until June.

Massachusetts-  Filing was made on March 7.  Expectation is that tariffs
will go into effect by April 9.
New Jersey-  Filing will be made on Monday, Mar 19.  Expectation that we
will have approval within 30 days, but not longer than 45 days.
Florida- We submitted our letter transfer request.  We have submitted our
tariff.  We expect an order to be issued by April 2 or 3.  There is a
17-day protest period, after which a final order is issued approving ETI as
a CLEC.  We expect to see an order by April 20.
Oregon-EBS has CLEC/IXC authority in Oregon.  We filed a letter requesting
to transfer the CLEC authority to ETI on February 19.  The Commission
subsequently advised us to submit an application, which will be filed on
Monday, March 19.  No tariff is required.  The Commission will not act upon
our application until June, when they process all such requests in a batch.
We will file a request with the state commission, in the interim, to allow
EBS to do business as ETI for local exchange service.  We will also begin
our interconnection negotiations as EBS with the understanding that the
agreement will be transferrable to ETI once certificated as a CLEC.
Washington-EBS is licensed as a CLEC/IXC.  On February 26, we filed a
letter with the WUTC requesting to transfer the CLEC authority to ETI.  The
Commission has advised us to submit an application, which if it is not
significantly modified from the EBS filing, will be acted upon within 30
days, but no longer than 45 days.  We expect to file that application next
week.
Utah-Application will be filed on Monday, March 19.  Expect Commission
action within 60 days.
Louisiana-We submitted our application on Tuesday, March 13 to transfer
existing local exchange authority from EBS to ETI.  We are on the
Commissions agenda (3/16).  We will advise you asap about any action that
was taken.
Nevada-Expect to file by 3/26.  Expect Commission to act within 60 days.










We have been advised that the state commissions of OR and WA will not
accept our request to transfer existing authority for EBS to ETI unless we
go through the formal application process again.  We expect to file the
applications in both states within the next week.  The WA Commission will
likely approve our application within 30-45 days of filing.  The OR
Commission has a quarterly batch process which will not happen again until
June.  There is no ability to expedite their processing of our application
any earlier.  However, counsel has advised that they will file a letter
with the OR Commission next week that will indicate that EB
