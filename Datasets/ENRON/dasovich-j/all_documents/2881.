This morning the FERC had its meeting to discuss events in California and =
=20
the FERC=01,s response to them. The following is a summary of the remarks o=
f=20
the  four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered:=20
?
Major features
?
1.? Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent,  non-stakeholde=
r=20
boards.

2.? Continued significant role for the presidents of PX/ISO, who  should be=
=20
made voting members.

3.? Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs  (although no=
=20
explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance  on spo=
t=20
markets has been problematical.

4.? As an independent exchange, the PX will be free to design the  products=
=20
desired by the market.

5.? The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary  measure.=
=20
Single price for all offers below $150. However, no bid above $150 will  se=
t=20
the price for all generators. A seller can bid anything it wants. Allowing =
=20
generators to receive their as-bid price will allow high-cost generators to=
 =20
participate in the market. However, the generator will be required to=20
provide  confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids ove=
r=20
$150 through  12/31/02.

6.? The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling =20
coordinator=01,s schedule, with a penalty applied for deviations which exce=
ed 5%=20
As  an incentive, the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who=20
comply with  the tolerance band.

7.? Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order  would=
=20
eliminate the ISO=01,s price cap authority.

8.? Beginning 1/1/01, the prospect of refunds will be available. =20
?
Commissioner Hebert
?
Due to a technical problem when I called in, I heard only part of his =20
remarks. He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order=
,=20
but  is troubled by some of its features. The $150 cap is questionable,=20
whether  described as a "Soft cap" or as a "hard cap."
His concern is that it will  clearly discourage new investment in generatio=
n.=20
He therefore recommended that  the $150 cap should be escalated on a regula=
r=20
basis (perhaps every six months)  until it reaches at least $250.=20
?
He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC =
=20
on 1/16/01. These filings should address the major aspects of the Order=20
issued  today.=20
?
Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds, alleging that it was =20
"disingenuous" to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy.=20
?
Commissioner Breathitt=20
?
Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the  orderT=
he=20
order is based on a market approach. "In choosing our market-based  approac=
h,=20
it is our goal to guide the markets to self-correct and not  re-institute=
=20
command and control regulation.? "We have all worked too hard,  too long, t=
o=20
have this result."
?
Commissioner Massey
?
Sixty-five years ago, the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and =
=20
reasonable.? There is no exception for market-based approaches. He will =20
concur, as the order does find that prices have been unjust and=20
unreasonable.  The order does insure that prices should return to being jus=
t=20
and reasonable.  Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 18-24=
=20
month forward product  designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law=
=20
dictated that prices had to  be just and reasonable.

The $150 is a "soft cap" and allows a generator to bid above it, but if  it=
=20
does, it will not set the price which other generators receive. He invites =
=20
comments on this issue.=20

With regard to retroactive refunds, the Office of the General Counsel  has=
=20
prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not=
 =20
have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October 2=
, =20
2000. Invites comments on this issue.=20
California needs new generation and  transmission and the siting authority=
=20
belongs to the state. California must do  its part to ensure that customers=
=20
do, in fact, benefit from competitive markets  that ensure just and=20
reasonable prices.=20
He is not yet confident that the  Commission has taken all necessary steps.=
=20
?
Chairman Hoecker
?
He strongly supports the order.=20

Comments are due in three weeks. This is no time to pull punches. He  cited=
=20
the San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were,?  "out o=
f=20
synch with the needs of the digital economy."? For FERC regulators  who are=
=20
used to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies,  "th=
is=20
was a real eye-opener."=20

Average citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had  no=
=20
competitive alternatives. It was unfair to them and, "there is plenty of =
=20
responsibility for this meltdown to go around."=20

"If I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income, or a  sma=
ll=20
business owner living on a small profit margin, or a school administrator =
=20
dealing with a tight budget, the doubling of my bill would make me want my=
=20
money  back, or to at least ensure that this won=01,t happen again in the=
=20
future."
Many  who expected this order, expected "a lynching and the transfer of lar=
ge=20
amounts  of money. They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated th=
e=20
market and  order the disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains. As our legal=
=20
opinion  indicates, that=01,s not going to happen."? Today=01,s order offer=
s a=20
thoughtful  way back to a rational basis for buying and selling power in th=
e=20
West.

We are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of =20
market power. The order makes better market monitoring going forward a =20
fundamental part of FERC=01,s proposal.? If evidence of such behavior is =
=20
brought forward, FERC will act on that information. "However, we can=01,t d=
elay =20
work on a market fix while searching for the culpable parties."=20

Hoecker believes that, "strong federal action is both warranted and =20
important at this moment."? "The bulk power grid must be made to work =20
efficiently across the entire West."=20

"Competition is at risk, make no mistake about that. In view of the =20
California experience, several states are reconsidering or shelving plans t=
o =20
implement competition."? Legislators will want to retain the possibility of=
 =20
returning to the old days of vertically-integrated utilities.? "The =20
California experience has been instructive, but not helpful=01(to the=20
meandering  implementation of competition throughout the nation."=20

The state=01,s markets have not been "mistakenly federalized" as alleged  b=
y=20
some. The markets are regional. California=01,s access to interstate power =
=20
supplies is critical, as was made evident by recent events. If we do things=
 =20
right, California will not be a federal enclave designed to satisfy our=20
market  predilections, it will be a workable and competitive market that=20
benefits  consumers.=20

"This is a strong order. It needs to be a strong order. We expect to  have =
a=20
strong order in December, and the public needs it."=20
