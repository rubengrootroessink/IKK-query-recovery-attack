Cal-ISO Declares Stage 2 Emergency; Directs SCE to Begin 'Load' Curtailment=
=20
Program for Certain Customers



ROSEMEAD, Calif., Nov. 13 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
With the state's power reserves
at less than 5%, the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has
declared a "Stage 2 Emergency" and called upon Southern California Edison a=
nd
other investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment progra=
ms
for certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO attributed the Stage 2 emergency to a generation shortfall
partially attributable to several power plants in the California market bei=
ng
down for scheduled maintenance.


At the same time, Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all
customers to immediately reduce their electricity consumption.


Cal-ISO, the nonprofit agency that manages 75% of California's
transmission power grid and secures power supplies for most of the state's
consumers, said the Stage 2 status would be in effect from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p=
.m.
The agency directed SCE to reduce its electrical load by 1,000 megawatts --
enough power to serve approximately a million homes.


To achieve this load reduction during Stage 2, SCE is required to activate
its voluntary load curtailment program, under which large industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers who have agreed to have their power
temporarily interrupted in exchange for reduced rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO will declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO would direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rotating outages for blocks of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


Large energy users, such as industrial and commercial customers, can help
the power-supply situation by turning off unneeded lights and auxiliary or
redundant machinery where ever possible.  The best ways to reduce power
consumption at home are to turn off any unneeded electrical appliances and
lights.


An Edison International company, Southern California Edison is one of the
nation's largest electric utilities, serving a population of more than
11 million via 4.3 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile servic=
e
area within central, coastal and Southern California.
