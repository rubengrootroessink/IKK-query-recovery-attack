Lari:
Glad to hear you had a great trek...my, my 21 people! You have your
hands full! Sounds like it is time for Ron to buy a house in Mendicino
too. I hope he is doing well.

We'll pick up sandwiches each morning in Westport, what do you and
Harvey like?

It'll be great fun to explore new trails. As far as my mount, Fierra is
always a blast but if you want to give her a rest I'm pleased to ride
Russia, Stoli, San Francisco or anyone you prefer. I am also happy to
ride a different mount each day. What ever is best for you and the
horses. This is such a treat for me...talk about heaven! I know all of
us feel the same way and I hope you know how great we all think you are
and your horses.

I haven't had a second to check in with Jazon regarding Virginia City.
Have you heard anything? I sure wish each race had a web site!

Madeleine
