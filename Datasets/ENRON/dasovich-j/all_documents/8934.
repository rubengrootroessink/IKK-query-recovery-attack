OK, perhaps not the booze, unless you're up for a keg of O'Doul's, but
definitely the pizza and soft drinks. Just a reminder that I am facilitating
an Evening MBA Career Services Planning Session next Tuesday, 2/13 in the
Career Center Conference Room (S420) during class break.

Last week John Morel received some good feedback regarding how the Career
Center can cater to the needs of EvMBA students. I would like to continue on
that path with those of you who weren't able to attend on 1/31. Input from
both sessions will assist John and the account managers structure and
prioritize programs to meet our career-related needs (e.g., EvMBA Resume
Book, on-campus company visits during class breaks, networking events at a
student's company, internships, etc.). Since John will not be attending,
please direct any questions specifically for him using the contact info
below.

Of course, if you cannot attend, feel free to send me your comments and
recommendations.  Following is a link to the Career Center in case you're
not familiar with its offerings:

See you next Tues.,
