Hello to my classmates,

Interested in finding out about the MBA clubs and student organizations? 
Got ants in your pants waiting for club night?

Visit the REVISED Clubs page on the MBAA website:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~mbaa/clubs.html

You'll find:
List of MBA student organizations, including contact names and email aliases.
List of unofficial clubs (activity email lists)
Resources on how to start your own club
... and more!

NOTE - Clubs will not finalize their dues until the end of this week.? We'll 
post before club night if possible.

Big thanks to the talented and generous Sara Baylis for building the site 
last week!

Heidi
MBAA, VP Clubs
