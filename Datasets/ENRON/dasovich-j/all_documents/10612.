The Libertarian Vision for Telecom and  High-Technology
by Adam Thierer and Wayne  Crews?

???????????  The technology and telecommunications sectors of the American=
=20
economy are  increasingly under assault by politicians and regulators at al=
l=20
levels of  government =01) local, state, federal, and international. Althou=
gh=20
the  Telecommunications Act of 1996 reflected a growing consensus that=20
competition  and deregulation would bring tremendous benefits to consumers=
=20
and entrepreneurs  alike, the Act not only fell well short of this goal, bu=
t=20
has actually resulted  in increased micro-management of the communications=
=20
industry. Worse yet,  policymakers show an increasing willingness to extend=
=20
the misguided regulatory  legacy of the past to cover the Internet and othe=
r=20
emerging technologies within  the information services marketplace.=20

???????????  Policymakers must resist the urge to treat existing and emergi=
ng=20
markets  and technologies as their political playthings. Fresh thinking is=
=20
needed and  this thinking should be guided by three simple principles as=20
policymakers  consider how the Internet and the high-technology sector shou=
ld=20
be governed: =20

Principle #1 =01) First, Do No Harm: Just as this sound principle governs  =
the=20
medical profession, so too should such a =01&High-Tech Hippocratic Oath=018=
 guide =20
public policymakers. The pace of technological change in this sector makes=
=20
it  almost impossible to establish timely policies that won=01,t be outdate=
d as=20
soon as  they are put into place. While both entrepreneurs and  industry=20
giants can sometimes move at cyber-speed to avoid rapid technological =20
obsolescence, it is apparent that governments and legislatures cannot. That=
=01,
s  the contrast between =01&Moore=01,s Law=018 and =01&Murphy=01,s Law.=018=
=20

Computer and  communications firms have been forced to come to terms with t=
he=20
reality of  =01&Moore=01,s Law,=018 which holds that the computing power do=
ubles=20
roughly every 18  months while its price falls by an equally dramatic margi=
n=20
over the same period.  In other words, they have to reinvent the wheel ever=
y=20
year-and-a-half if they  want to stay on top of their game.=20

However, lawmaking is often beset by =01&Murphy=01,s Law=018=01*  anything =
that can go=20
wrong, will go wrong. Moreover, even the most  well-intentioned efforts wil=
l=20
likely take so long to move through the  legislative =01&sausage factory=01=
8 that=20
most statutes or regulations will be obsolete  or redundant by the time the=
y=20
finally take effect. Put simply, =01&Internet time=018  and =01&Washington =
time=018 are=20
measured by two very different clocks.  Policymakers must avoid quick fixes=
=20
and supposedly simple political  solutions to the complex problems posed by=
=20
the realities of the new digital  economy.=20

Principle #2 =01) Be Patient: The second principle policymakers  should hee=
d=20
when considering high-tech policies is to exercise patience and  regulatory=
=20
restraint; to be willing to wait for the good results they allegedly  seek,=
=20
to develop naturally. This is not always easy in a town that believes  ther=
e=20
is a short-term political solution to every problem. Many politicians provi=
de=20
lip service to the benefits of the  market and self-regulation, but then ac=
t=20
to subvert the will of companies and  consumers by imposing haphazard=20
top-down regulatory solutions and protectionist  regulation.=20

Policymakers must avoid activism and recognize their own  ignorance. They=
=20
should not attempt to impose market structures or determine  outcomes.=20
Instead they should respect the natural discovery process of the free =20
market, and the spontaneous ordering of our fast-paced technological societ=
y.=20
As  these markets expand, evolve and mature, they will exceed any top-down=
=20
creation  of politicians.

Principle  #3 =01) Embrace  Change: Finally,  policymakers must embrace=20
technological change and its revolutionary nature.  Learning to live with=
=20
change is never easy. Firms, technologies, even entire  industry sectors ca=
n=20
rise and fall in a very short period of time. One day, CB  radio and 8-trac=
k=20
tapes are the hottest technology in the land; the next, they  are as dated =
as=20
disco dancing and bell-bottoms.=20

???????????  But sometimes such failure is a good thing. Yesterday=01,s=20
industrial  giant becomes today=01,s also-ran. Whether it=01,s IBM in the =
=01+70s or=20
Microsoft in the  =01+90s, no firm or technology can expect to remain king =
of=20
the hill for long. In  fact, if there=01,s one constant in the Internet wor=
ld,=20
it=01,s change. The New  Economy is characterized by extreme volatility: th=
e=20
ongoing stock market roller  coaster; techno fads; rapid technological=20
obsolescence; etc. In fact, tomorrow=01,s  Internet is not likely to be the=
=20
Internet we know today.=20

???????????  Consequently, policymakers must realize that the Internet and=
=20
the  high-tech sector will challenge previous policies, existing programs,=
=20
older  institutions, and well-established industries. Legislators must be=
=20
willing to  change existing structures, laws, or political norms to=20
accommodate or foster  the ongoing expansion of the New Economy. While some=
=20
Old Economy interests may  not like the emergence of these new industry=20
sectors and technologies, policymakers must not allow older companies to us=
e =20
old or new laws and regulations as a tool against their new competitors. Th=
e =20
history of communications industry regulation is littered with lamentable=
=20
tales  of one industry sector using the club of regulation to beat their=20
competitors  into submission. Policymakers must reject such Luddite=20
proposals.=20

These simple principles  should guide any telecommunications or technology=
=20
policy debates that arise.  More specifically, these principles can be=20
translated into a more concrete set  of commandments for policymakers to=20
follow:

(1) Any individual or entity should be free to create and offer to  the=20
public any technological good or communications service they want, whenever=
 =20
they want, however they want, and on whatever terms they and their customer=
s =20
find mutually agreeable.=20

(2) No individual or entity has a natural, inalienable right or  entitlemen=
t=20
to a specific technological good or telecommunications service.

(3) Free speech rights and the First Amendment are of paramount  importance=
=20
to individual liberty and should be fully honored and protected  against=20
government interference.=20

(4) Rather than impose administrative rules, policymakers should  respect=
=20
private property rights; unhindered freedom of contract; voluntary =20
negotiations and standard-setting; private dispute resolution; other common=
=20
law  standards such as the law of trespass and torts; and the proper=20
interpretation  of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution as a guarantor o=
f=20
the free flow of  interstate commerce.??? =20

The Cato Institute=01,s  Tech Knowledge series of commentaries will seek to=
=20
apply this libertarian  framework to the exploding universe of=20
high-technology policy issues in a  consistent and ongoing manner.
