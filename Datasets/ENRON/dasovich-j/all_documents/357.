LighTrade Aims For Bandwidth Boom With "Points"

	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Washington, D.C. entrepreneur Ted Pierson is betting on 
a boom in bandwidth trading. 
	His company, LighTrade Inc., will spend $20 million-$25 million this year to 
install and operate hardware to trade bandwidth, or space on telecom lines, 
in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Miami, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle 
and Washington, D.C. 
	Bandwidth trading is growing, driven by increased demand by businesses for 
the Internet. In a report released last December, CIBC World Markets 
estimated that 20% of total bandwidth traffic, or $12 billion in revenues, 
could be traded in some manner within five years. 
	Last week, Oklahoma energy company Williams Communications Group Inc. (WCG, 
news, msgs) announced plans to open a bandwidth trading unit. 
	LighTrade will be the first company not affiliated with a larger energy or 
telecommunications concern to develop the trading sites, known as pooling 
points, Pierson told Dow Jones Newswires. 
	The points connect telecommunications carriers, allowing data to move from 
one network to another. They are installed in "telecom hotels," buildings 
that house carrier facilities, and essentially consist of a Lucent 
Technologies Inc. (LU, news, msgs) bandwidth manager about the size of a 
tall, narrow refrigerator. 
	Enron Broadband Services, a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs), 
established the first two points last year in New York and Los Angeles. It 
plans to build another in London this year. 
	Last year, Enron Corp. proposed trading bandwidth under a standardized 
contract. It executed the first trade under the contract in December, buying 
space on a monthly basis on a New York-Los Angeles line from Global Crossing 
Ltd. of Bermuda. 
	Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based technology research firm, 
has charged that Enron's ownership of pooling points prevents neutrality in 
bandwidth trades. 
	Having an independent company like LighTrade operate points will help the 
bandwidth trading market get off the ground, said Stephen Kamman, a 
telecommunications industry analyst for CIBC World Markets. 
	It's a "very positive" development for the bandwidth trading market, said Tom 
Gros, vice president of international bandwidth trading for Enron. 
	"This is the first of what I think will be at least a few others who are 
interested in building pooling points that meet the Enron specifications for 
the open trading of bandwidth," Gros said. 
	The industry has been trading bandwidth without a standardized contract for 
years. Deals have typically taken weeks or months to negotiate. Companies 
must start from scratch with each deal, negotiating price, quantity, length 
of contract and quality of service. 
	In the past, deals have been long-term, sometimes as long as 20 years. But 
with the cost of bandwidth along some routes declining 15%-20% a year, such 
terms are less attractive. 
	Enron has also called on telecommunications companies to form a bandwidth 
trading organization, an independent body that will decide on standard terms 
and conditions for trading. Two groups in London and one in the United States 
are vying to form such a group. 
	LighTrade chose pooling point sites based on telecommunications traffic, 
Pierson said. Long-range plans call for the company to have sites in the 50 
U.S. cities that develop the most traffic. 
	But the company's pace building a network of points will depend on how 
quickly the telecommunications industry can decide on standards for trading 
bandwidth as a commodity. 
	LighTrade wants to install points in Boston, Houston, Las Vegas, Memphis and 
Phoenix in 2001, Pierson said. It is eyeing a move into international markets 
as early as next year, if the market will support it. Western Europe is a 
likely starting point, with Paris and Frankfurt possible sites. 
	Eventually, LighTrade could connect Miami to a South American city like Rio 
de Janeiro or Sao Paulo, and build Asian pooling points in sites like Tokyo 
and Osaka. 
	The company raised financing from private investors in two rounds last year 
and is now looking for investment from venture capital companies. 
	In addition to reaching an agreement with Lucent Technologies to use its 
bandwidth managers, LighTrade has another connection to the high-tech 
company. William Plunkett, a senior vice president at Lucent, is on 
LighTrade's board of directors. Pierson declined to say whether Lucent would 
invest in his company. 
	LighTrade isn't Pierson's first startup company. The telecommunications 
attorney founded Advanced Radio Telecom (ARTT, news, msgs), a NASDAQ-traded 
company that owns and operates broadband wireless metropolitan area networks. 
That company now has market capitalization of $800 million. 
	Pierson has commitments to tie pooling points into the networks of three 
major telecommunications carriers, he said. He wouldn't identify the 
companies. He said he doesn't know of any competitors building pooling 
points, but he expects others to enter the market. 
	He and his investors are taking a chance starting a company to develop 
pooling points because they don't know how quickly the market will develop, 
he said. 
	"But I wouldn't be in it if ... I did not think this would be a very 
significant economic return," Pierson said.
