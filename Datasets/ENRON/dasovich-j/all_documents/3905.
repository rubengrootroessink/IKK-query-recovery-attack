Here's as good a treatise on the subject as I've seen.  I think this articl=

does an excellent job of trying to explain the recent California market=20
phenomenon...

No quick fix for soaring California gas prices
In the past year, gas prices in most regions have doubled and in some cases=

tripled.  But no
region has seen the breadth of the price blowout now under way in the West.
While Henry Hub futures on the NYMEX appear to be leading the way for highe=

the fundamentals-driven
price surge centered in the Pacific Northwest and California.

The cost of gas in Southern California has been skyrocketing.  Prices last=

The most obvious cause of the dramatic escalation is scarcity of gas.  The=

Improving deliverability into Southern California is key to bringing the=20

Those problems had come to a head in part because of high summer prices tha=

he said.  At most, only 15%-20% of California=01,s supply of gas comes from=

At the moment, a lot of the new gas production in the Southern California=

byproduct of oil exploration and production =01* so any new natural gas=20

A majority of the =01&dry gas=018 producers are located in the northern par=

But new production
