	E-Government Site govWorks in Desperate Search For Cash
	mail this story? top
	
	NEW YORK (VENTUREWIRE) -- Electronic government services firm govWorks is 
taking last ditch measures in a bid to keep the company running. CEO Kaleil 
Isaza Tuzman said the company is "cutting costs in every way possible" in an 
effort to stay afloat, and is "every day pounding the pavement" to find 
further financing or a buyer. Mr. Isaza said that as part of the company's 
efforts to scale back, in the last sixty days govWorks has stopped 
contributing cash to its subsidiary govWorks Latin America, a fifty-fifty 
joint venture with Argentine firm Consultora Tecnologica (Cotesa), and that 
the company "will continue to make that decision until we're okay." Under 
that agreement govWorks and Cotesa each contributed funds on a monthly basis 
to govWorks Latin America, and Cotesa has picked up govWorks' payments in the 
meantime. Mr. Isaza also clarified the scale of the company's cuts. After a 
p! eak of 233 employees in March, he said, govWorks cut positions in April 
and mid-August, with a final round of 41 layoffs in November. The company now 
has 56 employees in its domestic operations, with approximately 40 more in 
its international staff through govWorks Latin America. Mr. Isaza said the 
company would close rather than make further staff cuts. "This is the number 
we believe we need to adequately service clients," he said. But closing shop, 
said Mr. Isaza, "is not the mode we're in." The company is in post-term sheet 
negotiations with three potential acquirers, he said, and is looking for "the 
first fully negotiated reasonable situation that allows us to survive as a 
company." He said acquisition by a competitor "makes less sense because other 
companies in the market are facing similar challenges." Mr. Isaza said the 
company is hitting projections made in June for an 18-month road to 
profitability, but that pace was no longer in line with market expectations. 
I! n April, govWorks received funding from the Mayfield Fund, Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts, American Management Systems, the Safra Group, Hearst Corp., Global 
Bridge Ventures, and Metropolis Ventures. Mr. Isaza, also co-founder and 
chairman of govWorks, made the comments in an interview after speaking at a 
luncheon on sponsored by The Colombian American, Ecuadorean American, and 
Venezuelan American Associations in New York.
