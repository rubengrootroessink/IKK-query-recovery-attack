Jim's e-mail makes it clear that we need to be a bit more specific on our 
internal resource reports.    In other words, let's identify where we are 
assisting ENA on specific projects or transactions.   For example, if we're 
working on a QF acquisition, then let's identify the project by name so Jim 
can inform Dave D. that we are helping ENA.

What's the IRTF?  Is that the internal resource report?

Subject: Monthly Update Report for ENA Management

Attached please find the monthly report I file to Dave Delainey (CEO of 
ENA).  I've attached the Sept 2000 report.  

Currently I use the IRTF to update this information.  It is critical that 
everyone submit these forms by the 1st of the month so that I can get this to 
Dave by the 5th.  If you want to give me this information in a different 
form, please feel free.  This is a good way to keep EGA in front of the 
business people.  The better the information you send me the better the 
report.

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to call me.  I know that 
everything is not on the list, only things that have a key focus on ENA.

Jim
