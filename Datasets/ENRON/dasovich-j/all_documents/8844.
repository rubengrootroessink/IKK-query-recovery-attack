Jeff,
 I have been receiving and forwarding mail from you a lot lately, and have 
decided that since it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon that I should 
contact you.  You send out multiple mailings daily regarding all things 
California, and one of the people on that list is Mike Smith in legal.  His 
address is Mike D Smith.  I am Mike Smith in EEIS, my address is Mike M 
Smith.  I would have contacted you sooner, but receiving the other Mike 
Smith's messages happens quite frequently, and forwarding  the mail usually 
works as a stop gap method.  I would appreciate it if you changed your 
mailing list, and look forward to not hearing from you in the near future.

 Thank You
  Mike Smith
