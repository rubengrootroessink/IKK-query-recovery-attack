Mona -- you can throw this in Wayne's face as well.  I think I'll make sure 
it gets around to the ISO Board.

Subject: NGI Article


Greetings:
NGI (Natural Gas Intelligence) released a very interesting article yesterday
about how SDG&E is continuing to pass on power deals.  Baum said that they
are not considering any bilateral deals right now and hope to receive
attractive offers.  He also indicated that trading is not something
utilities do well and has rejected the PX block forward markets.  To read
the article in its entirety please go to www.intelligencepress.com and click
on for a trial subscription.  The article is dated October 9, 2000.
Unfortunately due to copyright laws I cannot send the article out.  Please
let me know if you have trouble locating it and I can point you in the right
direction.
