I spoke with WHP management yesterday and we are still supporting the
Comprehensive Settlement - of course.  We have not reserved any time on
Tuesday to speak, though.  There is a possibility that could change at the
last minute, but as some of you might know, WHP is currently negotiating the
sale of its California assets.  Things are in limbo to say the least.  It
would be a short, terse message from WHP, if any.

I think Mike's suggestion that some of the details have another look should
focus towards the Interim Settlement, or more specifically the PD
provisions, as opposed to anything in the CS.  Even though we can all
express our support of the CS, it is not being voted on, and there is no
alternate decision that would even allow that for now.  But as Mike
suggests, maybe the Commission can be persuaded that the status quo needs to
change in light of today's environment; which means the PD has to be
changed.
