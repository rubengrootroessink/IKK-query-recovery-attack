I just want to confirm how we have agreed to proceed:
We will start our work focussing on " b)  Commercially Significant 
Interfaces"  rather than "a) Identification  etc." , on the understanding  
that our work on the regional issues may shift into a discussion of  a). 
We will work in three sub-groups:  Northeast (Roy Boston, Steve Montovano, 
Aleck Dadson), South (Ricardo Charvel, Kathleen Magruder, Jeff Dasovich) and  
Northwest (Rob Hemstock and one or both of Jeff Dasovich / Mary Hain*).     * 
I will approach Mary Hain to join the group and work in the Northwest 
subgroup. 
Each subgroup will produce a workplan  and focus document by the end of 
February.  Those three documents  will be circulated to the whole group and  
discussed on a conference call for the whole group  in the first week in 
March.  
Each subgroup will make their own  determination about  how they will  carry 
out their work:  meetings, telephone calls, e-mail, etc.; but the  group will 
endeavour to do all  of its group-level  work by e-mail and telephone. 
We will aim to have a work product to deliver from the group  by May.  At 
this stage, it is likely that the final work product will consist of a 
document  or documents  identifying impediments and opportunities and  the 
ways of mitigating/pursuing them.  However, as we discussed on the call, we 
should keep an open mind about the nature of the work product.  We will have 
a better idea of what work product to aim for after the completion/review  of 
the initial workplans.
