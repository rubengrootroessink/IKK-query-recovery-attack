Goal:
Lower
Not greater than average increase to C&I large
Later
Surcharge delayed
Flatter
RTP better 
Higher Winter Charges better
Sustainable
More allocation to winter better

PGE:
Residential Baseline subsidy covered by Residential    Positive
CARE subsidy covered by all     Negative but expected
37.50 (vs 30) since June 1 is start date    Positive since later is better
$30/MWh allocated on kWh      Acceptable since reduces impact to large from 
CPUC design
Use $250/MWh on peak 1st then residual to other hours  Negative since results 
in high summer low winter
replace PX with actual charges     Negative and contrary to law 
$10/MWh and $30/MWh should apply to DA    Negative to new customers, Positive 
to USCS case

SCE:
Recover $30/MWH in proportion to generation revenue  Positive
CARE allocated to all based on generation revenue   Negative but expected
Non TOU - $10/MWh increase in 1st block, remainder in 2nd block Indifferent
TOU - Delta $10/MWh off, Delta $30/MWH partial, remainder on Negative since 
high summer
Surcharge of $20/MWh in June to Aug to recover lost 2 months Further negative 
since high summer

TURN:
End of 10% decrease to res - unlawful    Negative
Res subsidy should be allocated to all    Negative
CARE subsidy to all       Negative but expected
Non TOU - All 1st tier same, Delta $30 in 2nd tier   Indifferent
TOU - Greater summer vs Winter: On = 200/MWh   Negative

CLECA:
Preferred is an allocation of the Surcharge by top 100 hours  Positive re 
Class, Negative re Seasonal Rates
No increase to CARE      Negative but expected
Non TOU - 1st tier lower average, 2nd tier much higher cust basis Complicated
Residential should pay 1st $10/MWh    Positive
No increase for off peak      Negative
Partial be made at lease $40/MWh     Negative
Summer On Peak is residual     Negative

CEC
Voluntary RTP rates with minimum term 6 months   Positive
Recognize that RTP cannot be done by June 1   Negative
ISO must publish imbalance charge daily    Negative and not necessary

California League of Food Processors
Allow customers to select their own 3 hour on peak periods  Indifferent 
unless this results in lower class contributions to $30/MWh surcharge
Customers cannot respond to high peak rates   Wrong
Support Gov. 5%/15% increases for non TOU/TOU   Negative since losses will be 
picked up by others 

Alliance for Retail Energy Markets
DA customers should not be subject to surcharges   Positive to new customers, 
Negative to USCU case

Kinder Morgan (Pipeline and Storage Co)
Support Gov. proposition that all classes get 30% increase  Positive
KM supports $320/MWh summer on peak rates provided that  Negative
KM supports reducing the on peak demand rates   Positive if relative to 2 
being accepted

Question:
Do we rescind our testimony?
Factors leaning against recincion:
CEC advocacy of RTP is weak
CLECA, PGE, SCE, TURN advocate higher summer
Factors supporting recision:
CLECA, PGE, SCE would not allocate above average to C&I
PGE, SCE, CLECA would make residential pick up residential subsidy

Other: 
Need to take on PGE Px should not be at market
Need to take on PGE Surcharge should be with DA customers???????
We prefer PGE method of recovering 2 month shortfall (allocate over 12 
months) vs SCE (allocate over upcoming winter)
