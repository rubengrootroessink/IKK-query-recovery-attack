hi-

just wanted to let you know that herve pierre (my friend who is the designer
at vera wang in NY), whom some of you met at the vera wang show last year,
designed the costumes for a gorgeous ballet at the paris opera a few years
ago (when i was still in paris) and that this ballet is coming to san
francisco in the beginning of may!

the name of the choreographer is angelin preljocaj and the name of the
ballet is "LE PARC", and it's really really beautiful and if you like the
ballet you should go see it.... his style is a combination of classical
ballet technique with a very contemporary edge to it, and herve's costumes
are gorgeous....

http://www.sfballet.org/2001season/programs.php

it will be at the sfballet on may 4 and may 5, and most tickets are already
gone, but there are still a few spots left.... just call 865-2000...

MOST IMPORTANTLY: i can't go to this ballet because i will be in las vegas
(spending the weekend with herve pierre... of all coincidences) so if any
one of you go (and why not film it for me?), or even just went and told me
about it, i would be thrilled to death and would forever be grateful....

just thought you might be interested...
colleen


mark---> will you please pass this on to maria because she came to the
fashion show, and what is her email anyways?
