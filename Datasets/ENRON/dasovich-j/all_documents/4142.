THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20

"42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot."=20

We're back.? We're live.? We're living.? Actually, we are still in limbo=20
land.? As of yet, no prez elect.? The week was typical by California=20
standards.? The utilities filed their plans to raise rates over the next fi=
ve=20
years, the consumer advocates held a press conference to kick off their hol=
y=20
war against electric restructuring, a class action suit was filed for $4=20
billion against the generators and the utilities, gas prices hovered betwee=
n=20
$18 and $20/mmcf on day trading, the Secretary of Energy spat on FERC=20
regarding the remedies proposed to fix the alleged dysfunctional California=
=20
market, and the Governor announced his options for curing what ails us.? I=
=20
think that pretty well covers it.? It was just another week in paradise.=20

I was on KRON TV last week for a couple of 10-second sound bites.? Chomp,=
=20
chomp.? That is what was distilled from fifty minutes of taping.? It was a=
=20
learning experience for me, more so than it was for the general viewing=20
public.? The station did an investigative report on California's restructur=
ed=20
power industry, and the slant was fairly predictable, although it could hav=
e=20
been far worse.? Two moms on my son's hockey team told me they saw the clip=
s=20
on TV, and I used these ladies as my unbiased (?) sample to gather some=20
opinions.? There are about twenty families on my son's team, so that means=
=20
(using testimonial math) that about ten percent of the Bay Area watched the=
=20
news piece.? One mom said she saw me, really didn't listen to what the news=
=20
was covering, but that she recognized me. I'm sure that her experience, les=
s=20
the recognition, applies easily to half or more of the viewing public. The=
=20
second mom, who I have known for many years, asked me, "So, who is doing th=
e=20
gouging?"? This from a person who is well educated, very involved with the=
=20
community, and is part of a routine family (he says) of husband, wife, thre=
e=20
kids, and a dog.=20

Alas, I realized, the battle for California's power market will not rest no=
r=20
be resolved in chaotic meetings at the ISO or AB1890 working groups.? The w=
ar=20
will be won or lost based on public opinion.? Will Californians support the=
=20
continuation of electric restructuring?? I don't know if they will, but I a=
m=20
not at all surprised that the vast majority of people do not understand the=
=20
issues.? As an industry, we have a long, long way to go in educating the=20
public.? And I have tremendous doubt that we are going to cough up the=20
necessary money to publicly demonstrate a positive image on power=20
restructuring.? Nancy Day wrote me last week; "You and your associates must=
=20
'prove' to the policy-makers and the public that, in the long run,=20
competitive markets are always better than command and control regulation.?=
=20
How do you do that?? You hire a PR firm =01( and you get them to help you s=
hape=20
your messages to a variety of audiences."=20

Shape a message.? I know that some of you folks think you are doing that=20
now.? I disagree.? Individually or collectively we have not made even a sma=
ll=20
dent in the public image for our cause.? There is some name recognition, to=
=20
be sure. The paid TV ads for Enron, and Southern have made those company=20
names more familiar.? Green Mountain Energy has done a good job of getting=
=20
its name out, too.? But that is hardly the point.? As an industry of privat=
e=20
interests, we are kaput on the PR side.=20

Imagine this.? Imagine Joe Montana, four-time Superbowl wining quarterback=
=20
for the San Francisco 49ers standing next to the Lombardi Trophy, talking=
=20
into the camera.? He smiles, and says, "Hi. I'm Joe Montana.? I believe in=
=20
competition."? A few side clips, some simple explanations how competition i=
s=20
going to more quickly bring prices into line with expectations, and back to=
=20
Joe.? We can also do some follow on ads with Jerry Rice, and Jim Plunket=20
(two-time Superbowl QB for the Oakland Raiders), thereby making a connectio=
n=20
with different factions of California's ethnic and racial makeup.? That is=
=20
what I call PR.? Touching the soul of the public with simple messages from=
=20
credible, well-known, likeable people.=20

I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.=20

?@@@ Oh when the comments, come marching in =01(=20

My mailman is becoming increasingly ticked off at me because the tonnage of=
=20
FERC comments coming to my address weighing four, or five pounds per=20
delivery.? He's a mailman, not a pediatrician.? He is leaving small hints o=
f=20
his displeasure, such as dropping my mail in the middle of the driveway, or=
=20
delivering the goodies to my neighbor's house.? Most of the copies received=
,=20
I confess, go into the trash bin without a second thought. I don't even bre=
ak=20
the gummy seal on most.? I check the sender's name, and decide if the fortu=
ne=20
inside the envelope might be worth a read.? I always open the envelopes fro=
m=20
the CPUC, the Electric Oversight Board, and Steptoe & Johnson (SCE's counse=
l=20
for really important filings).? These filings are the most entertaining of=
=20
the lot. The holiday weekend gave me some time to read a selection of=20
comments submitted to FERC regarding the Commission's November 1 Order.=20

I don't know whether I should laugh or cry at some of these pleadings.? The=
=20
comments I read from some of my favorite sectors of California's power=20
industry are so childish that I wonder if it is a joke.? Or is the joke on=
=20
us?? Take for example, the CPUC's comments.? The first 52 pages are more or=
=20
less what you would expect:? refund our money, change this hearing from a=
=20
paper hearing to a full-blown evidentiary hearing, request a rehearing, the=
=20
CPUC should get copies of everything the MSC and DMA publish at the same ti=
me=20
FERC gets them, FERC got the soft price-cap issues and just about everythin=
g=20
else wrong, the State has jurisdiction, etc.? The CPUC claims that there is=
=20
insufficient evidence to support the FERC's conclusions. Since the CPUC als=
o=20
lacks sufficient evidence (because the generators and power marketers will=
=20
not comply with the CPUC's data requests), then, well, what the heck, we ne=
ed=20
a lengthy hearing with evidence and cross-examination of witnesses.? This=
=20
line of reasoning sounds very much like the Florida vote recount litigation=
,=20
but I don't want to go there.=20

Here is the real kicker.? If you go to page 52 of the CPUC's comments, ther=
e=20
is the signature block of the CPUC attorneys, dated November 21.? The next=
=20
page begins with the "Separate Statement of Commissioners Duque, Neeper, an=
d=20
Bilas".? I did a double take on the title, not understanding, at first, tha=
t=20
the first 52 pages were never adopted by the CPUC by vote.? Our politically=
=20
hypercorrect couple, Ms. Lynch and Mr. Wood forced it in.=20

What do the three Republican Commissioners say?? "We find much to support i=
n=20
FERC's Market Order, and are filing this statement to insure that FERC has=
=20
access to our full thinking concerning the technical aspects of the wholesa=
le=20
market, which are not the principal focus of the Commission's filing."? I=
=20
remain astounded that, in essence, the CPUC has two replies.? One that=20
lambastes the FERC Order, and another that encourages the Order with some=
=20
modifications.? For example, the evil part of the CPUC commentary shakes a=
=20
finger at FERC for ordering elimination of the requirement for the UDCs to=
=20
buy all power through the PX.? That, says the attorneys, is a violation of=
=20
jurisdiction, and you federal people should stay off of our lawn. The trio=
=20
of? Duque, Neeper, and Bilas (DNB) say, "While the state maintains=20
jurisdiction, we are willing to cede to FERC temporary jurisdiction over th=
is=20
matter."? Which of the two responses sounds more cooperative to you?? I=20
wonder (he asks) why the CPUC comments never came to a vote?? Sounds to me=
=20
like the CPUC comments a la DNB would have passed 3-2, quite nicely, thank=
=20
you.? But those days are long gone.=20

The CPUC expert witness testimony appended to the CPUC comments includes th=
e=20
direct testimony of Michael Scheible, a supervisor of the California Air=20
Resources Board staff responsible for energy issues including electricity.?=
=20
This is a person who was part of the development of the RECLAIM program of=
=20
tradable emission credits utilized in the South Coast Air Quality Managemen=
t=20
District (SCAQMD).? Here is what Mr. Scheible testifies.? "The average pric=
e=20
paid for a NOx RTC went from $1 a pound in January 2000, to $4 in June, to=
=20
$20 in October 2000."? What is he talking about?? He took the year-to-date=
=20
expenditures on NOx credits, and divided the total by the number of traded=
=20
RECLAIM Trading Credits (RTC).? He used the average value, not the marginal=
=20
or incremental price!? NOx credits are today trading in the $40 to $50 per=
=20
pound range.=20

But he doesn't stop there.? He takes another leap at the impact of the RTC=
=20
prices on electricity prices.? "=01( RECLAIM affects only thermal power=20
generating units in the SCAQMD.? These units account for about 20 percent o=
f=20
the power generating capacity in the State=01( Thus, the market price of RT=

h=20
the State hopes to persuade FERC that the markets are not working because o=
ne=20
cost factor only affects 20% of the State's capacity.? Okay, it is your=20
turn.? Do you want to laugh, or cry?=20

I reviewed one of the UDC proposals, PG&E.? PG&E's comments included three=

expert witness affidavits that in total were about one inch thick.? PG&E as=

=20
requests a waiver of the payment provisions of the ISO and PX Tariffs,=20
requests that the utility only be required to pay based on 1999 levels, and=

Ziad Alaywan of the ISO talked with me today during my attendance at the IS=
O=20
Governing Board meeting.? He had a sad face as he told me, "We made our fir=
st=20
transaction using the Super Peak Market instead of issuing an out-of-market=
=20
(OOM) order.? It was for 100 MW."? Grand, says I.? Why the long face?? He w=
as=20
disheartened because the accepted bid was higher than the price cap of $250=
.?=20
I said to my man Ziad that bids either above or below the price cap are not=
 a=20
reason to be upset.? What do you want the bidders to do, I asked?? He=20
confessed that it troubles him when all the offers are above the cap, but,=
=20
nevertheless, he is going to maintain the request for bids every day for th=
e=20
remainder of December.=20

In case you haven't seen the form of the ISO request for bids, it is=20
dispatched via e-mail, and looks like this:=20
? For operating day XXXXXX, 2000 the CAISO will be participating in its=20
"Seasonal Super Peak Day of Market" via the Automated Power Exchange? (APX)=

I encourage marketers and generators to look closely at this market in whic=
h=20
to post offers.? The Super Peak Market is the best hope we have to bring=20
order to the otherwise somewhat chaotic method by which the ISO operators g=
o=20
hunting for out-of-market energy.? I told Ziad that the more the ISO access=

the Super Peak Market, the more offers he is likely to see, and the more=20

?=20

requires refunds to San Diego customers of excessive electricity charges=20
through a windfall profits tax on profiteering power generators;
requires oversight of electricity rates by the Public Utilities Commission=
=20
(PUC);
institutes an integrated resource planning process to address future energy=
=20
needs;
creates a state power authority to ensure the fulfillment California's ener=
gy=20
needs, promote conservation, and construct and operate power plants,=20
transmission and distribution facilities;
facilitates the authority of local and state government to exercise the pow=
er=20
of eminent domain if necessary; and
creates strong accountability mechanisms for state agencies.


The advocates expressed doubt concerning whether state officials were willi=
ng=20
to defy the powerful energy lobbies. And they warned elected officials=20
against another bailout of the utility companies at the expense of taxpayer=
s=20
and consumers.=20

If there is any part of the proposal I like, then it is the organization=20
asked the Governor and legislators to refuse any campaign contributions fro=
m=20
utility or power companies during the consideration of legislative=20
proposals.?? According to Rosenfield, "=01(history shows that whenever elec=
ted=20
officials must choose between the interests of the private utility/power=20
companies and protecting the public interest, they will choose to protect t=
he=20
utility and energy companies. That is how we got into this mess. Whether th=
e=20
public officials currently in office are willing to do so -- especially in=

You know, windfall profit tax aside, the more I read the proposal, the more=
 I=20
am intrigued.? The proposal boxes in the utilities, and you can easily expe=
ct=20
that the utilities will come slugging back in two directions,=20
simultaneously.? First, the utilities will slug back with the bankruptcy=20
argument if they are stuck with the under-collection risk.? Second, the=20
utilities will step up their accusations against the generators for=20
"gouging."? The opportunities for schizophrenic behavior will be legion,=20

It is that fifth cause of action that has me wondering.? Were we not=20

Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were unconscionable=

Speaking of learning new things, I mentioned in the introduction that my=20

phrases and words that get through the media filter.? I am becoming a stude=
nt=20
of the sound bite, as any reader of these Burritos will attest.? I am=20
compiling a list of key words that either work, or don't work when talking=
=20
with the media or the press.? For example, if you are talking to a reporter=
=20
and you say, "The day-ahead ancillary service markets are too illiquid and=
=20
the price is highly variable," then you will not only strike out with the=
=20
media people, but you will go to the back of the sound-bite class.? On the=
=20
other hand, if you say something like, "Of course they are gouging," then I=
=20
can assure you they will take your bite to print or video.=20

I have developed a simple chart of words and phrases either to embrace, or =
to=20
avoid when addressing members of the press, the public, or when mingling wi=
th=20
people at holiday cocktail parties with whom your spouse works, but you can=

doesn't matter.? So, for example, if you want to create a quotable quote,=
