Here is my view on the comments.  The ARM comments cover most of the
territory we would want to cover, but they do not spend enough time
explaining that the Barnett conclusion about "credits only not cash" is the
result of a flawed interpretation of the original stipulation.  The comments
also do not raise the points in Bob Williams' email from two days ago,
namely that the conclusion that only credits are available is counter to the
course of performance and practice by the parties, and that the decision is
procedurally flawed for providing relief beyond that requested in the Edison
petition, thereby denying the other parties due process.  These elements
could be added to the comments.

Secondly, however, the comments tee up very clearly the fact that we have an
outstanding complaint on these issues and say that the decision could hurt
our chances for recovery.  Bob had recommended that we down play these
issues to avoid enticing our enemies at the Commission.  The ARM comments
explicitly indicate that this order will prejudge our complaint case, which
I do not believe we would want to admit in any event.

In conclusion:  the ARM comments should not be used as the sole vehicle all
the above changes are made.  If the changes are made, we can go with those
comments.  Otherwise, I would suggest sticking with the comments we are
preparing, adding more information about our due process objections and
arguing strongly for a bifurcation of the issues.  This would both support
ARM and allow us to make a more focused pitch to defer the cash or credit
issue.

Please call me at 415-279-0702 to let me know how you would like to proceed.
