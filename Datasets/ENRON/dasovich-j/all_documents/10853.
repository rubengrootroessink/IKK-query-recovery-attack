Enron's Dispute With Indian State Over Power Bills Takes New Turn

BOMBAY, India -- Enron Corp.'s Indian power project has given the state of 
Maharashtra notice amounting to a threat to cut off electricity, raising the 
stakes in a dispute over bills from India's first big private power plant. 
The Enron-controlled Dabhol Power Co. delivered a notice of political force 
majeure to the Indian state, saying recent government actions could harm the 
company's ability to "perform obligations." A political force majeure is 
typically used to dissolve a contract after a war, a coup, or a similar 
radical event.
In this case, the declaration may be a pressure tactic, as the state 
government moves to renegotiate a five-year-old contract for the plant's 
second phase. A spokesman for Dabhol, in which Bechtel Group Inc. and General 
Electric Co. are junior shareholders, said yesterday that the notice was an 
effort to protect the $3 billion project's lenders, who "have expressed 
concern" about difficulties getting payments. He declined to elaborate. 
The cash-strapped Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only 
customer, has failed to make payments since December. 
The federal government has guaranteed the payments. But the government has 
withheld two months' worth, a total of $48 million, citing a claim against 
the gas-fired plant for taking two hours longer than promised to restart 
after shutdowns. The Dabhol spokesman said the Indian government agreed 
yesterday to send the payment dispute to a mediation panel. 
Vinay Bansal, chairman of the state electricity board, said he disagrees with 
the force majeure declaration. Mr. Bansal said Dabhol's notice pointed to 
recent statements by Maharashtra's top official questioning the need for the 
project's second phase. It also cited pronouncements by the federal 
government that it wouldn't pay until the shutdown dispute is resolved. He 
said the notice cited the state government's creation of a panel to review, 
and possibly renegotiate, the Dabhol contract. The panel is scheduled to 
release its conclusions on Dabhol today. 
The notice from Dabhol didn't say what the power company might do. Cutting 
off power would have limited effect. The board has already reduced purchases 
from Dabhol to a minimum, letting the 740-megawatt plant produce at 30% of 
capacity. The board blames Dabhol's high rates for the reduction, saying it 
must buy from cheaper sources first. Enron says rates would fall if the plant 
produced at 90% capacity, as envisioned when the first-phase contract was 
reached in 1993.

E.ON and Powergen Form a Superpower --- Deal Will Create World's 
Second-Largest Utility --- It Also Marks Europe's First Big Leap Into U.S. 
Market
By Vanessa Fuhrmans and Marc Champion
Staff Reporters

E.ON AG unveiled plans to take over Powergen PLC for 8.2 billion euros in 
cash and assume 7.1 billion euros in debt, a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest electricity-service provider and strike one of the 
boldest moves yet to consolidate Europe's newly deregulated power industry. 
E.ON said it would offer Powergen shareholders 765 pence (12.18 euros) per 
share -- an 8.4% premium to last week's closing share price -- valuing the 
U.K. utility at 8.2 billion euros. In addition, E.ON would take on roughly 
7.1 billion euros in debt from Powergen's acquisition of Kentucky-based LG&E 
Energy Corp.
The deal is the latest in a recent string of mergers and acquisitions to roil 
Europe's energy sector; E.ON itself was formed in late 1999 from the merger 
of German utility giants Veba AG and Viag AG. But the acquisition of Powergen 
would go further, creating the world's second-largest utility, after 
state-owned Electricite de France, in terms of electricity sales volume. It 
also marks the first big leap by a continental European utility into the 
U.S., the world's biggest power market, via LG&E. 
Monday, Powergen shares rose 1.9% in London to 719.5 pence, while E.ON shares 
jumped 5.2% to 54.45 euros in Frankfurt. 
Analysts cautioned that while the deal looks good on paper, carrying it out 
could prove difficult. E.ON still has to find buyers and reasonable prices 
for businesses with a total market value of more than 15 billion euros. And 
expanding in the U.S., where prices for utilities are on the rise and the 
regulatory environment is tough, also won't be easy. 
"It will be very easy to get their fingers burned," said Peter Atherton, 
analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. "This is a deal that makes sense, 
but it carries a large execution risk." 
The Kentucky utility, LG&E, is only the first step in E.ON's broader U.S. 
expansion plans, E.ON Chief Executive Ulrich Hartmann said. The German power 
giant will have a war chest of between 30 billion euros and 45 billion euros, 
depending how quickly it sells some of its nonenergy businesses. Much of it, 
Mr. Hartmann said, would go toward spreading further into more industrialized 
parts of the Midwest, which makes up one-third of the U.S. electricity 
market. 
"Our goal is to achieve a leading position in the United States," said Mr. 
Hartmann, who will remain chief executive of the enlarged E.ON and become 
chairman of Powergen. Powergen Chief Executive Nick Baldwin will continue to 
lead the U.K. utility as a unit of E.ON. 
The deal also will step up E.ON's plans to shed other assets, including major 
subsidiaries such as Degussa AG, a specialty chemicals maker, logistics 
company Stinnes AG, and real estate unit Viterra. 
E.ON and Powergen first disclosed they were in advanced takeover talks nearly 
four months ago. But negotiations snagged on concerns that the acquisition 
would run afoul of strict ownership laws in the U.S. that allow only 
utilities to operate other utilities. Authorities have instead viewed E.ON -- 
which derives half of its market capitalization from activities such as oil, 
chemicals and even electronics -- as a conglomerate. 
E.ON already plans to sell some of those businesses as part of a wider 
restructuring. On Monday, Mr. Hartmann pledged to sell all of them within the 
next three to five years. E.ON plans to make a formal offer for Powergen 
early next year, once it obtains all the regulatory approvals in the U.S., 
U.K. and European Union, and complete the deal by the spring of 2002. 
Like other European utilities, E.ON has been prowling for new acquisitions 
abroad as growing competition and lower electricity prices have cut into 
revenues in its home market. Acquiring Powergen would give E.ON instant 
access to two markets that present more near-term opportunities than 
elsewhere in Europe. Prices being asked for companies in Spain were far too 
high, Mr. Hartmann said, while in France and Italy there were big hurdles for 
purchasers. 
The U.S., by contrast, offers "a market with greater growth than in Europe 
and an energy market that is very fragmented with a lot of opportunity for 
consolidation," he said. 
E.ON and other European utilities also have been eager to expand into the 
U.S. to tap into its lucrative energy trading market particularly as U.S. 
utilities, such as Enron Corp. and Duke Energy Corp., make further inroads 
into Europe's fledgling trading market with their homegrown expertise. 
With Powergen, E.ON will have a utility whose management has 10 years of 
experience competing in a deregulated market and negotiating in the U.S. By 
comparison, the German market embarked on deregulation only three years ago. 
Powergen has been narrowing its generation business in recent years as it 
moved to develop an integrated energy business that includes generation, 
distribution, retail services and trading. Two years ago, for example, 
Powergen owned over 20% of the U.K.'s generating capacity. It now has 10%, 
comprised of seven mainly gas- and coal-fired plants but has expanded in the 
retail sector, adding one million customers last year.

American Airlines became the world's largest air carrier after acquiring the 
assets of bankrupt Trans World Airlines. The deal was completed after a 
federal appeals court denied a last-minute bid by a group of Israeli TWA 
workers to stop financially troubled TWA from selling its assets to American 
Airlines' parent company, AMR. AMR's deal to pay $742 million for the 
airline, plus the assumption of $3.5 billion in debt, does not include funds 
for TWA's unsecured creditors. The Israeli workers are unsecured creditors 
owed about $18 million in salaries and benefits, their attorney said. 
MORE NEWS
American Airlines, meanwhile, said it will charge passengers $10 each for 
paper tickets if a customer qualifies for an electronic ticket, as the 
carrier tries to reduce costs. The fee will be levied for tickets on American 
and American Eagle bought at the AA.com Web site; American's reservations 
centers; its Travel Centers, which are outside airports; and airports. 
American wouldn't say how it decides who qualifies for an e-ticket. 
Bank One has agreed to purchase Wachovia's $8 billion portfolio of consumer 
credit cards for undisclosed terms. The acquisition is the first for 
Chicago-based Bank One since Jamie Dimon became chief executive last March. 
T-bill rates fell. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned 
yesterday fell to 3.82 percent, from 4.125 percent last week. Rates on 
six-month bills fell to 3.815 percent from 4.02 percent. The actual return to 
investors is 3.912 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,903.40, and 3.945 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,807.10. 
Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year constant 
maturity Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in 
adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 4 percent last week from 4.19 percent the 
previous week. 
New York jurors who ordered online music provider MP3.com to pay nearly 
$300,000 to a record label for copyright infringement have told the trial 
judge that they checked the math and discovered they made a mistake: What 
they really meant was $3 million. After seeing press reports about their 
$300,000 award to Tee Vee Toons, jurors over the weekend alerted the federal 
judge of the error in their calculations, according to a court clerk. The 
judge scheduled a hearing. 
AT&T said in a regulatory filing that it's trying to sell a $1.98 billion 
stake in Cablevision Systems, the New York City area's largest cable 
television provider, as it sells investments in other companies to pay down 
debt. 
Prudential Insurance estimated its initial public offering could raise as 
much as $3.9 billion, which would make it the fourth-biggest first-time stock 
sale in U.S. history. Under the name Prudential Financial Inc., the company 
plans to sell 89 million common shares. 
IBM and United Technologies' Carrier unit said they will offer air 
conditioners that can be controlled remotely using personal computers and 
mobile phones. Owners of the new line of air conditioners will be able to set

the companies said. Prices weren't disclosed. 
LOCAL BUSINESS 
Verizon, the nation's largest local phone company, should be split up to 
ensure rivals get fair treatment when seeking access to its network, 
competitors told Virginia regulators. AT&T, Covad Communications, Cavalier 
Telephone and Network Access Solutions asked the Virginia State Corporation 
Commission to split the company into units leasing lines to rivals and 
selling service to its own customers. In Pennsylvania, regulators last month 
ordered Verizon to run separate wholesale and retail units and spared it from 
a breakup. 
W.R. Grace & Co. of Columbia has named David B. Siegel the chemicals firm's 
chief restructuring officer after the company's filing for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection. Siegel will continue to serve as Grace's senior vice 
president and general counsel. Siegel joined Grace in 1977 as corporate 
counsel and has held several positions in the company's legal office. 
Cingular Wireless, the second-largest U.S. mobile-phone company, was sued by

INDIA: India govt says to seek conciliation with Enron.

04/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, April 10 (Reuters) - India said on Tuesday that it planned to seek 
conciliation with U.S. energy giant Enron after the company invoked political 
force majeure over its controversy-ridden power project in western India. 
"We have agreed to conciliation and we will go ahead with conciliation," 
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters on the sidelines of a textiles 
conference. He did not elaborate.
The Indian unit of Enron , Dabhol Power Company (DPC), sent the force majeure 
notice on Monday to state utility Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
The notice was the latest step in a running confrontation between the U.S. 
multinational and the Maharashtra government over unpaid bills. 
Last week, Houston-based Enron notified the government it was applying to an 
arbitration court in London to consider its claim for 1.02 billion rupees 
owed by MSEB for power it purchased in December from DPC. Enron owns 65 
percent of DPC.

India: Finance minister on telecom, textiles policy, Enron issue

04/10/2001
BBC Monitoring

Monitoring/(c) BBC

Excerpt from report by Indian news agency PTI 
New Delhi, 10 April: Indian Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Tuesday [10 
April] said there was no rethinking on the part of Federal Government over 
its telecom policy, but the issue of providing limited area mobile telephone 
through wireless local loop system was being reviewed by the Group of 
Ministers on Telecom.
"Government is not having any rethinking. The issue is being reviewed by a 
group on telecom and IT. We will soon have a meeting of the group to look at 
the policy and make recommendations to the government", Sinha told reporters 
on the sidelines of a conference of state textile ministers in the Indian 
capital city. 
Asked about federal Communication Minister Ram Vilas Paswan's statement that 
the 1999 telecom policy would be modified to enable introduction of Wireless 
Local Loop (WLL), Sinha said Paswan is a member of the group and it will 
listen to what he has to say. 
"I cannot anticipate the conclusions of the group. The one lesson I have 
learnt is not to react to newspaper reports which are appearing," he said. 
On the dispute over Enron's Dabhol power project, Sinha said, Indian 
government has decided to resolve the issue through conciliation. 
"We have agreed to conciliation and we will go ahead with conciliation," 
Sinha said. 
The Dabhol power company had slapped arbitration and conciliation notices on 
federal finance ministry for not settling dues totalling 1.02bn rupees for 
December. 
Sinha's observation came after a meeting of senior officials of federal 
finance and power ministry on Monday which decided to adopt the conciliation 
route rather than arbitration to settle the standoff. 
On the demand of the textile sector to review the 16 per cent excise duty 
imposed on branded garments, Sinha said, he would not like to go into the 
specific taxation proposals now as they were the property of parliament. 
But at the same time, he admitted there were some areas of concern in the 
textile sector which merited reconsideration in consultation with the textile 
ministry. 
On the loss making National Textile Corporation, Sinha said the government 
was "trying its best to revive as many mills as possible within our means". 
The Group of Ministers on NTC had already gone into the issue and had come 
out with some recommendations which would be sent to the cabinet for taking a 
final view, he said. 
Sinha said the government had a very positive approach on the issue. 
Earlier addressing the state textiles ministers conference, Sinha cautioned 
the textiles industry against raising the bogey of dumping and said there was 
no escape from fair competition within the WTO regime. 
"We have to prepare ourselves for fair competition, through modernization, 
upgradation of technology and adoption of good management practices on a 
continuous basis." 
Sinha, however, said government would take all steps to ensure there was no 
unfair competition through enforcement of anti-dumping regulations and tariff 
measures. 
He said the dismantling of Multi-Fibre Agreement by December 2004 offered 
both opportunity and challenges. "If we do not prepare for it we will end up 
on the losing side"...

India: 'Failed business model' for Dabhol

04/10/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, April 9. EVEN as the wrangling continues over the Dabhol power 
project, financial analysts, in consultation with legal experts, are trying 
to identify means by which the feuding parties can back off after cutting 
their losses. 
One proposal that has been put forward is by Mr Pradyumna Kaul, management 
consultant and anti-Enron activist. Mr Kaul has suggested that the project be 
treated as a "failed business model". In other words, a sick company.
In his deposition before the Godbole Committee, set up to examine the Enron 
issue, Mr Kaul examined various alternatives available, and homed in on the 
"open market" method. The model suggests restructuring the project in 
consultation with lenders, as the "minority shareholders have developed 
serious differences with the majority stakeholders". 
Mr Kaul has argued that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) must not be allowed 
third-party sale of power (as suggested by it as a possible solution) as that 
would wean away the high-paying customers of the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board, paving the way for its bankruptcy. 
"A Greenwich University report speaks about 8-10 ways adopted by different 
countries for cancelling IPP contracts. The most common one is a legislative 
fiat - Parliament or a State Assembly pass a law declaring the project 
illegal ab initio, and, therefore, void ab initio. No rights would accrue to 
any of the parties involved in the contract," he told the panel. 
He cited the example of Pakistan which cancelled six projects already 
producing power at one stroke through this route and the nation "remained 
unaffected". 
A "workable private sector cure", according to Mr Kaul, would be to reduce 
the "over-invoiced" capital cost. The share capital, by way of illustration, 
can be written down from Rs 10 to Re 1. This has happened in Far East Asia, 
he said. To deal with the debt, loans have to be restructured and interest 
deferred. 
The capital cost of phase I of the Dabhol project is around Rs 3,760 crore, 
comprising 30 per cent (about Rs 1,100 crore) equity and the rest debt 
(around Rs 2,600 crore). "The equity has to be written down by a factor of 10 
to about Rs 100 crore and the debt has to be brought down by half. The 
interest has to be deferred," Mr Kaul suggested. 
This depends on the Government and MSEB playing a major role.

State seeks more power from Central Grid
The Times of India News Service

04/10/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

BANGALORE: The state government has urged the Centre to provide an additional 
14 million units (MU) of power from the Central Grid to tide over the present 
shortfall in demand. 
Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Energy Minister Veerakumar Patil said 
KPTC chairman V.P. Baligar was in Delhi for talks with the Union Power 
Ministry and had put forth this request.
``The state generates 57.244 MU and is supplemented with 24.260 MU from the 
grid while the demand is around 95 MU leading to a shortfall of roughly 14 
MU,'' he stated. 
Patil said the government had held discussions with Enron of Maharashtra for 
supply of power but dropped the proposal since it was an expensive affair at 
Rs 4.60 per unit. ``We did ask them to reconsider the pricing but they have 
not responded so far,'' he said. 
Meanwhile, the state was also getting ready to implement a programme for 
proper distribution of the available power within a week. ``Irrigation 
pumpsets will get three-phase power only at night, while supply will also be 
suitably regulated for non urban users as well. As of now we have no urban 
loadshedding proposal,'' he declared. 
As for eight-hour uninterrupted power supply for farmers from May 1 as 
announced by Chief Minister S.M. Krishna in his budget speech, Patil felt the 
state would be ready to fulfil the promise. ``We expect demand to fall by May 
enabling us to provide this amount. We are chalking out a detailed programme 
to achieve this,'' he informed. 
Referring to the Raichur Thermal Power Station, he said the third unit had 
started functioning about 10 days ago, while the fifth would commence on May 
15. ``Work on the seventh unit is in full swing and is ahead of schedule by 
28 days,'' he said. 
Asked about arrears, Patil said the KPTC had no outstanding dues to 
Maharashtra from where it buys power but owed the KPC more than Rs 1,000 
crore.

Houston Chronicle
Board picks California firm to build and run water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
A Pasadena, Calif., engineering firm was chosen Monday by a citizens board 
that will now negotiate a design-build-operate contract for a Lake Houston 
water plant that could cost as much as $150 million. 
The Houston Area Water Corp. board, known as the Hawk, voted 4-1 to negotiate 
a contract with Montgomery Watson Inc. despite three recommendations from 
City Hall staff that it choose another bidder. City Hall favored 
Houston-based Azurix Corp., a troubled affiliate of Enron Corp. 
After a contract is worked out, it will be presented to the City Council for 
approval, but the council does not have to accept the board's recommendation. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. Evidence that Mayor Lee 
Brown's administration wanted Azurix to get the contract came when City 
Attorney Anthony Hall had a heated public argument with the Hawk's chairman, 
David Berg, at a mayoral fund-raiser last month. They discussed an attempt by 
City Hall staff to change its calculation to favor Montgomery Watson. 
The staff was told by Hall and the mayor's chief administrative officer that 
such a change would taint the decision process and that the staff should 
support Azurix. The Hawk was not bound by the staff recommendation. 
"There was no pressure from City Hall that I and the board could not 
withstand," Berg said. He also joked when a reporter's cell phone rang 
midmeeting, "If that's Anthony Hall, tell him our anger management class is 
at 3:30." 
The plant is part of a Houston-area surface-water treatment and use plan that 
could cost about $2 billion to implement. Montgomery Watson's bid came in 
around $17 million below Azurix's. The third bidder is U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company. 
"Montgomery Watson is, frankly, cheaper. And that's impressive to me," Berg 
said. He also told the anxious crowd of business people at the meeting that 
he went against the City Hall staff's recommendation in part because of the 
financial viability of the three companies and Azurix's announcement Friday 
that it plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this 
contract. 
"We are disappointed with the decision the Hawk made," said Diane Bazelides, 
spokeswoman for Azurix. 
Board member Andy DeAnda, an engineer, was the sole voter for Azurix, though 
a sixth board member, Binh Ho, was absent but had indicated he, too, would 
have voted for Azurix. "I wanted to respect the staff recommendation," DeAnda 
said. "Plus companies are bought and sold all the time. That doesn't bother 
me." 
Kathi Wilkes, a lobbyist for Montgomery Watson, said it was happy to get the 
board's nod and doesn't really know what pressure City Council will get from 
the other companies. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council's infrastructure 
committee that will hear from the Hawk board, said the council will now ask 
questions of the board and staff and decide if the right decision was made. 
"I don't think everybody's going to walk away. I assume (all three companies) 
will still want to make their case to council about why they should have been 
picked," he said. 
Berg will make a preliminary report to Robinson's committee today. 
"This has been a very long process, longer than we thought," said Berg. "I 
recall (the mayor's chief administrative officer) saying to us it'll be six 
months, six meetings and it'll be over, no big deal." 
The board, appointed almost eight months ago, has instead been a center of 
controversy. Legislators have questioned the wisdom of allowing local 
government corporations like the Hawk to handle such large projects. The 
board is allowed by state law to choose a design-build-operate contract 
winner without following the traditional bidding process. 
There has also been some friction over the Hawk with Harris County and 
regional water boards about how the city of Houston will provide surface 
water and how much it will cost. 




		

		
		

		
		ASIA-PACIFIC, AFRICA & MIDDLE EAST: Enron threat to withdraw from India 
Financial Times; Apr 10, 2001
By DAVID GARDNER and KHOZEM MERCHANT

		Enron, the US-based power company, yesterday delivered a warning that it 
could withdraw from a controversial Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) power project 
in India, where it is locked in a payments dispute with a Bombay utility. 
		Officials at the Houston-based company said last night that it had lost 
confidence in the state company that is contractually obliged to buy the 
output of its Maharashtra plant. 
		Enron's 2,364MW plant at Dabhol, Maharashtra is the biggest foreign 
investment in India and the only one of eight fast-track power projects 
unveiled in the early 1990s to be up and running. Enron's departure would be 
damaging to the government, which held up the sector as a standard-bearer of 
liberalisation, only to see entrants scared off by red tape. Cogentrix of the 
US quit in December 1999 after waiting seven years for approval of its 
project. 
		Enron yesterday issued a "political force majeure" notice to the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB), a standard contractual clause that aggrieved 
parties use as a first step towards possibly quitting. Companies issue the 
notice if they believe circumstances on the ground have undermined a 
contract. 
		Enron is owed Rs2.25bn (Pounds 33m) in unpaid bills by MSEB, which recently 
raised the stakes by imposing a Rs4.02bn penalty on the company for 
"technical under-performance". Enron has called in two federal government 
guarantees on the unpaid bills. Enron said "the concerted, deliberate and 
politically motivated action of the government of Maharashtra, government of 
India and MSEB have or potentially will have a material and adverse effect 
(on the company's) ability to perform obligations under the power purchase 
agreement". 
		Vinay Bansal, chairman of MSEB, said Enron's notice "does not seek particular 
relief so it is unclear what is their intention". But he said MSEB would 
press ahead with its claim for Rs4.02bn for "services that we have a right to 
expect". Enron has dismissed the claim as "frivolous and a diversion". 
		Power industry sources in New Delhi said the effect of Enron's move yesterday 
could be to raise the stakes in its struggle to get paid by MSEB, or to 
signal its intention to withdraw from India. 
		One power industry executive noted, however, that Enron, as part of its 
world-wide strategy, has begun moving out of the ownership of assets into the 
trading of power, although investment in assets is often part of the entry 
strategy to build the trading relationship. "The question is whether Enron is 
willing to write India off," he said. "Or, rather, will they get rid of the 
assets before the trading strategy has had time to get going." For regional
