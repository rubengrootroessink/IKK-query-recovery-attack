Legislative Weekly=20
July 5, 2001=20
Issue 27, Volume 3=20

A weekly publication from the=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association=20
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento




A DEDICATED REVENUE STREAM=20
Department of Water Resources Wants Money to Flow Their Way=20

Six months ago Department of Water Resources took over power purchasing=20
responsibility from the nearly insolvent investor-owned utilities. The=20
general fund was first tapped, then a short-term loan allowed the purchasin=
g=20
to continue.? Now the state needs to issue $13.4 billion in bonds authorize=
d=20
in SBX1 31 (Burton D-San Francisco), to be paid back by utility ratepayers=
=20
for more than a decade.=20

On July 12 the CPUC must decide how much of utility rates should be siphone=
d=20
off to pay off the bonds and the ongoing costs of power being purchased on=
=20
the spot market and under short and long term power contracts signed by DWR=
.=20
This =01&dedicated revenue stream=018 (DRS) will be based on the latest ana=
lysis by=20
utility and administration financial experts. The big question is whether=
=20
current rates are high enough to cover all utility generation costs (nuclea=
r,=20
qualifying facilities, hydro, etc.), DWR power costs, and all the other=20
elements of rates (public purpose charges, transmission and distribution,=
=20
etc.).? Many assumptions about the spot market, the effects of the FERC pri=
ce=20
mitigation order and the level of customer demand enter into the calculatio=
n=20
of the DRS.? Wholesale spot prices have recently dropped, but there still=
=20
could be a shortfall that would need to be made up in higher rates or with=
=20
more borrowing to push off repayment to the future.=20

In related news, last week the CPUC nearly ordered the suspension of direct=
=20
access in order to ensure that customers would not be able to leave utility=
=20
service and thus escape the payment of bond and DWR power costs.? Customer=
=20
groups were able to persuade regulators to put off the decision pending=20
legislation that could clarify a direct access customer's obligation to pay=
 a=20
fair share of these costs.? To that end, ABX2 10 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys) is=
=20
being amended to make the bonds secured by the DRS rather than DWR contract=
s,=20
thus creating more regulatory flexibility regarding the terms of direct=20
access, and SBX2 27 (Bowen D-Marina del Rey) and ABX2 42 (Kelley R-Idyllwil=
d)=20
are the competing vehicles for how exit fees should be calculated.=20
?=20

LOCKYER CONVENES NEW GRAND JURY ON ALLEGED PRICE GOUGING=20

California Attorney General Bill Lockyer appointed 19 new members to a=20
Sacramento County Grand Jury this week to consider the growing volume of=20
evidence from both sides on the continuing investigations of alleged price=
=20
gouging by power generators. The Grand Jury to be convened later this week=
=20
will be issuing subpoenas for testimony and documents and is expected to be=
=20
impaneled for several months.=20

In a related development, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante and Assemblywoman=20
Barbara Matthews reportedly will introduce two new =01&whistleblowers=018 a=
t the=20
state capitol on Thursday from a San Diego power plant. Recent testimony fr=
om=20
three employees before a legislative committee investigating charges of=20
wrongdoing on the part of a San Diego power plant claimed their employer,=
=20
Duke Energy, manipulated the supply of electricity from the plant to increa=
se=20
the company's profits. In response, generators have produced documents=20
showing they were simply following the direction from the State Independent=
=20
System Operator to modify their electricity output.=20
?=20

WINDFALL PROFITS TAX LEGISLATION TO BE CONSIDERED=20

SBX2 1 (Soto D-Pomona) would impose a =01&windfall profits=018 tax on elect=
rical=20
power generators and is scheduled for hearing on Monday, July 9th in the=20
Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee. CMTA opposes the bill.=20

SBX2 1 pertains to all types of electricity generation including=20
co-generation produced and sold by manufacturers and generation by other=20
qualified facilities such as bio-mass and solar plants.? It causes the=20
=01&excess profit=018 to be confiscated by the state from a middleman in th=
e supply=20
chain: a 100% tax.? This revenue is then distributed to individual taxpayer=
s=20
but not to business taxpayers (who paid the middleman the excess in the fir=
st=20
place).=20

The bill is a state-imposed price cap.? Excess profit is defined as anythin=
g=20
exceeding a cost-based rate established by the PUC on a plant-by-plant=20
basis.?? If enacted, SBX2 1 would have almost no effect on merchant=20
generators, as most of them have entered into contracts with the state that=
=20
pass on the cost of any increased taxes to the state.? Furthermore, this=20
legislation would violate federal law which preempts state law in this area=
.?=20
In accordance with the 1979 federal law, the PUC has set the price at which=
=20
co-generators and other QFs can sell their energy.? It is the cost that the=
=20
utility would have charged had it performed the sale. This formula was=20
devised to encourage manufacturers to build on-site generation and sell=20
excess power for public use.? This formula did not guarantee a profit for=
=20
such generators but gave them an incentive to build generation facilities a=
nd=20
operate efficiently.? Changing the formula would result in manufacturers=20
refusing to build more generation facilities and increased litigation costs=
=20
until the courts wipe away SBX2 1 (Soto).=20
?=20

LIABILITY FOR ELECTRICAL NON-GENERATION=20

CMTA strongly opposed ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno) which would make any retail =
or=20
wholesale operator of an electric generation facility strictly liable for a=
ny=20
damages proximately caused by that generator's reduction or discontinuance =
of=20
service for economic reasons.

Neither negligence nor intent must be proven in order to establish strict=
=20
liability.? Under this legislation, a generator could be held strictly liab=
le=20
for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the=
=20
generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance,=20
unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors (i.e. the=
=20
high cost of fuel).? ABX2 51 also would make it difficult for a generator t=
o=20
permanently close a facility, even if the facility was not operating=20
profitably.=20

Generators are only one component of many that work together to provide=20
reliable electricity supplies throughout the State.? However, ABX2 51 would=
=20
result in generators shouldering the responsibility for all damages,=20
liability and responsibility for electricity shortages.=20

Amendments were taken to remove co-generation from the bill.? However, CMTA=
=20
will continue to oppose the measure on the principal that imposing strict=
=20
liability on generators will only discourage generators from siting new=20
facilities and selling their electricity within the State.=20

The measure passed from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July 2 and next=
=20
will be heard in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee.
?=20

STREAMLINING THE PIPELINE PERMITTING PROCESS=20

The CMTA is supporting ABX2 47 (Diaz D-San Jose) which would increase the=
=20
financial threshold necessary to obtain a Public Utilities Commission (PUC)=
=20
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from $50 million to=
=20
$100 million.? Increasing this threshold will allow for expedited=20
construction of new natural gas pipelines and will help to shore up the=20
infrastructure needed to increase the State's natural gas capacity.

The measure also streamlines the permitting process for new pipeline=20
construction, requiring the PUC to act on a permit request within 12 months=
=20
of receiving a completed application.? Failure to act on the permit would=
=20
result in the automatic issuance of a CPCN.=20

Natural gas is a necessary component of many CMTA members=01, industrial an=
d=20
manufacturing operations.? Given the State's heavy reliance on imported=20
natural gas, CMTA supports expediting the construction of new pipelines to=
=20
ensure that a sufficient supply of this critical fuel is available for use.
?=20

REPORTING TO THE EOB MAY OPEN RECORDS FOR PUBLIC REVIEW=20

A measure that allows the Energy Oversight Board (EOB) to inspect and make=
=20
public all of a facility's records, data, accounts, books or documents=20
related to reliability, availability, and the cost of electric service was=
=20
heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on June=
=20
27.=20

CMTA testified in opposition to ABX2 28 (Migden D-San Francisco) which=20
substantially expands the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO=
)=20
to adopt operating and availability standards for electricity generation an=
d=20
transmission.=20

ABX2 28 also would allow the ISO to regulate a facility's co-generation=20
scheduling and maintenance practices, which would have the practical effect=
=20
of giving the ISO regulatory authority over a business=01, primary industri=
al=20
operations.=20

Since many of the co-generation facilities do not keep separate records for=
=20
the electricity component of their facilities, this requirement could open =
up=20
much of the facility's private operational records for their competitors=01=
, and=20
public review.=20

Committee members expressed concern regarding the effect of expanding the=
=20
authority of the Energy Oversight Board, how the measure affects the handli=
ng=20
of documents subject to the Public Records Act, and clarification regarding=
=20
the purpose for which documents would be used.=20

The measure was subject to testimony and discussion, however a vote was not=
=20
taken. The measure will again be heard on July 10.=20
?=20

NEW FISHING LIMITS FOR REGIONAL WATER BOARDS=20

In late May, Assemblymember Fran Pavley=01,s (D-Agoura Hills) AB 1664, whic=
h=20
makes various changes to state and regional water board penalty authority,=
=20
was amended on the Assembly Floor to remove language that would have create=
d=20
major new penalty exposures for manufacturers.? Shortly thereafter, questio=
ns=20
surfaced concerning a subtle change to a section of the water code that=20
grants authority to the regional boards to issue orders for investigation o=
f=20
waste discharges.? The concern pertains to the ability of the regional boar=
ds=20
to issue investigation orders to parties =01&suspected of having discharged=
=018=20
waste at some point in the past.? Orders issued under these circumstances=
=20
typically involve contentious property access issues and costly monitoring=
=20
requirements.? This section of the code is already used liberally by the=20
regional boards and the change in AB 1664 arguably invites more orders that=
=20
lack a clear nexus between the discharger=01,s past activities and the susp=
ected=20
discharge.=20

AB 1664 was amended earlier this week in Senate Environmental Quality=20
Committee to address this issue.? The bill's sponsor, the State Water=20
Resources Control Board, and Assemblymember Pavley agreed to take language=
=20
requiring that any new investigation order be accompanied by a written=20
statement identifying the evidence upon which the order is based.? This=20
clarification applies to all circumstances under which investigation orders=
=20
are issued and should help to ensure that regional boards do not abuse this=
=20
authority.=20
?=20

CAL-OSH STANDARDS BOARD TO CONSIDER ERGONOMIC RULE=20

On the agenda for the July 19, 2001 meeting in San Diego, the California=20
Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board (Standards Board) will=20
consider a petition from organized labor to adopt the recently overturned=
=20
federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) ergonomic rule as a state=
=20
rule for California.? If adopted, it would replace California's repetitive=
=20
motion standard (Title 8, CCR 5110).=20

Employers opposed the federal rule because most employers believed it was=
=20
based on dubious science that could not accurately identify the cause of=20
repetitive motion injuries attributable to work.? The federal rule containe=
d=20
restrictions that would prohibit doctors from providing information on=20
non-occupational causation of injury that would interfere with an employer'=
s=20

=20
gross pay; and the continuation of employer provided fringe benefits for up=
