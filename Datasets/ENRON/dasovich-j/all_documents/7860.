3. How to Withdraw Retirement Funds
----------------------------------------------------------------

Congratulations -- you've retired with an investment portfolio
that you've grown diligently.  Now, how do you get the money
out? What's the right balance of taxable and non-taxed assets
to draw upon each year? This article lays out the key issues
and suggests a "mix-and-match" strategy for tapping into
retirement assets.

----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Making Sense of Analyst Recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------------

What do Wall Street analysts really mean when they rate a
stock as buy, accumulate, hold and neutral? Our columnist
explains how to maintain perspective when you hear an
analyst's assessment of a stock you own or are researching.

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t8/eb_dec/ss/assessment/

----------------------------------------------------------------
5. The Role of Investor Relations
----------------------------------------------------------------

Publicly traded companies usually communicate with the
investment world through a function known as Investor
Relations, or IR.  A company's IR department or outside agency
can be a valuable resource for an individual investor.  This
column presents the IR basics, such as how IR professionals
disclose "material" news and information and deal with the
media.

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t9/eb_dec/ss/IR/

----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Great Earnings -- or Are They?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Investors are taught to look closely at a company's earnings.
But what are earnings? The answer depends on what definition
you apply.  This column clarifies the differences between net
income, operating earnings, and earnings before excluding
certain items.  It also explains why a company's earnings are
not the same thing as its cash flow.

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t10/eb_dec/ss/earnings/

----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Schwab's New Website for Women Investors
----------------------------------------------------------------

At Schwab we understand that women have special investing
needs.  That's why we've designed the Women Investing Now web
site.  It's a place where you can share investing stories,
hear what investing professionals have to say and join a
growing community of women investors.

The website has several sections:

* "Talk/Share/Learn" enables women to learn from investing
professionals and other Schwab customers. * "Dates to
Remember" lists investing workshops and online community
events. * The "Life Events Series" provides action plans to
help deal with life events such as retirement, job changes,
divorce and loss of a spouse.

Visit the Women Investing Now website today!

----------------------------------------------------------------
8. Lower Commissions on Automated Phone Trades!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Good news! Qualifying equity trade orders placed via Schwab's
automated phone channels -- TeleBroker(R) (touch-tone) and
Schwab by Phone(TM) (speech recognition) -- are now just
$29.95* per trade up to 1,000 shares.  For trades over 1,000
shares, commissions are just $0.03 per share.

We recently added new speech recognition functionality to
Schwab by Phone, so it's easier than ever to use for quotes,
trading, account services and more! To place a trade order on
Schwab by Phone, dial 1-800-435-8804, press 2 for Trades, key
in your account number and PIN, and say "trade."  To place a
trade order on TeleBroker, dial 1-800-272-4922.

* The $29.95 price cannot be combined with any other offer.

----------------------------------------------------------------
9. Think Bond Funds Aren't for You? Think Again!
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bond funds typically provide relative stability, reliable
income and diversification.  Plus, for the first time since
1990, bonds are actually outperforming stocks so far this
year.*

To learn more about SchwabFunds' full range of bond funds go to:

http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t12/eb_dec/ss/bondfunds/

Prospectuses containing more complete information including
management fees, charges and expenses are available from
Schwab.  Please read the prospectus carefully before
investing.

*Source: Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.  Through 9/30/00, stocks
as measured by the S&P 500(R) Index are down 1.39%; taxable
bonds, as measured by the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond
Index, are up 7.12% and municipal bonds, as measured by the
Lehman Brothers General Muni Bond Index, are up 7.01%.  Past
performance is no guarantee of future results.  Indices are
unmanaged and their returns assume reinvested dividends.
Unlike fund returns, indices do not reflect any fee or expense
deductions and cannot be invested in directly.

10. New Annuity Info on Schwab.com
----------------------------------------------------------------

In response to customers' interest in annuities, Charles
Schwab Insurance Services is launching a new educational site.
At www.schwab.com/annuities (under the "Investments" tab),
you can find information and tools to help you decide if an
annuity is right for you.

The site has sections on the advantages of tax-deferred
investing, a comparison of variable annuities with other types
of retirement plans, and details on the low cost, flexible
Schwab Select Annuity(TM).  If you already own an annuity, the
site can help you determine whether it makes sense to transfer
your annuity assets to Schwab.

In addition, if you own a Schwab Select Annuity, you can
access your annuity account information at this site and
manage your annuity assets online.

DISCLOSURE: Variable annuity contracts (J434) are issued by
Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company (in New York
State, by First Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company)
and distributed by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.

For a prospectus containing more complete information
including management fees, charges and expenses, please call
Charles Schwab Insurance Services at 1-800-838-0650.
(New York residents call 1-800-838-0649) Please read the
prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.

11. Now Available -- Mutual Fund Select List(TM): Sector Funds
----------------------------------------------------------------

We're pleased to introduce the Sector Select List, a
complement to our popular Mutual Fund Select List.  The funds
in the Sector Select List are arranged according to market
sector, and have been carefully chosen by Schwab's Center for
Investment Research(R) based upon total return, expenses and
risk.

Used together, the Mutual Fund Select List and the Sector
Select List can help you build a diversified portfolio.  If
you've already established a core foundation of broadly
diversified investments, you can use the Sector Select List to
explore areas of the market that may provide greater growth
potential. A mutual funds prospectus contains complete
information, including fees and expenses.  To obtain one for
any fund available through Schwab, call 1-800-435-4000 or
visit schwab.com.  Always read the prospectus carefully before
investing. The Schwab Center for Investment Research is a
division of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.
