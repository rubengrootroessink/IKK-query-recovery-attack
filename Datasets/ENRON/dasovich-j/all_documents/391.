Scott, it's hard to say. Hackney indicated there would be a revised
"principles" piece before long, so maybe we'll just have to wait. They do
have some legitimate concerns - if they're going to invest in distribution
system upgrades, they need to know what's going to stay in ratebase and
what's going to be competitive. There is a danger that the rules will
remain so murky that nothing will get done by anyone - something akin to a
reluctance to invest in generation so long as the ISO screws around with
must run contracts and congestion management schemes. We would probably all
benefit by knowing what the rules are going to be going forward.
On the other hand, it's hard to believe that SCE and the others don't want
to nail down everything in sight for themselves. However, there appears to
be a growing understanding that the farther they try to reach, the more
uncertainty they produce - they can't have it both ways.
Sooner or later there is going to have to be some consensus on what stays
regulated and what goes competitive. Don't know what you think the chances
are that it will be sooner, but at least it seems SCE is indicating a
willingness to engage in meaningful discussions that I haven't seen before.
