Hi Everyone,

In support of Alessandro Ratti's e-mail to you, I strongly urge you to
attend the Alumni Pizza Dinners that will be held Monday and Tuesday of
next week in Room C230 during the break.  Tenny Frost, Director of Alumni
Relations, and two EvMBA alums, Pamela Horrick and Peter Loukianoff,  who
are on the Haas Alumni Board will be telling you about the on-line
community network of Haas alums.

From the day you arrived at the Haas School, you became members of the
alumni network, and this is a great opportunity to learn how you can take
advantage of all the opportunities that the network provides you both
personally and professionally.

I hope you can find a few minutes in your busy schedules to attend this
important event!

Cheers,

Diane
