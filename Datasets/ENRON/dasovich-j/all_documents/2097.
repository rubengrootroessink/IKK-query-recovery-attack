Attached is write-up that discusses PG&E's past behavior and outlines the 
various facts that could lead to a compromise solution.  Please read it, 
because I think it is very enlightening and may be a useful tool in 
discussions with regulators, legislators, the Governor, and PG&E.  If you 
have any other thoughts, please share them with us.  I have omitted a 
write-up on a post-freeze market structure and defer to Government Affairs on 
articulating a proposal that is competitively-friendly.

Roger
