Jeff, when you get the description, just go to the bottom of the page and hit 
continue, then your election form will appear and when you get to the bottom 
of that form, click accept and then you will be able to print your 
confirmation statement.  Also, if you prefer to print the form before 
entering your information, you can do so from the bottom of the page.  
Sometimes people, for whatever reason, can't see the whole screen, so they 
can't see the buttons "I Accept"  or "Continue" or "Print" and then they have 
to go to the display settings if maximizing the screen doesn't help.  Let me 
know if none of this works for you or you can call me at 713-853-5878 and 
I'll walk you through it.

Thanks.

Mary

Hi Mary:
Well, the problem is likely just that I'm dense.  I log in, click on deferral 
and find a description of what one needs to do (i.e., fill out the form), but 
I've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form.  Am I 
(probably) missing something?  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff
