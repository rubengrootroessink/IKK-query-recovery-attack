There is 4 proposed decisions that came out today. The CPUC is set to vote =
on=20
them tomorrow.  Here is a quick overview:

1) Two decisions address how much money is collected for going forward=20
electric energy costs and how much of that is paid to CDWR. Average rates a=
re=20
to increase 3c/kWh.  Further the AB1x  1 c/kWh is to continue.   Thus, the=
=20
total increase, relative to rates in effect in year 2000,  is 4 c/kWh=20
($40/MWh). Lynch was very unclear how this rate would be implemented for=20
residential customers (a tiering proposal will be heard separately and take=
=20
30-45 days to implement).  One of these decisions addresses how to measure=
=20
past undercollections but as far as rate increases go, they are to cover on=
ly=20
going forward costs.
2) One decision addresses QF issues.  I have not seen the PD (It is expecte=
d=20
out shortly).  The Wood PD revises his revised PD of last week (yes, a=20
revised, revised PD) as follows:
a) Requires QFs to be paid on a going forward basis (as of 4/1/01). Utiliti=
es=20
to pay within 15 days upon presentation of an invoice.  No help for past du=
e=20
amounts, however.
b) Change the SRAC energy index from Topock to Malin.  Such a change will=
=20
lower the SRAC energy by =01&4 c/kWh=018.  This is a 15% to 25% hit to SRAC=
=20
relative to the status quo, which is based more or entirely on Topock.
c) Calls for workshops to further refine the gas basis for SRAC and address=
=20
other factors in the SRAC formula such as heat rates and O&M factors=20
d) Works with Section 390, as is, does not depend on a legislative change
i) Thus the reason why SRAC is based upon a border price index.
e) Overall cap (i.e. 7.9 c/kWh) is dropped.
The fourth decision addresses an investigation of the utility holding=20
companies.  Basically the CPUC is going after utility holding companies for=
=20
funds to reduce the past undercollections.

Further Notes taken by Sue Mara during the press conference:

Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the "failure to act", sellers for hi=
gh=20
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package. =
=20
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is=
=20
34%.  Sellers "have us over a barrell" for those sales.  Attorney Gen=20
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=
ts=20
-- this doesn't address the "$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care o=
f=20
in Sacramento."  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=20
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.=
=20
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- "our cries have fallen on=
=20
deaf ears"

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning=
=20
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 39=
0=20
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas inde=
x=20
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, wher=
e=20
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
=20
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for=
=20
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the=
=20
payments are for going forward costs. "It's time to pay the power bills for=
=20
California."  CPA calculated based on the "residual" method, rather than th=
e=20
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,=20
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
.=20
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge=20
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers=
=20
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers=
=20
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase=
,=20
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's=20
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Tak=
es=20
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding=
=20
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e=20
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate=20
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use) =
=20
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided=
=20
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above =
--=20
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=
o=20
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

I'm still listening.
