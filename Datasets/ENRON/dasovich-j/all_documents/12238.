ABSTRACT OF COURSE'S CONTENT AND OBJECTIVES:
This course offers a framework to understand how taxes affect a firm's
investment and financing strategies. Taxes affect investment strategies
because the differential tax treatment of the various investments affect
both their before and after tax rates of return. Taxes influence financing
decisions because of their impact on a firm's cost of capital. This course
will downplay the technical detail under the assumption that you
intend to become effective managers not tax experts. Tax rules and
regulations will be presented and discussed in the broader context of firm
strategy. We will focus on fundamental tax principles, the understanding of
which will provide you with a framework to integrate the constant
changes in the tax laws. Note that we will focus on both individual and
corporate tax, under the assumption that good tax decisions consider
the impact of all parties in a transaction. For instance, when a firm is
deciding on a compensation policy for its managers, it has consider both
the managers' tax situation as well as its own.
