Attached is a sumamry of three recent SDG&E letters.? Pay  particular 
attention to 1345-E, in which? SDG&E is allocating its remaining  
overcollected URG revenues to the benefit of AB 265 customers, rather than 
to  the large customers to whom these revenues were originally  allocated.
?
AL 1346-E is also interesting,  in that it has the utility's ratepayers 
reimbursing the State for its costs of  negotiating and implementing the MOU.
