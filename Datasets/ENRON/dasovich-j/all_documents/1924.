Sue and Jeff,

I have been asked to update the attached matrix and redistribute it to our 
group.  I would like to get this out to everyone by noon on Tuesday, Oct. 3.  
Please let me know if you have anything to add/change.

I believe this will be the information source that Tracy will use to keep the 
map current.

Thanks for your help, and have a nice weekend!
