This is from PIRA.  There stuff is usually quite good.  To go farther back 
than '98 would require special work on their part.  The person at PIRA 
basically indicated that such data would come straight from the WSCC/NERC.  
So that really leaves the WSCC suggestion as being the only viable one if you 
want a long-term view.
