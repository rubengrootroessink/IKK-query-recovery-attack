AB 1784:  Internet Tax Freedom Act: Continuation  Introduced: 1/26/00
The California Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits, with specified exceptions, 
the imposition, assessment, or attempt to collect (1) a tax on Internet 
access, On-line Computer Services, or the use of the Internet or On-line 
Computer Services, (2) a bit or bandwidth tax, or (3) any discriminatory tax 
on On-line Computer Services or Internet access.  This act provides that it 
is to become inoperative on January 1, 2002.
This bill would remove this limit on the operation of the California Internet 
Tax Freedom Act.

Status: read first time. 



SB 1217: Internet broadband access.   Introduced: 2/26/99
Under the Public Utilities Act, the Public Utilities Commission has the 
authority to regulate public utilities, including telecommunications.

through wireline broadband Internet access transport providers.
This bill would enact the Internet Access Enhancement Act of 1999. 
The bill would require a wireline broadband Internet access transport 
provider, as defined, to provide any other requesting Internet service 
provider, as defined, access to the broadband
Internet access transport services of that transport provider, as prescribed.
