A rate payer relief bill  passed AB 1156 which would 
transfer $150,000,000 from the general fund  to a subaccount within the 
Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.  
would appropriate those funds from the subaccount, to the commission, to 
reduce the adverse impact of high-cost wholesale energy purchases on certain 
ratepayers if a specified rate ceiling is in effect, and if the commission 
determines that a specified revenue shortfall would result in a ratepayer 
surcharge greater than 10%, and the electricity rates were directly linked to 
Power Exchange costs.  
declare that, on January 1, 2004, any remaining balance in the account would 
revert to the General Fund.
become operative only if AB 265 is enacted, as specified.
 take effect immediately as an urgency statute.  
Attached is the bill
