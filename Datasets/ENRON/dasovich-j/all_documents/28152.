FOCUS Utilities selling to California pressured by re-regulation, FERC talks

---- by Ben Morgan-Sanjurjo ---- 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of utilities with significant market exposure to 
California are expected to remain under pressure from fears that 
re-regulation could chip away at company revenues, dealers said.
There are also concerns that federally supervised talks, begun yesterday, 
designed to address allegations that electricity sellers overcharged 
California for power, may result in a 9 bln usd bill, they said. 
Power marketers involved in the negotiations with utilities and state 
legislatures include Enron Corp, Calpine Corp, Duke Energy Corp, Williams 
Companies Inc, Reliant Energy and Dynegy Inc New. 
Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Mike Barbis said that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission's (FERC) proceedings to mediate between California's 
power buyers and sellers will end "unfavourably for the sellers." 
California Governor Gray Davis is seeking a 9.0 bln usd refund from western 
utility groups it claims inflated power bills. 
"In our view, the political playing field for power generators and marketers 
has shifted," said Barbis. 
"We would avoid those companies with the largest exposure to California 
including Mirant, Reliant Resources and Dynegy," said Barbis. 
Negotiators have 15 days starting yesterday to come to an agreement. If the 
talks fail, FERC commissioners will render a final ruling. 
Morgan Stanley analyst Kit Konolidge said: "We think these numbers are way 
overstated and any real refunds will be far less." 
"Realistically, we might never see the real number," said Konolidge. 
Power generators will likely agree to a smaller figure they can "live with to 
put this behind them." 
Additionally, FERC's decision last week to reintroduce price controls in 
California and eleven other Western states could also affect power marketers 
profitability, analysts said. 
CIBC World Markets analyst William Hyler said that "FERC's latest measures 
have to be viewed as a step away from a purely market-based solution." 
Power marketers will not be allowed to sell at a price of more than 85 pct of 
the cost of natural gas needed to serve the electricity load during 
non-emergency hours. 
The wholesale price will be derived from the price of gas either in northern 
or southern California. 
However, Hyler also said the "current initiative appears much more palatable 
than hard price caps, which ignore the impact of fuel cost and emission 
credits or cost-base pricing." 
Hyler further explained that the key issue is whether FERC's decision will 
attract or take away from additional investment in electricity production 
needed to moderate the supply/demand balance in California. 
"In the event new plant investments are curtailed, the validity of the price 
mitigation plan will obviously come under question," said Hyler. 
While Hyler does not expect much impact on power generators, "those companies 
with more of a trading focus on the western markets could be effected by the 
declines in regional volatility we might expect from the mitigation plan." 
The crisis began last year when Pacific Gas & Electric Corp, Southern 
California Edison Co and San Diego Gas & Electric Co, operating in a 
semi-deregulated market place were forced to buy wholesale power at ten times 
average costs. 
Power marketers increased wholesale power prices due to high natural gas 
prices, strong demand and tight supply, forcing them to highs of 202 usd per 
megawatt hour from 29 usd in less than one year. 
However, while utilities bought power at such high prices they were only 
allowed to sell to customers at lower fixed rates. 
Eventually, utilities stopped paying their bills for the power they were 
purchasing, said Barbis. 
One result was the declaration of bankruptcy of PG&E. 
Analysts estimate that more than 14 bln usd is owed to power generators by 
utilities. 
At 2.30 pm, Enron shares were trading 50 cents lower at, Calpine Corp fell 36 
cents to 38.61, Duke Energy Corp lost 20 cents to 39.30, Williams Companies 
Inc gained 9 cents to 32.45, Reliant Energy fell 40 cents to 30.15, Dynegy 
Inc declined 5 cents to 42.87 and Mirant Corp was up 7 cents at 31.07. 
The DJIA gained 16.37 points to 10,520.50, the S&P 500 fell 0.75 to 1,217.85, 
while the Nasdaq composite rose 7.34 points to 2,058.21.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron's Keen On Asia's Young Market
By Michael Rieke

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- If the U.S. market for bandwidth is nascent, the market 
in Asia is still in the conceptual stage.
But if a market is underdeveloped and the potential is attractive, Enron is 
probably interested, and it is. 
Enron knows margins are usually very high in the early stages of any market. 
The company also wants to get established early to capture big market share, 
as it's done in energy markets in the U.S. and Europe. 
Enron is focused on Asia's four least-regulated markets - Japan, Hong Kong, 
Singapore and Australia - which account for 70% of the region's wholesale 
leased-line revenue, said Fred Cohagan, director of global wholesale services 
in Asia for Enron Broadband Services. 
Enron began operating a Tokyo pooling point for trading in March, the same 
month it opened an office in Singapore, said Cohagan, speaking recently from 
Singapore. The trading giant will begin operating pooling points in Hong 
Kong, Singapore and Sydney next quarter. 
Enron has a desk of five traders divided among Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo 
and has commercial people on the ground in Seoul and Hong Kong. Soon, the 
company will be willing to buy or sell bandwidth in markets for minimum 
three-month contracts, followed by six-month and one-year quotes. It will 
quote spot and forward markets - initially for STM1 capacity, then for STM4 
and DS3. 
Potential players are well defined. About 50 companies have capacity in one 
form or another, whether through leases, indefeasible rights of use or equity 
ownership, Cohagan said. 
Because the cost of entering the Asian telecom capacity market is high, there 
are fewer companies of questionable financial status than in the U.S. and 
Europe. 
Prices for transpacific data capacity are four to six times higher than 
transatlantic prices, said Alan Mauldin, a researcher for Telegeography, a 
telecommunications research and data firm in Washington, D.C. 
Ron Banaszek, director of TFS Telecom, a bandwidth brokerage in New York 
City, gave a still greater spread between transpacific and transatlantic 
prices. An STM1 between Los Angeles and Tokyo is probably $90,000 a month, 
compared with $10,000 for an STM1 from New York to London, he said. 
That's because there's about three times as much capacity in the 
transatlantic market as in the transpacific market, Mauldin said. Growing 
Room 

The Asian market, however, needs some foundation work done. Standard 
contracts need to be developed, and players need to understand the idea of 
liquidated damages for nonperformance. 
There's also the challenge of introducing market prices in an area accustomed 
to basing prices on costs, said Ciara Ryan, head of Arthur Andersen's 
bandwidth trading team. 
Carriers deployed the Asian and transpacific networks according to five-year 
market forecasts. They projected how much demand there would be for capacity 
in five years, built networks to handle that much demand and are trying to 
sell capacity at prices based on the cost of laying and lighting the 
networks. 
Carriers, which have walked away from deals to sell below cost in the past, 
are reluctant to lower prices while waiting for demand to rise to the level 
of supply. But the weak financial state of many carriers has forced them to 
think again about the revenue they could be earning now from their invested 
capital. 
"I'd definitely say I've seen lots of interest," Cohagan said. 
He wouldn't name specific companies, but said all the global and regional 
carriers are interested. Enron has already done deals with global companies, 
Internet service providers, corporations and regional carriers for capacity 
in Asia, he said. Corporate interest comes from energy and software 
companies. 
Some regional carriers are interested in seasonal wholesale markets for 
capacity to the United States on a weekly basis, he said. He wouldn't 
disclose the reason for the demand for seasonal capacity, indicating that it 
was proprietary information. 
Demand is coming from companies wanting capacity to the United States from 
Asia, rather than capacity between individual countries in Asia, said Lionel 
Guerrara, a consultant with Arthur Andersen in London. 
Some of that demand comes from European companies, he said. Because there's 
little capacity available directly from Asia to Europe, companies on the 
Continent buy capacity from Asia to the U.S., across the States and then 
across the Atlantic to Europe. It's a less direct route, but it can be 
lower-priced.

CANADA: Enron goes after Alberta power users, eyes Ontario.

06/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

CALGARY, Alberta, June 26 (Reuters) - Corp. , one of the largest energy 
companies in the world, is entering Alberta's retail electricity and natural 
gas markets and hopes to expand into Ontario's large and lucrative power 
market, company officials said on Tuesday. 
"Alberta stands on its own. But if the regulatory environment is one that is 
conducive to competition, we'd certainly like to scale this model into other 
provinces as they open up for competition, " Rob Milnthorp, chief executive 
of Enron Direct Canada Corp, said in an interview following a news 
conference. "It (Ontario) is a logical extension."
The Canadian subsidiary of Houston, Texas-based Enron Corp. is targeting 
about 100,000 commercial and light industrial users of electricity, and an 
equal number of gas users, in Alberta. 
The province's gas market has been deregulated for years while competition 
for electrical customers began in January. The incumbent city-owned 
utilities, Enmax Corp. in Calgary and Epcor Utilities Inc. in Edmonton, 
currently dominate Alberta's retail energy scene. 
Ontario, the most populated province and source of the majority of Canada's 
industrial electrical demand, is tentatively scheduled to deregulate its 
power industry next May. The process has been delayed several times in 
efforts to avoid problems such as those seen in California, where 
deregulation has been blamed for skyrocketing prices and rotating blackouts. 
Milnthorp declined to comment, citing confidentiality agreements, on whether 
Enron was negotiating to buy retail gas and power divisions recently put on 
the block by Atco Ltd. , a large Alberta-based utility. 
At its annual meeting in mid-May, Atco executives said they hoped to sell the 
units by the end of this month. 
Enron is already a player in Alberta's electrical market. It paid C$300 
million ($199 million) last August to secure a 20-year contract to market 706 
megawatts of power, part of the provincial government's plan to encourage 
competition. 
($1=$1.52 Canadian).

European Traders To Launch Crucial Gas Trading Contract
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Opening up Europe's gas market is slowly getting 
underway. One crucial element is lacking - a standardized short-term trading 
contract that will help large customers to pick and choose the best offer in 
the market, rather than remain shackled to a traditional long-term supplier. 
Energy company representatives are gathering in Amsterdam Wednesday to thrash 
out such a contract.
"Due to the development of gas markets in Europe, especially in Germany, the 
time is ripe for creating a standard European contract," Joerg Spicker, a 
spokesman for the European Federation of Energy Traders, told Dow Jones 
Newswires. Spicker is managing director of the German subsidiary of Aquila 
Energy, a Utilicorp United Inc. (UCU) unit. 
EFET members will create a "template" that could be used in all the trading 
hubs around Europe, which are emerging as delivery locations for gas sold on 
a short-term basis, Spicker said. An attachment to the standard contract 
would specify which hub will be used for physical delivery of the gas. 
"One hurdle to liquidity (in these hubs) is the lack of a standard contract," 
Steve Asplin, director for Benelux operations at energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) said, adding that he sees the EFET initiative as a positive step 
forward. 
The standard contract is likely to be in euros per gigajoules and will enable 
counterparties in the trade to choose which domestic law - German, Dutch or 
English - should apply to the contract. 
By creating such a contract, EFET aims to replicate in the gas sector the 
success of its two standard contracts for European electricity trading, which 
were launched in 1999 and 2000 and are now widely used for the wholesaletrade 
of electricity on the continent. 
The standardization of contract terms is deemed essential for development of 
spot markets in mainland Europe, following the blueprint set by the U.K. 
since the 1980s and in Belgium since 1999. 
In addition, the EFET initiative comes just one week ahead of another 
industry-wide meeting in London, when representatives of European gas 
industry will discuss the creation of U.K.-style trading hubs in northwest 
Europe. 
Since earlier this year, small amounts of gas sourced from the U.K., the 
Netherlands and Norway have been sold on a short-term basis - instead of 
through traditional long-term contracts - for delivery in places such as 
Emden and Lampertheim in Germany and Oude Statenzijl and Bunde on the 
Dutch/German border. 
The development of short-term trading there been made possible by the gradual 
opening up of pipelines through the so-called third party access measures 
imposed by the European Union's gas directive, which most member states 
implemented by the August 2000 deadline. 
Developments in the German market, which is estimated at 82 billion cubic 
meters a year, have been closely watched by foreign companies wishing to sell 
gas to large industries, which are now free, at least on paper, to move away 
from their traditional long-term suppliers. 
Wednesday's meeting in Amsterdam will be largely attended by lawyers 
representing EFET members, such as Germany's RWE AG (G.RWE), the U.S.'s 
Mirant Energy Corp. (MIR), Dynergy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE). 
Traders and lawyers will attend a joint meeting scheduled for early July. 
Some of those participating in the meeting are also part of the European Hub 
Steering Committee, which will meet July 4 to discuss steps to be taken for 
the creation of a North-West European hub. 
"There is an efficient overlap (with the EFET group) and no efforts are being 
duplicated," Spicker said.

India Court Dismisses Enron Petition On MERC - Report

06/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY -(Dow Jones)- India's provincial High Court in Bombay Tuesday 
dismissed Dabhol Power Co.'s petition challenging the jurisdiction of 
Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission, or MERC, to adjudicate 
on the payment dispute between Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the 
company, the Press Trust of India reported. 
Dabhol Power is the Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE), which 
holds a controlling 65% stake.
Further, the Bombay High Court has directed MERC to decide on this issue 
within six weeks, the report said. 
According to the report, the High Court said MERC was an expert body and 
competent enough to decide its own jurisdiction. However, the court has 
stayed the order until July 10 to enable Dabhol Power to petition the Supreme 
Court in an appeal. 
An official at Dabhol Power said it is too early to comment on the step the 
company would take and that any comments will be made after studying the High 
Court decision carefully. 
Dabhol Power hasn't come to any settlement yet on payment disputes with its 
sole buyer the MSEB. 
Dabhol Power supplies power to MSEB from its 740-megawatt plant in the 
western Indian state of Maharashtra. Since May 29, MSEB has stopped drawing 
electricity from Dabhol Power, saying the company's tariffs are 
"unaffordable".

INDIA: Enron's Dabhol suffers legal blow in India row.

06/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 26 (Reuters) - U.S.-based energy giant Enron Corp suffered a 
legal setback on Tuesday when an Indian court declined to intervene in a long 
and bitter wrangle between its subsidiary, Dabhol Power Company (DPC), and an 
Indian power utility. 
The Dabhol spokesman declined to comment on the Bombay high court's rejection 
of its petition, which had asked the court to help settle a dispute with the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).
The two sides are locked in an acrimonious row over a 2,184 MW power plant 
that DPC is building in two phases on the western coast of India. 
Dabhol has already approached the International Court of Arbitration in 
London claiming that the state utility had reneged on its contractual 
obligations by defaulting on payments. 
The state utility, for its part, has taken its case to the provincial 
regulator citing its own clauses in the contract that it claimed Dabhol had 
failed to honour. 
Acting on a plea from the state utility last month, the Maharashtra Electricy 
Regulatory Commission ruled that the dispute fell within its ambit and that 
Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration. 
Dabhol, in turn, argued that according to the power purchase agreement, 
disputes between the two signatories could only be settled by the 
International Court of Arbitration in London. 
COURT RULING 
In early June, Dabhol petitioned the Bombay high court, asking it to clarify 
the Commission's jurisdiction. 
On Tuesday, Dabhol's counsel requested the court to reverse the Commission's 
ruling that it could not take the dispute to the London court. 
But the high court replied that the Commission was an expert body which was 
empowered to decide on the issue. 
The court requested the regulator to hear both sides of the argument again 
within the next six weeks. 
But it stayed the ruling for two weeks to give Dabhol time to appeal to 
India's highest court. 
The dispute has brought Enron bad publicity and hurt India's image among 
foreign investors, since the $3 billion that has been committed to the 
high-profile project is now in danger of going down the drain.

Indian State Ministers Defer Decision on Utility Dues to July 6
2001-06-26 11:24 (New York)


     New Delhi, June 26 (Bloomberg) -- Indian provincial ministers
deferred a decision on the steps they should take to repay about
$8.5 billion of dues owed by state power companies to generators,
to July 6, as ministers disagreed on the terms of the payback.
     The ministers today met to discuss a report submitted by a
government panel in May on how to repay the debt. The report
suggests state governments take on the liability by issuing tax-
free bonds at 8.5 percent. Not all the ministers agree with the
conditions mentioned in the report.
     State electricity companies supplying power to ``rural areas
is a social obligation, it's not only the state government's
obligation and all these issues have to be seen in the macro
view,'' Digvijay Singh, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh said.
``We have asked for some more time to come to a consensus.''
     Most of the state electricity boards in the country are loss-
making as they sell electricity to farmers at highly subsidized
rates. The accumulated losses of these boards, is about 400
billion rupees ($8.5 billion), and the inability of these boards
to repay their dues may hinder further foreign investment in the
sector.
     ``It has become necessary to take a hard look at the power
sector to make sure whoever generates power gets paid for it,''
Krishna Chandra Pant, deputy chairman of India's planning
commission told reporters. ``This is coming in the way of foreign
direct investment in the sector.''

                               Enron

     Enron Corp.'s Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., stopped
generating power in May after the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board refused to pay 3 billion rupees in dues to Dabhol. Enron is
the country's biggest foreign investor and has spent $3 billion on
building its power plant.
     The board has refused to pay, saying Dabhol's price is more
than double the rate charged by other Indian generators, and has
stopped buying power from Dabhol. It also charged Dabhol an 8
billion-rupee penalty for not supplying power at full capacity on
three days between January and March.
     The dispute is also a concern for rating agencies such as
Moody's Investors Service.
     Kristin Lindow, vice president and lead analyst at Moody's
said she was concerned about the dispute, which is widely seen as
a litmus test for foreign investment in India.
     ``Foreign investors are becoming wary because of Enron's
problem and the government's failure to honor its contractual
obligation,'' Lindow said. ``It has put up several red flags.''
