Hello,

Well, it's Monday and some of you might be feeling a little down, because
your weekend ended and you are being forced into these large buildings with
fluorescent bulbs.  Some of you might be lucky enough to have windows to
see the bright sunshine taunting you from outside.

Well, find solace in the fact that tonight, April 30th, we're kicking off
CATERED DINNERS with a Mexican Fiesta.  During the break, stop by the Wells
Fargo room for dinner and some socializing (or counseling) with your fellow
classmates.

Yes, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
