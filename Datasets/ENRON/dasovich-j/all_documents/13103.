The fastest way for the Feds to fix the national super highway system to
dirt path transition at the California border (in terms of physical capacity
and regulatory schemes) is to FERC the PG&E and SoCal backbone systems.  Let
the CPUC reg gas from the SF and LA city gate.  FERC would get the high
pressure lines from the border, which is the way it is in almost every other
state in the lower 48. Integrate California in the national gas markets.

Repeal the Henshaw amendment, or encourage PG&E/Sempra to file. I think
sending pixs of Lynch and Hebert would be more than enough encouragement.
At least one of them is thinking of such a filing.

It would set off WW III in the California /DC dialogue and PC/ utility
discussions.

Ps.  In terms of bypass, it would result in a pretty level playing field to
the city gate in terms of rate designs and operational rules.
