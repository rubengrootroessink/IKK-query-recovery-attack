Subject: Moral Questions 

I have a moral question for you.? This is an imaginary situation, but I 
think it is fun to decide what one would do. 

The situation:? You are in the Midwest, and there is a huge flood in
progress.? Many homes have been lost, water supplies 
compromised and infrastructures destroyed. 

Let's say that you're a photographer out getting still photos for a news 
service, traveling alone, looking for particularly 
poignant scenes.? You come across George W. Bush, who has been swept
away by the floodwaters.? He is barely hanging on 
to a tree limb and is about to go under.? You can either put down your 
camera and save him, or take a Pulitzer Prize-winning
photograph of him as he loses his grip on the limb. 

So, here's the question, and think carefully before you answer the 
question below: 

















Which lens would you use ?
