Subject: DRAFT Principles for Use with Possible Coalition

We discussed on Friday the need to draft some basic, core principles that 
could unite a large, broad base of consumer (and other) support in the 
on-going effort (to quote today's WSJ editorial)  to inject some "brains" 
into California's "no brains" proposals.  

Here is a first whack.  It draws from the one-pager drafted last week for use 
in Sacramento to describe our "constructive proposal."  Many thanks to Paul 
for his help.  The document is in "strike-out-underline" mode.  Please edit 
directly (and freely) and send back to me and Ken.

Best,
Jeff
