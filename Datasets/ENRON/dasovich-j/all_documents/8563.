Kurt Pfotenhauer, Chief of Staff for Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR)  called to 
ask if someone from Enron would place a courtesy call to Sam Lauter, with the 
San Francisco Public Relations firm of Barnes, Mosher, Whitehust, Lauter & 
Partners at 415-241-9913.  They would like to discuss the possibility of 
being hired to work for Enron on the California electricity situation.  I 
told Kurt that I thought our California team had already hired a firm but he 
asked if someone from our California team would give Sam a call regardless as 
a courtesy.  I said I would ask.  Senator Smith and Kurt have been great 
friends to Enron so it would be nice if someone would extend this courtesy to 
Sam.  Thanks.
