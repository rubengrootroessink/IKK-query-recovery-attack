Listed below is a brief description of SB 1540 (Sher) relating to dams.
We should keep an eye on this throughout the session.


The bill would enact the California Dam Decommission, River Restoration,
and Public Safety Act of 2000, which would require the Secretary of
Resources, on or before January 1, 2002, to prepare and submit to the
Governor and the Legislature a report evaluating the suitability or
nonsuitability for decommission, demolition, removal, or modification of
dams, diversions, and other impoundment facilities for the purpose of
restoring spawning habitat for salmon and steelhead fisheries within the
system and within other rivers and streams in California.
