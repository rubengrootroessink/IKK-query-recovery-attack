CalPX Requests Exclusive Right To ISO Forward Pwr Trades

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Power Exchange requested Monday that 
if the state Independent System Operator is given the ability to purchase 
forward power, it make its trades only through the CalPX. 
The ISO filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last month for 
approval to buy forward power because it said utilities underscheduled 
supply, forcing the ISO to buy expensive emergency power last summer. 
"We are generally supportive of (the ISO's) procuring power in the forward 
markets, but we want to make sure the ISO does that procurement through us 
because it should be done in the market with the most liquidity," said CalPX 
spokesman Jesus Arredondo. 
In its filing with the FERC, CalPX said that experimentation with "fledgling" 
forward markets would place customers at risk for higher transactional costs 
and might discourage the development of forward markets in California. 
The ISO controls most of the state's power grid and real-time market, and the 
CalPX is the spot market where electricity is bought and sold in the state.
