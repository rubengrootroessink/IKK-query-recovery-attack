Subject: California credit issues

Rick/Jeff - I just spoke with John Sherriff and mentioned to him how on top 
of California you guys were.  As you may be aware, we are making markets in 
the credit of many utilities and telcomm companies, via EnronCredit.com.  
Brian Seyfried is the commercial leader for this business.  John has asked me 
to ask you, if you become aware of significant developments, in the public 
sector (not privileged/insider information), bearing on 
creditworthiness/ability to pay by California utilities, would you please 
keep us informed, as we will have a keen interest in these developments?  
Please forward to this to any others on your team(s) you think appropriate.   
thanks   mcs
