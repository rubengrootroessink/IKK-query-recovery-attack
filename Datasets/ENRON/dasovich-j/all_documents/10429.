Mike, etal --

I wanted  to get your perspectives on the idea that the CPUC will raise rates 
tomorrow?  Is this legal, without any notice?  

Did the CPUC give notice on its prior Emergency Surcharge action?  

What else should happen tomorrow at CPUC meeting?  Most importantly, what is 
happening with DWR need for more clarity?  I would really appreciate a copy 
of the March 7 CPUC Decision on DWR issues.

Please respond or call at 713-853-7673.

Thanks,

Jim
