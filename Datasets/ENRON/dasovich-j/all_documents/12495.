Budget plan shrinks: Davis responds to an uncertain economy but preserves a=
=20
boost in education funding.=20
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 15, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis laid out his plan for coping with diminished revenues and=
=20
growing fiscal uncertainty Monday, slashing the state budget he proposed in=
=20
January while preserving much of the spending for education and public=20
safety.=20
"Every proposal I made was warranted, needed and, in some cases, long=20
overdue," Davis said. "But a budget by definition is the act of making=20
choices."=20
Davis' new proposal launches what is likely to be an intense month-and-a-ha=
lf=20
struggle over the $103 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July =
1.=20
State revenue, which over the years has grown far more sensitive to economi=
c=20
cycles, plunged with the stock market, leaving a $4.2 billion hole in the=
=20
January budget proposal.=20
For the first time in years, the governor and the Legislature must deal wit=
h=20
shrinking expectations, and it's happening during a period of intense=20
partisan bickering over the state energy crisis.=20
The revised budget proposal counts on the sale of bonds in August to repay=
=20
the state treasury for electricity purchases, which now total more than $7=
=20
billion. Davis admitted in announcing his new plan that the assumption is=
=20
risky and once again criticized Republicans for holding up a bill that woul=
d=20
have allowed an earlier bond sale.=20
"If anything else goes wrong, like a natural disaster or some precipitous=
=20
drop in the economy, then we could be in real trouble," he said.=20
Davis' plan depends on delaying for two years a commitment to shift sales t=
ax=20
on gasoline from the state's general fund to a special fund dedicated to=20
transportation projects. The move, which would save $1.1 billion, is likely=
=20
to be opposed by Republicans, who fought for the shift.=20
Davis said his proposal would not delay transportation projects in the=20
pipeline because more money is available than is needed right now, but migh=
t=20
affect those that haven't been approved.=20
The revised budget proposal makes numerous cuts, with some one-time=20
expenditures eliminated altogether.=20
A $250 million payment to local governments to use as they see fit is gone.=
=20
So, too, is $200 million that would have rewarded cities and counties that=
=20
increased the number of housing permits they issued.=20
A $40 million pilot project for touch-screen voting got the ax, as did a=20
three-day "holiday" from sales taxes this summer, designed to give parents =
a=20
break in paying for school supplies.=20
A program to clean up California's beaches was slashed from $100 million to=
=20
$10 million. Another that would encourage the development of parkways along=
=20
rivers was cut in half, from $70 million to $35 million.=20
"Generally, if it was a new program that was not law the year before, it go=
t=20
pared back significantly and sometimes entirely," Davis said.=20
The revised proposal also calls for a 2.5 percent across-the-board cut for=
=20
state departments, except for those involved in public safety or making mon=
ey=20
for the state. That move is expected to save $50 million.=20
The governor said his revised budget preserves much of the school spending =
he=20
proposed in January.=20
"Notwithstanding the reduction in revenues, I'm not about to let our=20
commitment to education backslide," he said.=20
Still, Davis made some adjustments to his education plan. In January, he=20
proposed expanding the middle school year from 180 days to 210 days. That=
=20
proposal has been pared back to 200 days.=20
Davis also had hoped to increase rewards to schools that do well from $63 p=
er=20
student to $150, but that increase has been jettisoned.=20
On the plus side, the new proposal adds $220 million to help schools=20
performing poorly on standardized testing, and $541 million to help offset=
=20
school districts' increased spending on energy and to promote conservation.=
=20
School districts taking part in that program must commit to cutting their=
=20
energy use 10 percent.=20
Overall, the amount spent on each student would drop $6 from the $7,174=20
proposed in January.=20
Davis, however, touted a 43 percent increase in education spending since he=
=20
became governor. He invited several education leaders to the news conferenc=
e=20
announcing the revised budget, and his office released a collection of quot=
es=20
from the educators praising him for maintaining school funding.=20
Even Republicans found something to like in the Democratic governor's=20
education proposals.=20
"Certainly, if he kept education whole, we agree with that," said Assemblym=
an=20
Dave Cox, R-Sacramento, the Assembly minority leader.=20
But that was about the extent of bipartisan harmony.=20
"We simply don't think the governor is moving in a prudent direction," Cox=
=20
said.=20
He blasted the proposed budget for reducing the reserve from $1.9 billion t=
o=20
$1 billion. Republicans have advocated maintaining the reserve and adding a=
=20
special energy reserve to avoid the need for borrowing or raising electrici=
ty=20
rates again next year.=20
Davis said the $1 billion is enough. "Reserves are for rainy days," he said=
.=20
"It's starting to rain."=20
Republicans oppose Davis' plan to allow a quarter-cent sales tax increase=
=20
that was eliminated this year to go into effect again next January.=20
Cox said Republicans also would oppose the delay in shifting gasoline sales=
=20
tax to a special fund to relieve traffic congestion. He said Republicans=20
fought for the change, believing that a gasoline tax should be dedicated to=
=20
transportation projects.=20
Republican opposition to that provision, key to Davis' plan to balance the=
=20
budget, could spell trouble for the budget bill. The bill requires a=20
two-thirds vote and must garner the support of at least a handful of=20
Republicans.=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the delay in=20
shifting gasoline sales tax money means that "program cuts don't go as deep=
=20
as they might have."=20
The revised budget preserves spending for home health care workers and=20
part-time community college workers, Burton said.=20
"But we're going to have to find more money for child care," he said.=20
In addition, Burton said, he hoped that the Legislature could find a way to=
=20
give raises to state workers.=20
He said that barring an economic rebound, next year's budget will be far=20
tougher because the state will no longer enjoy a big cushion.=20

PG&E goes to court for rate relief=20
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 15, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. warned in bankruptcy court=20
Monday that it could be forced out of business by a March regulatory ruling=
=20
that prolonged a freeze on retail electricity rates.=20
But U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali said PG&E might still be in=
=20
financial trouble, even without the accounting change by the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission in March. Montali expressed reservations about the=20
utility's request for an injunction to block the change.=20
The accounting question -- and the timing of the expiration of the rate=20
freeze -- centers on whether PG&E has made up its transition costs in movin=
g=20
from a regulated to an unregulated market.=20
Montali said he'll rule as soon as possible, given the importance and=20
complexity of the issue.=20
PG&E projects a loss of $12.9 billion by next March because of an imbalance=
=20
between low retail electricity rates and high wholesale rates since June.=
=20
Without relief, said PG&E lawyer Jerome Falk, the utility could be forced t=
o=20

In April, the utility filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the=20
Bankruptcy Code, which requires judicial authorization for most actions tha=
t=20

t=20
requirement by forcing it to operate under the rate freeze.=20
But the PUC contends that PG&E's real motive is to free itself from state=
=20
regulatory control.=20
"We're talking about disabling the commission" by ending its authority over=
=20
rates, PUC lawyer Walter Rieman told Montali.=20
The commission didn't need court authorization because its action --=20
technically just an accounting change -- preceded PG&E's bankruptcy filing,=
=20
Rieman argued.=20
Rieman said such a regulatory action needs no authorization and that the 11=
th=20
Amendment -- the sovereign immunity clause of the U.S. Constitution -- bars=

Dan Walters: Davis wants to preserve rosy budget, let red ink rain on=20
Legislature


(Published May 15, 2001)=20
Once upon a time, the grammatically incorrect "May revise" was a low-level=
=20
exercise in fine-tuning income and outgo numbers prior to passage of a stat=
e=20
budget.=20
Beginning in the late 1990s, however, the spring ritual became elevated in=
=20
importance because an exploding economy was generating billions of=20
unanticipated tax dollars, thus allowing the governor and legislators to=20
create lavish new spending programs.=20
A year ago, Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislators were looking at a $14=
=20
billion budget surplus, fueling another round of tax cuts and spending. But=
=20
the high-technology balloon has burst, the tech-oriented Nasdaq market has=
=20
tanked and Monday's budget revision, released by the Davis administration,=
=20
anticipates about a $4.2 billion reduction in revenues from what was=20
originally projected in January.=20
If it's a cold dose of reality on the revenue side of the ledger, however,=
=20
the expenditure column of the revised budget is swathed in politically=20
contrived fantasy -- and represents the beginning of a high-stakes chess ga=
me=20
pitting Davis against a Legislature dominated by fellow Democrats.=20
While the revised Davis budget for fiscal 2001-02 reduces overall general=
=20
fund spending from the January version -- with reductions principally in=20
transportation, housing and proposed tax cuts -- it boosts spending on K-12=
=20
schools and community colleges to nearly $5 billion over the minimum=20
guarantees of the California Constitution.=20
Davis said his goal was to "curb government spending but ... protect my two=
=20
highest priorities: public education and law enforcement." And to reinforce=
=20
that stance, the governor's office packed the budget news conference with=
=20
representatives of public schools, ranging from the superintendent of the L=
os=20
Angeles Unified School District to teachers union lobbyists. They played=20
their designated role in the mini-drama by publicly lauding the governor's=
=20
school money, even if privately many acknowledged that the additional schoo=
l=20
financing is far from certain.=20
The real story of this year's May budget revision is that Davis is trying t=
o=20
force the Legislature into making the spending cuts that economic reality -=
-=20
and the state energy crisis -- will probably require so that he can maintai=
n=20
his image as the champion of education going into his re-election campaign.=
=20
The new Davis budget is plainly unworkable. By maintaining education spendi=
ng=20
and cutting reserves to the bone, the spending plan makes no allowance for=
=20
further drops in revenues, even though harsh experience is that in an=20
economic slump, income tends to fall much further and faster than Departmen=
t=20
of Finance bean-counters project.=20
Furthermore, the budget assumes that the $7 billion -- and still rising -- =
in=20
general fund expenditures for electric power will be completely reimbursed=
=20
from a $13.4 billion state bond issue and that no additional money will be=
=20
needed during the high energy consumption summer months. But that, too, fli=
es=20
in the face of reasonable expectations. The governor's energy purchase plan=
s=20
are based on very optimistic conservation numbers and, most ominously, on a=

declining price of electricity while the futures market indicates that pric=
es=20
may, in fact, jump by 50 percent over the next few months.=20
It's entirely possible that the entire bond issue will have been consumed b=
y=20
the time the bonds are sold in August and that the state will still be layi=
ng=20
out billions of dollars each month for juice. State legislative leaders, ev=
en=20
the most liberal ones, want to create a multibillion-dollar budget reserve=
=20
for those huge uncertainties, but with Davis taking his damn-the-torpedoes=

approach, they would be the ones to cut spending, including for the schools=

Daniel Weintraub: Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation


(Published May 15, 2001)=20

Now that Gov. Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats, run over the=20
Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to=
=20
borrow $13 billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases, there'=
s=20
probably only one person who can stop him: Harvey Rosenfield.=20
Rosenfield is the Santa Monica-based consumer advocate who tried to halt=20
California's experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started.=
=20
His 1998 ballot measure failed, and that campaign is blamed in some circles=
=20
for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the=
=20
electricity shortage that's helped send prices heavenward.=20
But if Rosenfield's last ballot initiative got the state's energy=20
establishment in a snit, the one he's contemplating now would positively pu=
sh=20
them over the edge. He is seriously considering launching a signature drive=
=20
to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his=
=20
$13 billion energy bond measure.=20
That bond, to be repaid by ratepayers, is supposed to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for=20
consumers since January, when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern Californi=
a=20
Edison ran out of money. The bond measure also will be used to delay the pa=
in=20
of the extremely high prices expected this summer. Without it, consumers=20
would immediately face another staggering rate increase, probably well into=
=20
triple digits.=20
The alternative would be a state budget in shambles. All the tax money Davi=
s=20
has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for traditional=20
services such as education, roads and health care. A referendum that killed=
=20
the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be=
=20
filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts.=20
Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound, and his talk of a referendum=
=20
may be just that. Collecting 750,000 signatures in less than 90 days, which=
=20
is what's required to qualify the referendum, would be a massive undertakin=
g.=20
Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than 50-50 that he=
=20
will proceed. But this is a man who has qualified two measures for the ball=
ot=20
already, including one in 1988 that brought on regulation of the California=
=20
insurance industry. You have to take him seriously.=20
The question is why he would even consider it. Why would a man who fancies=
=20
himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers =
to=20
swallow a massive rate hike, or else bankrupt the state? Because Rosenfield=
's=20
goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power system that's no=
w=20
serving California -- and raking in enormous profits for its owners.=20
And if it were up to him, he'd be willing to risk economic catastrophe to=
=20
make it happen. His theory is that the power generators will simply keep=20
raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on th=
e=20
table. It is, he says, like giving crack to an addict. Take that money away=
,=20
and the generators will kick the habit, fast.=20
"If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed, and politically or as a=20
matter of economics you can't raise rates that high in the state, the only=
=20
thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say, 'I'm taking yo=
ur=20
plants.' At which point they will say, 'OK, all right, we're lowering our=
=20
prices,' or some face-saving thing will happen. The ultimate showdown betwe=
en=20
naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs." And he's convinced that=20
capitalism will blink.=20
"If the lights go off in California, and the economy goes down the tubes,=
=20
then 20 years of Republican ideology, of less government, free markets,=20
competition -- all of that goes down the tubes.=20
"All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been=20
economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy, people want action and=
=20
they'll do anything, whether its seizing private property, or whatever. The=
re=20
will be a revolution, and I don't think the political institutions in this=
=20
country are prepared to push things to that point."=20
The Legislature already has set a Nov. 15 deadline after which the state=20
budget is supposed to be off-limits to Davis' power-buying ways. But that's=
=20
not good enough for Rosenfield. By then, he thinks, Davis will have burned=
=20
through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total tab wil=
l=20
be approaching $20 billion. Rates will have to rise again to pay that bill.=
=20
Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation -- without anesthesia -- t=
o=20
stop a painful and dangerous infection. But he is not the only one thinking=
=20
about the doomsday scenario.=20
The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut=20
deals with the state. They have offered to take caps on their profits,=20
forgive some of the debt that's owed them, anything to keep the system=20
running without further provoking the public's ire. They know that=20
Rosenfield's kind of anger can be contagious. They want to contain it befor=
e=20
it spreads.=20

Judge Asked to Block Freeze on Power Rate=20


By MAURA DOLAN, Times Legal Affairs Writer=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Lawyers for Pacific Gas & Electric clashed with attorne=
ys=20
for the state in federal bankruptcy court here Monday over whether the cour=
t=20
should block a state regulatory order that prolongs an electricity rate=20
freeze.
?????After three hours of arguments, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali=
=20
said he will prepare a written decision. "It will be issued when I am ready=
=20
to issue it," Montali told a packed courtroom.
?????The legal battle represents PG&E's first attempt to use its bankruptcy=
=20
petition to protect itself from state regulators--the California Public=20
Utilities Commission.=20
?????PG&E has asked Montali to block a key accounting order the commissione=
rs=20
approved March 27, several days before the Northern California utility file=
d=20
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
?????The utility contends that the order illegally extended a freeze on=20
electricity rates. Lawyers for the state counter that the PUC has sovereign=
=20
immunity under the 11th Amendment, and the judge has no power to intrude on=
=20
its regulatory decision making.=20
?????Montali asked a PG&E lawyer how he could get around the protection=20
argument.
?????"Because we have commissioners who are shielded by sovereign immunity,=
=20
don't I have to find a potential ongoing violation of federal law [to=20
intervene]?" the judge asked.
?????Jerome Falk, the lawyer for PG&E, said the regulatory commission was=
=20
breaking federal law by blocking the utility's ability to use the Bankruptc=
y=20
Act's protections to reorganize.
?????Under PG&E's calculation, the rate freeze imposed by deregulation shou=
ld=20
have ended in mid-2000. The utility stands to lose $4 billion because of th=
e=20
continuation of the freeze, Falk told Montali.
?????"Don't let it get $4 billion worse," he pleaded.
?????Walter Rieman, representing the state, countered that the commissioner=
s=20
were acting in their regulatory capacity when they approved the accounting=
=20
change.
?????"Here we have rate-making and regulation in its classic and purest=20
form," Rieman told the judge.=20
?????Because of the rate freeze, the utility must buy power at a cost highe=
r=20
than the rates it charges, Falk said.
?????"Money is going out. . .," Falk said. "Assets of the estate are=20
threatened with diminution, major diminution, as a result of this order."
?????Montali asked him what would happen if he blocked the regulatory order=
.=20
Would the rate freeze immediately end?
?????Falk replied that PG&E would return to the PUC and make its case for a=
n=20
end to the freeze. "I am not asking you to set rates."=20
?????Lawyers for the state pointed out that PG&E happily accepted the rate=
=20
freeze when it allowed the utility to sell power at higher than market rate=
s.=20
In their view, PG&E wants a ruling against the rate order to give the utili=
ty=20
more leverage against the state in the future.
?????Montali questioned Rieman about what authority, if any, the Bankruptcy=
=20
Court has over the utilities commission.
?????"You want me to say that everything the commission has done or will do=
=20
is insulated," Montali said. "I don't know how I can do that, and maybe I=

?????The judge asked Rieman whether the PUC could eventually approve=20

retroactive hikes would be "appropriate."

Edison Deal Sets High Legislative Hurdle for Davis=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis faces the toughest legislative challenge o=
f=20
his tenure as he tries to win votes for a deal he says is needed to keep=20
Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy--even as lawmakers work on=20
alternative plans.
?????Davis has tapped Sen. Richard Polanco to carry the bill, and the Los=
=20
Angeles Democrat is expected to introduce legislation implementing key part=
s=20
of the Edison deal this week. But even before hearings begin, key lawmakers=
=20
say the Davis plan has little chance of success, at least not in its curren=
t=20
form.
?????Some Democrats in the Assembly are considering the possibility that th=
e=20
effort to rescue Edison could falter, that the company could end up in=20
bankruptcy, and that the state might buy the utility, according to a summar=
y=20
of various plans prepared by Assembly Democrats.
?????The document, prepared for Assembly leaders, shows that at least some=
=20
members of the lower house are thinking about making a run at buying Edison=
's=20
Northern California counterpart, Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed for=20
bankruptcy last month.
?????"The state would assume existing secured debt . . . and would pay the=
=20
unsecured debt using a combination of the cash that has been hoarded by the=
=20
utility . . . and new cash from revenue bonds issued by the California Powe=
r=20
Authority," the document obtained by The Times says.
?????With Edison's stock price depressed, the cost to the state would be=20
perhaps $1 billion to $2 billion. PG&E's cost might be less, the document=
=20
suggests. The state would have to spend additional sums to pay off the=20
utilities' creditors.
?????"I don't know if we have even contemplated that thought," Davis=20
spokesman Steve Maviglio said of a potential bankruptcy. "We're still=20
optimistic that the Legislature will agree to the [deal] or a framework tha=
t=20
encompasses most of it."
?????Lawmakers, meanwhile, shut down their special session on energy Monday=
,=20
a necessary step so the state could sell as much as $13.4 billion in bonds =
by=20
August to pay for power purchases. Davis quickly reconvened a second specia=
l=20
session to deal with many other energy bills.

?????Measure Would Use Part of Utility Bills
?????"This is not going to be solved by the state buying the utilities," sa=
id=20
Bob Foster, the Edison executive who oversees lobbying operation. "It is ti=
me=20
to get real here. The state has a crisis on its hands. It needs to start=20
digging out."
?????The 98-page bill would authorize the state to pay $2.76 billion to buy=
=20
Edison's high voltage transmission lines, and permit the state to sell bond=
s=20
to finance the purchase. Edison would use the money to restructure and pay=
=20
down its debt, pegged at $3.5 billion.
?????Additionally, the bill would earmark part of ratepayers' monthly utili=
ty=20
bills to be used by Edison to pay off debt it incurred in 2000 and early th=
is=20
year as state regulators barred the company from charging consumers for the=
=20
full cost of record wholesale electricity prices.
?????"The state of California needs to get out of the business of buying=20
electricity," Polanco said, adding that the measure assumes Edison would ta=
ke=20
over the chore of buying power at the end of 2002 once it gains financial=
=20
stability. "My reasons for stepping up to the plate is to deal with it and=
=20
get it behind us."
?????Passage of the bill requires simple majorities in the 40-seat Senate a=
nd=20
80-seat Assembly. But Davis is having a hard time persuading fellow Democra=
ts=20
to embrace the proposal, and Republicans shudder at the prospect of the sta=
te=20
getting more deeply involved in the power business by taking over Edison's=
=20
transmission system. Some think Edison should follow PG&E into Bankruptcy=
=20
Court.

?????Some Officials Prefer Bankruptcy Option
?????"Why should we spend $3.5 billion for something the Bankruptcy Court=
=20
does for free?" Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) asked. "I don't hear=
=20
anybody voicing support for the bailout."
?????Added Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier): "I haven't been given any=20
argument why bankruptcy is bad."
?????Escutia said one of Davis' top aides jokingly threatened to lock Escut=
ia=20
in a padded room until she voted for the bill. "I told her the governor wou=
ld=20

?????Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, the Legislature's most influenti=
al=20
Democrat, said he would prefer that Edison not file for bankruptcy, but tha=
t=20
the bankruptcy of Edison's Northern California counterpart, PG&E, has had=
=20
little day-to-day impact.
?????"Bankruptcy is not something I'm afraid of," Burton said.
?????Burton's biggest criticism of the Davis-Edison accord is that it would=
=20
allow independent power sellers, most of which are out-of-state firms, to=

recoup all money owed them by Edison.
?????Burton said no deal will win passage unless the independent generators=

utilities, agree to take a discount on the money they are owed. He called o=

them to accept a 30% discount, an amount that Davis embraced last week afte=
r=20
meeting with Burton and other legislators.
?????Burton's idea is one of at least four alternatives to the Davis-Edison=

deal now in the works at the Capitol.
?????In the lower house, the plan with the most support is being pushed by=

Assemblymen John Dutra (D-Fremont) and Joe Nation (D-San Rafael). It would=

pushing Edison debt to $2.65 billion, from the current $3.5 billion.

written comments filed in the case.=20
The report by Jonathan Ogur, a Cornell-trained expert in market competition=

marks a departure from past findings of the federal commission that cleared=

El Paso of wrongdoing.=20
"It is likely that El Paso Corp. had and exercised market power during the=

EL PASO DENIES CHARGES
El Paso vigorously denies that it manipulated the gas market. It says gas=
=20
prices in the state have varied from two to 10 times more than elsewhere=20
because demand in California is high and existing pipelines and storage=20
basins are inadequate to meet it.=20
The federal commission in March rejected complaints by the California Publi=
c=20

on=20
its pipeline early last year so that its own gas marketing affiliate could=
=20

But the federal commission ordered further hearings before an administrativ=
e=20
law judge to determine whether El Paso then elbowed out other gas traders=
=20
that might have used the pipeline to ship cheaper gas into the state.=20
That's the accusation leveled at El Paso by the state and California's two=
=20
major utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Ediso=
n.=20
They say the company's conduct jacked up prices for natural gas and had a=
=20
ripple effect on the electricity market, because 60 percent of power plants=
=20
in California run on gas.=20
Those higher prices have contributed significantly to the state's energy=20
problems. Natural gas prices for consumers rose sharply last winter, and=20
among PG&E's billions of dollars of debt is at least $150 million it owes t=
o=20
El Paso for gas and electricity purchases.=20
PIPELINE ACCESS CONTROLLED
PG&E once controlled the space on the El Paso pipeline, but dropped it in=
=20
1997 because it didn't need it at the time. Gas prices from the pipeline=20
started climbing in 2000, when El Paso controlled the space and, critics sa=
y,=20
limited access to it by potential competitors.=20
A report commissioned by Edison estimated that California paid an extra $3.=
 8=20

=20
because of El Paso's domination of the pipeline space.=20
$864 MILLION PAID TO EL PASO=20
Some $864 million of that went to El Paso, said the Brattle Group, a=20

The report by Jonathan Ogur, a Cornell-trained expert in market competition=

"It is likely that El Paso Corp. had and exercised market power during the=

EL PASO DENIES CHARGES
El Paso vigorously denies that it manipulated the gas market. It says gas=
=20
prices in the state have varied from two to 10 times more than elsewhere=20
because demand in California is high and existing pipelines and storage=20
basins are inadequate to meet it.=20

But the federal commission ordered further hearings before an administrativ=

that might have used the pipeline to ship cheaper gas into the state.=20

Sacramento -- Blaming the tech-stock slide, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday=
=20
that there is a $3.5 billion hole in California's coming budget that he=20
proposes filling with relatively painless cuts that spare public schools.=
=20
By squirreling away billions from the past two years, when California had=
=20
huge budget surpluses, the Democratic governor avoided having to propose de=
ep=20
whacks to existing state programs.=20
Instead, he wants to pare back one-time spending proposals, eliminating $25=
0=20
million for cities and counties, and use unspent state money approved in pa=
st=20
budgets to cushion the blow.=20
"We knew this day would come. Happily, we had the discipline to prepare for=
=20
it," Davis said in presenting his spending plan.=20
The May revision, as yesterday's event is called, is when negotiations over=
=20
the state's spending plan heat up.=20
Lawmakers are supposed to approve their version of the budget by June 15 so=
=20
Davis can review it and have it in place for the start of the new fiscal=20
year, July 1.=20
Republicans, whose votes are needed for the document to be approved, said=
=20
Davis isn't being fiscally conservative enough. They say the plan drains=20
reserves without considering that the economic downturn could last more tha=
n=20
just a year.=20
"The budget's short overall. He needs to come up with more cuts," said Sen.=
=20
Dick Ackerman, R-Fullerton, vice chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.=
=20
"The reserve is not adequate. It's not a very realistic document because it=
=20
doesn't take into account the economic downturn or the size of our energy=
=20
costs."=20
The revision is simply a look at whether the projections the governor made =
in=20
his January budget still hold true. Instead of a total budget of $104.7=20
billion outlined earlier this year, Davis now envisions a spending package =
of=20
$102.9 billion.=20
For the first two years of Davis' administration those projections were=20
wildly conservative, yielding last year a staggering $12.3 billion in=20
unexpected revenue.=20
This year, a slack stock market and a cooling state economy had the opposit=
e=20
effect -- for the first time in nearly a decade the state will take in less=
=20
revenue than it did in a previous year.=20
"The declining Nasdaq, more than anything else, is responsible for the drop=
=20
in revenue we're seeing this year," Davis said.=20
Davis predicts that the state next year will take in $5.3 billion less=20
revenue than this year.=20
However, higher-than-anticipated tax payments in April mean the state will=
=20
end the current fiscal year on June 30 with an extra $1.4 billion.=20
The governor uses that surplus and hundreds of millions of dollars in=20
transfers to winnow the next budget's shortfall to $3.5 billion.=20
He assumes a proposed bond sale this summer will erase the state's more tha=
n=20
$6 billion in emergency electricity purchases.=20
Davis said his two spending priorities are public schools and public safety=
.=20
In the face of the shortage, Davis not only gave schools what he offered in=
=20
his January spending plan -- some $1.8 billion above the minimum schools ar=
e=20
guaranteed by law -- but added $676 million.=20
Of the $676 million, $541 million is one-time money to help defray higher=
=20
power bills brought on by the state's energy crisis. That works out to abou=
t=20
$90 per student for higher energy bills, more than the schools had requeste=
d.=20
Because enrollment is higher than expected in January, per-pupil spending=
=20
fell slightly from $1,176 to $1,168. School officials throughout the state=
=20
were pleased that their budgets weren't cut, as they work to raise test=20
scores through a variety of new programs.=20
Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist for school administrators, said that if school=20
districts suddenly had to deal with funding cuts, they would be hard presse=
d=20
to continue the progress in academic achievement seen recently.=20
Davis does not cut higher education, either, giving it a 2 percent increase=
=20
over this year, as opposed to the 4 percent increase he pitched in January.=
=20
He also preserves $160 million to begin construction of a new University of=
=20
California campus in Merced but, to save money, pays for it with bonds=20
instead of cash.=20
Among the one-time items eliminated was $40 million for a three-county pilo=
t=20
project to experiment with touch-screen voting.=20
Davis also cut $350 million from the the state's housing department,=20
including $200 million in grants to cities and counties that increase their=
=20
stock of homes and apartments.=20
The governor eliminated a $37.5 million proposal to clean up toxic-waste=20
sites in urban areas and pared down to $10 million from $100 million a=20
program to clean up beaches, mainly in Southern California.=20
Davis abandoned several tax cuts he proposed in January to save $50 million=
.=20
Among the casualties was a three-day sales tax holiday in August for back-t=
o-=20
school shoppers.=20
Davis also assumes that a quarter-cent sales tax cut caused by the state=20
being so flush with cash will end next January, allowing consumers to=20
contribute $1.2 billion in additional taxes to help fill the budget hole.=
=20
The key to Davis' budget proposal is spending $5 billion of the state's $6=
=20
billion reserve.=20
That means in the fiscal year beginning July 1, the state will spend some $=
5=20
billion more than it takes in, a potentially dangerous gamble if the econom=
y=20
doesn't rebound in 2002, when Davis stands for re-election.=20
"Reserves are for rainy days," Davis said of the spending. "It's starting t=

PUC puts off vote on rates=20
Posted at 10:43 p.m. PDT Monday, May 14, 2001=20
BY VBY MICHAEL BAZELEY=20

Mercury News=20


Abruptly postponing a decision until today, state regulators on Monday bega=
n=20
revising an electricity rate proposal, with indications that businesses wou=
ld=20
get more of a break and residential customers would take a greater hit.=20
Public Utilities Commission member Jeff Brown said he asked for the changes=
=20
late Friday after hearing testimony from business groups that a huge rate=
=20
increase would hurt the state's economy. Brown said he was particularly=20
concerned by the big increases proposed for electricity rates for peak-peri=
od=20
usage.=20
``There are some people that cannot go off-peak,'' Brown said, ``and those=
=20
people will pass their costs on to consumers, or they might take their=20
business out of California. Either way, the impact on the economy will be=
=20
very high.''=20
Under the revised proposal, moderate residential users apparently will take=
 a=20
slightly bigger financial hit. At the same time, industrial users would be=
=20
less affected, and agricultural users would get a big break, with their=20
highest average increase dropping from 30 percent to 20 percent or less,=20
Brown said.=20
Brown's efforts to change the rate proposal apparently were being pushed by=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed Brown and has taken an active interest in ho=
w=20
the $5 billion rate increase is divvied up among users.=20
Davis presented his own rate proposal to the commission a couple of weeks=
=20
ago. It gave agricultural groups and industrial users a bigger break than=
=20
plans released by the PUC last week.=20
``Our staff has been working with Mr. Brown to make the rate increase refle=
ct=20
the governor's wishes,'' said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
Last week, the commission released two proposals for how to distribute the=
=20
increase -- one from Commission President Loretta Lynch and one from=20
Administrative Law Judge Christine Walwyn.=20
Both proposals created a tiered system for residential users, with the=20
biggest power hogs getting slapped with the highest rates. And both skewed=
=20
the rate increase against commercial and industrial users. According to one=
=20
PUC analysis, the average increase for industrial users was 50 percent, wit=
h=20
some businesses facing on-peak rate increase of 250 percent.=20
Although business groups have enjoyed disproportionately lower rates in=20
recent years, they reacted strongly to the plans, insisting the higher=20
electric rates would drive some companies to ruin and hurt the state's=20
already foundering economy.=20
Attorneys representing agricultural, industrial and big and small business=
=20
groups dominated the final rate-setting hearing Friday. And groups such as=
=20
the California Manufacturers and Technology Association urged their members=
=20
to bombard the PUC with letters.=20
The limits of relief=20
Brown said he had originally tried to bring the average increase for=20
industrial users down from 50 percent to 45 percent, but that shifted too=
=20
much of the rate increase onto residential users.=20
``So we're looking at a very little more for residential users and taking i=
t=20
down a little for industrial,'' Brown said.=20
Lynch had not released details of the revised proposals Monday night.=20
But Brown released figures that he said were being seriously considered.=20
Customers who keep their usage within 130 percent of their baseline would=
=20
still be exempt from higher rates, as required by state law.=20
Among Pacific Gas & Electric customers, moderate residential users (between=
=20
130 and 200 percent of baseline) who originally faced a 28 percent rate=20
increase would now see a 33 percent increase, Brown said. Heavier users wou=
ld=20
see the rise in their rate jump from 39 percent to 55 percent. But the=20
heaviest residential users, originally slated for a 147 percent increase,=
=20
would now see a rate increase of only 75 percent.=20
Consumer groups were not happy.=20
``This is really hitting people who are moderate users who cannot fit withi=
n=20
their baseline,'' said Michael Florio, an attorney with The Utility Reform=
=20
Network. ``It's going easy on the really exorbitant users, who you would=20
think are pretty well-off.''=20
Lynch said immediately after the meeting that she wanted to spread more of=
=20
the rate increase to other residential users ``to ensure conservation=20
incentives are at every tier.'' And indeed, some energy experts had urged t=
he=20
commission to be more aggressive with the residential rates as a way to spu=
r=20
conservation.=20
Skeptics abide=20
But one consumer advocate scoffed at the notion, arguing that higher rates=
=20
will not lead to significantly higher conservation by homeowners.=20
``It seems like big industry and the environmentalists have gotten together=
=20
to try to get people to conserve through higher rates,'' said Harry Snyder,=
=20
senior advocate at Consumers Union in San Francisco. ``But the way to=20
conserve is not through forcing it.''=20
Snyder accused the commission of doing the ``hokey-pokey, changing everythi=
ng=20
by the reaction they get.''=20
Anti-rate-increase activists dominated much of Monday's meeting, showing up=
=20
dressed as ``Ratebusters'' and frequently interrupting the meeting with=20
chants (``I ain't payin' no hikes!'').=20
All they apparently got in return were a few chuckles from the commissioner=
s=20
and stern glares from the many California Highway Patrol officers stationed=

around the room.=20
The commission is scheduled to vote on the new rate plan today at 2 p.m.=20
