All:
The word from the Assembly is that there will be amendments to SB 78, which
will be the vehicle addressing the Edison bailout, on Thursday, a hearing on
Friday and Floor Session to follow to ratify whatever comes out of
committee.  This word comes out of the Assembly energy committee (Joe Lyons)
and although Rick Simpson was with the Speaker all afternoon and didn't get
back to me, numerous other Members' offices confirmed that they have been
told to be in town and available Friday.

There is another working group, but I do not know who is on it, nor were we
invited.  I will continue to advocate for the language we were able to get
into 82, as should your individual lobbyists.

More later ...
