STRONG ARM ROBBERY
Central Campus

"On Sunday, September 17, 2000 at about 9:00 p.m., a strong arm robbery
occurred on the Esplanade between Sather Tower and Doe Library on the
Berkeley campus.

The victim was an 18 year old male UCB student.  he was walking from the
Unit III Residence Halls to Doe Library when he was approached by 5-6
individuals.  Suspect #1 asked, 'Where is Building 1B?'  The victim replied
that he did not know.  As the victim backed away, Suspect #1 hit him on the
right side of his face and knocked him to the ground.  The victim felt his
backpack being pulled away and grabbed for it, but was knocked down
again.  The victim saw the other suspects approaching, so he released his
backpack and ran into Doe Library to report the crime.  A witness saw the
crime occur and said the suspects fled in a southeast direction towards
Stephens Hall.  The victim received scrapes and bruises, but was not
seriously hurt.  His backpack and contents were taken.

The robbers were all described as African-American men:
#1 was 17-29 years old, about 5'-9" tall, about 140 pounds, thin build,
black hair in cornrowed cut, goatee, wearing a black t-shirt with white
lettering and black pants.
#2 and #3 were 17-29 years old, medium height and weight, black hair,
wearing white 5-shirts.
#4 and #5 were 17-29 years old, medium height and medium build, black hair,
wearing dark t-shirts.

Anyone with information about this case should immediately call the
University of California Police Department Detective Kenneth Moody (510)
642-3184.

As with any emergency situation, if you see suspicious activity, call
9-911, from a campus phone."
