For information purposes I am attaching a spreadsheet showing what the 
potential value of this transaction may be given various terms and volumes.  
Given the scenario outlined in the recent draft decision from the CPUC 
regarding back payments, there may be an oportunity on behald of the QFs to 
negotiate a modified agreement with dispatch in return for relief on payables 
by the IOUs.

Mike

The structure is the same as we tried 4 years ago with no success.  ("ABE" - 
"anybody but Enron", being the primary reason we failed.)  The deal we were 
offering was the option to supply from the market in exchange for a 20% 
discount in the capacity payment.  At the time, we WERE going to shut down 
the QF and pay them more PV than they would have gotten by running, the 
"grease" coming from the relatively high O&M, which could be extinguished 
with the proposed structure.  

This structure sounds like a strict option, but should still work great.  The 
"grease" in this case is the arbitrage between market price and QF operating 
cost.

In the past, I have called John Fielder, VP Regulatory Affairs, when I want 
to talk about something strategic with SCE.  He was my fellow board member on 
the ISO board.  I could call him for you.

Guys,

Mike Etringer has a real good structure to present to SCE.  Basically, Enron 
would pay for the right to dispatch the QF so that their obligations to the 
utility could be met by either the plant or the market.  For that right, 
Enron would be able to pay for/absorb most of the past due receivables owed 
to the QF.  Several QF's have expressed interest, but the utility wont return 
calls.  We could not do this for the whole QF group, but we could do it for 
500MW+, which could save everyone $200MM+ in past due receivables.  

Who should we meet with to putch this idea?

Chris
