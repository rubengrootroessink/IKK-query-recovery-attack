If we have been given a reprieve.  The comments on the ACR are not due until
Friday the 15th. And then we have a week for reply (originally 5 days with
two being a weekend).

I will send out a draft today as planned.  Unfortunately, I will not be
available to finish the final product as I am leaving this p.m. to head back
east due to a family emergency.  Mike, however, should be able to pick up
the ball.
