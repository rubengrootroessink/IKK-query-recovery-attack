Jeff,

Stephanie Miller gave me your name as the person who might be able to help me 
track down the SoCal Gas WACOG calculation methodology.  I'm looking at the 
Core Procurement Service schedule, and it indicates that the WACOG 
calculation is set forth in "D.98-07-068".  I am assume that this is a 
decision number from the California PUC.  

I need to get a copy of the decision and/or whatever information is relevant 
to the calculation.  Let me know if you can help.

Thanks,

Phil Polsky
Associate, West Gas Origination
