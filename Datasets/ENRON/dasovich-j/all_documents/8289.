Dear Friend:

Time is running out!  There are only a few more shopping days left
to get RealMoney.com at our special holiday discount prices.  On
January 16, 2001, our special offer will expire.  After that you
will be unable to take advantage of a full year of RealMoney.com
for $100 off our regular price.

Each gift of RealMoney.com is still just $99.95.  But only if you act
now and click here:

http://offers.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/set.cgi?code=GGRE

You can give as many gifts as you like or even renew your own
subscription.  But hurry.  Time is running out.


Happy New Year.

Karen Smith Singer
Director - Customer Retention
