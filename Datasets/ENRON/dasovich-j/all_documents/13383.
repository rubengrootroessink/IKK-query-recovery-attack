EMI to let users 'burn' their own CDs

EMI Recorded Music, ranked third among the world's five largest
music labels, plans to let customers buy music tracks through the
Internet and use their PCs to make custom CDs. EMI said Tuesday
it has invested in software developer Roxio Inc., to provide the
technology necessary for recording while prohibiting unauthorized
redistribution. "Cooperation between technology companies and the
music industry is at the core of our plans to develop new revenue
streams for our artists," said Jay Samit, EMI's senior vice
president, in a statement.

WorldNet to offer users free trial video e-mail

WorldNet, the Internet service operated by AT&T, is offering a
free trial of video e-mail. The company said no additional
software is necessary to create and send the files, but users do
need a Pentium-class computer, a Web camera and a microphone.
"It's a great way to really 'see' your college kids while they're
away at school, send video greetings to parents and grandparents
and, if you're [Olympics champion] Marion Jones, display your
medals and trophies," said WorldNet Vice President Ed Chatlos.
Fremont, Calif.-based Talkway Communications, a multimedia
delivery content service provider, delivers the streaming
capability and hosts the video content on its servers. The trial
will run into July, during which time AT&T WorldNet Service will
offer subscribers up to 60 free minutes a month per account of
video e-mail. Pricing for the service after the trial's
expiration has not been disclosed.

Washingtonpost.com introduced a service that lets users custom
design their online version of the newspaper. Users can select
various modules of information -- national news, community
headlines, sports, entertainment and so forth. Specific
columnists and features can also be chosen. "Whether it's
delivering the news to e-mail inboxes, or being available [on a]
mobile phone, we are working to give users the information they
want, when and where they want it," said Washingtonpost.com CEO
Christopher M. Schroeder.

about potential recipients and delivers a report of applicable
programs and procedures. Nearly 1,000 state and federal programs
