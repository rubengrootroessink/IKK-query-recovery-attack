I think it should be during the game, not after the season is over.

By the way, you should really start using a service like PayPal for sending

Should football party be during the division championships like it was last 
year or the weekend after the Super Bowl (the Pro Bowl)?? If it's after then 
we could hand out all the checks including the playoff winners.? Please let 
me know what you think ASAP.
