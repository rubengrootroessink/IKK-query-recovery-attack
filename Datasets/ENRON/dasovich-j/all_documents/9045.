I thought about putting free jeans on the subject header to get your
attention but I am not at the point that I am willing to bribe you all
(yet).  As I finish up my last semester at Haas, I am determined to get
the 1st and 2nd year students involved--to help carry on some of the
programs that the EvMBA board has supported over the past few years. One
of the most valuable and fun experiences I have had over the past three
years at Haas has been being able to make a difference through my
involvement on the EvMBAA board.

You ask, what does the board do?  In addition to supporting and
organizing social events (Back to School Party, Wine Trip, Raiders game,
etc.), the board supports the Career Center Roundtable (thanks Albert)
and other activities such as this year's Elective Scoop Night (more
details to follow.)

Seven out of the ten board members have finished the program in December
or will finish the program this semester, so it is time for you to get
involved (or Albert Demery and Alessandro Ratti will have to carry the
entire load!) The following positions are currently open or will be in
the next few months. I urge you to get involved now so that we can have
some overlap between outgoing and incoming board members.

President (Dawn Taketa, May '01)
VP Communications (Thera Kaljmin, May '01)
VP Finance (Todd Wells, May '01)
Social Co-Chair (open)
Social Co-Chair (open)
Corporate Outreach (Christine Piesco, May '01)
Day Program Liaison (open)
Student Advisory Committee Chairperson (Mike Plumb, May '01)

Attached are the descriptions of each position and the responsibilities
for each. How much of a time commitment will you need to make?  At
minimum, it is about 6-8 hours per months (a little higher for the
President and SAC Chairperson positions)--but with all the great ideas
that I am sure all of you have, it can be as much time as you want to
put into it.

If you are interested in applying, please send me an email with a couple
of paragraphs stating which position you are interested in and why you
want to get involved/what you would like to accomplish in the position.

Thanks.
Dawn Taketa
EvMBAA President
