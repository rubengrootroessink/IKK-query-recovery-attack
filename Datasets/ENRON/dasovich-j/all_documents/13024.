PLEASE FORWARD TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF YOUR OUTAGE CO-ORDINATION

To Outage Coordinators :

Effective June 8 2001, in accordance with Executive Order D-23-01, the ISO
will be implementing the Interim SLIC Outage Web Page (
https://slic.caiso.com ).   This will be the primary means of reporting
planned outages to the ISO. After June 8, 2001, the current fax, telephone
and e-mail method of reporting will still be available for emergency use
only.

The updated SLIC users manual (with screen shots) is now available on our
website at the following URL
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2001/03/29/2001032906410829431.html>.


The XML Upload/ Download Specification will be available and posted to the
website  on 5/25/01. As stated above, the implementation date will occur 2
weeks later on June 8, 2001.

For your final testing and integration processes, outages may be reported to
the CAISO in parallel via the web page and your normal reporting method for
the next two weeks.

Any questions please contact Michael Martin at mmartin@caiso.com.
