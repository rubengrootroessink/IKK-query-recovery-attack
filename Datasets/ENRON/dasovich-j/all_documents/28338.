Enron notes to discuss tomorrow...

Background:
1.  Late March - we met with members of GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing
group) and the CIO from ETS (Enron Transportation Services)
2.  Mid May -  we showed a demo to a mix of EES (Enron Energy Services), GSS
(John Gillespie, John Will, Craig Brown), and ETS contacts
3.  EES and ETS were interested, mentioned DealBench as too costly for their
needs, we followed with a proposal to GSS for a Pilot, response was that we
need to get a divisions on board
4.  Late June (6/28) - met with 2 contacts from EES (Procurement Mgrs who
were in the May mtg, they suggested we show how our system can help their
upstream counterparts who structure the "deals" (since the Proc. Mgrs are
simply the downstream execution piece), they also mentioned that GSS is busy
with SAP/C1 ibuyit rollout right now

Questions:
1.  Who are the "deal makers", what is their function, what tools do they
use, how do we best position our solution with them?
2.  How are decisions made?  Should we target a solution to a particular
division e.g. EES?  Our contacts have said solutions are purchased both
through GSS as a "gatekeeper" and by a single divison on its own (as there
seems to be a number of maverick projects going on at the moment)
