Drake, Heather, Rasa and Jason:

I wanted to thank you for the time you took to meet with Mona Petrochko and 
me regarding our commercial and industrial customers.  Each of you were very 
helpful providing information in response to our questions.  We appreciate 
your patience through the revision of our annual report.

As discussed, we will send you the label calculation (with the revised annual 
reports) for the commercial and industrial product, the letter notification 
to customers, the product registration and the revised monthly performance 
reports by the end of the week.   Further, as requested, we will include a 
1998 bill that notifies customers that their rates were reflective of the 1.5 
cents p/kwh customer credit. 

Again, we greatly appreciate your kind assistance.

Best regards,
Stacey Bolton
