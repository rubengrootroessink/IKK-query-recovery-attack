Wow. That's fascinating. Sounds neat.  I would be very concerned, though, 
given the current environment about having us listed as a sponsor.  In short, 
I would recommend against sponsoring, at least at this point.

Best,
Jeff

Bill Jones has announced to run against Davis.  gary Ackerman is asking for 
sponsors to pay the costs of the dinner.  He will publicize the sponsors.  
The attendees include all WPTF members (munis, BPA, other power marketers), 
plus invitees -- CPUC staff, ISO staff and sometimes FERC staff come.  What 
do you think

		 Subject: Bill Jones will be keynote speaker for WPTF meeting in June

On the evening of Thursday, June 21, at Ojai Inn, Secretary of State
Bill Jones will be our keynote speaker at our WPTF General Meeting.  Rob
Lapsley, Bill's Undersecretary just called an told me the good news.
Jones is the front running candidate to challenge Gov Gray Davis in
2002.

Here is what I am thinking.  I would like to solicit among our esteemed
Board members sponsors for the dinner that evening.  I anticipate that
we would attract possibly 70+ guests and members, and the dinner bill
could be around $100/person with the open bar.  Which of you members
would like to be sponsors?  Will divide the cost equally among the
sponsors, and make sure to mention your names as sponsors for the
dinner.
