No Pardon for this Turkey
?
In 1999, Pennsylvania had the fourth dirtiest air in the nation. For years =
=20
Governor Ridge and Secretary Seif of the Department of Environmental=20
Protection  (DEP) have blamed power plants in Ohio for the Commonwealth=01,=
s=20
dirty air, which  damages our environment, our economy, and most importantl=
y=20
the public health of  Pennsylvanians. But now the Governor, DEP, and most=
=20
directly the Pennsylvania  Public Utility Commission (PUC) have the chance =
to=20
apply Pennsylvania law to a  major polluter of Pennsylvania=01,s environmen=
t =01*=20
FirstEnergy of Ohio.
?
Having for years spewed soot and smog-causing pollution across the =20
Ohio-Pennsylvania border, particularly victimizing Pittsburgh and western =
=20
Pennsylvania, FirstEnergy has come before the PUC in search of an official=
=20
stamp  of approval for its proposed merger with GPU. Our officials should=
=20
make it clear  this merger won=01,t just be rubber-stamped. They must hold =
this=20
out-of-state  polluter accountable by ensuring that the price of merger=20
approval is real  benefits for consumers, competition, and the environment.=
=20
?
Since the August, 2000 announcement of the proposed merger, we have hoped =
=20
that FirstEnergy would recognize the harm it has caused and have the grace=
=20
to  propose real concessions that would protect the public interest. Silly=
=20
us. Last  week=01,s merger Application filing by FirstEnergy proposes nothi=
ng=20
that would  benefit consumers or undo its damage to Pennsylvania=01,s=20
environment.=20
?
FirstEnergy apparently believes that it is still in Ohio where it is an =20
800-pound political gorilla which gets all the bananas. Perhaps with the he=
lp=20
of  GPU=01,s political influence, it thinks it has the same command here. =
=20
Pennsylvanians will soon see on whose side are our state officials.=20
?
The stakes are high and involve life and death.
?
According to a recent study, air pollution from power plants =01*  specific=
ally,=20
fine particles resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxides and  sulfur=20
dioxide =01* kills more than 30,000 Americans each year, nearly twice as  m=
any=20
as die from drunken driving accidents or homicides. This study ranks Ohio =
=20
second in the nation, with 1,920 annual deaths from health problems=20
attributed  to power plants. Only Pennsylvania, with 2,250 deaths, had more=
.=20
?
In total, FirstEnergy=01,s plants are among the nation=01,s worst air pollu=
ters. =20
In 1999, FirstEnergy power plants pumped into the air over 300,000 tons of =
=20
SO2 and 100,000 tons of NOx=20
(http://www.cleveland.com/news/index.ssf?/news/pd/w17power.html)  as well a=
s=20
40 million tons of CO2, a principal cause of  global warming. It alone is=
=20
responsible for approximately 27%, 21% and 23%,  respectively, of Ohio=20
utilities' SO2, CO2, and NOx emissions. FirstEnergy's sole fossil fuel plan=
t=20
in  Pennsylvania, Bruce Mansfield, contributes approximately 3%, 13% and 12=
%=20
of all  of Pennsylvania power plant SO2, CO2,  and NOx emissions.=20
?
Not surprisingly, given that record, in November 1999, the United States =
=20
Department of Justice and EPA brought suit against FirstEnergy subsidiaries=
=20
Ohio  Edison and Pennsylvania Power, charging that modifications at the=20
Sammis Plant  in Jefferson County, Ohio, violated the Clean Air Act.=20
According to the United  States, the defendants made improvements at each o=
f=20
the seven units at Sammis  without applying required pollution control=20
technology that would have sharply  reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides,=
=20
sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter.  Reducing these emissions would=20
significantly reduce public health threats and  environmental effects,=20
including acid rain and smog. There should be no merger  approval, unless=
=20
FirstEnergy agrees to clean up Sammis and settles this suit, as  Virginia=
=20
Electric Power recently resolved a similar case.
?
The Turkey is Served
The FirstEnergy-GPU merger  Application acknowledges that the PA PUC may=20
approve the merger =01&only if the  commission shall find or determine that=
 the=20
granting of such certificate is  necessary or proper for the service,=20
accommodation, convenience, or safety of  the public.=018 Yet, the proposal=
 does=20
not attempt to show that the merger would  provide any specific public=20
benefits. Rather, it attempts to put a spin on the  requirement, arguing th=
at=20
the merger won=01,t cause any harm because it won=01,t  change things very =
much.=20
?
The merger proposal itself places the companies between a rock and a hard =
=20
place in gaining PUC approval. The transaction represents the acquisition o=
f=20
the  GPU holding company by the FirstEnergy holding company. The individual=
=20
public  utilities that are holding-company subsidiaries =01* Met Ed, Penele=
c,=20
and PennPower  in Pennsylvania =01* will continue to operate as they have,=
=20
without corporate or  operational changes. But the Public Utility Code does=
=20
not allow PUC approval  based on the well-being of the holding companies=20
involved or their unregulated  businesses. Neither does the Code allow PUC=
=20
approval based on the absence of  significant harm to public service.=20
?
The proposal does, however, claim that the merger would provide substantial=
 =20
strategic company benefits and is expected to enhance FirstEnergy's  cash=
=20
flow and earnings per share. But for consumers, the best the companies can =
=20
muster is a vague claim that the larger company will be financially stronge=
r=20
and  more profitable and that the several regionally operated utilities wil=
l=20
be able  to share =01&best practices.=018=20
?
It may be obvious to FirstEnergy that a bigger, more profitable company is =
=20
good for the company and its shareholders, and therefore what=01,s good for=
 the =20
shareholders is good for public service. But these are not truths that we =
=20
hold self-evident. Before the PUC approves the merger, it must be given =20
affirmative reasons concerning the public benefit to do so.=20
?
Recently, the PUC approved the PECO-Unicom merger settlement, which  provid=
ed=20
a long list of additional public benefits. As modified from PECO=01,s  init=
ial=20
proposal, the PECO-Unicom merger puts substantial muscle and dollars  into=
=20
rate cuts, service improvements, cleaner air, affordable service for low =
=20
income customers, improving the competitiveness of the electricity market=
=20
and  many other identifiable, tangible public benefits (See E-cubed of Apri=
l=20
7, 2000,  Vol. 2, No. 7).
?
Slicing the Turkey=20
There are ways in which the merger  could provide public benefits. Let=01,s=
 look=20
at the key =01&benefits=018 outlined in the  merger proposal and briefly co=
nsider=20
whether they provide a basis for public  benefits and, if not, how they=20
could.=20
?
1.?FirstEnergy Becomes Big. The merger would create the  nation's sixth=20
largest investor-owned electric system based on number of  customers.
?
Bigger is not inherently better for consumers. In fact, it could make  thin=
gs=20
worse for consumers.
?
2.?Access to the Wholesale Electric Market. The companies point  out that=
=20
FirstEnergy would have the largest customer base in the PJM Power Pool  and=
=20
its customer base in the 13-state region that FirstEnergy has targeted for =
=20
growth would double.
?
How will that benefit consumers in Pennsylvania? There are ways, discussed =
=20
below, but FirstEnergy doesn=01,t seem to have identified them, let alone m=
ade=20
any  commitment.=20
?
3.?Transmission System Integration. The companies identify that  joining=20
their contiguous transmission and distribution systems provides the  basis=
=20
for wholesale market opportunities and that the companies =01&intend=018 to=
 keep =20
GPU in PJM.=20
?
GPU is currently part of PJM, the most effective ISO in the nation. =20
FirstEnergy is not a part of any functioning ISO. In fact, the Application =
=20
affirms that FirstEnergy continues to hold onto hopes that the Alliance RTO=
=20
will  become operational, although there is no basis at this time to expect=
=20
that it  will become a fully functioning ISO which would serve the market a=
nd=20
consumers  as required. The merged companies would not be able to integrate=
=20
their  transmission systems, serving the public interest and obtaining the=
=20
companies=01,  anticipated wholesale market benefits, unless FirstEnergy jo=
ins=20
PJM.=20
?
FirstEnergy has no viable near-term alternative to joining PJM. And the =20
recent announcement that APS will join and create PJM-West precludes any=20
attempt  to argue to the contrary.
?
Neither wholesale nor retail competition  can work without a fully=20
functioning ISO to ensure that the wholesale electric  market is workably=
=20
competitive, the power supply is reliable, and consumers are  protected fro=
m=20
anti-competitive market manipulation. If FirstEnergy were to join  PJM, it=
=20
would expand the size of the market in which electricity could be freely =
=20
traded, benefiting FirstEnergy, its customers, and all consumers within the=
=20
PJM  market from New Jersey to the Indiana state line.=20
?
The Application also states that the companies =01&intend=018 that GPU will=
  remain=20
in PJM, but includes no firm commitment. If GPU were pulled out of PJM,  th=
e=20
merger would be categorically contrary to the public interest, no matter =
=20
what other benefits might be provided.=20
?
In order for the merger to provide public benefits, it cannot be approved =
=20
without an iron-clad requirement that GPU will remain in PJM and that =20
FirstEnergy will join. ?=20
?
4.?Solve GPU=01,s POLR Disaster. The proposal vaguely suggests  that the me=
rger=20
may help contribute to meeting GPU's "provider-of-last-resort"  requirement=
s=20
for electricity customers in its Pennsylvania and New Jersey  service areas=
.
?
GPU made its POLR bed and should be made to lie in it. The rate cap is a =
=20
promise that cannot be broken, and is a consumer right that exists with or =
=20
without this merger =01* it is not a merger benefit.=20
?
Expanding customer opportunities to shop and demand-side response should be=
 =20
a major part of the plan to reduce company POLR exposure. FirstEnergy shoul=
d =20
commit to deploying real-time meters and appliance control technology which=
 =20
would empower customers to save money by changing their demand in response=
=20
to  market prices.
?
5.?Selling FirstEnergy Generation in the PJM Market. The  companies emphasi=
ze=20
the important wholesale market opportunity to sell 12,100 MW  of generation=
=20
capacity in the east.=20
?
FirstEnergy cannot improve on its present ability to sell into the PJM =20
market without first joining PJM.
?
Additionally, expanding the PJM  market can make it much more competitive a=
nd=20
provide public benefits, but there  must be strong and specific commitments=
=20
to improve competitive market  conditions, clean up FirstEnergy=01,s dirty =
power=20
plants, and substantially expand  the availability of cleaner, renewable=20
generation.=20
?
6.?Expand Unregulated Business Opportunities. The proposal  identifies=20
increased market and growth opportunities for FirstEnergy's natural  gas=20
resources, and both companies' mechanical contracting and construction, =20
telecommunications, and e-procurement resources.
?
That may well be a benefit of the merger to the companies and their =20
shareholders, but it has nothing to do with public service or merger=20
approval.  If anything, unregulated business growth and profits up the ante=
=20
for providing  more regulated business savings and other benefits to=20
consumers.=20
?
7.?Merger Savings. The proposal vaguely argues merger savings  but presents=
=20
only a crude estimate of $150 million that are expected to come  from the=
=20
elimination of duplicative activities, improved operating efficiencies,  mo=
re=20
efficient use of generation assets and the combination of the companies' =
=20
work forces. Only a portion of such savings would be from regulated service=
=20
in  Pennsylvania.=20
?
If the merger won=01,t provide real opportunities for cost savings, the =20
companies have a heavy burden to demonstrate why not and to provide other=
=20
ways  in which the merger will provide alternative public benefits. For=20
example,  FirstEnergy claims that its creation in 1997 upon the merger of=
=20
Ohio Edison and  Centerior already has delivered $700 million of the promis=
ed=20
$1 billion in  savings, with $350 million in annual recurring savings.
?
And cost savings should mean rate cuts =01* the most basic consumer benefit=
 =20
from a utility merger =01* but the proposal promises nothing. Therefore, th=
e=20
merger  must not be approved, unless a substantial portion of economic=20
benefits are  shared with consumers or provide other public benefits.=20
?
8.?Other key points. The proposal states that the companies  will maintain=
=20
separate utility operations and seek to minimize the effects of  work-force=
=20
reductions through hiring limits, attrition and separation programs  and=20
honoring all labor agreements.
?
Wow. What a commitment to their  workers and our communities! The only=20
specific commitment made is to retain GPU  charitable giving levels for thr=
ee=20
years. Even that represents a lack of  immediate harm, not a public benefit=
.=20
What would actually happen in Reading and  Johnstown?=20
?
We=01,re Still Hungry
The FirstEnergy-GPU merger as  proposed will not be in the public interest=
=20
and should not be approved. The PUC  must make consumer savings, service=20
improvements, more competitive choices,  cleaner energy and similar public=
=20
service gains the requirements for merger  approval. And the PUC must ensur=
e=20
improved demand-side response opportunities  and a more competitive wholesa=
le=20
and retail market by compelling First Energy to  join PJM.=20
?
That is the very least that should be expected, and the very least that =20
FirstEnergy owes the people and environment of Pennsylvania.=20
