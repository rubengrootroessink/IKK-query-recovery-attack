Subject: Meeting to Discuss California Plan

I'd like to have a face-to-face Western States meeting on Thursday afternoon 
(of this week).
Topics for discussion include:

1. The "California Plan" that Jeff and I must provide to Rick.  I'll 
circulate a draft later this week.  
2. Budget and Budget Reductions
3. Mid-year PRC
4. Work load

LYSA:  PLEASE CONTACT EVERYONE IN THE GROUP TO DETERMINE THEIR AVAILABILITY 
FOR A 2-HOUR MEETING ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN SFO TO BEGIN AT 3:30 AND END AT 
5:30. 

JOSEPH:  PLEASE CANCEL THE STAFF MEETING ON THURSDAY MORNING.  ALSO ... IS 
THERE A CONFERENCE ROOM AVAILABLE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT 3:30 OR SO?
