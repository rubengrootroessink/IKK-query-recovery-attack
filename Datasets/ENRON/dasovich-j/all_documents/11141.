Subject: Brifing for German parliament members

Through my environmental work, I was contacted by a German foundation that is 
hosting several members of the German parliament on a U.S. visit.  They will 
be visiting San Francisco on April 26 and 27, and are interested in learming 
more about the California energy situation.  

Would it be possible to conduct a meeting/briefing for this delegation at our 
San Francisco office?   These are not energy experts, but legislators who are 
interested in the U.S. policy process, so the briefing would not need to be 
anything complex, and probably no more than 1 hour long.  Please let me know 
if you would be available and willing to host this group.

They are sending brief biographies of the German delegation, and more 
specific time availability on the 26th/27th, and will pass it on to you when 
I get it.

Thanks,

Jeff
