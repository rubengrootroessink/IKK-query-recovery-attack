Jeff Dasovich,
Make sure you are subscribed to the e204-1 alias for course e-mail.
I received a notice after you message that you were not connected.
If you received the e-mail from me with the course syllabus earlier
this week, you probably are on the alias, but you can check with
Shawn Allison at the Evening MBA office <allison@haas.berkeley.edu>
if you think there is a problem.  Just in case, I am attaching the
files (2) with the course syllabus and assignments.
