Jeff -  Cynthia Sandherr said you were once again the person to write to. We 
talked in  the fall of 1999 when I was thinking about bringing the energy 
seminar to San  Franciso in 2000.
?
17 in  our group this year, really interested in gas and elec matters, 
especially in  CA. 14 students including a BGen from Croatia, and 3  faculty.
?
At this  point, I am trying to juggle between an open Monday afternoon 9 
April, and a  very early possible morning appt on Thursday a.m., 12 April. We 
have asked CPUC  to host us the afternoon of 11 April, but they may back out 
given the  circumstances, but for the moment that time is spoken for.
?
We did  manage Alaska last year after all, so now I am trying to resume the 
regular  alternation between California and Houston. I am several shades 
whiter of head  as a result of bringing the Alaska trip to closure.
?
Draft  schedule attached for your consideration of where we are in the 
planning  process.
?
Best  regards,
?
