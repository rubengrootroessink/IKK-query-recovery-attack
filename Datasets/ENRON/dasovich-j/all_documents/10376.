I suggest the following contents for the legislative briefing book we 
discussed during our 11:30 call yesterday.  My goal was to be comprehensive, 
even if it sacrifices brevity.  My goal was also to put something together 
that we could use for more than just California.  

Overview of how we ended up in this crisis--include EPSA paper on crisis, EEI 
paper on crisis, and 1-2 articles from CA papers on the crisis.
Load growth--California (show in terms of MWs, not percentages) and in WSCC.  
Point is to show how load growth in California has been extraordinary 
relative to historical growth, show how entire west is growing.
Generation additions--show how California and west did not keep pace with 
load growth.
Consumption per capita or other measurements. 
Rate comparisons--show how west has had experienced substantial rate 
increases.  Compare actual increase in California to other states.
MRW Study--show how $1 billion can be produced by 10% increase.  Show how 
increases experienced in--e.g., Nevada can produce revenues.  
Transmission takeover analysis--show $39 billion price tag, compare with 
school funding.
Solutions--include the Brulte or Herzberg piece.


I would add the following pieces as well (just not sure where):
