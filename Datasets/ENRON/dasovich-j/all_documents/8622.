The Canadian Assoc. of Members of Utility  Tribunals ( our NARUC) is planning 
their annual conference for this summer. They are looking for a good  
"independent" commentator on California power issues.    I know that your 
friend Molloy (?) has already accepted an invitation to speak at the 
conference but CAMPUT is  looking for someone  else as well.  Can you suggest 
a name or two?  Thanks, Aleck
