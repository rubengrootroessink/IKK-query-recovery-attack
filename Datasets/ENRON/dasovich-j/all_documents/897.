Sounds like a good idea to me.  Steve Walton and I have been involved in the 
NW negotiations.  I'd be happy to go to FERC to talk to Alice, Rob, and Mike.

Since the rates departments are going to review the October 15 RTO filings, 
and because we expect many of them to be deficient, I think we can take 
advantage of some opportunities to set up meetings with the three directors 
-- Alice Fernandez, Rob Cupina, and Mike Coleman -- to educate them and their 
staffs on the minimum RTO requirements we feel are necessary for a successful 
RTO.  We can also take this opportunity to let them know some of the 
weaknesses we expect to see in the filings, so that they can begin to think 
about these issues before the filings are made.  Also, by meeting with FERC 
staff prior to the filings, we can state our positions without ex parte 
communications on any specific filings.  To make the meetings successful, 
we'll need to get input and information from the regional people on the 
status of the RTO negotiations.  It might also make sense to have a regional 
person attend these meetings to provide first hand accounts of what's been 
happening in the RTO meetings.

Subject: EPSA Meeting

The EPSA meeting in Chicago was successful.  In addition to numerous 
stakeholders, the press was there in full force. It became clear that 
deregulation is not complete, and that the problem is not deregulation -- but 
continuing unnecessary regulation. 
    
Commissioner Massey's speech on why competition is necessary was actually 
quite good.  His message is approximately 90 percent consistent with Enron's 
on the wholesale level (He even called for Federal siting authority.).  He 
sees price caps as a stop gap only and votes for them as a last resort.  
However, he still contradicts himself when he questions the use of single 
price auctions because they do not work as intended; but, he comments that 
PJM is working.  I and others will work with him to make sure he 
understands.  

I spent time with Mike McLaughlin (Director of Corporate Applications) and 
Rob Cupina (Director of Rates, Central).  We spoke about the RTO filings due 
October 15.  I shared my concern that some of the RTO filings may be 
incomplete and asked what actions FERC may take if the filings are 
deficient.  Mike indicated that the RTO filings will be processed by the rate 
offices of the three regions (east, central and west) in Dan Larcamp's group 
(OMTR).  He believes that Order 2000 will become as "voluntary" as Order 436 
was.

If you would like to discuss or have particular questions, please do not 
hesitate to call -- 202.466.9150  JOE
