Jeff, 
I've spoken to Robin Hill's office, (EBS Legal) and this is what we need to 
get the NDA shipped:
1) Legal entity name 
2) Business Address
3) if possible, name and title of signatory party at IOS

Please get this information together and send to Robin Hill.  She should be 
able to return the NDA in 2 business days.
By the way, I spoke with Matt Harris, and we think this opportunity would be 
best handled by Kirk Neuner's group.  What is your take?
Thanks,

Dan Minter
