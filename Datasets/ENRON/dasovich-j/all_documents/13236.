I think that we should call her on Friday.  Can you do this Jeff?

Per the voice message I forwarded to you last Friday from Stacey....Heather 
Raitt from the CEC never called me, but if they're interested in Enron's 
position on the issues, maybe you and Jeff D would just want to contact her 
on your own and give her the company line.  

Just let me know if you do, so we can keep Stacey abreast of our actions. 
thanks
