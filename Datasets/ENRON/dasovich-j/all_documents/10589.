Laura:
Sorry to bother you again, but I'm concerned that Justin is wildly busy and 
may not have the time to forward the package on to the SVMG.  I'm hoping that 
you might have the distribution list and might be able to forward to that 
list, too.  No big deal, just trying do everything we can to try to mobilize 
the troops on customer choice.

Best,
Jeff
