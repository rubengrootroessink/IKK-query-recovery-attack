Jeff:

I did a final draft of the one-pager I sent you earlier. I am attaching it 
here as it communicates the idea better. Please send along to whomever you 
feel should recieve it and let me know when I can contact who & when. I will 
be traveling on Friday am for 1 week.
Thank you.
Joe Alcantara
