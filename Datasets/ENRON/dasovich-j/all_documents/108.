Dear Jeff:
Thank you very much for your feedback.  I will try to facilitate future
discussions and keep the class on track.  Some of the discussion we had
yesterday are not quite closly relate to the course material (such as
valuation of internet stocks), but I decided to spend some time talking
about that just to enhance students' understanding regarding application of
the model.
I don't think I received the e-mail from your girlfriend.  Please ask her
to send it to me again today.  I will pass it on to the grader.
Regards,
