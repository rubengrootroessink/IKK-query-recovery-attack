on=20

nd=20
the interruptible program=01,s opt-out window scheduled for November of  ea=
ch=20
year.? Numerous other parties submitted comments opposing the proposed =20
suspension of the opt-out provisions of the existing interruptible rate =20
schedules.? In D.00-10-066, the Commission nevertheless temporarily =20
suspended the opt-out window until March 31, 2001, but only for SCE=20
customers  that signed-up for the interruptible program before April 1, 199=
