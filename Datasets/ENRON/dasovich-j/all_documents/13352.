Jeff:

Please see attached. I have a key contact that knows your Vice-Chairman, Tom 
White who I understand was just nominated to become Army Secretary. I don't 
think this is of his level but let me know how I should proceed. If you feel 
it's right to be talkng to him, let me know as I have been offered an 
introduction to him by my friend, Michael Krause, Chief Logistician, US Army.

Best regards,
Joe Alcantara
