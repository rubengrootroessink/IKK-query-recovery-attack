California is electric industry test case

SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- The federal government will provide grants and loans to 
help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills, 
President Clinton said Wednesday.
Clinton said $2.6 million will be earmarked to help low-income families and 
seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled. He urged the 
Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are 
struggling to pay power bills.
He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
"We'll do what we can to help you," the president said during a televised 
news conference at the White House in Washington.
Test case yields public outcry
The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the 
feasibility of electric industry deregulation. The region -- which also 
encompasses South Orange County, north of San Diego -- is the first in the 
nation to have its power market completely deregulated. 
New York, New England and mid-Atlantic states are following suit, and they're 
watching California carefully.
Thus far, the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles.
Electricity supply that hasn't increased in 10 years failed this summer to 
meet strong demand resulting from a growing state. With market forces in play 
for the first time, strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was 
passed along to residents.
After a public outcry, the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday 
approved a plan that would cap customers' electric bills for normal use, but 
they'll pay market rates for anything extra. Utility companies also can 
collect on any shortfalls later.

In other words, if the electric company can't pass along the entire cost of 
buying the energy for now, they'll be able to pass it along months later. 
Therefore, people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the 
cooler months in fall and winter won't see much of a drop-off.
"It's a shameful pay-now-or-pay-later plan," said Bob Finkelstein, staff 
attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. 
"California jumped off the deregulation cliff."
State legislators, which have the power to expand on the commission's ruling, 
shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid-1999 levels and cap them for 
customers of San Diego Gas & Electric, a Sempra Energy (SRE: news, msgs) 
subsidiary. They faced opposition from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and from 
Republican lawmakers.
Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by 60 percent immediately but that 
would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later. 
Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers' money to help pay 
electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits.
San Diego fiasco
The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated 
electricity market that began two years ago. The effects of deregulation are 
being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its 
rate freeze -- last summer. The rest of California should follow, region 
after region, by 2002. 
The idea sounded good: Deregulate the electric industry and let the market 
set the prices. With competition, rates should come down and service should 
improve. When the long-distance phone market was deregulated, it did bring 
about low prices and greater competition.
But things got messed up along the way.
For one, the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for 
electricity as they shop for better deals among long-distance carriers was 
dashed, at least for now. Initially, hundreds of companies had signed up to 
offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market. Of the 
remaining companies, most serve the more lucrative corporate market, said 
Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman at Consumer Action.
Also, the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives 
and negotiate better rates "didn't pan out," Sherry said.
Demand far outstrips supply
Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew. 
But supply didn't grow with it because no new electric generation plants have 
been built in the state for 10 years. Last year, the state approved five 
applications to build new plants, but they're years away from becoming 
operational.






Under the deregulated market, electric utility companies were mandated to 
sell their power generation plants. By separating the provider of electricity 
and the generator of electricity, the idea is to usher in a more competitive 
market.
Today, San Diego Gas & Electric buys from electric generators through an 
auction market.
But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San 
Diego worse. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when 
electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices, they are 
required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid. But in a situation 
where the electric company needs all the power available, it has to accept 
all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal -- inflating the cost.
Electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more, 
Sherry said. FERC is investigating and plans to issue a report later this 
year. But for now, price caps have been set.
Utility company buffeted
Ed Van Herik, a Sempra spokesman, said the auction rules are putting the 
squeeze on utility companies, already buffeted from all sides by public 
outcry and political pressure.
But Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein said San Diego Gas & Electric isn't 
totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high 
costs.
"They could have entered into (futures) contracts to hedge these risks," 
which would have allowed the utility to buy electricity at prices under 
normal conditions, the attorney said.?
