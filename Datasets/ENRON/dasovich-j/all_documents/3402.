Dear Students,

You will be receiving a folded, sealed letter from CIS in your MBA mailbox
this week.  DO NOT DISCARD IT.  It contains your ID and password for
accessing a powerful version of Nexis-Lexis.  Please keep this letter
and/or write down your ID and password in a secure location for future
reference.  IDs and passwords are not case sensitive and should contain no
spaces.

This version of Nexis, Nexis.Com, contains significantly more resources
than you will find on the unpassworded, Nexis Academic Universe that we
have had access to in the past.  Also unlike Academic Universe, you will
now be able to search across a number of different publication types all at
once, download and print multiple records, and have Nexis automatically
email you updated information on topics that you have researched.

We have been chosen as a test site for this new B-School program.  As noted
in your letter, you will have access to Nexis.Com until the end of the May
when the trial ends.  Please be sure to read and honor the restrictions
outliined on your letter.

If there is enough interest, we will schedule some training sessions that
highlight the advanced search features of Nexis.Com.  In the meantime,
please be sure to try the online tutorial and read the help and search tip
screens available on Nexis.

We hope you find this helpful,
Your Long Library Reference Staff,

Rebecca L'Hermitte
