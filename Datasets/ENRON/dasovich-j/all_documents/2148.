Mary, I've attached Seabron's draft of the White Paper.  Per your request, 
Seabron added a section on governance; I have not reviewed this particular 
section to see if I have any additional thoughts or comments, although I 
agree with Seabron that we should probably discuss the need for this section 
next week.  I have received the Acrobat version by separate email and will 
forward it to you separately.  Finally, I will send the pleading that will 
accompany the White Paper to you on Monday.  Ron

Ron:

Please find attached a first draft of the Enron white paper on further
California market reforms.

I have added a short section on governance as discussed, although I am not
convinced that it has a great role or that the comments of Carl or I are
very insightful on this issue. Perhaps we should discuss it further next
week.

Give me a call if you need anything else. There may be problems with the
Word version (Word always causes problems) so I will email you an Acrobat
version as well in a few minutes.
