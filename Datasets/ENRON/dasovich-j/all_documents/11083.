Scott, etal --

My final concern.  

Is anyone at EES concerned with this outcome --  
(1) Accept EES' tiering but use 60% of current usage as baseline, 
(2) all above 60% is DJ Index, and 
(3) demand below 60% is paid at $500/Mwh (or the ISO price)?  

This is an adaption of our proposal.  Would this be painful?  

My big fear is that somehow the CPUC uses our filing against us.  We need to 
make sure that these discussions don't get away from us to allow that outcome.

Jim
