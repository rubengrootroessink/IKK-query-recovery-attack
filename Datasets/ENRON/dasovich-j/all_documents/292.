Greetings all,

 Scott Bolton and I wanted to give you the "low-down" on the strategy meeting 
taking place next week in New Orleans.  

The meeting will be held at the Hilton New Orleans Riverside.  The hotel 
address is:  Poydras at the Mississippi River, New Orleans, 70140.

We have reserved a block of sleeping rooms (16 total) at a rate of $189.00 
per night.  The room reservations are for the nights of January 19 and 20, 
checking out January 21.  Each meeting attendee will need  to call the hotel 
directly to make reservations.  The number to call to make reservations is 
504.584.3999.  Tell the reservationist that you need one of the rooms in the 
"Enron Communications" block.  If you want a confirmation faxed or mailed, it 
must be requested at the time of booking.  Those flying into New Orleans on 
January 20 need to tell the reservationist that they will need the hotel room 
on January 20 as opposed to January 19 and 20.  Room reservations must be 
made no later than January 12. Each person will be responsible for his/her 
hotel room and charges.

The meeting is scheduled to begin at 9:30 AM on January 20 and end around 
2:00 PM on January 21.  The meeting will be held in the Cambridge Room.

We will be sending out a formal agenda by Thursday this week.  During the 
meeting , we will be developing  our team's objectives and strategy for 2000, 
hearing from a number of ECI commercial people, and conducting lots of Q&A.  
Please contact myself or Scott to confirm your attendance as soon as 
possible.  
 
Best Regards, 

Scott & Donald
