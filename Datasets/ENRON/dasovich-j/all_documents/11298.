Hi Everyone,

Get ready for the blast!

In the next couple of days, we'll be sending to your home addresses an
invitation to the annual EvMBA End-Of-Year Reception, a celebration for
everyone!

The event will be held Friday,  May 18 from 6:30 - 8:30 pm at Palio D'Asti
(640 Sacramento) in San Francisco.  All current students, recent grads, and
families are welcome.

This has always been a great event, and we hope you can make it!

Cheers,

Diane
