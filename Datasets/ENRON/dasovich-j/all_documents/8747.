Ok, Great.

I'm in class tonight, but will be working on the case today
around lunch. Sounds like tomorrow AM may be a better
time for a conf call - after everyone sends around their
analysis to each other. I'll take a crack at putting it all
together - as I am relatively free tomorrow.

Greetings:

I'm in the group (and traveling on the East Coast, returning late tonite).
I can do a conference all today if folks would like.  Otherwise, I'll be
working on it on the plane back tonite and will distribute when I get home
or first thing in the AM.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Guys,

Just sat down to read about the first write up that is due
this Thursday, and realized that this is supposed to be a
group assignment!!  Ooops - I had no idea... Did you ;-)
Anyone read the case and/or taken a crack at it? Should
we try and co-ordinate a conference call?

Carolyn is out for the week and excused from the
assignment - just had a baby girl last Fri!!
Jeff, did you hear from teacher if OK to join ?
