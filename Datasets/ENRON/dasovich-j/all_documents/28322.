I am sorry I could not call you earlier to talk about this; I have been in
Washington D.C. the last few days with my CEO for meetings.

First of all I want to say that I am very, very sorry that you have had to
deal with the Bill Perry issue in any way.  I think it is entirely
inappropriate to involve either of you and I am sure it has caused you
distress.  I am also sorry that I went onto Bill Perry=01,s property last
weekend and I promise to NEVER go on Bill Perry=01,s property again.

Last weekend the 6 of us took the usual hike around the Johansson=01,s prop=
erty
and ended up on Roseman Creek road next to Bill Perry=01,s property with th=
e
observation deck.  Scott has never seen the deck and has heard a lot about
it so I (in not my best judgment) thought it would be ok to quickly go up t=
o
the deck and check it out for a couple minutes and come right back.  We did
not intend on hanging out on the deck or spending more than a couple of
minutes.  All I wanted to do was show Scotty where it was and what it looke=
d
like.  Kent and Scott had been talking about building one on our property
and I wanted them to see it.  We went in the middle of the day and we did
not bring any drinks, bottles, cigarettes, or food.  We purposely went out
there with nothing, spent a couple of minutes and came right back.  I am no=
t
saying that this was right (because it was still trespassing), but we did
not go out there as we had in the past.

Then, on Sunday, Bill Perry came (unannounced) to the dome and started
yelling at me.  He called me horrible names and said he was calling the
Sheriff.  I only spoke nicely to him and apologized repeatedly.  I also
promised him that I would never go onto his property again.  He embarrassed
me and said bad things about me and both of you regarding things that are
not even related to this event.  He also said that people continue to go on
his deck and disrespect his property.  This is when I knew that it is not
just us that has used his deck.  I have not been on his property in two
years and I know Prentice and Jeff haven=01,t either.  He complained that
things have still be mistreated and he blamed me for things that I could no=
t
have done.  I know that what I did was not right and I tried to let him see
that I was sincere about never going there again, but he would not listen.

I know that I have to deal with this issue.  I assume you have the name of
the Sheriff so I can speak with him (and I hope you referred him immediatel=
y
to me).  You should not have been called in this matter and that is VERY
upsetting to me.  You did not trespass.  Trespassing is not a crime that is
against another person=01,s property, but rather against another person.  T=
here
is no reason why you should be involved.  I am a 32 year old adult, full
capable of being responsible for my own actions.  I may make mistakes, but
it is not your responsibility to answer for those mistakes and I am sorry
that you have been put in this position.
