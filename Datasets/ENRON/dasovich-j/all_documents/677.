value added over the past year. For budgetary reasons, it is critical for=
=20
every EGA member to participate in this exercise and document his/her share=
=20
of significant value added.  Please contact Gia Maisashvili or John Neslage=
=20
to discuss the  methodology for determining EGA=01,s value added as soon as=

The dead line for this effort is Friday,  September 1st
