store (powered by Greenlight.com) will let you browse among  hundreds of 
models, compare vehicles side by side in your own  personal showroom, and

2001 Dodge Durango - Save $1000
The 2001 Dodge Durango was already a great value in its  class, but  now it's 
outstanding. Simply take delivery by January 8, 2001, and  qualified buyers 
can take advantage of either a $1,000 rebate or  3.9% financing for up to 36 
months.*

How does the Honda Accord remain the benchmark by which  all midsize  sedans 
are judged? By continually delivering Honda's trademark  blend of

2001 Toyota Camry
Every year Americans vote with their pocketbook for the  most  popular sedan, 
and over the past few years this American-built Toyota has established a 
formidable record. Available with either  a fuel-sipping four-cylinder or a 
powerful V6, the Camry routinely  maintains the highest resale value in its 
class.
