previous workshop attendees.  This year's workshop, helpful to both beginner 
and experienced professionals who currently work, or desire to work with the 
media, is being held at Cadence Design Systems on April 26th and 27th, 2001, 
and is co-sponsored by the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce

The registration fee for this event varies from $100.00 to $250.00.
