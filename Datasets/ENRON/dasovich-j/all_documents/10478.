Is there any way that this group of people (and other people who may want to 
participate) can begin to have weekly conference calls to keep everyone fully 
in the loop on what is happening and needs to happen going forward related to 
wholesale activities - gas & power?

When things settle down (will that ever happen?), maybe weekly calls won't be 
necessary.  But given the pace and intensity of matters, we should try and 
coordinate through a 30 minute call.  I suggest Friday afternoon (3pm 
Houston) - that should give us the ability to make sure the right RCRs are 
submitted for discussion Monday am.

Also, Sue Mara has been keeping a catalog of activities on Power Wholesale 
matters.  (1) Sue can you please send it out to all of these people, (2) Sue. 
should we let the DC team - Ray and Donna - keep the catalog to make sure 
that we are organized before FERC?  Appreciate your thoughts.

Let me know.  I'll ask Marcia to try and put this together for this Friday 
and going forward.

Jim
