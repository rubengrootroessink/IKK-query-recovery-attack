Jeff - twenty years ago Hogan and I wrote long papers on "disruption
tariffs" to offset OPEC market power.    I even published a book on the
subject (Oil Markets in Turmoil)..  The United States never tried them but
the European's did and they have been quite effective.

In today's LA Times I have an op ed which suggests the state may want to
use them as a tool to deal with the electricity crisis.  I did not mention
the manifesto in the op ed because the idea was not discussed in our
meeting or the paper.

I suspect the op ed will not be welcomed in Houston - but you should be
aware of it.
