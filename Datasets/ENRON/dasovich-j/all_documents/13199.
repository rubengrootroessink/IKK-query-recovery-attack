Karen, I vote for sending out a press release rather than having disgruntled
and surprised customers go running to the press.  If possible, it should be
directed to metro/general assignment reporters rather than political types.

I think it becomes a more positive and manageable story if we're up front
and get our side out before it looks like massive consumer complaints
against a company that is posting hundreds of millions in revenue.  Without
an announcement, I'm afraid you'll get the story about the poor family who
has been trying to save money and is now facing huge utility bills that they
didn't expect and can't meet; with one, we may be able to get coverage that
is more thoughtful and looks at some of the legitimate reasons Enron had to
take this action.

Ken
