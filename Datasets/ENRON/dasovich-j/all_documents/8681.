FCC Expands ILEC Line-Sharing Mandates To Fiber Loops, Confirms=20
Line-Splitting Duty

The FCC has given data CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers) a major=
=20
win by expanding incum-bent local exchange carriers=0F' =0F"line-sharing=0F=
" and =0F"
line-splitting=0F" duties.  The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those=
=20
duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in=20
Common Carrier dockets 96-98 and 98-147.  The order addressed petitions for=
=20
reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing (TR,=
=20
Nov. 22, 1999).

Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers=20
(ILECs) allow competitors to offer high-speed service over the high-frequen=
cy=20
portion of a loop, while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the=
=20
low-frequency portion.

In the order adopted Jan. 19, the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing=
=20
over the entire loop even if they=0F've deployed fiber in the loop to suppl=
ement=20
or replace the original copper line.  The order was one of many actions tha=
t=20
the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E. Kennard=0F's tenure but=
 that=20
were not immediately available, eventually trickling out of the Commission=
=20
last week.

Rhythms NetConnections, Inc., had filed a petition for clarification with t=
he=20
FCC, complaining that some ILECs were contending they didn=0F't have to unb=
undle=20
fiber portions of the loop when those portions were used to provide xDSL=20
(digital subscriber line) services.

=0F"In the absence of this clarification, a competitive LEC might undertake=
 to=20
collocate a DSLAM [digital subscriber line access multiplexer] in an=20
incumbent=0F's central office to provide line-shared xDSL services to custo=
mers,=20
only to be told by the incumbent that it was migrating those customers to=
=20
fiber-fed facilities,=0F" the FCC said.  In that case, the CLEC would have =
to=20
collocate another DSLAM in a remote terminal to continue offering line-shar=
ed=20
services to the same customers.

=0F"All indications are that fiber deployment by incumbent LECs is increasi=
ng=20
and that collocation by competitive LECs at remote terminals is likely to b=
e=20
costly, time-consuming, and often unavailable,=0F" the FCC said.

The FCC says ILECs must allow for =0F"line splitting,=0F" so competitors th=
at offer=20
voice service using the unbundled network element platform can provide=0F-o=
r=20
partner with another data CLEC to provide=0F-DSL service on those same line=
s.

=0F"Incumbent LECs are required to make all necessary network modifications=
 to=20
facilitate line splitting, including providing nondiscriminatory access to=
=20
[operation support systems] necessary for preordering, ordering,=20
provisioning, maintenance and repair, and billing for loops used in=20
line-splitting arrangements,=0F" the FCC said.

The FCC =0F"strongly urged=0F" ILECs and CLECs to =0F"work together to deve=
lop=20
processes and systems to support competing carriers=0F' ordering and=20
provisioning of unbundled loops and switching necessary for line splitting.=
=0F"

The FCC, however, denied a related petition for clarification filed by AT&T=
=20
Corp.  It had asked the FCC to require ILECs to make their xDSL services=20
available to customers even if they obtain voice service from competing=20
carriers using the ILECs=0F' lines.  AT&T was worried that customers wouldn=
=0F't=20
switch their voice service to a competitor if that change would eliminate=
=20
their ability to get DSL services.

=0F"Although the line-sharing order obligates incumbent LECs to make the=20
high-frequency portion of the loop separately available to competing carrie=
rs=20
on loops where incumbent LECs provide voice service, it does not require th=
at=20
they provide xDSL service when they are no longer the voice provider,=0F" t=
he=20
FCC said.

=0F"To the extent that AT&T believes that specific incumbent behavior const=
rains=20
competition in a manner inconsistent with the Commission=0F's line-sharing =
rules=20
and/or the [Communications Act of 1934, as amended] itself, we encourage AT=
&T=20
to pursue enforcement action,=0F" it said.

The FCC also denied requests from Bell Atlantic Corp. (now Verizon=20
Communications, Inc.).  It had asked the FCC to (1) reconsider the=20
requirement that ILECs refusing to condition a loop for the provision of DS=
L=20
service demonstrate to the relevant state commission that conditioning that=
=20
loop would degrade voice services and(2) permit a line-sharing deployment=
=20
schedule other than the one it adopted.

Rhythms applauded the FCC=0F's decision.  =0F"By expanding the definition o=
f line=20
sharing to include fiber loops and ensuring our ability to use consumers=0F=
'=20
existing voice lines for data services, we can bring the benefits of the mo=
st=20
robust broadband service offerings to consumers,=0F" said Jeffrey Blumenfel=
d,=20
chief legal officer and general counsel for Rhythms.

During a press briefing last week (see separate story), Thomas J. Tauke,=20
senior vice president-public policy and external affairs at Verizon=20
Communications, Inc., criticized the FCC=0F's decision, specifically the=20
provisions requiring line splitting.  The FCC =0F"didn=0F't address how thi=
s is to=20
be done,=0F" he said.

Jonathan Lee, vice president-regulatory affairs at the Competitive=20
Telecommunications Association, said the order was an =0F"unmitigated win=
=0F" for=20
data CLECs.  But he said the FCC=0F's decision not to grant AT&T=0F's petit=
ion for=20
clarification was =0F"regrettable.=0F"

Residential consumers who have DSL available only from the ILEC won=0F't be=
 able=20
to switch their voice service without losing their DSL service, he said.  M=
r.=20
Lee compared the ILECs=0F' =0F"tying=0F" of voice and DSL service to Micros=
oft Corp.=0F's=20
practice of linking its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows=20
operating system.  The ILEC practice =0F"could run afoul of antitrust laws,=
=0F" he=20
said.

Critics Worry White House =0F`E-rate=0F' Proposal May Reduce Funding, Disco=
urage=20
Participation

The education reform package that President Bush sent to Congress last week=
=20
is drawing criticism from policy-makers who helped draft and implement the =
=0F"
E-rate=0F" telecom discount program.  It=0F's also sparking concern among s=
chools=20
and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it.

They=0F're worried that the president=0F's E-rate proposal, if adopted in i=
ts=20
current =0F"blueprint=0F" form, would discourage certain schools from apply=
ing for=20
discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections.  In th=
e=20
long run, they fear that the president=0F's proposal would lead to decrease=
d=20
funding for the program, which currently stands at $2.25 billion a year.

The main problem, these critics say, is that shifting administration of the=
=20
program to the Department of Education, as President Bush has said he inten=
ds=20
to do, would render E-rate funding dependent on congressional=20
appropriations.  In its current form under the FCC=0F's oversight, the prog=
ram=20
is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers=
.

The technology part of the president=0F's education reform initiative unvei=
led=20
last week calls for combining the E-rate with several Department of Educati=
on=20
programs to form one =0F"performance-based technology grant program.=0F"  T=
hen, it=20
says, funding for that program would be disbursed =0F"by formula=0F" to sta=
tes=20
through block grants.

The aim is to streamline the many =0F"duplicative technology programs=0F" i=
nto one=20
education grant plan, the Bush administration says.  Such streamlining woul=
d=20
go a long way toward reducing the E-rate program=0F's =0F"burdensome paperw=
ork=0F"=20
requirements and adding more flexibility to those program, the proposal say=
s.

=0F"Flexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes=
 that=20
include software purchases and development, wiring and technology=20
infrastructure, and teacher training in the use of technology,=0F" it state=
s. =20
It also would permit E-rate recipients to use federal funds to pay for=20
Internet filtering software, which is being mandated for the first time thi=
s=20
year by the Children=0F's Internet Protection Support Act of 2000 (TR, Jan.=
 22).

But key U.S. lawmakers and education officials aren=0F't prepared to embrac=
e the=20
plan yet.  They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on=
=20
several issues, including how the E-rate program would be funded and what=
=20
formula would be used to distribute money among the states.

Jeff Burnett, director-government relations at the National Association of=
=20
Independent Schools, says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it=20
comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service=20
Fund, as it is now, or by general tax revenues.  =0F"That=0F's a huge quest=
ion=20
mark, and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it wou=
ld=20
become part of the Department of Education=0F's budget,=0F" he says.

Mr. Burnett says making the E-rate dependent on general tax revenues could =
=0F"
destabilize=0F" its funding and discourage some private and parochial schoo=
ls=20
from applying for telecom discounts.  =0F"It would go from where it is now,=
 a=20
pretty stable $2.25 billion per year, to where you would have arguments eve=
ry=20
year in Congress over how much money it would get.=0F"

Plus, he says, E-rate funds =0F"no longer would be string-free=0F" if they =
were to=20
be allocated by the federal government.  Moving the program to the Departme=
nt=20
of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because =
of=20
potential =0F"church-state problems,=0F" he says, referring to the First Am=
endment=20
to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits congressional establishment of an=
=20
official religion.  And some states may be restricted by their state=20
constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to priva=
te=20
and religious schools, he adds.

Former FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, who oversaw the implementation of the=20
E-rate program back in 1996, fears that the end result could be the =0F"kil=
ling=20
of the program altogether=0F" or a =0F"chopping of it down from a significa=
nt=20
program to an insignificant one.=0F"   =20

Having the Education Department oversee the E-rate program would remove=20
stability from the program, Mr. Hundt stressed.  =0F"Where are they going t=
o=20
find 2, 3, or 4 billion dollars in the general [tax revenues] to pay for it=
?=0F"=20
he asked.  =0F"The bigger [telecom service] providers probably would be hap=
py,=20
but the [support] would be reduced,=0F" Mr. Hundt told TR last week.

He also rejected the administration=0F's claims that consolidating the educ=
ation=20
technology programs would reduce applicants=0F' paperwork and filing=20
requirements.  =0F"Moving it to the Department of Education is not a way to=
=20
simplify paperwork,=0F" Mr. Hundt said.  =0F"Nothing is simpler than the wa=
y it=0F's=20
done now.  These forms don=0F't even go to the government; they go to a=20
privately run trust fund,=0F" he added.

A source who works with schools on fine-tuning their E-rate applications=20
foresees a =0F"food fight at the state level=0F" if the Bush administration=
=20
institutes a block-grant program.  =0F"There won=0F't be the same spirit of=
=20
cooperation among the schools and libraries that there is today,=0F" the so=
urce=20
says.  =0F"Instead, they=0F'll see each other as competition.=0F"

A library official said that even if the E-rate program remained part of th=
e=20
USF, expanding its scope to include software purchases and teacher training=
=20
could give telecom carriers grounds for a legal challenge of the assessment=
s=20
made on their revenues.  =0F"If the money is to come from the service provi=
der,=20
then the program must directly relate back to the services that they=20
provide.  I could see someone challenging the software and teacher-training=
=20
aspects,=0F" the source says.

Snowe, Rockefeller Are Skeptical

The program has received an icy response from two U.S. senators who were=20
among the original sponsors of the legislation that added the E-rate=20
provisions to the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Republican Olympia J.=20
Snowe (Maine) and Democrat John D. Rockefeller IV (W.Va.).

In a statement issued soon after the Bush education proposal was released=
=20
Jan. 23, Sen. Rockefeller vowed to =0F"aggressively fight=0F" the E-rate as=
pects of=20
the proposal.  It would be a =0F"grave mistake=0F" to fold the E-rate into =
a block=20
grant program with the Education Department technology programs, Sen.=20
Rockefeller said.

=0F"Under the Bush block-grant approach, local schools would have less=20
flexibility, not more,=0F" Sen. Rockefeller said.  =0F"Private and parochia=
l=20
schools would have to negotiate with state education agencies and worry abo=
ut=20
entanglements of federal regulations.  Most importantly, the secure funding=
=20
for the E-rate and investments in technology would be jeopardized,=0F" he s=
aid.

Sen. Snowe also worries about turning the E-rate into a block-grant program=
. =20
Among other things, she says, such a proposal could deter private and=20
parochial schools from participating in the program. =20

=0F"We plan to work with President Bush and our colleagues in the Congress =
to=20
ensure that the current program is protected, as we don=0F't support any ef=
forts=20
that would undermine its goals,=0F" a Snowe aide told TR. =20

New House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Fred Upton (R., Mich.) h=
as=20
told President Bush in a letter that he plans to hold several hearings this=
=20
year on =0F"aspects of your proposal that fall under the subcommittee=0F's=
=20
jurisdiction,=0F" including the E-rate plan.

Rep. Upton has asked the Bush administration to focus on broadband service=
=20
deployment, =0F"particularly as it relates to how increased access to high-=
speed=20
data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve educational=20
opportunities.=0F"  Numerous calls to the White House seeking comment weren=
=0F't=20
returned before TR=0F's Friday afternoon news deadline.

FCC Gears Up To Enforce E-rate =0F'Net-Filter Mandate

The FCC wants advice on how to implement the Children=0F's Internet Protect=
ion=20
Act of 2000 (CIPA), which requires schools and libraries that receive =0F"
E-rate=0F" discounts for Internet services and internal connections to use =
=0F"
filtering=0F" technology that prevents minors from accessing =0F"harmful=0F=
" material=20
over the =0F'Net.

The FCC has suggested that recipients certify compliance with the CIPA on=
=20
forms they must file when applying for E-rate discounts on telecom services=
,=20
Internet services, and internal connections.

Under the CIPA, the =0F"Internet safety technology=0F" must filter out =0F"=
visual=20
depictions=0F" of =0F"obscene=0F" material or =0F"child pornography,=0F" ev=
en when adults=20
are using the computers.  Schools and libraries are required to bar access =
to=20
visual depictions that are =0F"harmful to minors=0F" only when minors are u=
sing the=20
computers.

The law requires E-rate recipients to certify each program year that they a=
re=20
complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of=
=20
the filtering technology while the computers are in use.  The law allows an=
=20
administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is bei=
ng=20
used by an adult =0F"for bona fide research or other lawful purpose.=0F"

Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy; in=
=20
the first year after the effective date of the law, they either must certif=
y=20
that they have such a policy or that they are developing one.

The law also allows schools and libraries to seek a waiver from the FCC=20
during the law=0F's second year, if state or local procurement rules or=20
competitive bidding requirements have prevented them from implementing an=
=20
Internet safety policy.

The FCC=0F's further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Co=
mmon=20
Carrier docket 96-45 proposes that E-rate recipients this year certify eith=
er=20
that they have complied with all relevant provisions of the CIPA or that th=
e=20
CIPA requirements don=0F't apply.  The certifications would appear on their=
 =0F"
receipt of confirmation=0F" forms (FCC Form 486).

The CIPA doesn=0F't require schools and libraries that use E-rate funds onl=
y for=20
telecom services=0F-and not for Internet access or internal connections=0F-=
to=20
install the filtering technology.

The FCC proposes that in future years recipients include their compliance=
=20
certifications on FCC Form 471, which is used to describe the services to b=
e=20
funded.  It asks how to implement the =0F"remedial=0F" provisions of the CI=
PA,=20
which detail ways an applicant can correct its noncompliance or=20
noncertification.  Comments are due 15 days after publication of the=20
rulemaking notice in the Federal Register; replies are due 30 days later.

The American Library Association has announced plans to challenge the=20
constitutionality of the CIPA (TR, Jan. 22), whose Internet-filtering=20
requirements extend to other federal programs that subsidize schools=0F' an=
d=20
libraries=0F' purchases of computers and Internet access.

The ALA, which notes that the CIPA takes effect April 20, has launched a We=
b=20
site where it will post information about its activities regarding the CIPA=
=20
(http://www.ala.org/cipa).

Meanwhile, President Bush last week announced a proposal for modifying the=
=20
E-rate program, including reducing the paperwork demands on applicants (see=
=20
separate story).

Large Carriers Want 700 MHz Auction Postponed, But Small Providers,=20
Broadcasters Oppose Delay

Large wireless carriers are once again asking the FCC to postpone the=20
scheduled auction of licenses for the 700 megahertz band, citing a host of=
=20
familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the=
=20
frequencies.

But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin t=
he=20
auction March 6, as scheduled, noting that the sale already has been=20
postponed three times.  They say that large carriers have had plenty of tim=
e=20
to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them.

They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in respon=
se=20
to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September (TR, Jan=
.=20
22).  Several large carriers that supported the request asked for an even=
=20
longer postponement.

Supporters of postponement cited the presence of broadcasters in the spectr=
um=20
and the need to negotiate band-clearing agreements as evidence to support=
=20
their cause (see separate story).  Most of their arguments echoed those of=
=20
Verizon Wireless.

TV broadcasters don=0F't have to evacuate the spectrum (channels 60=0F-69) =
as part=20
of the transition to digital TV until 2006 at the earliest.  But wireless=
=20
carriers, citing the uncertainty about when the frequencies slated to be=20
auctioned will be available for use, have asked the FCC and Congress to for=
ce=20
the broadcasters out early.

In addition to the presence of the broadcasters, other reasons the large=20
carriers said the auction should be delayed included concerns that (1)a=20
reauction of =0F"C=0F" and =0F"F=0F" block PCS (personal communications ser=
vice) licenses=20
hadn=0F't finished in time for carriers to assess their spectrum needs in t=
he=20
700 MHz auction (see separate story), (2)companies need more time to prepar=
e=20
for package bidding rules that will be used for the first time in the aucti=
on=20
(TR, July 10, 2000), and (3)a high-level effort to identify and allocate=20
frequencies for third-generation (3G) services will affect carriers=0F' int=
erest=20
in the 700 MHz band (see separate story).

The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Associationsaid carriers=20
interested in participating in the 700 MHz band auction wouldn=0F't have ti=
me to=20
assess their bidding strategies and spectrum needs and form alliances becau=
se=20
the C and F block reauction concluded last week, after the comments were=20
filed.  In addition, the Commission=0F's anticollusion rules limit contact=
=20
between bidders, CTIA noted.

CTIA added that prospective 700 MHz band bidders wouldn=0F't have time to=
=20
negotiate the band-clearing agreements the FCC is encouraging.  And it cite=
d=20
carriers=0F' need to prepare for package-bidding rules.  In the end, the sa=
me=20
factors that led the FCC to delay the auction last year still exist, CTIA=
=20
said.

AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.,asked the FCC to delay the auction until March=
=20
2002.  Such a move =0F"will give incumbents, prospective bidders, and the=
=20
Commission an opportunity to resolve much of the uncertainty associated wit=
h=20
this band,=0F" the carrier said.  AT&T Wireless also said more time was nee=
ded=20
to assess whether recent FCC actions designed to speed broadcasters=0F'=20
transition to digital TV would accomplish their goals.

It suggested that the FCC schedule the auction of channels 60=0F-69 in=20
conjunction with a sale of channels 52=0F-59, which the FCC is statutorily=
=20
required to license by September 2002.

Cingular Wireless LLCasked the FCC to delay the auction until at least 60 t=
o=20
90 days after it acts on all =0F"long form=0F" applications filed by winnin=
g=20
bidders in the C and F block reauction.  It also suggested that FCC=20
coordinate the timing of licensing channels 60=0F-69 and channels 52=0F-59.

Nextel Communications, Inc.,wants the auction delayed until November.  That=
=20
move would give carriers time to assess the spectrum-allocation decisions=
=20
made under the 3G initiative, Nextel said.  Although the 30 MHz of commerci=
al=20
spectrum in the 700 MHz band is not under consideration as part of that=20
effort, the frequencies are considered ideally suited for such advanced=20
services.

Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.,filing on behalf of itself and its United=
=20
States Cellular Corp.subsidiary, supported a delay until September or later=
=20
if several other related proceedings aren=0F't completed.

A postponement is =0F"essential=0F" for smaller and midsize companies that =
need=20
time to assess 700 MHz market valuations, to locate funding sources, and to=
=20
prepare for the package-bidding methodology, TDS said.

=0F"In July of 2000, the Commission postponed this very auction for precise=

these same reasons, a decision strongly supported by the wireless industry,=
=0F"=20
said Motorola, Inc.=0F"The logic of that postponement should apply with equ=

It added =0F"that forcing carriers to engage in competitive bidding for spe=

FCC Takes Additional Steps To Help Clear 700 MHz Band

The FCC has taken additional steps to help spur the relocation of incumbent=
=20
TV broadcasters from the 700 megahertz band in order to make way for wirele=
ss=20
carriers.  But it said it wouldn=0F't force the incumbents to clear the=20
frequencies=0F-at least not yet.

In a third report and order released last week, the Commission said it had=
=20
decided to allow the private sector to determine what band-clearing=20
mechanisms best suited the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers.

Specifically, the FCC has decided not to impose cost-sharing rules, cost=20
caps, or cost-recovery guidelines at this time on the relocation of incumbe=
nt=20
broadcasters.  Last year the agency asked whether it should impose such rul=
es=20
(TR, June 26 and July 10, 2000).

=0F`Secondary Auctions=0F' Touted

The FCC also will leave it up to industry to decide if =0F"secondary auctio=
ns=0F"=20
should be organized to facilitate band-clearing agreements before the=20
auction, which is scheduled to begin March 6.  The FCC earlier asked for=20
comments on whether it had the authority to conduct such auctions.

In the order released last week, the FCC reiterated its view of the benefit=
s=20
of such auctions, saying they =0F"have potential to offer both broadcasters=
 and=20
new entrants additional opportunities to reduce the potential transaction=
=20
costs of negotiating with each other directly after the auction.=0F"

As part of their transition to digital TV (DTV), broadcasters don=0F't have=
 to=20
leave the 700 MHz band (channels 60=0F-69) until 2006 at the earliest.  The=
y may=20
stay longer if less than 85% of households in their markets have access to=
=20
DTV signals.  That timetable has created uncertainty among wireless carrier=
s=20
about how much to bid=0F-or whether to bid at all=0F-on the spectrum when i=
t is=20
auctioned.

Wireless carriers have asked the FCC to force TV broadcasters out of the=20
spectrum before they are required to leave (TR, Aug. 21, 2000).  For their=
=20
part, broadcasters have fought such band-clearing mandates and instead have=
=20
urged the FCC to address larger issues related to the DTV transition,=20
especially digital =0F"must-carry=0F" cable TV rights.

The FCC recently took several actions that it said would facilitate=20
broadcasters=0F' transition to DTV, including those dealing with must-carry=
=20
rights.

In its 700 MHz band order, the FCC said it wanted to give voluntary=20
mechanisms a chance in clearing the frequencies for wireless services.  =0F=
"We=20
believe that voluntary agreements between broadcasters and licensees should=
=20
result in the effective clearing of the 700 MHz band,=0F" it said.  =0F"How=
ever, we=20
will revisit this issue in the future if we find it necessary.=0F"

The FCC=0F's latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to=
=20
provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory=20
treatment of private band-clearing agreements.

For example, the agency extended to three-way agreements a general =0F"
rebuttable presumption=0F" adopted last year for bilateral pacts.  The=20
presumption is that such agreements are in the public interest.

The FCC also provided guidance on interference issues arising from relocati=
on=20
agreements that involve moving a broadcaster to a channel below channel 59.=
 =20
And it has streamlined the review of band-clearing agreements and affirmed=
=20
that it expeditiously will process band-clearing agreements.  It also=20
clarified that voluntary agreements to temporarily relocate licensees into=
=20
channels 52=0F-58 would be permitted.

Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the report and order.  =
In=20
a statement, she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable=20
presumption to three-way agreements.  She expressed concern that such=20
agreements would result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she=20
wanted to consider band-clearing agreements case by case.

=0F"As I have stated previously, my ultimate concern is that the presumptio=
n in=20
favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value o=
f=20
free, over-the-air television services,=0F" Commissioner Tristani said.

She also took exception with the FCC=0F's statement that it might revisit i=
ssues=20
surrounding the mandatory relocation of broadcasters.  =0F"I remain convinc=
ed=20
that such action would contravene the statute=0F" establishing broadcasters=

transition, she said.

The FCC=0F's order was adopted Jan. 18 in Wireless Telecommunications docke=
t=20
99-168, Cable Services docket 98-120, and Mass Media docket 00-39.  A news=

Kennard Requests Hard Stand

In a related development, former FCC Chairman William E. Kennard has asked=
=20
Congress to take a hard stand against broadcasters in their transition to=
=20
DTV.  Writing Jan. 19 to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), Mr. Kennard=20
suggested that Congress set a firm deadline of Dec. 31, 2006, for TV=20
broadcasters in channels 52=0F-69 to relocate. =20

He also proposed that broadcasters using channels 2=0F-51 after that date b=
e=20
charged an escalating fee to encourage them to clear the spectrum.

Writing Jan. 26 to Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee=
=20
Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.), Lyle Gallagher, president of the=20
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International,=20
expressed support for Mr. Kennard=0F's proposals to help clear the 700 MHz =
band.

At the very least, steps should be taken to clear channels 60=0F-69, Mr.=20
Gallagher said.  Public safety agencies urgently need access to 24 MHz of=
=20
spectrum in the 700 MHz band that the FCC has reallocated for their use, he=

said, but much of it is occupied by broadcasters.

=0F"By making the Dec. 31, 2006, date firm for channels 60=0F-69, state and=

Easing Spectrum Crunch Tops CTIA=0F's 2001 Lobbying Agenda

Spectrum issues will top the wireless industry=0F's Washington agenda for t=
his=20
year, according to Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association=20
President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas E. Wheeler.  A scarcity in=20
frequencies is hurting U.S. carriers=0F' competitiveness with their foreign=
=20
counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet, he said.

Mr. Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier ma=
y=20
hold in any one market while a high-level effort to identify and allocate=
=20
frequencies for third-generation (3G) services proceeded.  Such a move woul=
d=20
ease the spectrum crunch, he reasoned.

At a briefing for reporters last week, he said the Bush administration had=
=20
its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable band=
s=20
for 3G use.

U.S. Seen Falling Behind

=0F"God bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy r=
eview=20
process, but [it] couldn=0F't bring it to fruition, and it now falls to the=
 Bush=20
administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisions,=0F=
" Mr.=20
Wheeler said.

=0F"Those decisions will probably take time.  We can=0F't afford time.  It=
=0F's what=20
we don=0F't have.  Japan and Europe are already building the [networks whil=
e] we=0F'

Then-President Clinton launched the 3G initiative by executive memorandum i=
n=20
October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan. 8 and 22). =

The memorandum calls for the FCC to license the spectrum by Sept. 30, 2002,=
=20
after a collaborative effort led by the FCC and the Commerce Department=0F'=
s=20
National Telecommunications & Information Administration.

But a key obstacle is that the bands being examined most closely for 3G=20
applications already are occupied by military, commercial, and educational=
=20
users.

Mr. Wheeler said that the time it would take to allocate 3G spectrum made i=
t=20
even more important for the FCC to lift the spectrum cap immediately.  The=
=20
FCC asked for comments on the issue last week (see separate story).

He said he had =0F"some very profitable discussions=0F" with Bush transitio=
n team=20
officials on spectrum issues, although he wouldn=0F't elaborate.  He also s=
aid=20
he was pleased that Donald L. Evans stressed the importance of allocating 3=
G=20
spectrum in his Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of commerce earli=
er=20
this month (TR, Jan. 8).

Mr. Wheeler said another key issue for the coming year was finding ways to=
=20
use wireless technologies to bridge the =0F"digital divide.=0F"  He stresse=
d that=20
the gap wouldn=0F't =0F"be bridged by just pumping more money into existing=
 subsidy=20

e=20
needed.

On other issues, Mr. Wheeler said CTIA also hoped there would be=20
congressional or FCC action on Internet privacy, =0F"calling-party-pays=0F"=
 billing=20
arrangements, and reciprocal compensation.  Regarding privacy, he said the=
=20
trade group had gotten a positive response from members of Congress and=20
regulators to its proposed principles for location-information services (TR=
,=20
Oct. 30 and Nov. 27, 2000).

Mr. Wheeler defended the industry=0F's claims regarding the safety of mobil=
e=20
phones.  A new book by George L. Carlo, a scientist who led a seven-year, $=
27=20
million industry-funded initiative to study the issue, says the wireless=20
industry has downplayed evidence that the phones can cause illness (TR, Dec=
.=20
25, 2000).  The book is particularly critical of Mr. Wheeler.  The industry=
=20
also has suffered recent setbacks in pending court cases that claim mobile=
=20
phones are dangerous to humans (TR, Jan. 22).

=0F"I don=0F't think that the issue is George Carlo or Tom Wheeler or CTIA,=
=0F" Mr.=20
Wheeler said.  =0F"The whole issue is, What=0F's the science? . . .We=0F've=

the transition would give it about 20 megahertz of SMR spectrum in the 800=

Commission Examines Merits Of Lifting CMRS Spectrum Cap

The FCC is reexamining whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum=20
wireless carriers may hold in any one market.  The Commission also is=20
considering whether it should eliminate its cellular cross-interest rule.

In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week, the FCC asked for=20
comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained, modified, or=20
eliminated to comply with the public-interest standard set forth in section=
=20
11 of the Communications Act, as amended.

Specifically, the agency is soliciting views on whether =0F"meaningful econ=
omic=20
competition=0F" in the commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) market has=20
rendered spectrum aggregation limits, including the cellular cross-interest=
=20
rule, unnecessary.

Under the agency=0F's rules, carriers aren=0F't allowed to hold more than 4=
5=20
megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and 55 MHz in rural markets.  The=20
cellular cross-interest rule restricts an entity=0F's ownership interest in=
=20
cellular carriers operating in the same market.  The FCC wants to know=20
whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of=
=20
spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the mark=
et.

The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes =0F"meaningful=20
economic competition=0F" under section 11 and how competitive conditions ha=
ve=20
changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in 1999.

In the largest metropolitan areas, where seven in 10 Americans live, at lea=
st=20
five mobile telephone carriers are offering service, the agency noted last=
=20
week.  As a result, it said, prices are declining, coverage areas are=20
expanding, and new service packages are being offered.  It wants to know if=
=20
there are public-interest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of suc=
h=20
competitive developments.

Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap, saying it has=
=20
thwarted the U.S. wireless industry=0F's deployment of third-generation (3G=
)=20
services, placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.  Some=20
smaller carriers, however, have asked the FCC to retain the cap, saying it=
=0F's=20
needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger=20
counterparts.

In a broad review of the cap conducted in 1999, the FCC decided to retain t=
he=20
restriction, although it eased the limit in rural markets (TR, Sept. 20,=20
1999).  At the time, it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against=20
excessive concentration in the CMRS market, preserving competition and the=
=20
consumer benefits it had produced.  It also determined in 1999 that the=20
cellular cross-interest restriction was necessary to protect competition. =
=20
The agency eased the rules somewhat, however, permitting some degree of=20
cross-interest.

In November 2000, the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its=
=20
1999 decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its 2000=20
biennial review (TR, Nov. 13, 2000).  The notice of proposed rulemaking,=20
adopted Jan. 19 and released Jan. 23 in Wireless Telecommunications docket=
=20
01-14, stems from that review.  Comments are due 60 days after the notice=
=0F's=20
publication in the Federal Register, and replies are due 30 days after that=
.

In a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said that h=
e=20
supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have conclude=
d=20
that the cap should be lifted.

=0F"The use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues=
 to=20
search for a corresponding competitive ill,=0F" he said.  =0F"I have grown=
=20
impatient with the Commission=0F's repeated reexaminations of these issues=
=20
without substantial alterations in our policy approach.=0F"

Industry Praises Review

Thomas E. Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of the Cellular=20
Telecommunications & Internet Association, said that lifting the cap was=20
crucial while a high-level effort to identify and allocate 3G bands winds=
=20
through the regulatory process (see separate story).

Mr. Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to=20
additional spectrum was necessary for the U.S. to maintain its leadership i=
n=20
the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices.

Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencie=
s=20
for 3G services, setting aside twice as much spectrum as the U.S. has, he=
=20
said.

The Personal Communications Industry Association, however, has said the cap=
=20
is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market.

Mr. Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell had said =
he=20
would favor lifting the spectrum cap.  =0F"Clearly in some of the opinions =
that=20
he=0F's written in the spectrum proceeding, he=0F's asked the question, Why=
 should=20
this continue?=0F" Mr. Wheeler said.  =0F"We=0F're hopeful.=0F"

Then-Commissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November 2000 but said =
he=20
tended to agree with Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth=0F's conclusion that the =
cap =0F"
has outlived its usefulness.=0F"

Notice Explores Alternatives

In its rulemaking notice, the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting=
=20
the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched.  For example, it asks=20
whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services.  =
It=20
also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less=
=20
competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are=20
offering service.

The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat already-licensed spectru=
m=20
differently from frequencies licensed in the future.  =0F"As a general matt=
er,=20
we believe that newly available CMRS-suitable spectrum either should be=20
excluded from the spectrum cap, or, if it is included, that the cap should =
be=20
adjusted accordingly,=0F" the Commission said.

The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would=20
affect its authority to review license-transfer requests under section 310(=
d)=20
of the Act.  If it makes such changes to the cap, it wants to know whether =
it=20
could or should =0F"incorporate other methods=0F" into its license-transfer=
 review=20
to prevent consolidations =0F"that would eliminate the benefits brought by=
=20
competition.=0F"

It also seeks comments on whether removing the cap would place more of a=20
burden on the FCC and industry in the review of license transfers.

If the Commission decides to keep the spectrum cap for now, it wants to kno=
w=20
what further market developments could make the cap unnecessary and whether=
=20
it should set a =0F"sunset=0F" date for the restrictions.

Regarding the cellular cross-interest rule, the FCC asked whether the=20
restriction was still necessary to prevent cellular carriers from merging i=
n=20
markets where there is little or no other competition.

Verizon Wants Law Changing Approach to Broadband Regs

The =0F"time is ripe=0F" for legislation creating a new regulatory regime f=
or=20
broadband services and networks, similar to the regime that governs the=20
wireless industry, according to Verizon Communications, Inc.  Such an=20
approach would entail =0F"no economic regulation and minimal rules,=0F" and=
 states=20
would be preempted from regulating broadband services.

Meeting with reporters in Washington Jan. 25, Verizon executives said recen=
t=20
court decisions had made it more important for Congress to develop a new=20
regime for such services.

Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon senior vice president-federal government relations=
,=20
said representatives of incumbent telephone companies, cable TV providers,=
=20
and telecom equipment providers had discussed with each other the need for=
=20
new broadband legislation.

=0F"There has been no organized effort=0F" by the industry segments to coor=
dinate=20
lobbying efforts, Mr. Tauke said.  =0F"But it=0F's fair to say there=0F's b=
een a lot=20
of discussion among the players.=0F"

Recent court decisions on the appropriate regulatory regime for cable modem=
=20
services (TR, April 17, May 22, and June 26, 2000) have troubled the cable =
TV=20
industry by suggesting that they could be considered telecom services, Mr.=
=20
Tauke said.

He also cited the recent federal appeals court decision overturning the FCC=
=0F's=20
regime for advanced services affiliates (TR, Jan. 15).  The court rejected=
=20
the FCC=0F's finding that incumbent local exchange carriers could avoid=20
unbundling and resale mandates for their digital subscriber line offerings =
if=20
they provided those services through a separate affiliate.

=0F"This court case really highlighted the point that the FCC doesn=0F't ha=
ve the=20
ability to come up with, on its own, a new regulatory structure covering=20
broadband services,=0F" Mr. Tauke said.

Mr. Tauke said the Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act drafted last year b=
y=20
Reps. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.) and John Dingell (D., Mich.) would have=
=20
provided a =0F"little bit=0F" of the regulatory reform sought by Verizon.  =
But Mr.=20
Tauke said he hoped lawmakers would =0F"look at it in somewhat broader term=
s=0F"=20
this time around.

Mr. Tauke suggested that this type of broadband legislation had become=20
Verizon=0F's top priority and that its push for legislation to allow Bells =
to=20
offer interLATA (local access and transport area) data services was becomin=
g=20
less so.

Asked if interLATA data relief was still the most important legislative iss=
ue=20
to Verizon, Mr. Tauke said, =0F"It certainly would have been two years ago.=
  Is=20
that the most important thing now?  It=0F's certainly important. . .But of =
equal=20
importance, if not more importance, is getting some clarity on the broadban=
d=20
world.=0F"

Verizon still is pushing for legislation to change the existing reciprocal=
=20
compensation regime.  Edward D. Young III, SVP-federal government relations=
,=20
said payments to compensate competitive local exchange carriers for=20
terminating calls to Internet service providers ran Verizon about $1 billio=
n=20
a year.

Although the FCC has been promising to act on the reciprocal compensation=
=20
issue, Congress may need to step in, Mr. Young said.  =0F"The FCC is still=
=20
trying to work through the issue, but obviously it=0F's a different dynamic=
=0F"=20
given the change in chairmen from William E. Kennard to Michael K. Powell, =
he=20
added.

Mr. Tauke said it was =0F"shameful=0F" that the FCC hadn=0F't resolved the =
issue.  =0F"
Two years ago they knew there was a problem, but they didn=0F't have the co=
urage=20
to preempt the states,=0F" he said.  =0F"They could see the problems coming=

they thought it would work itself out.=0F"

Joan H. Smith, chairwoman of the National Association of Regulatory Utility=

Utah Bill Would Halt Plan To Merge Consumer Agencies

Legislators in Utah have passed a measure to repeal a year-old law that wou=
ld=20
have folded together two state agencies that represent utility customer=20
interests before the Public Service Commission.  Absent the repeal measure,=
=20
the legislation passed in 2000 would have combined the Committee of Consume=
r=20
Services and the Division of Public Utilities, effective July 1.  The new=
=20
entity would have been called the Office of Public Advocate.

House Majority Whip David Ure (R.), who sponsored last year=0F's restructur=
ing=20
legislation, also was behind the bill to repeal it.  The legislative staff=
=20
said he=0F'd decided that the time wasn=0F't right to overhaul the state=0F=
's utility=20
regulatory system.  The repeal measure sped through the Utah Legislature la=
st=20
week, progressing from its first House reading through passage by both hous=
es=20
in just two days.

Rep. Ure rejected alternative proposals for re-structuring the state=0F's=
=20
regulatory agencies, settling for a straight repeal of last year=0F's=20
legislation.  One proposal would have expanded the PSC=0F's membership, the=
=20
legislative staff told TR.

Another version that circulated between the end of last year=0F's legislati=
ve=20
session and the beginning of this year=0F's would have merged the PSC and t=
he=20
Division of Public Utilities. =20

The staff said Rep. Ure pulled those drafts after deciding that the state=
=0F's=20
regulatory structure shouldn=0F't be altered in the midst of the current en=
ergy=20
crisis.

The Division of Public Utilities is charged with representing the public=20
interest before the PSC and ensuring that all utility customers have access=
=20
to safe, reliable service at reasonable prices.  The Committee of Consumer=
=20
Services represents residential, small- business, and agricultural consumer=
s=20
before the PSC.  Some parties had expressed concern that merging the two=20
entities would decrease the amount of information available for PSC decisio=
n=20
making.

Consumer group opposition last year persuaded Gov. Michael O. Leavitt (R.) =
to=20
call for a review of the law after the legislative session ended in March. =
=20
He allowed the bill to become law last year without signing it.

Reps. Cannon, Eshoo Unveil Internet Privacy Measure

Reps. Chris Cannon (R., Utah) and Anna G. Eshoo (D., Calif.) have introduce=
d=20
a bill to require operators of commercial Web sites that collect personally=
=20
identifiable information to explain to site visitors what information is=20
collected, how it will be used, and who is collecting it.  The proposed=20
Consumer Internet Privacy Act (HR 237) would authorize the Federal Trade=20
Commission to assess civil penalties of up to $22,000 per violation, or a=
=20
total of $500,000 against a particular violator.

Rep. Cannon said the bill was a good starting point for addressing Internet=
=20
privacy, a topic that many observers see as the top Internet-related issue =
in=20
the 107th Congress.

=0F"We are going to rely heavily on the marketplace to help define how to=

market has commendably worked with government officials to develop other=20
standards and seals for privacy,=0F" Rep. Cannon said.

Rep. Eshoo, who said consumers shouldn=0F't have to =0F"reveal their life s=

The measure also would require Web site operators to give users an=20

Appeals Court Says FCC Erred in Rejecting U S WEST Bid for =0F`Nondominant=
=0F'=20
Regulation

A federal appeals court agrees with former U S WEST Communications, Inc. (n=
ow=20
Qwest Corp.) that the FCC erred by focusing on the company=0F's market shar=
e=20
when considering its request to be freed from =0F"dominant=0F"-carrier regu=
lation=20
of certain services.

The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington last week remanded to the FCC a 199=
9=20
order rejecting a U S WEST request to forbear from applying such regulation=
=20
to the company=0F's special-access and high-capacity dedicated transport=20
offerings in the Phoenix and Seattle metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).=
 =20
In the 1999 order, the FCC said U S WEST could refile its request for relie=
f=20
under a separate deregulatory regime it had set up to allow incumbent telco=
s=20
to seek pricing flexibility for some services (TR, Nov. 29, 1999).

Chief Judge Harry Edwards wrote the Jan. 23 decision in AT&T Corp. v.=20
FCC(consolidated cases beginning at 99-1535).  He was joined by Judges Davi=
d=20
Sentelle and A. Raymond Randolph. =20

The court found that the FCC failed to conduct its review of U S WEST=0F's=
=20
request in compliance with section 10 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996=
,=20
which directs the FCC to forbear from applying regulations deemed no longer=
=20
necessary.

The court explained that the FCC=0F's order =0F"rests solely on the view th=
at,=20
because U S WEST offered no reliable data on market share, the petition for=
=20
forbearance failed to make a prima facie showing that sufficient competitio=
n=20
existed to satisfy section 10.=0F"

But in relying so heavily on market-share data, the FCC =0F"departed from i=
ts=20
traditional nondominance analysis without explanation,=0F" the court said. =
 The=20
FCC=0F's decision to rely on that data =0F"may well be reasonable, but unti=
l the=20
Commission has adequately explained the basis for this conclusion, it has n=
ot=20
discharged its statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act,=
=0F"=20
the court said.

In the past, the FCC had =0F"gone so far as to view market share as irrelev=
ant=20
where there was other evidence that a carrier lacked market power,=0F" the =
court=20
said.

=0F"Were this the first time the FCC was asked to consider whether a carrie=
r was=20
dominant in a given market, the explanation provided by the Commission in t=
he=20
forbearance order may well have been accurate,=0F" it said.  =0F"But it is =
not the=20
first time that the Commission has addressed this issue.=0F"

The court said it might be =0F"reasonable=0F" for the FCC to demand a showi=
ng on=20
market share in every inquiry on dominant regulation.  But it is =0F"not=20
reasonable for the Commission to announce such a policy without providing a=
=20
satisfactory explanation for embarking on this course when it has not=20
followed such a policy in the past,=0F" it said.

Court Nixes IXCs=0F' Claims

As was apparent during oral arguments (TR, Dec. 4, 2000), the court was=20
unconvinced by the arguments of AT&T and WorldCom, Inc., which had challeng=
ed=20
the order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for so=
me=20
services.

In the forbearance order, the FCC stated that it granted the relief request=

=0F"to the extent that the pricing flexibility order establishes a framewor=
k=20
pursuant to which [Bell operating company] petitioners may obtain relief by=
=20
demonstrating satisfaction of the competitive triggers adopted in that orde=
r.=0F"

The court rejected the AT&T and WorldCom petitions to overturn the pricing=
=20
flexibility =0F"relief,=0F" saying their argument =0F"borders on being disi=
ngenuous.=0F"

=0F"When the forbearance order is read in its entirety, it is absolutely cl=
ear=20
that U S WEST was granted no relief whatsoever,=0F" the court said.  =0F"U =

=0F"
reminded=0F" U S WEST that it was eligible to apply for pricing flexibility=

The court added, however, that the FCC couldn=0F't use its pricing flexibil=

=0F"Congress has established section 10 as a viable and independent means o=

FCC Gives Bells =0F`Blueprint=0F' In OK of SWBT=0F's InterLATA Bid

The FCC=0F's authorization for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. to offer=20
interLATA (local access and transport area) services in Kansas and Oklahoma=
=20
could offer insights to other Bell companies planning their own interLATA=
=20
service bids=0F-especially for rural states.  In granting SWBT=0F's applica=
tion,=20
the FCC marked some clear guideposts it will use for evaluating future bids=
,=20
including issues relating to late-filed data and other procedural matters.

In an order adopted unanimously Jan. 19 and released Jan. 22 in Common=20
Carrier docket 00-217, the FCC doubled the number of states in which Bell=
=20
companies are permitted to provide in-region interLATA services.  In an=20
unprecedented move, the FCC delayed the effectiveness of its decision for 4=
3=20
days.

Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC must=20
determine that a Bell company has met a 14-point =0F"checklist=0F" of=20
market-opening mandates in a given state before authorizing it to provide=
=20
interLATA services there.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department of=
=20
Justice and the relevant state commission before granting such an applicati=
on.

The FCC said it imposed the 43-day delay because it had based its approval,=
=20
in part, on UNE (unbundled network element) rates that SWBT changed after=
=20
submitting its application.  Competitors had argued that the new rates=20
shouldn=0F't be considered when evaluating SWBT=0F's application.  At the t=
ime, the=20
FCC said it wasn=0F't sure =0F"what reliance, if any,=0F" it would place on=
 the new=20
rates.

In a Jan. 19 statement, then-FCC Chairman William E. Kennard said the=20
original rates were =0F"not acceptable=0F" and praised SWBT for voluntarily=
=20
reducing them.  But it may not be so easy in the future for Bell companies =
to=20
amend their interLATA service applications.  In last week=0F's order, the F=
CC=20
said =0F"it would be rare for other parties to meet the high bar [for accep=
ting=20
the late-filed rates] set here in other applications.=0F"

Then-Commissioner Michael K. Powell objected to the 43-day delay and=20
cautioned that Bell companies =0F"risk rejection if they file evidence afte=
r the=20
due date for initial comments.=0F"  Mr. Kennard said the FCC =0F"must ensur=
e that a=20
pattern of last-minute rate reductions or other changes in [section] 271=20
applications does not develop in the future.=0F"

In justifying the inclusion of the new rates in its consideration of SWBT=
=0F's=20
application, the FCC cited its authority to waive its own procedural rules =
in=20
cases where doing so will serve the public interest.  It said that =0F"a nu=
mber=20
of circumstances=0F" supported its waiver of the =0F"complete-as-filed=0F" =
doctrine,=20
including the fact that the rate changes =0F"were limited in nature.=0F"

The FCC indicated it wouldn=0F't accept certain other types of data filed a=
fter=20
Bell companies submit interLATA service applications, such as =0F"more comp=
lex=20
rate revisions.=0F"  It also indicated that it wouldn=0F't consider late-fi=
led =0F"
measures designed to achieve nondiscriminatory performance in the applicant=
=0F's=20
provision of service to competitive [local exchange carriers], since it is=
=20
difficult to determine the actual effect of such changes on performance in=
=20
advance.=0F"

The FCC=0F's Kansas-Oklahoma order also offers guidance for regulators in o=
ther=20
rural states.  It encourages rural states to =0F"pool their resources=0F" a=
nd=20
conduct multistate reviews of Bell companies=0F' compliance with the sectio=
n 271=20
checklist, when appropriate.  It said the =0F"general approach=0F" of the K=
ansas=20
and Oklahoma commissions could be =0F"used as a model=0F" for future applic=
ations.

Financial analysts last week saw the FCC=0F's approval as a boon for Bells =
in=20
other states, particularly rural ones.  =0F"While these markets are relativ=
ely=20
small, Oklahoma at $220 million and Kansas at $170 million, their approval=
=20
signals a positive trend for future approval, particularly with the=20
appointment of Michael Powell as the new FCC chairman,=0F" said USB Warburg=
 LLC.

The FCC=0F's action represents the first successful multistate application=
=0F-and=20
the first time a single Bell company has gained FCC approval in more than o=
ne=20
state in its service territory.  SBC last summer gained FCC approval to off=
er=20
interLATA services in Texas (TR, July 3, 2000).

Evidence from Other States Accepted

The FCC also offered clues about how it would view future applications that=
=20
rely on a Bell company=0F's performance in one state to show its compliance=
 with=20
the section 271 mandates in another state.  There were no independent=20
third-party tests of SWBT=0F's operation support systems (OSSs) in Kansas a=
nd=20
Oklahoma, but the company did provide third-party verification that those=
=20
systems were the same as the OSSs used in Texas.

The FCC said that such an approach was appropriate, given that the Texas=20
proceeding served as =0F"a precursor and a model=0F" for the proceedings in=
 Kansas=20
and Oklahoma.

The FCC also was clear about the types of issues it would recognize in=20
opponents=0F' filings on future interLATA applications.  It noted that the=
=20
statutory 90-day review period was designed as a =0F"fast-track, narrowly=
=20
focused adjudication=0F" process.  It said that such proceedings are =0F"
inappropriate forums for the consideration of industry-wide local competiti=
on=20
questions of general applicability.=0F"

If SWBT fails to continue to comply with any of the requirements under=20
section 271, the FCC can hold the telco liable for up to $45 million annual=
ly=20
in Kansas and $44 million annually in Oklahoma.  SWBT must meet a series of=
=20
anti-=0F"backsliding=0F" and performance-measurement requirements or it cou=
ld face=20
fines or other legal action, the FCC said.

International Service OKs Granted

The Telecommunications Division of the FCC=0F's International Bureau last w=
eek=20
also granted SWBT authorization under section 214 of the Communications Act=
=20
of 1934, as amended, to provide international services for calls originatin=
g=20
in Kansas and Oklahoma.  In file ITC-214-20001130-00713, the division said=
=20
SWBT=0F's long-distance subsidiary, Southwestern Bell Long Distance, would =
be=20
subject to =0F"international dominant carrier regulation=0F" on three route=

SWBT has an affiliation with the foreign-market carriers.

The three routes are those between the U.S. and Belgium, Denmark, and South=

FCC Rethinks Limitations On Carriers=0F' Use of EELs

As it promised to do last year, the FCC has begun reexamining its policy=20
limiting how requesting carriers can use enhanced extended links (EELs)=0F-
combinations of unbundled loops and transport purchased from incumbent loca=
l=20
exchange carriers.  The FCC previously ruled that requesting carriers can=
=0F't=20
use EELs to provide exchange access services exclusively.

The FCC had imposed that prohibition in response to incumbent local exchang=
e=20
carriers=0F' fears that competitors could use EELS to avoid paying special=
=20
access charges (TR, Sept. 20, 1999).  The Commission later extended the=20
prohibition and promised to revisit the issue early this year (TR, June 12,=
=20
2000).

In a Jan. 24 public notice seeking comments on the issue (Common Carrier=20
docket 96-98), the FCC asked if the exchange access and local exchange=20
markets were =0F"so interrelated from an economic and technological perspec=
tive=20
that a finding that a network element meets the =0F`impair=0F' standard und=
er=20
section 251(d)(2) of the [Telecommunications Act of 1996] for the local=20
exchange market would itself entitle competitors to use that network elemen=
t=20
solely or primarily in the exchange access market.=0F"

The =0F"impair=0F" standard requires the FCC to evaluate whether the failur=
e to=20
unbundle each network element would impair competitors=0F' ability to provi=
de=20
service.

The FCC asked whether the local exchange and exchange access markets are =
=0F"
economically and technically distinct.=0F"  If the markets are distinct, do=
es=20
lack of access to loop-transport combinations impair requesting carriers=0F=
'=20
ability to provide special access services? the FCC asked.

It asked about the availability of =0F"alternative elements=0F" aside from =
those=20
offered by the incumbents.  It asked whether it should treat special access=
=20
and private line services as a single market.

The FCC also sought comment on the nature of the special access and private=
=20
line markets for business and residential end-users.  =0F"In some markets,=
=20
particularly those markets serving high-volume business customers, it may b=
e=20
practical and economical for carriers to compete using self-provisioned=20
facilities,=0F" the FCC said.  But in residential and small-business market=
s =0F"
the delay and cost associated with self-provisioning will preclude carriers=
=20
from serving that market without access to unbundled network elements.=0F"

The FCC also asked whether requesting carriers should be permitted to combi=
ne=20
unbundled network elements with tariffed access services purchased from=20
incumbents.  That kind of commingling is now prohibited by FCC rules.

=0F"Specifically, if a requesting carrier converts special access circuits =
to=20
combinations of unbundled network elements, we ask parties to comment on=20
whether such circuits may remain connected to any existing access service=
=20
circuits without regard to the nature of the traffic carried over the acces=
s=20
circuits,=0F" it said.

Comments on the public notice are due 30 days after its publication in the=

Federal Register; replies are due 45 days after publication.

Pole Attachment, TELRIC Rates To Be Challenged in High Court

Supreme Court Again Refuses To Hear State Immunity Cases

The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to review an appeals court ruling that=
=20
denied state regulators=0F' claims of immunity from federal lawsuits regard=
ing=20
carrier interconnection.  The interconnection provisions are included in th=
e=20
Telecommunications Act of 1996.

The 11th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants states immunity from=20
federal lawsuits, but a 1908 Supreme Court decision, Ex parte Young,created=
=20
an exception for lawsuits seeking to prevent an ongoing violation of federa=
l=20
law by state officials.

The high court=0F's action last week left in place a ruling by the U.S. Cou=
rt of=20
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago) that the Ex parte Young exception=
=20
applies to lawsuits involving carrier interconnection proceedings.

This isn=0F't the first time the Supreme Court has refused to take on such =

case.  But it is the first time it=0F's been confronted by state immunity c=
laims=20
extending not just to arbitration and approval of carrier interconnection=
=20
agreements but also to (1)enforcement of such pacts and (2)review of =0F"
statements of generally available terms=0F" (SGATs), according to a Wiscons=
in=20
Public Service Commission official.

In the case the Supreme Court rejected last week, the Wisconsin PSC and the=
=20
Illinois Commerce Commission separately had sought review of a decision by=
=20
the Seventh Circuit (TR, July 31, 2000).  The circuit court had ruled that=
=20
the commissions=0F' actions regarding interconnection agreements, SGATs, an=

Last fall the Supreme Court refused to hear a case that arose in the Sixth=
=20
Circuit and involved the Michigan Public Service Commission (TR, Oct. 9,=20
2000).  The Michigan case didn=0F't cover an SGAT review or enforcement of =
an=20
interconnection agreement.

In addition to the Sixth and Seventh circuits, the 10th and=0F-most recentl=

Fifth circuits have ruled against state immunity claims in interconnection=

The FCC recently stepped in to preempt the Virginia Corporation Commission=

Lucent last week announced that it would cut costs by more than $2 billion=

Focus Turns To Global Incumbents

Henry B. Schacht, Lucent=0F's chairman and chief executive officer, told=20
investors last week that the company=0F's seven-point =0F"transition=0F" pl=

the redeployment of resources toward incumbent and international service=20
providers and the adoption of a more =0F"targeted approach=0F" to the troub=

competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) market (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).

This new approach exposes Lucent to less risk, =0F"at least from a credit p=

of view,=0F" according to one Wall Street analyst.  The analyst, who reques=

anonymity to avoid conflict with clients, said Mr. Schacht=0F's targeted=20
approach to CLECs will decrease Lucent=0F's chances of getting stuck with u=

By focusing on incumbent and international carriers, Lucent will lessen its=
=20
reliance on =0F"aggressive vendor financing,=0F" the analyst said.  Incumbe=

On the other hand, Lucent=0F's decreased activity in the manufacturing sect=

said.  Lucent will have most of its =0F"eggs in one basket,=0F" the analyst=

Lucent immediately began laying off workers following its Jan. 24=20
restructuring announcement.  It unveiled a workforce reduction of 16,000=20
employees, which includes what it described as a =0F"transfer=0F" of 6,000 =

outside contractors upon the sale of its Columbus, Ohio, and Oklahoma City=

facilities.

A Lucent source has told TR, however, that the company is targeting as many=

as 20,000 positions for elimination this year.  The 6,000 employees in=20
Oklahoma and Ohio should be included in the workforce reduction estimate, t=

Lucent will lose another 16,500 workers when the microelectronics group is=

Although the company likely will terminate more workers than it=0F's willin=

Court Says WorldCom Tariff Trumps Service Pact with ICOM

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York) has affirmed a=

the claim was barred by the =0F"filed-rate=0F" doctrine and preempted by th=

federal Communications Act of 1934.

Under the filed-rate doctrine, a carrier=0F's tariffed rates take precedenc=

ICOM filed a lawsuit in 1999 alleging that WorldCom had missed a contractua=

WorldCom specified damages WorldCom must pay in the event of a breach of=20
contract.

In an opinion written by Judge Robert D. Sack and joined by Judges Sonia=20
Sotomayor and Robert A. Katzmann, the appeals court panel found that the=20

As part of the arrangement, Telefonica has agreed to increase its ownership=

Brazil, France Face Setback In Awarding Wireless Licenses

Telecom regulators in Brazil and France are facing setbacks in their attemp=
ts=20
to award licenses for wireless services.  Brazilian officials are seeking t=

overturn a court challenge, while prospective licensees in France have=20
dropped out of the running.

In Brazil, telecom regulator Anatel has postponed its scheduled Jan. 30=20
auction of three wireless licenses in the wake of a court injunction blocki=

the sale.

Anatel said it would reschedule the auction for Feb. 5 or 6 if it could=20
persuade a court on Jan. 29 to overturn the injunction, which a Sao Paulo=
=20
court issued last week.  That court said the rules governing the bidding=20
process were illegal.  Anatel has scheduled additional auction rounds to se=
ll=20
three licenses each for Feb. 20 and March 13.

In France, regulators=0F' plans to award four licenses for third-generation=
 (3G)=20
services ran into trouble when at least two prospective bidders, French=20
utility Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux and Telefonica SA of Spain, dropped out. =
=20
There was growing speculation that French wireless carrier Bouygues Telecom=
=20
also would withdraw.  Bids are due Jan. 31.

Also last week, Denmark awarded second-generation wireless licenses to=20
Mobilix A/S and Telia A/S.  The National Telecom Agency had received=20
applications from four bidders for the 900 megahertz (MHz) band licenses,=

which were issued in a comparative process known as a beauty contest.

Included in the binding terms of the licenses are the prices and products t=

Wireless Industry Seeks Changes In Antenna-Collocation Agreement

Two wireless industry trade groups are seeking changes in a draft agreement=
=20
designed to streamline the review of antenna collocations on historic sites=
. =20
The industry groups say the changes are needed to ensure that the pact=20
accomplishes its goal.  But a historic preservation group says the agreemen=
t=20
would result in harm to historic properties.

The agreement was drafted, pursuant to the National Historic Preservation A=
ct=20
(NHPA), by the FCC, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), a=
nd=20
a telecommunications working group that includes state historic preservatio=
n=20
officers, federal officials, and wireless industry representatives (TR, Nov=
.=20
27, 2000).  The FCC said it expected to take action on a final agreement on=
=20
or about Jan. 29.

The pact restricts the conditions under which state or tribal historic=20
preservation officers would review antennas for their potential effect on=
=20
historic properties or sites.  Wireless industry officials say they hope 75=
%=20
to 85% of new antenna applications would be freed from the review process.

CTIA Attacks Agreement

As drafted, the agreement =0F"does not streamline the regulatory process fo=

CTIA noted that under current FCC rules, licensees are responsible for=20
determining whether an antenna would affect a historic property.  =0F"Howev=

=0F"Such a provision undermines the FCC=0F's efforts to streamline the coll=

CTIA argued.

In addition, the trade group said the FCC should ensure that future=20

In its comments, the Personal Communications Industry Associationsaid that=

PCIA said the draft agreement on which the FCC sought comments =0F"preserve=

Among the amendments PCIA suggested were changing the effective date of the=

Carriers, Others See Problems In FCC=0F's ID-Number Proposal=20

Carriers and broadcasters gave a lukewarm reception to the FCC=0F's plan to=
=20
require each regulated entity to use a unique identifying number on certain=
=20
filings.  Many carriers and others said the planned system was duplicative =
of=20
existing registration programs and suggested ways to simplify the FCC=0F's=
=20
process for tracking regulatory filings.

The FCC had proposed making mandatory a previously voluntary system under=
=20
which anyone doing business with the agency would use a 10-digit FCC=20
registration number (FRN) obtained from the Commission Registration System.=
 =20
In a notice of proposed rulemaking released in Managing Director docket=20
00-205 last December, the FCC suggested that the FRN be required on all=20
regulatory fee payments, waiver petitions, auction payments, and other=20
filings and submissions (TR, Dec. 4, 2000).  Parties would be responsible f=
or=20
maintaining the accuracy of the information in the Commission Registration=
=20
System database.

In comments filed on the proposal last week, many carriers said they=20
supported the FCC=0F's goal of efficiently tracking filings and fees but=20
disagreed with just how the plan should be implemented.

Parties already use a taxpayer identification number (TIN) on many of their=
=20
FCC filings, including those on which the Commission has suggested using th=
e=20
FRN, Verizon Wireless said.  =0F"The need for another =0F`unique identifyin=
g=20
number=0F' is unclear,=0F" it said.

The confidentiality of TINs is important, Verizon said, =0F"but this factor=
 does=20
not appear crucial since, as the Commission says, the information in [the=
=20
Commission Registration System] is for Commission use only and will not be=
=20
published or distributed.=0F"

Cingular Wireless LLC suggested instead that the FCC do away with its use o=
f=20
TINs when it institutes the mandatory FRN system.  It said that financial a=
nd=20
personal information can be revealed and =0F"a person=0F's =0F`identity=0F'=
 can be =0F`
stolen=0F' if his or her TIN=0F" is obtained.  It also criticized the FCC f=
or the=20
lax security it gave parties=0F' TINs.  =0F"Inadvertently filed copies cont=
aining=20
TIN information have been discovered in the Commission=0F's public referenc=
e=20
room on more than one occasion,=0F" Cingular said. =20

It recommended that the FCC assign FRNs only to parties that request one,=
=20
rather than having the Commission assign FRNs as it issues bills or other=
=20
notifications.  The latter approach could =0F"result in duplicative FRNs by=
=20
large business entities who control numerous applicants and licensees,=0F" =
it=20
added.

The Walt Disney Co. had similar reservations about how the FRNs would be=20
assigned.  It said that under the voluntary FRN system, when a parent compa=
ny=20
made a joint filing that included regulatory fees for more than one=20
subsidiary, only the FRN of the parent company was associated with the=20
payments and the FRNs of the subsidiaries appeared to be unused by the syst=
em.

This can lead to the misperception that the subsidiaries still owe the fees=
,=20
Disney said.  =0F"The Commission=0F's filing systems should be able to prop=
erly=20
credit payments made on behalf of a licensee that is a subsidiary of anothe=
r=20
entity, regardless of the source of payment,=0F" it added.

Qwest Communications International, Inc., criticized the =0F"unforgiving ma=
nner=20
in which the Commission proposes to implement its FRN proposal.=0F"  The FC=
C had=20
suggested that it would reject filings that fail to include an FRN where on=

is required, which could result in the filing=0F's dismissal or the FCC=0F'=

Qwest said such an approach was =0F"overly harsh=0F" and suggested that the=
 FCC =0F"
modify its proposed rules to allow filing parties a minimal period of time=
=20
(e.g., five calendar days) to correct a filing or application that lacks an=
=20
FRN.=0F"=20

The National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., said that it submits filin=
gs=20
on behalf of more than 1,200 carriers and that it was concerned about the F=
CC=20
suggesting that one entity could obtain multiple FRNs.  =0F"The Commission=
=20
should make clear that, as authorized filing agent for its various=20

If the FCC allows single entities to obtain multiple FRNs =0F"it should, at=
 a=20

Building Owners, Carriers Spar over FCC Proposal To Block Service, Extend B=
an=20
on Exclusive Pacts

As the FCC considers another slate of proposals designed to help carriers=
=20
obtain access to multitenant structures, building owners and competitive=20
telecom service providers are escalating the battle they=0F've been fightin=
g for=20
the last several years.

The issue this time around is whether the FCC should take steps specificall=
y=20
targeting multitenant residential buildings.  The agency previously has=20
limited the scope of its actions to commercial buildings.

The FCC recently adopted rules in Wireless Telecommunications docket 99-217=
=20
designed to help competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) obtain access =
to=20
multitenant structures.  Among other things, the Commission barred exclusiv=
e=20
contracts between telecom service providers and owners of multitenant=20
commercial buildings (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).

When it adopted those rules, the FCC suggested that it would need to take=
=20
more steps.  It issued a further notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) askin=
g=20
whether it should (1) extend its ban on exclusive contracts to apply to=20
multitenant residential buildings and (2) bar incumbent local exchange=20
carriers (ILECs) from serving buildings where the owner prevents CLEC acces=
s.

In its comments filed last week, the Real Access Alliance, which represents=
=20
building owners, said the FCC already had concluded that it lacked authorit=
y=20
to =0F"regulate the real estate industry.=0F"

But in the further NPRM, the FCC asks whether it can =0F"achieve the same g=
oal=20
through the draconian measure of ordering telecommunications providers to c=
ut=20
off service in buildings whose owners do not comply with the Commission=0F'=
s=20
wishes,=0F" it said.

=0F"Whether the Commission regulates building owners directly=0F-as propose=
d in the=20
original notice of proposed rulemaking in this docket=0F-or indirectly, as=
=20
proposed in the [further notice], makes no difference because the FCC lacks=
=20

=0F"Agreements for building access are agreements for the use of real estat=

said.

Enforcement of =0F`Best Practices=0F' Questioned

The Smart Buildings Policy Project, which represents telecom carriers and=
=20
equipment manufacturers that support building-access policies, said buildin=
g=20
owners continue to delay the entry of competitive telecom carriers.  It=20
advised the FCC not to rely on the model agreements and =0F"best practices=
=0F"=20
promoted by building owners.

=0F"Reasonable access terms and conditions are meaningless if access can be=
=20
denied entirely, or if access can be delayed for months or years,=0F" the=
=20
project said.  =0F"These model terms and conditions are entirely unenforcea=
ble=20
without a Commission requirement for granting access.=0F"

The group said it was particularly concerned about the =0F"increasing=20
phenomenon=0F" of building owners making direct investments in building-foc=
used=20
CLECs (BLECs).  =0F"The resulting symbiotic financial relationship motivate=
s the=20

building,=0F" it said.  The FCC should =0F"directly prohibit=0F" building o=
wners from =0F"
unreasonably discriminating among facilities-based carriers,=0F" it said.

AT&T Corp. called for a nondiscriminatory access rule allowing a CLEC to =

prohibiting a LEC from providing telecommunications services=0F" to any bui=
lding=20
that refuses to allow =0F"reasonable, nondiscriminatory access to competing=

The FCC has the authority under sections 201 and 205 of the Communications=
=20
Act of 1934 to stop LECs from serving buildings whose owners engage in=20
discriminatory practices, AT&T said.  =0F"The fact that such regulations ha=

In joint comments, Carolina BroadBand, Inc., RCN Telecom Services, Inc., an=

Utilicom Networks LLC complained that the =0F"entrenched incumbent local=20

They noted that the FCC=0F's further rulemaking notice had said the record =

BLEC Sees Residential, Commercial Differences

BLEC CoServ LLC said the FCC=0F's =0F"reservation about extending the ban o=

therefore, have a =0F"greater degree of flexibility in mitigating (or simpl=

Cypress Communications, Inc., an Atlanta-based BLEC, said the FCC should ba=
r=20
ILECs from signing discriminatory access arrangements with building owners.=
  =0F"
Such a rule is necessary because ILECs have market power and, therefore,=20
possess an advantage over CLECs,=0F" it said.

A nondiscrimination requirement applied to CLECs is =0F"unnecessary,=0F" Cy=
press=20
said, because they =0F"lack market power, and building owners do not have a=
n=20

The FCC shouldn=0F't keep LECs from serving multi-tenant buildings whose ow=

that it affects the very health, safety, and livelihood of innocent LEC=20
customers,=0F" BellSouth said.

Verizon Communications, Inc.=0F's telephone companies asked the FCC to bar =
all=20

SBC Communications, Inc.=0F's telcos also backed extending the ban on exclu=

The Independent Cable & Telecommunications Association said =0F"limited-ter=

The FCC said Alaska Communications Systems, Inc. (d/b/a ATU=20

Thirty-five of the 87 bidders that originally qualified for the reauction=
=20
were still eligible to bid in the final round.  Of those 35 bidders, 32=20
qualified as entrepreneurs in the sale, which began Dec. 12, 2000.  The $16=

billion raised was a record for the FCC in a single auction.  The amount=20
reflects bidding credits allotted to small businesses.  The previous record=
=20
was the $9.2 billion netted in a C block auction (TR, May 13, 1996).

DE Rules under Fire

The FCC=0F's set-aside rules for small businesses, also known as =0F"design=
ated=20
entities=0F" (DEs), have drawn controversy since before the reauction began=
 and=20
are expected to remain a contentious issue.

The day before the sale began, one DE, Allegheny Communications, Inc., aske=
d=20
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington to block the reauction, saying the=
=20
FCC had failed to review the ownership of bidders classified as DEs to ensu=
re=20
they were qualified entrepreneurs (TR, Dec. 18, 2000).

Allegheny, which qualified as a very small business, cited AT&T Wireless=0F=
'=20
interest in Alaska Native Wireless and Cingular Wireless=0F' stake in Salmo=
n=20
PCS.  It said that the rules allowed large corporations to bid through =0F"=
shell=20
entities=0F" for licenses reserved for entrepreneurs.  Of the 422 licenses =
on=20
the block in the reauction, 170 were reserved for qualified DEs, while 252=
=20
were open to all bidders.  The 422 licenses covered 195 markets.=20

The appeals court denied Allegheny=0F's request.  Allegheny ended up droppi=
ng=20
out of the reauction during the bidding.

The FCC defended its DE rules, saying they enable small businesses to raise=
=20
enough capital to participate in spectrum auctions while ensuring they are=
=20
controlled by entrepreneurs.  It conducts ownership analyses of winning=20
auction bidders before granting licenses it said.

Last week an attorney for Allegheny said it planned to challenge the=20
reauction results, at least at the FCC.  =0F"We don=0F't think there=0F's a=

sham bidders have hurt true entrepreneurs,=0F" attorney Dana Frix told TR. =

DEs and the big players they partnered with defended their auction alliance=

=0F"From our perspective, we have complied in every respect with these rule=

Ritch Blasi, a spokesman for AT&T Wireless, said his company believed it wa=

$2.6 billion toward the $2.8 billion purchase price of the licenses,=20
according to a news release.

In the release, Rosemarie Maher, president and CEO of Doyon Ltd., another=

Officials at Leap Wireless International, Inc., another DE that had=20
criticized the alliances with large carriers, said they wanted to focus now=

on building out networks to use the licenses they won.  Leap won 22 license=
s=20
for $350 million, including those in Columbus, Ohio; Providence, R.I.; and=
=20
Houston and San Antonio.

=0F"Our goal now is to look at what we have and see how we can move forward=

Harvey P. White, Leap=0F's chairman and chief executive officer, told TR.

Some industry observers expect regulatory or legal challenges to the auctio=
n=20

d [the=20
challenges are] highly unlikely to be successful,=0F" said Rudy Baca, an an=
alyst=20
at The Precursor Group in Washington.

The other legal cloud hanging over the licenses involves NextWave=0F's chal=
lenge=20
of the cancellation of its licenses.  Oral arguments on its appeal in the=
=20
D.C. Circuit are scheduled for March 15.  The FCC has conditioned the award=
=20
of those licenses in the reauction on the outcome of NextWave=0F's court ca=
se.

The other licenses sold in the reauction were reclaimed from other bankrupt=
=20
carriers, returned, or unsold at previous auctions.

Analysts, Industry Assess Results

Meanwhile, industry analysts and officials were assessing the reauction=20
results.  Mr. Baca said the proceed totals were about what he expected,=20
adding that the winning bids =0F"are not out of line.=0F"  Most financial a=
nalysts=20
had forecast that the sale would bring in from $11 billion to $20 billion.

The bids were closely watched=0F-not only to see how much would be deposite=
d in=20
the U.S. Treasury but to see how the bids compared with the $4.7 billion=20
NextWave had pledged for its C block licenses in 1996.

Knox Bricken, an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston, said she was=20
surprised at the bids for the New York City licenses.  =0F"We didn=0F't exp=
ect=20
prices to be that high for those licenses,=0F" she said, adding Verizon Wir=
eless=20
would be hard-pressed to realize a positive return on its investment in tha=
t=20
market.

Jeffrey Nelson, a Verizon Wireless spokesman, declined to comment on the=20
auction results, citing the Commission=0F's anticollusion rules.  But David=
=20
Frail, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless=0F' parent, Verizon Communications,=
=20
Inc., said the parent would lend the wireless unit $8.8 billion to pay for=
=20
the licenses.

Verizon Wireless bid $2.0 billion for each New York City license.  Alaska=
=20
Native Wireless won its license there with a bid of $1.4 billion.

Ms. Bricken said the New York City bids rivaled the huge bids seen in last=
=20
year=0F's third-generation (3G) spectrum auctions in the United Kingdom and=
=20
Germany, which raised more than $80 billion (TR, May 1, 2000; and Aug. 21 a=
nd=20
28, 2000).

Before the reauction began, analysts had predicted that bidding would be mo=
re=20
controlled as a result of the common belief that bidders overpaid in those=
=20
foreign auctions.

Thomas E. Wheeler, president and CEO of the Cellular Telecommunications &=

Pa. ALJ Slams Verizon Plan To Avoid Full Structural Split

An administrative law judge has recommended that the Pennsylvania Public=20
Utility Commission develop its own plan for Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc., to=
=20
split up its wholesale and retail operations.  In his recommendation to the=
=20
PUC, the ALJ criticized Verizon=0F's =0F"alternative=0F" plan for not going=
 far enough=20
to separate the company=0F's business functions and for being too full of h=
oles=20
to implement.

In 1999 the PUC ordered the retail-wholesale split as part of a =0F"global=
=20
order=0F" settling a number of proceedings on issues ranging from reciproca=
l=20
compensation to universal service (TR, Aug. 30, 1999).  Also last year,=20
Verizon proposed a plan that would allow it to avoid a complete split of it=
s=20
company by separating the business functions but keeping the company=20
structurally intact (TR, July 3, 2000).

Administrative Law Judge Wayne L. Weismandel last week recommended giving=
=20
Verizon a year to create separately operating retail and wholesale=20
affiliates.  Under his recommendation, the two affiliates would be required=
=20
to maintain separate books, records, staffs, and officers.  The retail=20
affiliate would not be permitted to obtain financing =0F"that would permit =
a=20
creditor, upon default, to have recourse to the assets of the Verizon=20
Pennsylvania, Inc., wholesale affiliate.=0F"  Under the plan, the two affil=
iates=20
would be required to conduct transactions =0F"on an arm=0F's-length basis.=
=0F"

The ALJ said that Verizon=0F's alternative plan didn=0F't propose a true=20
wholesale-retail separation, but rather a =0F"line-of-business split. . .th=
at=20
does not mitigate the anti competitive dominant market power Verizon=20
currently exercises as a result of its base of legacy monopoly customers.=
=0F" =20
He also blasted the telco for not supplying cost analysis or data to suppor=
t=20
many of its conclusions.

=0F"Due to Verizon=0F's failure to comply with the commission=0F's orders i=
n this=20
proceeding, the commission is left with no choice but to direct structural=
=20
separation of specific elements as the commission deems appropriate,=0F"  A=
LJ=20
Weismandel said.

Competitors=0F' Plans Criticized, Too

Competitors, including AT&T Corp. and WorldCom Corp., had submitted their o=
wn=20
proposals on how the PUC should structure the split.  Although the ALJ said=
=20
he found aspects of the competitors=0F' proposals =0F"intriguing,=0F" he di=
dn=0F't have=20
kind words for them.  He said the competitors=0F' proposals weren=0F't bols=
tered by=20
cost studies or analyses either.

The judge identified several =0F"policy issues=0F" that the PUC must =0F"in=
vestigate=0F"=20
as it considers how to implement the Verizon split:  (1) how Verizon could=
=20
continue to serve as customers=0F' =0F"carrier of last resort=0F"; (2) whet=
her the=20
Verizon retail affiliate should be required to have =0F"significant=0F" ind=

minority stakeholders, as competitors had proposed; and (3) how to conduct=
=20
the =0F"migration=0F" of Verizon=0F's customers to its retail affiliate or =
to=20
competitors.

Carriers Back Simplified Transfers Of International Authorizations

Several carriers say they generally support the FCC=0F's proposals to strea=
mline=20
procedures governing pro forma assignments and transfers of international=
=20
service authorizations, although they also suggest further modifications of=
=20
the rules.

But one major provider is asking the FCC to continue requiring foreign=20
affiliates of carriers receiving such authorizations to settle traffic with=
=20
U.S. carriers at or below settlement rate =0F"benchmarks.=0F"

Parties offered their views in comments filed at the FCC last week in=20
response to an International docket 00-231 notice of proposed rulemaking (T=
R,=20
Dec. 4, 2000).

To ease the regulatory burden on international carriers, the FCC had propos=
ed=20
to make its procedures for international service authorizations granted und=
er=20
section 214 of the Communications Act more like those it uses for assignmen=
t=20
and transfer of control of commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) licenses.

The FCC also tentatively had concluded that it no longer needed to require=
=20
carriers to comply with its international settlement rate benchmarks as a=
=20
condition of granting them section 214 authorizations to provide=20
facilities-based international private line services.

It had proposed to stop requiring dominant international carriers to seek=
=20
prior agency approval before discontinuing service on a route, =0F"except w=
here=20
a carrier possesses market power for international service in the U.S.=0F"

In its comments on the FCC=0F's rulemaking proposal, WorldCom, Inc., said i=
t=20
supported streamlining and harmonizing the Commission=0F's rules.  But it a=
sked=20
the agency to retain the benchmark condition for facilities-based service t=
o=20
affiliated markets until Jan. 1, 2003. =20

That=0F's the last of several deadlines for U.S. carriers to settle traffic=
 with=20
foreign carriers at or below the applicable benchmark rate; the FCC=0F's=20
benchmark order had set different deadlines for various groups of countries=
.

=0F"The incentive for unlawful one-way bypass remains a serious issue,=0F" =
WorldCom=20
said.  =0F"By removing this condition, the Commission would make it easier =
than=20
ever for a dominant foreign carrier to circumvent unlawfully the settlement=
=20
rate benchmarks.=0F"  It added that it would be difficult for the Commissio=
n to=20
detect evasion by carriers without the mandate.

Verizon Communications, Inc.=0F's international carrier affiliates backed t=
he=20
streamlining proposals.  =0F"In an increasingly competitive environment,=20
simplification and streamlining of outdated rules are essential to assure=
=20
that U.S. carriers are able to compete in the world market,=0F" Verizon sai=
d.

It suggested the FCC go further and streamline other rules affecting=20
international service authorizations as well.  It urged elimination of the=
=20
following requirements:=20

(1) Prior notification for affiliation with non-dominant foreign carriers,=
=20

(2) Identification of interlocking directorates with foreign carriers,=20

(3) Quarterly international traffic reports required under section 43.61 of=

(4) Amendments of international authorizations when a Bell company receives=
=20
FCC authorization to provide in-region interLATA (local access and transpor=
t=20
area) service in a particular state.

Verizon Wireless supported changing the rules concerning pro forma=20
assignments and also asked the FCC to eliminate the quarterly reporting=20
requirements mandated by section 43.61(c).

Cingular Wireless LLC also backed making section 214 application procedures=
=20
more like those used for CMRS licenses.  It also said the Commission should=
=20
(1) authorize certain non=0F-wholly owned subsidiaries and partnerships to=

Falling Credit Ratings Create Costly Obstacle for Carriers

Many telecom companies these days are groaning under the weight of excessiv=
e=20
debt they accumulated while building networks, acquiring other companies, a=
nd=20
trying to enter new markets.  Determining whether they can pay those and=20
future debts is the job of credit-rating agencies like Moody=0F's Investors=
=20
Service.

Robert Ray, a senior vice president in the telecom, technology, and media=
=20
group at Moody=0F's, tells TR that some of the biggest names in telecom, li=
ke=20
AT&T Corp., are in danger of losing top credit ratings and having to pay mo=
re=20
interest in their next round of funding.  An edited transcript of our=20
interview with Mr. Ray follows.

TR:  What does Moody=0F's do?  What=0F's your role?

Ray:  I=0F'm lead analyst for a number of high-visibility companies in medi=
a,=20
technology, and telecommunications.  I=0F'm responsible not only for assign=
ing=20
ratings to companies but also for monitoring those ratings as companies=0F'=
=20
business prospects ebb and flow to make sure that our ratings, once assigne=
d,=20
continue to be accurate.

In case we=0F're no longer comfortable with the rating, it=0F's my responsi=
bility=20
to make a recommendation to change the rating of a company.

TR:  The news about telecom debt levels has been gloomy [see separate=20
story].  What=0F's your perspective on the financial health of the telecom=
=20
sector?

Ray:  There have been a number of defaults and bankruptcies, particularly=
=20
among the CLECs [competitive local exchange carriers].  There are a number =
of=20
companies that have tried to enter the market.  Not all the business plans=
=20
were fully funded.

As both the equity and the debt markets have become more restricted,=20
companies that didn=0F't have a fully funded business plan=0F-that didn=0F'=
t have=20
enough money on hand or committed money from their bank group to cover thei=
r=20
cash needs over the next 12 to 18 months=0F-have found themselves in liquid=
ity=20
crunches relatively quickly.

TR:  On the equity side, a lot of analysts were surprised by what happened =
in=20
the telecom sector.  Is there a similar sense on the credit and debt side=
=20
that investors and their advisers were caught by surprise?

Ray:  In the high-yield area many of the companies had relatively low ratin=
gs=0F-
single-B or Caa.  Those ratings don=0F't necessarily anticipate a certainty=
 of=20
default, but they do reflect a high degree of risk.

Even on the investment-grade side, however, we=0F've seen some surprising=
=20
developments=0F-not so much in terms of direction, but in terms of speed=0F=
-
primarily in the pricing environment for long distance services from=20
companies such as AT&T and WorldCom [Inc.] =20

We were aware that those prices were going to come under pressure as the Ba=
by=20
Bells began to get permission to offer long distance service in their home=
=20
markets, as usage moved from wireline to wireless [service], and as usage=
=20
began moving from traditional circuit-switched networks to Internet-deliver=
ed=20
voice.

While we knew there were a lot of pressures that were going to bring pricin=
g=20
down in that market, the degree of the falloff was a bit of a surprise even=
=20
to us.  As a result, the large long distance carriers have had to scale bac=
k=20
their expectations for profitability in the voice business.

TR:  And as a consequence, their credit ratings have come under downward=20
pressure.

Ray:  Yes, AT&T has had its long-term rating lowered from A1 to A2, and tha=
t=20
rating remains on review.  Certainly the pressures from the voice business=
=20
were part of that.  But AT&T is also in the process of breaking itself up=
=20
into three separate businesses.  The review is not only focusing on some of=
=20
the risks that we=0F've talked about, but also the financial structure that=
 each=20
of these businesses will have going forward.

We=0F've changed the outlook on Sprint [Corp.] from stable to negative. =20
WorldCom retains an A3 rating and a stable outlook.  While they=0F've had s=
ome=20
pressure like the other players, they had a little more flexibility, under=
=20
the current rating, to absorb some of those pressures.

TR:  How big a deal is it to these companies to have their credit rating go=
=20
down a step?  What effect does that have on their day-to-day business?

Ray:  On the day-to-day business it has relatively limited impact.  To the=
=20
extent that they would be issuing new debt, a lower credit rating normally=
=20
would result in a higher interest rate.

The most critical rating for AT&T is its short-term rating of Prime-1.  If=
=20
they didn=0F't have a Prime-1 rating, they=0F'd be severely limited in thei=
r=20
ability to sell commercial paper to the money market funds.  [Securities an=
d=20
Exchange Commission rules limit the amount money market funds can invest in=
=20
companies that don=0F't have top-tier commercial paper ratings, like Prime-=
1,=20
from at least two rating agencies.  =0F-Ed.]

For a company whose commercial paper outstanding has been between $15 billi=
on=20
and $20 billion, that could result in a significant increase in AT&T=0F's=
=20
funding costs.  They would have to seek out, for the most part, a different=
=20
group of investors.

TR:  Is AT&T=0F's Prime-1 rating under review?

Ray:  Yes, it is.  Both the A2 long-term rating and our Prime-1 short-term=
=20
rating are on review for possible downgrade.

TR:  Can you give me an example of what the cost of money might be to AT&T=
=20
through a money market fund v. the next-best alternative?

Ray:  The money market funds would just be one of a number of investors who=
=20
would be buying AT&T=0F's commercial paper.  So don=0F't get too caught up =
in their=20
being the only source.

TR:  Percentagewise, though, how much better is commercial paper than the=
=20
next-best alternative?

Ray:  They would certainly have to pay higher rates.  To the extent that th=
ey=20
were reliant on the money market funds for a substantial part of their=20
commercial paper issuance, those funds would have to be replaced by investo=
rs=20
who are less constrained by the rating.  You can find those investors, but=
=20
they are obviously looking at a lower rating for a higher pricing.  So it=
=0F's=20
hard to speculate on specifically what any one company might have to pay.

TR:  It depends on the day of the week, I=0F'm sure.

Ray:  And it also depends on the size of the program, the market=0F's view =
of=20
how safe the investment is, how comfortable investors are with the company=
=0F's=20
prospects, and how much similar paper there is.

A telecom issuer is not only competing against a full range of issuers goin=
g=20
into the market; it=0F's also competing against other telecom companies for=
=20
access to the market.  Most investors set limits on how much they=0F're wil=
ling=20
to expose themselves to any particular industry.  Once they feel they have=
=20
enough exposure to the telecom industry, they=0F're going to be less intere=
sted=20
in putting that next dollar into telecoms rather than some other opportunit=
y.

The other thing we=0F've seen in the last couple of years is there=0F's bee=
n=20
tremendous need in the telecom industry for financing as companies have bui=
lt=20
out their networks.  CLECs have been building networks.  A number of long=
=20
distance networks have been built here in the United States.  Wireless=20
networks are being built.  There are also international networks, not only=
=20
connecting countries but also within Europe and within Asia=0F-both wirelin=
e and=20
wireless.

In the U.S. market alone, there was over $70 billion worth of media and=20
telecom debt in the first 11 months of 2000, compared to about $55 billion =
in=20
1999.  That=0F's just the straight debt market, not including equities or=
=20
convertible debts.

TR:  How do you determine a company=0F's rating?

Ray:  We look at the business risks of a company.  We try to understand=20
exactly what business they=0F're in, their competitive position, and their=
=20
strengths and weaknesses.  We also try to get a good understanding of=20
management and what their appetites may be for business and financial risk.

We rate virtually all major companies in virtually every industry.  We also=
=20
have a solid understanding of the industry broadly and where any particular=
=20
company fits in terms of its cost structure, market share, management=20
direction, and strategic focus.

We also, obviously, do some statistical analysis.  Since we=0F're fixed-inc=
ome=20
analysts, we=0F're focused more on ensuring that debt obligations get paid =
and=20
trying to assess the probability that all obligations will be paid in full =
in=20
a timely manner.

A fixed-income investor doesn=0F't necessarily have the upside that an equi=
ty=20
holder does.  A fixed-income holder has one of two results if he buys a=20
security at issuance and holds it to maturity:  He either gets paid or he=
=20
doesn=0F't.

Even if the company=0F's been fabulously successful, he just gets his inter=
est=20
on a regular basis and the principal at maturity.  If the company just=20
struggles through and barely makes it, he=0F's in the same situation.  So t=
here=0F'
s not much upside on straight debt if you=0F're a buy-and-hold investor.

As fixed-income analysts, our key measures are the company=0F's ability to=
=20
generate free cash.  That=0F's cash after meeting all fixed obligations, li=
ke=20
interest and dividends.  We also look at their ability to finance their=20
capital spending requirements and their cash-generating capability relative=
=20
to their debt load.

If you look at two companies that are basically in the same industry and th=
at=20
have similar sizes and market positions=0F-with neither one possessing any=
=20
particular competitive advantage in terms of new products=0F-the one that h=
as=20
the stronger cash generation relative to its debt obligations would have a=
=20
higher rating.

Probably the most difficult part of our business is making sure that we are=
=20
consistent in applying our ratings.  I want to make sure my strongest compa=
ny=20
has the highest rating and my weakest company has the lowest rating.

It=0F's also important to make sure that what I call an A1, an A2, or a Baa=
3 is=20
equivalent to the ratings of anyone else in the corporate finance area,=20
whether they=0F're covering auto companies or coal mines.

TR:  How much of your time is spent talking to management and trying to=20
figure out their plans?  What happens during these talks?

Ray:  A large part of our analytical meetings with companies is spent tryin=
g=20
to understand their strategy, their philosophy, and their appetite for=20
business and financial risk, and looking at what the company has done in th=
e=20
past and how successful they=0F've been in meeting goals that they=0F've se=
t for=20
themselves.

We look at their plans relative to others in the industry and try to make=
=20
sure the strategy and the objectives they=0F've set are reasonable and=20
achievable.  The discussion, quite frankly, in the average meeting tends to=
=20
be more about the companies=0F' products and business mix.

It=0F's often beneficial having a long-standing relationship with a company=

management.  You develop a sense of comfort regarding management=0F's abili=

TR:  It must be an expensive prospect for a company to get its rating=20

Ray:  We try to have a pretty good ongoing dialogue with a company so that =
it=0F'
s not a matter of calling them up one day and saying, =0F"Oh, by the way, w=

putting you on review for a downgrade.=0F"  To the extent that we develop a=
reas=20
of concern, we like to bring them to the company=0F's attention=0F-both in =
our=20

Obviously no company is ever pleased to be put on review for a downgrade. =
=20
Our objective, quite frankly, is to make sure that they understand and=20
appreciate the position we=0F've taken and that they know why we=0F're doin=
g what=20
we=0F're doing.

Even though they ultimately may disagree with the action, at least we want =
to=20
make sure that they understand the logic behind the steps we take.  And we=
=20
give them a chance to share with us their view as to why some of our concer=
ns=20
may be less severe from their perspective.

TR:  Do you have any advice for telecom executives, investors, or=20
regulators?  What needs to happen for the sector to climb out of its slump?

Ray:  For the long distance companies, it=0F's a matter of continuing to ge=
t=20
their costs in line as best they can, knowing that their revenue is going t=
o=20

In the wireless segment, the key things are the ability of the wireless=20

ss=20
data markets=0F-while maintaining cost structures that will allow them to=
=20
continue to be profitable.

There are more national wireless carriers now, and we expect that developme=

will put pressure on pricing.  We don=0F't anticipate that it=0F's going to=
 be as=20
dramatic as the pressure we=0F've seen recently in the voice wireline secto=

But the more competitors you have and the broader their coverage, the great=

the risk of continued pricing declines.

TR:  We haven=0F't talked much about the Bell companies=0F-the ILECs [incum=
bent=20
local exchange carriers].  What=0F's your outlook for that sector?

Ray:  One argument that Moody=0F's has been making in support of them for a=
 long=20
time is that they have direct contact with their customers, and they=0F're =
also=20
the ones with the line into the house.  Our ratings on the ILECs are=20
certainly the highest we have in the telecom area.  They are, by and large,=
 a=20
strong group of competitors who=0F've demonstrated better stability in thei=

TR:  Does the prospect of greater regulatory oversight figure into your=20

Telecom Sector=0F's Dubious Debts Create Drag on Financial Markets

The rumblings began in Europe.  The Bank of England issued warnings, follow=
ed=20
by the Bank of France.  The major credit-rating agencies=0F-Standard & Poor=
=0F's,=20
Moody=0F's Investors Service, and Fitch ICBA=0F-issued ominous reports.  On=
 the one=20
hand they sounded alarm bells, while on the other they said, =0F"Don=0F't p=
anic.=0F"

The reason for the caution flags is the level of questionable debt among=20
telecom companies.  Pessimists fear that so many obligations will go unpaid=
=20
that the telecom industry single-handedly will tip the economies of several=
=20
countries into recession=0F-as the U.S. real estate industry did in the 198=

Even optimists admit that telecom debt is already a drag on the economy.  I=

y,=20
and how many defaults the economy can absorb.

=0F`Fears Are Overdone=0F'

By some estimates, telecom service providers have borrowed $322 billion ove=
r=20
the past three years, including bonds and bank loans.  Analysts generally=
=20
divide that debt into two sectors.  The bigger group has been generated by=
=20
large carriers like AT&T Corp., British Telecommunications plc, and France=
=20
Telecom SA.  If one of those companies went under, it would be a=20
catastrophe.  But analysts don=0F't think that=0F's likely.

They=0F're more concerned about smaller service providers, like competitive=
=20
local exchange carriers (CLECs).  Fortunately, those carriers aren=0F't tho=
ught=20
to carry enough debt to bring down a major bank, let alone an entire indust=
ry=20
or an economy.

=0F"At this stage, Moody=0F's is not forecasting defaults by major telecoms=

Fitch ICBA issued a similar statement.  =0F"Large, profitable, and creditwo=

=0F"Fears of a banking crisis are overdone, in our view,=0F" says Morgan St=

Those assessments don=0F't mean there won=0F't be pain for the telecom comp=

that their books will look uglier, their profits will sink, and their stock=

Telecom isn=0F't the only industry causing banks to spew red ink, says Cred=
it=20
Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst Rosalind Looby.  Movie theater companies,=
 =0F"
dotcoms,=0F" and California electric utilities are doing their part, too. =
=20

=0F"We are in the midst of a broader deterioration in commercial credit qua=
lity=20
driven by loose lending standards adopted in the mid-1990s,=0F" Ms. Looby=
=20
comments in a recent report.

Banks traditionally were reluctant to fund money-losing companies.  They=20
changed tacks during the dotcom frenzy on Wall Street.  If they lent money =
to=20
a young company, some bankers reasoned, that company might hire them for=20
other financial services.  The risks were greater, but the prospects for=20
future revenue were tempting.

That was before those young companies fell on hard times.  CLECs=0F-one of =
the=20
harder-hit sectors in the current economic slowdown=0F-have $8.2 billion in=
 loan=20
commitments from U.S. banks, Credit Suisse First Boston estimates.  Skittis=
h=20
banks have ways of dumping risky clients, but the process can be expensive,=
=20
Ms. Looby says.

=0F"Bankers attempting to sell any marginal CLEC credit into the distressed=

For now, however, many bankers are choosing to sit tight.  =0F"I=0F'm not s=

=20
managing director-loan syndications for First Union Securities, Inc.  Banke=

s, but=20
they=0F're also not ready to take the financial hit that results from a =0F=
"
distressed=0F" sale, he says.

Furthermore, bankers remain confident that they=0F'll collect the entire am=
ount=20
on telecom loans, even in the worst cases, Mr. Johnson says.  First Union,=
=20
for example, still expects full repayment of its loans to two bankrupt CLEC=
s=0F-
ICG Communications, Inc., and NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc. =20
Bankruptcy courts often find ways of restructuring debt that enables banks =

Meanwhile, the telecom industry appears to be recovering, Mr. Johnson notes=
. =20
=0F"While there still may be more bankruptcies, the perspective in the bank=

Recovery Could Be Stymied

Debt-market analysts at Bear, Stearns & Co. are less sanguine.  The debt=20
market appears to have regained its footing, Bear Stearns analysts say, but=
=20
the recovery could be stymied by fear, uncertainty, and market failures.  =

The telecom sector remains prone to headline risk,=0F" they say, suggesting=

Debt markets are especially vulnerable in Europe, where large carriers are=

what if nobody is willing to buy the assets or invest in the IPOs?

Many analysts view France Telecom=0F's IPO of its wireless subsidiary, Oran=

Vendors Become Lenders

The type of lending that seems to worry analysts most is vendor financing, =
in=20
which equipment vendors give carriers loans in exchange for guaranteed=20
equipment orders.  Vendor financing was much less common before last April,=
=20
when the stock market still was the best source of funding for telecom=20
companies.

When stock market investors closed their doors, many telecom companies went=
=20
to the bond market.  When bonds dried up, they visited banks.  Rejected by=
=20
banks, many carriers turned to vendors.

Analysts are nervous because vendors sometimes aren=0F't qualified to judge=
=20
creditworthiness and administer loan programs.  But the vendors are eager t=
o=20
snag customers.  =0F"Offering financing has quickly developed into a compet=
itive=20
weapon by equipment manufacturers keen to take market share,=0F" Messrs. Cr=
ehan=20
and Secker explain.

=0F"The aggressive expansion of vendor financing has raised fears that equi=

Vendor financing worries already have stung some manufacturers.  Lucent=20

Conn. Draft Decision Would Let SNET Drop Cable TV Business

The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control has proposed letting=
=20
Southern New England Telephone Co. (SNET) and its video service subsidiary,=
=20
SNET Personal Vision, Inc., stop providing cable TV services in the state.

SNET, a subsidiary of SBC Communications, Inc., had told the department tha=
t=20
its hybrid fiber/coaxial cable (HFC) cable TV network was unsuitable for=20
ubiquitous, full-service telephony and that the video-only deployment of th=
e=20
HFC network was commercially impracticable (TR, Aug. 14, 2000).

A draft department decision says the agency lacks the statutory authority t=

lacks the authority to force the transfer of SNET=0F's cable TV franchise o=
r=20
video assets to another company, as Connecticut Telephone & Communications=

Systems, Inc., had requested last fall (TR, Sept. 25, 2000).

Written exceptions to the draft decision are due Jan. 26 in docket 00-08-14=

The department will hold a Feb. 5 hearing, if one is requested, and plans t=
