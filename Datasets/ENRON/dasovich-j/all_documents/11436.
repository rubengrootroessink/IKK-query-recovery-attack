We need to coordinate our participation in this conference to make sure we 
don't over load the expense reimbursements.   At this point I understand that 
Sandi has a commitment to host a Commissioner's breakfast.

Sandi & Paul, 

here's a website link to the conference you were asking about
(the June one at Resort Semiahmoo [say that 3 times fast!] in Blaine, 
Washington):

Let me know if you'd also like it faxed and to where!

Joseph
