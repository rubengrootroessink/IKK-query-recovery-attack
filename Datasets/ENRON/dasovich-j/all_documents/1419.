A couple of folks have told me that SDG&E wants to go to the commission to 
get a "pre-prudency" type approval with the CPUC prior to moving forward with 
any type of deal.  That seamed odd to me and they would need to have a deal 
in hand or have some parameters of a deal structure to get any type of 
approval.  I imagine that SDG&E is concerned that the shareholders get stuck 
with any risk if the do enter into a deal and it is found not to be prudent 
(not to mention the fact that they have had trouble pulling a trigger or even 
pointing in the past).

Have any of the other utilities tried something like this or does the CPUC 
give a pre-approval or a declaratory order of this nature.  Does the CPUC 
have process in place to do this.  Any thoughts.
