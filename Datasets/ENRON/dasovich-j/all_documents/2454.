CHANGING SUPPLY CHAINS

A typical hospital buys $50 million in supplies from 22,000
suppliers annually.  On average there is a 75% price discrep-
ancy for identical products.  Paper invoices cost 30 times as
much as electronic invoices. Room for improvement? Perhaps.
We've convened an expert panel at Healthcare Outlook 2000 to
help us understand where the changes will come from and who
the big winners will be:

Dr. Gilbert H. Kliman, General Partner, InterWest Partners
Dr.David M. Auerbach, Principal, Decision Health
Sundeep Bhan, Chairman,President, & CEO, Medsite.com
