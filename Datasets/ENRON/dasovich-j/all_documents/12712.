Judge dims PG&E producers' shot at relief
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 18, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali delivered a sharp blo=
w=20
to a large number of small energy generators, signaling in an opinion=20
released Thursday that he'll probably require them to continue selling powe=
r=20
within California and at state-regulated rates.=20
The tentative ruling in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bankruptcy case=20
denied most of the relief requested by the first four generators to have=20
their cases decided. The Central Valley power-generating plants have warned=
=20
that financial pressures may force them to shut down in June, cutting into=
=20
the power needed to avoid rolling blackouts this summer.=20
They asked to be released from their contracts with PG&E or for higher pric=
es=20
for the power they sell to the utility.=20
Montali responded by sweeping beyond the technical confines of bankruptcy=
=20
law, saying, "The court cannot and will not ignore other considerations,"=
=20
such as "the need to keep (the generators) on-line, producing power for=20
California."=20
While the four facilities provide less than 1 percent of the utility's=20
electricity, the tentative opinion sent out a broad message to scores of=20
small power producers -- which together provide more than 20 percent of=20

Montali's decision, posted Thursday, was dated Wednesday, the same day the=
=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued an order ensuring energy=20
producers the right to sell to the highest bidder if they can get out of=20
their contractual obligations.=20
Montali also declined to raise the price PG&E must pay under current=20
contracts. While conceding the energy producers are entitled to a reasonabl=
e=20
rate, he cited FERC findings that under certain conditions, spot market rat=
es=20
in the California market have been "unjust and unreasonable."=20
Instead, Montali held out the likelihood of far more modest relief. He=20
ordered immediate negotiations to increase the cash flow sufficiently at th=

with the goal of ensuring they will be able to "perform when needed."=20
The four generators had warned in court documents of "June shutdown=20
scenario," which would have cut into the power needed to avoid rolling=20
blackouts this summer.=20
They are owed $58 million out of a total $1 billion PG&E debt to 300=20

Most, including a plant that generates energy from rice hulls, are small or=

mid-sized, but several are owned by some of the nation's largest=20
corporations, including Texaco. They're paid on the basis of various formul=
as=20
set by contracts or a formula set by the Public Utilities Commission.=20
Ed Feo, a lawyer representing the creditors' committee, which will be=20
included in the negotiations, said Montali's tentative ruling "will probabl=
y=20
be the template" for the way he deals with all of the small producers=20
operating at PUC-approved rates that don't cover their costs.=20
The committee represents thousands of businesses and individuals who are ow=

money by PG&E. It had asked in a hearing a week ago that all of the small=
=20
generator cases be consolidated for a single ruling because of the likely=
=20
impact.=20
Montali refused, saying the complications would be "more than I can=20
comprehend" because each case presents different facts.=20
About two dozen facilities have petitioned Montali for relief so far,=20
including 15 that have curtailed or ceased operations at times this spring,=
=20
claiming PG&E's payments were insufficient to keep them on-line.=20
Several have hearings scheduled within the next three weeks, but at least t=
wo=20
-- Berry Petroleum and Crockett Cogeneration -- have reached settlement=20
agreements with the utility.=20
In response to Montali's tentative ruling on the four Central Valley=20

Bush's mixed message: Fossil fuels tomorrow don't solve crisis now


(Published May 18, 2001)=20

President Bush seeks to focus public attention on tomorrow's energy challen=

while doing little to prevent a looming electricity crisis that may start i=
n=20
California this summer and spread to other parts of the country.=20
The existing crisis is so serious, and so neglected by the president, it wi=
ll=20
be hard for Californians to focus on his glossy new energy blueprint, which=
=20
he unveiled Thursday with campaign-style fanfare. Documents such as these=
=20
(this one has more than 100 specific recommendations), when successful, end=
=20
up serving the broader purpose of launching public discussion and political=
=20
debate.=20
This time, though, the president has no choice but to enter this debate in=
=20
the present, not the future. California waits, wonders and bleeds as billio=
ns=20
of dollars in excess electricity profits go to generating companies and=20
traders.=20
What's so perplexing about this president is the emerging philosophical=20
inconsistency between how he sees the energy future and the present. Line b=
y=20

energy marketplace. Rather than leave the market to itself, Bush seeks to=

opportunities on public lands.=20
Yet today for California, the president sticks to a hands-off approach,=20
rejecting intervention in a horribly distorted electricity marketplace. Why=
?=20
Viewed as an a-la-carte menu, Bush's energy strategy offers something for=
=20
everyone. Appetizers range from tax breaks to fuel-conscious motorists who=
=20
want to buy hybrid cars to billions of dollars in new research to burn coal=
=20

power plants. And some cutting-edge stuff, such as new funds for alternativ=
e=20
fuels research, are tied to one controversial source -- royalties from new=
=20
gas and oil development in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.=20
The charts and graphs all speak to matching future supply with demand, as i=
f=20
the challenge is two dimensional. It is not. The third piece, barely=20

House Democrats began the day with a high-tech assault on the plan that=20

Much of the Democratic criticism centered on Bush's failure to offer=20

Many cities, including Los Angeles and Sacramento, have publicly owned=20

Power: She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create "artificial=

shortages." An industry spokesman calls the accusation "idiocy."=20

By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers=20

?????State investigators have uncovered evidence that a "cartel" of power=
=20
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices=
,=20
the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
?????PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state=20
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have=
=20
created "artificial shortages," particularly when the state has issued=20
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
?????"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose=
=20
not to," Lynch said in an interview at The Times.
?????"And it is clear that there are instances that plants, when called to=
=20
produce, chose not to produce," even when they were obligated to do so unde=
r=20
special contracts with the state and utility companies.
?????Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough=20
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action=
=20
against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she sai=
d,=20
is still under review.
?????Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide=
=20
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain=20
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
?????Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power mark=
et=20
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the=
=20
facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis tha=
t=20
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
?????Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of=20
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has=
=20
been unwarranted.
?????In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a stateme=
nt=20
last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was=
=20
justified and that the company's officials were "accommodating."
?????State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joi=
nt=20
investigation with the PUC. A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyer's=
=20
office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide-ranging probe of=
=20
possible civil and criminal violations.
?????So far, the attorney general's office has subpoenaed documents in 91=
=20
categories from generators, including records of plant operations, pricing=
=20
practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another=20
about California's power market.
?????"We're looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair=20
business practice laws," Lockyer has told The Times.
?????Although he has not provided details of his office's findings, he=20
recently said the inquiry is "beginning to get interesting."
?????Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amass=
ed=20
during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous=20
subpoenaed records, obtained after intense legal battles with the power=20
companies.
?????In addition, investigators have been entering plants where unplanned=
=20
shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records, Lync=
h=20
said. At times, the investigators have been denied access and have had to=
=20
exert legal pressure to get in, she said.=20
?????The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices, whic=
h=20
have gone from $200 a megawatt-hour in December to as high as $1,900 last=
=20
week.
?????"I would argue it's no accident," Lynch said of the high prices. "That=
=20
in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel."
?????The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the=
=20
rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to bu=
y=20
power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
?????Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power=20
producers, said Lynch's allegations were "the height of idiocy."
?????The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is th=
at=20
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summe=
r=20
demand.
?????He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing=20
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
?????"My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their=
=20
competitors can make money," said Ackerman, executive director of the Weste=
rn=20
Power Trading Forum.
?????State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap=20
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power=
=20
that is sold are so high.
?????According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were=
=20
more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulat=
e=20
the state's power market.
?????She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern: When=20
operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage 1 alert--meaning th=
at=20
electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs=
=20
suddenly are yanked offline. That, she said, aggravates the shortages, and=
=20
the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
?????Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven =
up=20
prices primarily through bidding. At the time, the market was designed to p=
ay=20
all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state's grid operato=
r.
?????That changed in December, when new federal regulations restructured=20
California's wholesale power market to loosen price controls, Lynch said.=
=20
Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--"not coincidental=
ly=20
in my view," she said. Now, she added, the state has endured "historically=
=20
high levels of unplanned plant outages."
?????The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by=20
utility companies because they have not been "going off [line] at record=20
levels," Lynch said.
?????The California Energy Commission reported last week that the state's=
=20
electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several=
=20
times higher than in the last two years.
?????A Times analysis of state data found that, throughout the last two=20
months, about 12,000 megawatts of production was offline, more than a third=
=20
of the peak power used in California on a typical day. That has been about=
=20
evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns.
?????By contrast, shutdowns in the same period of 1999 and 2000 took only=
=20
3,300 to 5,700 megawatts offline.
?????Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electrici=

supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay $8 million in=20

?????However, FERC released a study in February of closures at three other=

?????By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too=
=20
late to do the Golden State much good.
?????"This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the=
=20
next critical 18 months," groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)=
.=20
"You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be de=
ad=20
before we get the life-support systems in place."
?????Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to=
=20
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are=
=20
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
?????Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an=
=20
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclea=
r=20
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy=
=20
development.
?????Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many=
=20
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woe=
s=20
far ahead of other states.
?????The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or=20
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from=
=20
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
?????"Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' " said=
=20
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and=20
advocacy group.
?????"I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California," added=20
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
?????State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the=
=20
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one.=20
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27=
=20
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
?????"It's not that we don't have long-term problems," said Stephen Levy,=
=20
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the Californ=
ia=20
Economy. "It's just that energy isn't among them."
?????Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a=
=20
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a=
=20
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
?????"Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to=20
purchase more efficient air conditioners?" asked Dan Reicher, assistant=20
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Over the course of the yea=
r,=20
a program like that can make a dramatic difference" because air conditionin=
g=20
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
?????Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency=
=20
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the=20
country to build 43 new power plants.
?????Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California=
=20
were clouded by doubt.
?????Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to=20
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as "Path 15," between Northern=
=20
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires=
=20
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by=
=20
"nonfederal contributions"--meaning the financially strapped utilities migh=
t=20
be expected to bear the cost.
?????Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from=20
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California an=
d=20
criticized the president for allowing "the price-gouging energy companies,=
=20
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder."
?????Davis said the state is "doing everything possible to build and conser=
ve=20
our way out of the problem," but it desperately needs federal price control=
s=20
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion;=
=20
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
?????But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that=
=20
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forc=
es=20
reign.
?????Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in=20
peril.
?????"Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning =
a=20
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state," Davis=
=20
said. "Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because the=
y=20
can't afford these rates."
?????Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly=20
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California=
.
?????Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20=20
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a=20
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two year=
s.
?????The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushi=
ng=20
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however=
,=20
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive=20
order issued in February.
?????There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to=20
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plan=
t=20
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found=
=20
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.
?????"You can barely build clean-burning gas plants here, let alone nuclear=

plants," said Edward Kahn, a San Francisco-based energy consultant with=20
Analysis Group/Economics.
?????Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a=20

?????"I'm just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the=

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year=20
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top=

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad=
=20
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by=20
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
?????Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares=
=20
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts a=

money managers say.
?????Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's=
=20
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 200=

than in 2001, analysts estimate.
?????That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will =

peaks--or head lower.
?????Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rockete=

many energy stocks have stalled this year.
?????The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related=20

f=20
six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.

y,=20
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 t=
o=20
$67.99 on Thursday.
?????By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
?????Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief=

investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choos=

to find good buys today in the energy sector.
?????"We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because=20
they're the better bargains," he said. "And at this point the good news loo=

fully priced into the services and equipment group."
?????After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took=20
profits earlier this year. "We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--i=

leadership days are done," he said.
?????Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. "W=
e=20
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro=
=20
trends," he said.
?????For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that=20
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
?????Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this yea=
r,=20
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson=20
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.=
20.
?????At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the=

price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lowe=
r=20
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy=20
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature =
of=20
the business.
?????Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interes=
t=20
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
?????Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be=20
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen,=
=20
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleu=
m=20
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich=20
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased =

?????Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland=20
(ASH), Pennzoil-Quaker State (PZL) and Sunoco (SUN) are among the refining=

stocks with reasonable valuations and plenty of upside, he said.
?????Ashland eased 17 cents to $43.50 Thursday, Pennzoil-Quaker added 5 cen=
ts=20
to $15.96 and Sunoco rose 98 cents to $41.45.
?????Some money managers prefer to leave the traditional oil and gas stocks=
=20
for others--in favor of alternative energy issues.
?????John Hammerschmidt, manager of Turner New Energy & Power Technology=20

which is seeking to develop cheaper and sturdier solar panels, and AstroPow=
er=20
(APWR), another solar firm.
?????Energy Conversion jumped $3.53 to $31.28 on Thursday while AstroPower=

leaped $3.38 to $54.93.
?????In the fuel cell industry, Hammerschmidt pointed to Ballard Power=20

?????Ballard jumped $8.37 to $57.60 and FuelCell rose $4.98 to $85.28.

Municipal Utilities Seek Exemptions From Blackouts=20
Power: Those connected to state grid, L.A. not among them, say their=20
customers should not be deprived to aid others.=20

By SCOTT GOLD, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A group of California cities that run their own electric utilities and=
=20
have plenty of power to weather the energy crunch this summer will ask the=
=20
federal government today to exempt them from blackouts.
?????Their quiet campaign challenges the very foundation of the power grid =
in=20
California, and could change the dynamics of how electricity is doled=20
out--just as the state is bracing for a summer of rolling outages.
?????Most Californians pay large, investor-owned utilities like Southern=20
California Edison Co. for power. But about a quarter of households, from th=
e=20
tiny desert city of Needles to the state capital, are billed for electricit=
y=20
by cities, counties or local districts that run their own nonprofit=20
utilities. There are 30 "municipal" utilities.
?????Four of them--serving Los Angeles, Burbank, Glendale and the Imperial=
=20
Valley, east of San Diego--are independent of the state power grid and do n=
ot=20
face any outages. But the others are required by contract to give electrici=
ty=20
back to the California Independent System Operator, which runs the grid, by=
=20
participating in rolling blackouts--although they have plenty of power to=
=20
serve their customers.
?????"It makes them wonder why they went out and did their jobs," said=20
California Municipal Utilities Assn. attorney Tony Braun.
?????These utilities argue that they are suffering for the myopic decisions=
=20
behind the deregulation of California's electricity market and the power=20
shortage.
?????"We believe our power was purchased for the citizens of Riverside and=
=20
that we don't have the right--nor does anyone else--to take it away from th=
em=20
when they need it," said Riverside Utilities Director Tom Evans. "Our=20
customers are being denied something that they are fundamentally entitled t=
o."
?????Leading the campaign is the tiny Los Angeles County city of Vernon,=20
which filed a complaint last week asking the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to exempt it from rolling blackouts.
?????Vernon's public utility has 2,000 customers, all but 30 of which are=
=20
industrial operations such as glass manufacturers and meatpacking plants. T=
he=20
city launched its own distribution system primarily to lure industry with=
=20
electric rates that are typically among the lowest in the state, said Jorge=
=20
Somoano, Vernon's assistant director of resource management.
?????FERC set a deadline today for other municipal utilities to support the=
=20
campaign. Up to half, including Riverside, are expected to either file thei=
r=20
own complaints or file documents supporting Vernon, said Washington attorne=
y=20
Bonnie Blair, who represents municipal utilities in Azusa, Banning and Colt=
on.
?????Even the campaign's supporters are unsure whether it will succeed. Bla=
ir=20
acknowledged that there is no precedent for presenting this type of legal=
=20
challenge to FERC, which is expected to decide on the issue by mid-June. An=
d,=20
she said, municipal utilities might have a tough time proving they have don=
e=20
enough to insulate themselves from the energy crisis.
?????Some cities with municipal utilities, such as Anaheim, are not plannin=
g=20
to join the campaign.
?????Marcie Edwards, general manager of Anaheim Public Utilities, said the=
=20
relationships between municipal utilities and Cal-ISO are too complicated t=
o=20
make a clean break. She said it is rare that a power shortage can be blamed=
=20
entirely on the large investor-owned utilities--including this summer's=20
energy crunch. And until that can be proved, she said, municipal utilities=
=20
still have an obligation to support California's power grid.
?????"It's not right to go either way 100%," she said. "The fact remains th=
at=20
municipals still have an obligation to serve."
?????Most of the municipal utilities are linked to the grid through=20
agreements with Cal-ISO that call for them to share electricity in an=20
emergency.
?????Those utilities tend to believe that the agreements were reserved for=
=20
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, or other sudden and monumental=20
problems, such as a plane running into a transmission line.
?????"The failure or inability of other utilities to schedule sufficient=20
supplies," Vernon contended wryly in its papers filed with FERC, does not=
=20
constitute an emergency.
?????"The obligation to share in [rolling blackouts] did not contemplate=20
situations where some utilities were not meeting their basic obligation to=
=20
provide resources to serve their customers," Blair said. "If they are force=
d=20
to participate in rolling blackouts, the effect is that the ISO is taking=
=20
energy that has been bought and paid for by some customers and effectively=
=20
giving it to somebody else that has been unable to buy it."
?????Jim Detmers, Cal-ISO's vice president of operations, said the=20
organization plans to fight the campaign. He said emergency provisions of=
=20
Cal-ISO's agreements with the municipal utilities cover the current energy=
=20
crunch.
?????Detmers said that exempting municipal utilities from blackouts would=
=20
increase the share of those events shouldered by communities that do not ha=
ve=20
their own electricity distribution. He compared the exemption request to a=
=20
homeowner declining to fight a fire at a neighbor's because he wants to kee=
p=20
his water for himself.
?????"What we're dealing with is an overall shortage," Detmers said. "We wa=
nt=20
to make sure that we are making the right choices when everyone's lives are=
=20
at risk."
?????Ronald Nunnally, Edison's director of federal regulations and contract=
s,=20
said the municipal utilities have an obligation to uphold the integrity of=
=20
the power grid to which they are connected.
?????"The ability to use the grid requires to keep it whole, if you will,=
=20
under all circumstances," he said.
?????Blair said those arguments don't hold up. Indeed, she said the municip=

utilities will argue that the California Constitution expressly prohibits=

"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose not=

Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum,=20

Power generators have repeatedly said they have been acting within the rule=

Washington -- The White House's reluctance to bail California out of its=20
electricity woes was made plain by President Bush's decision to release his=

Traveling as far west as the Mississippi River, Bush spoke sympathetically =

Davis, who has predicted that the state will have enough power to be out of=

"The president can say the problem will correct itself, and that's true --=

State energy regulators have uncovered evidence that some electric power=20

Investigators with the California Public Utilities Commission and the state=

What's more, many of those unnecessary plant shutdowns came when California=

"That's not within the PUC's bailiwick," Lynch said last night.=20
Lockyer could not be reached for comment.=20
Although Lynch said investigators have evidence that several companies shut=

INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN AUGUST
Lockyer's office began investigating last August whether power companies ha=
ve=20
been manipulating prices to maximize profits as California struggles with a=
=20
deepening energy shortage.=20
But even if investigators prove that electricity generators are "gaming" th=
e=20
market with a variety of price-influencing techniques, it remains to be see=

whether their actions violate the law.=20
Meanwhile, the PUC has been investigating why so many plants are down=20
simultaneously for maintenance. The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the=

soaring power prices, which have gone from $200 in December to as high as $=
1,=20

Lynch said investigators amassed their evidence during interviews and a=20

PG&E plans new plants outside California=20
Higher profits from building elsewhere=20

N222441.DTL&type=3Dnews=20
PG&E Corp., which insists that California's energy woes will end only when=
=20
new power plants are built, will begin construction of five generating=20
facilities this year and has at least four others on the drawing board.=20
Unfortunately for California, not one of these plants will be in the state.=
=20
Rather, PG&E will build more than 9,000 megawatts of new generation -- enou=
gh=20
power to light about 9 million homes -- in New York, New Jersey, Wisconsin,=
=20
Michigan, Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Nevada.=20
PG&E may talk about the importance of building power plants in California,=
=20
but the simple fact is that the company generally can construct generating=
=20
facilities more quickly and cheaply elsewhere -- and still benefit from hig=
h=20
electricity prices.=20
The company's ambitious building boom was outlined this week at PG&E's annu=
al=20
shareholder meeting in San Francisco.=20
"It is not perceived as advantageous for them to build their plants in=20
California," Keith Hannigan, a Chicago lawyer specializing in power plants,=
=20
said yesterday. "It's naive to think that PG&E will behave in any way excep=
t=20
to maximize its returns."=20
PG&E Corp. has only one major plant under way in its home state: the 1,000-=
=20
megawatt La Paloma facility near Bakersfield, due to begin operating by the=
=20
middle of next year.=20
The company received approval from state authorities last month for a 510-=
=20
megawatt plant in San Diego, but it plans to sell the project to San Jose's=
=20
Calpine Corp.=20
"The businesses that we have outside California are designed to grow=20
shareholder value," PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn told shareholders on=20
Wednesday.=20
Indeed, PG&E's National Energy Group, which oversees the company's power=20
plants, is the corporation's fastest-growing division -- a marked contrast =
to=20
PG&E's cash-strapped utility operations.=20
The National Energy Group saw operating earnings skyrocket by 165 percent=
=20
last year, compared with just 2 percent for the utility and 13 percent for=
=20
the corporation overall.=20
Operating earnings exclude one-time charges related to California's current=
=20
energy crisis.=20
While state officials expressed disappointment that PG&E would build its=20
plants elsewhere, they quickly noted that nothing can be done to change the=
=20
situation.=20
"What the holding company does is different from the regulated utility," sa=
id=20
Richard Bilas, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission. "The=
=20
holding company is able to do things that ain't right for California, but=
=20
that's what they do."=20
Under California's 1996 deregulation of the state's electricity market, PG&=
E=20
sold off most of its power plants to out-of-state energy companies -- the=
=20
same companies that PG&E now says are gouging California consumers and=20
driving its utility deeper into debt.=20
Meanwhile, PG&E Corp. owns, or holds stakes in, more than 30 power plants i=
n=20
11 states and has been especially aggressive in the New England area, where=
=20
the company now has 21 generating facilities.=20
The largest investor-owned utility in Massachusetts asked federal regulator=
s=20
this week to block PG&E Corp. from raising electricity prices during power=
=20
shortages.=20
PG&E countered that the rates it charges customers in the Boston area are=
=20
"fair and reasonable."=20
Most power companies say the same about what they are charging California=
=20
consumer these days. Supply and demand, they say, means that prices go up=
=20
when inventories go down.=20
The situation in California is gradually changing. Four new plants,=20
accounting for almost 2,000 megawatts, will begin operating this summer,=20
according to the California Energy Commission.=20
Another four should be online by next year, and seven others are scheduled =
to=20
be up and running by 2004.=20
Total production from all 15 new plants will be about 9,800 megawatts.=20
Yet California's demand for electricity will continue to grow during that=
=20
same period, and the state is expected to continue purchasing power from ou=
t-=20
of-state sources.=20
One of those sources could be PG&E. The company is in the final stages of=
=20
securing permits for a 1,000-megawatt plant near Las Vegas -- one of nearly=
 a=20
dozen generating facilities being fast-tracked by Nevada authorities to mak=
e=20
the state the energy hub of the West.=20
Nevada's primary goal is to secure enough electricity for the state's glitz=
y=20
gaming palaces. But it also wants to have enough power on hand to be able t=
o=20
export electricity elsewhere.=20
"We're obviously very interested in the Nevada market," said PG&E spokeswom=
an=20
Sandra McDonough. "It's a fast-growing market and we want to be in it. To t=

extent that power is not needed there, we would sell it elsewhere in the=20

In other words, to California -- potentially at the same sky-high prices th=

"The new power plants are trying to get on line as quickly as possible," sa=

Washington -- President Bush warned yesterday that California's blackouts a=
re=20
a "preview" for the rest of the nation if it fails to increase energy=20
supplies, but his plan to do so met with a hail of ridicule from=20
environmental groups and Democrats.=20
So quick and fierce were the attacks that the Bush plan may do less to ease=
=20
public concerns about energy than to set off an all-out political war with=
=20
environmentalists and their Democratic allies.=20
"If we fail to act, this great country could face a darker future, a future=
=20
that is unfortunately being previewed in rising prices at the gas pump and=
=20
rolling blackouts in the great state of California," Bush said at a St. Pau=
l,=20
Minn., utility where he revealed his 163-page energy plan.=20
"Californians are learning, regrettably, that sometimes when you flick on t=
he=20
light switch, the light does not come on at any price."=20
Bush insisted that by exploiting new technologies, energy production and=20
environmental protection can go hand in hand, urging "a new tone in=20
discussing energy and the environment, one that is less suspicious, less=20
punitive, less rancorous."=20
"We've yelled at each other enough," Bush said. "Now it's time to listen to=
=20
each other and to act."=20
But no sooner did Bush release his plan than it met a barrage of criticism=
=20
from environmental groups and Democrats who set up "war rooms" in the=20
basement of the Capitol and derided the plan as a payoff to the energy=20
industry.=20
Greenpeace activists dumped a heap of coal and oil drums outside Vice=20
President Dick Cheney's residence. Opponents previewed television commercia=
ls=20
depicting the administration as an auctioneer selling off public lands and=
=20
clean air.=20
Gov. Gray Davis joined the fray from Sacramento. "By not doing anything,=20
(Bush) is allowing price gouging by the energy companies -- many of whom=20
reside in Texas," Davis said. He urged Bush to tell federal regulators to=
=20
impose price controls on wholesale electricity.=20
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., mocked the report as full of=20
pretty colored pictures. "It really looks like the Exxon Mobil annual repor=
t,=20
and maybe that's really what it is."=20
BUSH HAS TOUGH ROW TO HOE
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer acknowledged that Bush has a=20
difficult selling job ahead. "If presidents lead by polls when it comes to=
=20
energy, America's lights will slowly go out," Fleischer said.=20
Bush's plan calls for easing regulatory barriers to more nuclear power, mor=
e=20
natural gas and oil drilling on public lands, more pipelines and a total=20
overhaul of the nation's electricity grid.=20
Environmental regulations have "created a Catch-22," Bush said, that has "t=
oo=20
often blocked environmental progress by discouraging companies from=20
installing newer and cleaner equipment."=20
Attempting to soften his policy's strong tilt toward fossil fuels, Bush=20
called for a basket of tax credits for solar, biomass, wind, geothermal and=
=20
other "green" fuels, along with a hefty consumer subsidy for hybrid cars th=
at=20
run on gasoline and electricity.=20
But he said energy-efficient California proves that "not even the most=20
admirable conservation effort could keep up with the state's demand for=20
electricity. . . . Even the sleekest laptop needs to plug into an electrica=
l=20
outlet from time to time."=20
CALL FOR NATIONWIDE GRID
Citing California's infamous "Path 15" transmission bottleneck that keeps=
=20
electricity from moving freely south to north, Bush called for the creation=
=20
of a national grid, condemning private property if necessary to make way fo=
r=20
new transmission lines.=20
"Highways connect Miami with Seattle, phone lines link Los Angeles and New=
=20
York," Bush said. "It is time to match our interstate highway and phone=20
systems with an interstate electrical grid."=20
While promising no quick relief for high gasoline prices, Bush said his pla=
n=20
to review the dozen different "boutique" fuel blends required by varying=20
environmental rules would help ease limitations on refinery production.=20
And he vowed that new technologies can make conservation painless.=20
"Conservation does not mean doing without," Bush said, citing such things a=
s=20
"smart" electric meters on homes and sensors that switch off lights when=20
people leave a room. "Wise regulation and American innovation will make thi=
s=20
country the world's leader in energy efficiency and conservation in the 21s=
t=20
century."=20
Bush's conciliatory language was a twist on former President Bill Clinton's=
=20
oft-used rhetoric to fend off criticism from the right that environmental=
=20
protection would cost jobs.=20
GREEN GROUPS MOBILIZE
While Bush is trying to keep those on the left at bay, environmental groups=
=20
promised an intense effort to kill the president's plan.=20
Bush "creates a thin veil of energy efficiency to hide a cesspool of=20
political giveaways" to the energy industry, said Dan Becker of the Sierra=
=20
Club.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein and nearly every other Democrat in the California=20
delegation attacked the plan as doing nothing to aid California, urging=20
electricity price controls instead.=20
"For Big Oil and other suppliers, the Bush energy plan is a dream come true=
,=20
" Feinstein said. "But among those most left behind are the people and=20
businesses of California who have been under siege by electricity and natur=
al=20
gas marketers bent on gouging every cent they can."=20
Environmentalists said the plan offered only a sorry sop to conservation an=
d=20
avoided calling for higher fuel-efficiency standards on sport utility=20
vehicles.=20
Yet like both political parties, environmental leaders also avoided pressin=
g=20
for public sacrifices.=20
"Most people didn't buy an SUV because they wanted to spend a lot of money =
on=20
gasoline," said Philip Clapp, president of the National Environmental Trust=
.=20
"It is not a consumer choice to buy inefficient SUVs."=20
PLAN'S PROSPECTS IN CONGRESS
The Bush plan is likely to ignite a free-for-all in Congress to divvy up=20
benefits among competing energy sources ranging from coal and nuclear power=
=20
to wind and biomass. Tax credits for "green fuels" such as solar and=20
geothermal are wildly popular in both parties.=20
Regional interests split the parties on other issues, from greater use of=
=20
coal and oil, to higher auto fuel-efficiency standards -- opposed by many=
=20
representatives in automaking states but favored by New England Republicans=
.=20
Both parties agree with Bush on encouraging construction of a huge pipeline=
=20
to bring natural gas from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska to the lower 48 states.=20
Alliances are likely between Democrats and moderate Republicans on more=20
conservation and higher efficiency standards, which have broad support.=20

Making a case for WASTE=20
President's tax credits for biomass energy development could be boon for tw=

Included in the Bush administration's 163-page energy plan is a call for ta=
x=20
credits to spur the development of biomass, a form of energy generation tha=
t=20
spans everything from old-style wood burning to futuristic processes such a=
s=20
extracting ethanol from agricultural waste.=20
Although Bush envisions biomass playing a tiny role in solving the nation's=
=20
immediate energy woes, high-level support for the technology could be=20
important for two California industries: biotechnology and agriculture.=20
Sharon Shoemaker, director of the California Institute of Food and=20
Agricultural Research at the University of California at Davis, is a=20
proponent of using biotechnology to reinvent biomass as an industry. The ai=
m=20
is to extract clean energy and mineral byproducts from plant waste, while=
=20
giving distressed farmers a new market for harvest leftovers.=20
"There's no commercial (biomass) plant like this out there yet, but we're=
=20
just on the verge of making it happen," said Shoemaker, who will hold a=20
biomass conference at Davis in June.=20
California's biomass industry, which contributes about 1.5 percent of the=
=20
state's electricity, is based primarily on burning waste wood from sawmills=
,=20
forests and orchards.=20
The keys to reinventing biomass are genetically engineered bacteria and=20
bioengineered enzymes that can turn cellulose -- the material that gives=20
plants their strength -- into ethanol in a process similar to fermenting=20
grain or grapes into alcohol.=20
In addition to producing ethanol to blend with gasoline, new biomass=20
breweries would extract valuable minerals from plants and even convert the=
=20
cellulose in plant waste into plastic substitutes.=20
"Some of our members are making shirts that feel like polyester, but they'r=
e=20
made from corn, not oil," said Megan Smith with the American Bioenergy=20
Association, a Washington, D.C., lobby whose members include the Palo Alto=
=20
biotech firm Genencor International.=20
After ethanol and mineral byproducts have been extracted from plant waste,=
=20
biomass plants would burn the remaining material, called lignin -- the=20
substance found in peat bogs. Left alone over geologic time, lignin would=
=20
compress and turn into coal.=20
Evidence of Bush's interest in biomass surfaced earlier this year, when the=
=20
administration slashed research budgets for alternative energy sources such=
=20
as wind and solar power, but barely touched biomass research. Some of that=
=20
money came to Northern California biotech firms. Genencor and Novozymes=20
Biotech in Davis each recently won competing $15 million research contracts=
=20
to cut the expense of turning cellulose into ethanol.=20
"Today the enzymes used in the process cost 45 cents per gallon of ethanol=
=20
produced," Novozymes President Glenn Nedwin said. "We want to get it down t=
o=20
5 cents a gallon."=20
From political and policy viewpoints, Bush's affinity for biomass is clear.=
=20
Gregg Morris, director of the Green Power Institute -- a Berkeley nonprofit=
=20
that performs alternative energy research -- recalled a recent ethanol=20
conference in Las Vegas.=20
"One of the agricultural lobby guys said that whenever he visits=20
administration officials, he brings a map that shows which states voted for=
=20
Bush," Morris said. The map showed solid Republican support in the farm-bel=
t=20
states that would benefit most from biomass techniques that provide new=20
markets for field waste.=20
The policy rationale for biomass energy was laid out in a 1999 article titl=
ed=20
"The New Petroleum" that appeared in the influential journal Foreign Affair=
s.=20
The authors, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and former CIA Director James=20
Woolsey, warned that America was headed for economic disaster and another=
=20
Gulf War unless it reduced oil imports. The vehicle, they said, was to use=
=20
biotechnology to turn abundant farm waste into ethanol.=20
"If genetically engineered biocatalysts and advanced processing technologie=
s=20
can make a transition from fossil fuels to biofuels affordable, the world's=
=20
security picture could be different in many ways," they said, making anothe=
r=20
oil embargo or Mideast war less likely.=20
The nation annually consumes about 120 billion gallons of gasoline and=20
produces about 1.9 billion gallons of ethanol.=20
The new biomass fever must be tempered by recognition that today's biomass=
=20
industry is controversial and subsidized, and the futuristic processing=20
plants envisioned by boosters exist only in the pilot stage.=20
California, for instance, has 29 biomass plants in operation, fueled=20
primarily by wood waste, Morris said. An equal number of biomass plants has=
=20
been idled or dismantled for a variety of reasons, including a lack of wood=
=20
for fuel. The fastest way to ramp up the wood supply would be thinning the=
=20
state's forests, but that could stir environmental opposition, Morris said.=
=20
In the Midwest, biomass has a different, though no less controversial,=20
meaning. In the grain-producing states, biomass means turning corn kernels=
=20
into ethanol. The same kernels that might get popped in the movie theater o=
r=20
fed to the livestock are instead put through an ethanol conversion plant.=
=20
Two factors make this possible. First, corn kernels are rich in starch, whi=
ch=20
is relatively easy to ferment. The stalks and the cobs -- which contain the=
=20
cellulose so valued in biomass dreams -- are thrown away because they aren'=
t=20
economical to convert.=20
Second -- and steeped in controversy -- is a 53-cent-per-gallon federal=20
subsidy that helps put it on par with competing petroleum products. Free=20
market groups, such as the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., have attacke=
d=20
this as a handout to the corn belt that primarily benefits one company --=
=20
Archer Daniels Midland -- the nation's leading ethanol producer.=20
Backers of the new biomass are counting on that subsidy to help support the=
=20
challenging task of taking ethanol from cellulose waste. "Without the=20
53-cent- a-gallon subsidy, the corn ethanol industry wouldn't be here today=
,"=20
said Mike Bryan of BBI Associates, a Colorado firm that conducts feasibilit=
y=20
studies for ethanol plants. "The cellulose ethanol industry will need simil=
ar=20
support for a while."=20
Although much of the talk about biomass centers on futuristic applications,=
=20
the newest aspect of the Bush energy plan benefits the oldest form of bioma=
ss=20
- - burning waste to generate power.=20
Smith, the Bioenergy Association lobbyist, said Bush has proposed giving=20
biomass power generators access to an existing, but unused, tax credit of 1=
.7=20
cents per kilowatt hour.=20
When Congress enacted the credit in 1992, it was intended for biomass=20

"This has cost the treasury nothing, because nobody does it," said Morris,=

Today's energy shortages far less ominous than in frantic '70s=20
Posted at 10:49 p.m. PDT Thursday, May 17, 2001=20
KEN MORITSUGU=20
WASHINGTON -- As President Bush unveiled his energy plan Thursday, nearly 2=
00=20
new power plants were under construction across the United States and 1,000=
=20
drilling rigs were burrowing for new sources of natural gas.=20
Today's high energy prices and shortages are driving massive energy-industr=
y=20
investments that over time -- with or without government intervention -- wi=
ll=20
bring supplies up and prices down.=20
To call the current situation a crisis is an exaggeration, with the excepti=
on=20
of the severe electricity shortage in California that all but guarantees=20
temporary blackouts this summer and possibly next. It pales in comparison=
=20
with the 1970s crises that forced motorists to line up for limited gasoline=
=20
supplies and drove the U.S. economy into recession.=20
``There's an electricity crisis in California,'' said Paul Krugman, a=20
Princeton University economist. ``Nothing else out there justifies talking=
=20
about a crisis. Energy demand surged in the late 1990s and the capacity for=
=20

were caught by surprise. So we have high prices by recent standards, but al=
l=20
that will solve itself.''=20
That does not mean there are not serious energy issues facing the nation,=
=20
including bottlenecks in making gasoline from crude oil, and delivering=20
electricity over heavily burdened transmission lines and natural gas throug=
h=20
nearly full pipelines.=20
But even today's high gasoline prices, when adjusted for inflation, are 30=
=20
percent lower than their historic peak in 1980.=20
Consumers enjoyed a period of extremely low energy prices for most of the=
=20
1990s. Such depressed prices won't return anytime soon. Instead, homeowners=
=20
and drivers are likely to be saddled with higher prices for gasoline, heati=
ng=20
oil and natural gas for months and maybe a few years.=20
While higher energy costs always pose a threat to the overall economy, it's=
 a=20
much more distant one today than in the 1970s. Then, oil prices soared 200=
=20
percent in a year, and the impact rippled through gasoline and electricity=
=20
markets.=20
By comparison, energy costs rose 35 percent last year and are projected to=
=20
rise an additional 9 percent this year, according to DRI-WEFA, a Lexington,=
=20
Mass., economic-forecasting firm.=20
``We're better off today, because we have a much more diversified energy=20
supply,'' said Jim Osten, chief energy economist at DRI-WEFA.=20
The country is much less dependent on oil, particularly for electricity=20
generation, where the use of coal, nuclear and more recently natural gas ha=
s=20
expanded. Also, conservation has helped contain -- though it hasn't stopped=
=20
-- the growth in energy use.=20
The one risk is California.=20
``In the end, disaster probably will be avoided, but it's going to be=20
nasty,'' Krugman said.=20
Outside California, the outlook is much less bleak. Power companies have=20
built or significantly expanded 123 power plants in the past 14 months,=20
according to Resource Data International, a Boulder, Colo.-based=20
energy-information and -consulting firm. An additional 197 are under=20
construction, up from 121 this time a year ago.=20
That pace of construction is enough to meet the upper end of the Bush=20
administration's estimate that the country will need 1,300 to 1,900 new pow=
er=20
plants over the next 20 years.=20
``We are on the right road and we are building up front a lot of what is=20
needed over the 20-year period,'' said Judah Rose, managing director of=20

Richmond, Va.-based Dominion sees no power shortages in its markets in Nort=

Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, said Thomas Capps=

the company's president.=20
Likewise, the natural-gas market is adjusting to recent supply shortages th=

last week, there were 994 rigs drilling for gas in the United States, up fr=

up from 634 a year ago and 365 two years ago, according to a weekly survey =
by=20
Baker Hughes Inc., a Houston-based maker of drilling equipment.=20
``As the price rises, there's economic incentive to drill more,'' said Gary=
=20
Flaharty, director of investor relations for Baker Hughes. ``Eventually=20
you'll drill to the point where there is enough gas on the market and the=
=20
price will come down.''=20
Still, future gas supply will have to keep up with new demand from the=20
construction boom in power plants, the vast majority of which are powered b=
y=20
natural gas.=20
To meet that expected demand, most analysts support construction of a=20
proposed pipeline to bring in new supplies of natural gas from Alaska.=20
Bush also has proposed opening previously restricted federal lands in the=

these areas, economists say there is enough of a projected need for natural=

FTCR/ Bush Energy Plan Will Make California Crisis Worse; Taxpayer=20
Boondoggles, More Deregulation Equals Higher Prices, Taxes



LOS ANGELES, May 17, 2001 (U.S. Newswire via COMTEX)  via NewsEdge=20
Corporation  - The Bush-Cheney energy
plan will make things worse for beleaguered Californians, who are facing an
economic and public health catastrophe this summer as a result of=20
deregulation,
a California-based citizen group said today.

"California's facing a catastrophe because a handful of energy companies ha=
ve
seized control of our electricity supply under deregulation, and have been
manipulating the supply of electricity to create artificial shortages and
maximize their profits," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the non-profi=
t
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "The federal government could=
=20
stop
this assault and order rate reductions and refunds of overcharges. Instead,=
=20
the
Bush-Cheney plan calls for more deregulation, massive tax breaks for energy
companies and the construction of multi-billion dollar boondoggles like=20
nuclear
power, all of which will benefit the same energy companies that are holding
California hostage."


With Bush-Cheney Plan, Crisis History Repeats Itself


FTCR noted that the last energy "crisis" to strike America was inspired not=
 by
supply shortages but by greed -- of the OPEC nations, which in the 1970s us=
ed
their control of petroleum supplies to create shortages and massive price=
=20
hikes.
American energy companies took advantage to profit from their resources as=
=20
well.
In response, the U.S. Congress passed a then-staggering multi-billion dolla=
r
billion package of tax breaks and grants to the energy industry to build po=
wer
plants that would manufacture "synthetic fuels." These plants ultimately=20
became
taxpayer-funded boondoggles, while nuclear power, hailed by the energy=20
industry
as a source of clean energy, turned out to be prohibitively expensive and a
public health threat.


Ironically, California's 1996 deregulation law required ratepayers to pay o=
ff
over $20 billion of the California utility companies' bad debts, most of wh=
ich
were incurred by the utilities as cost-overruns in construction of nuclear=
=20
power
plants in the 1970s.


"California's economy, health and safety, and the quality of life in the=20
Golden
State are threatened by the skyrocketing energy prices inspired by=20
deregulation.
The Bush-Cheney plan not only does nothing to protect us against the energy
cartel, it calls for more deregulation, higher taxes and prices," said
Rosenfield.


"In the last energy crisis, a handful of nations in the Middle East created=
 a
cartel to exploit their control over energy supplies; two decades later, a
handful of energy companies from the Southern United States have created a
cartel to exploit their control over our electricity supply," said Rosenfie=
ld.
"The only solution to the current crisis is to break the cartel: to bust th=
e
Texas-based OPEC."

PG&E's CEO faces off with angry shareholders at company's annual meeting




meeting&lt;

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE=3D


AP Business Writer=3D


SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ PG&amp;E Corp. chief executive Robert Glynn
brushed off the scorn of shareholders burned by the company's
bankrupt utility during a prickly annual meeting that ended with
three consumer activists being dragged out of the auditorium by
security officers.


Throughout out the two-hour meeting, Glynn repeatedly sought to
reassure the sometimes hostile audience of nearly 500 people that
the San Francisco-based company remained a solid long-term
investment despite the bankruptcy of its main revenue source,
Pacific Gas and Electric.


He repeated previous promises that the company intends to
recover most, if not all, of its dlrs 9 billion in unreimbursed
electricity expenses accumulated since May 2000, allowing the
utility to regain its financial footing and repay its more than
150,000 creditors.


The company is seeking rulings in bankruptcy court and other
legal venues that might open the door for the utility to
retroactively charge its customers for above-market electricity
bought from June 2000 through February of this year.


``We are not seeking a bailout, a rescue or a handout,'' Glynn
said.


Glynn's arguments didn't seem to win over many shareholders,
some of whom worried that it would take 10 years for the company's
shares to climb back above dlrs 30 _ the stock's value less than
nine months ago. PG&amp;E's stock closed Wednesday at dlrs 11, down 55
cents.


Shareholders this year also missed out on their first quarterly
dividend since World War I.


Several investors lambasted PG&amp;E's nine-member board of
directors and the company's auditors, Deloitte and Touche, but most
shareholders saved their harshest words for Glynn and his executive
team.


``The truth of the matter is you all should be fired for
incompetence,'' Orinda resident Clyde Vaughn, 79, told Glynn.


PG&amp;E agreed to an electricity rate freeze beginning in 1998 as
part of California's electricity deregulation. From January 1998
through May 2000, PG&amp;E's utility made a dlrs 2.7 billion operating
profit on electricity because the frozen customer rates were
usually much higher than the prices on the wholesale market until
last summer.

WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hou=
r=20
with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's=
=20
national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.=20
Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among othe=
r=20
things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron=
=20
and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's=20
electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building=
=20
new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush=20
unveiled yesterday reflected many of those same priorities.=20
In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other=
=20
energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says h=
e=20
sought Mr. Lay's advice because "Enron has a different take than most energ=
y=20
companies."=20
Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the=
=20
past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest=
=20
trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such=
=20
as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's=
=20
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.=20
Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with=
=20
government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based company, which was=20
President George W. Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up=
=20
its lobbying staff, boosted its political contributions and sought out=20
friends in the world of politics. Now, with Mr. Bush in the White House, it=
=20
is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.=20
Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of=20
deregulation. Just as government created immense telephone, electric and ga=
s=20
monopolies early in the last century, Enron and other players feel they nee=
d=20
the government's help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to=
=20
once-closed markets.=20
In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensu=
re=20
that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company. Rather than=
=20
having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the utilities, it want=
s=20
those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to=
=20
buy and sell power.=20
Mr. Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush=20
cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the=
=20
Texas governor's mansion with Mr. Bush. Before joining the administration,=
=20
both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative=
=20
Robert Zoellick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annua=
l=20
stipend of $50,000.=20
Under Mr. Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr. Bush during his=
=20
political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and its=20
employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive, the=
=20
Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center for=20
Responsive Politics. Enron also accounted for $461,000 in contributions=20
during Mr. Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Public=
=20
Integrity.=20
Mr. Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from=20
government is a fair shake. Enron supports candidates "you believe in," he=
=20
says. "You believe in their value system, you believe in their philosophy a=
nd=20
you believe they'll do the right things as leaders."=20
But it's clear that Mr. Lay wants more than that from government. For now, =
he=20
is focusing on FERC, where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was=
=20
known as the Federal Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in=20
beating back the power of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwat=
er=20
overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities, the=20
commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nation's transition to=
 a=20
fully deregulated energy marketplace.=20
Even before Mr. Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market powe=
r=20
of utilities. In December, FERC told the nation's utilities that it wanted=
=20
them to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines -- those that can=20
dispatch electricity across state lines -- to independent grid operators,=
=20
such as those already in place in California and the Northeast, which would=
=20
provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to submit=
=20
plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control =
of=20
their lines to such independent organizations.=20
Mr. Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct=20
control of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he cal=
ls=20
energy "balkanization" and create "seamless" interstate electricity markets=
.=20
"Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the=20
competitive side of the business," says Andre Meade, an analyst for=20
Commerzbank. "To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows=
=20
down."=20
Right now it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly=20
controlled markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout a=
nd=20
risk-management savvy to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it=
=20
frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.=
=20
In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants,=
=20
sometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using=
=20
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the=
=20
power, finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owne=
d=20
by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale=20
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for=20
electricity in the first quarter alone. Such growth pushed Enron's wholesal=
e=20
energy-trading income, before taxes and interest, up more than threefold to=
=20
$785 million during the first quarter.=20
Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979=20
million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over=
=20
the same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than=
=20
fourfold.=20
At the start of the Bush administration, FERC's future was very much up for=
=20
grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron quick=
ly=20
sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush named a frien=
d=20
of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulator Pat Wood.=
=20
Mr. Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort to open=20
Texas' retail electricity market. Mr. Wood also had shown the kind of=20
backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when =
he=20
insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened the=
ir=20
networks to competitors.=20
For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utilit=
y=20
regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block an=
=20
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and =
by=20
GOP Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of=
=20
the Philadelphia market.=20
Enron worked to raise Ms. Brownell's visibility by lobbying the House=20
Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and=
=20
as a member of an informal advisory group, say Enron and congressional aide=
s.=20
Mr. Lay provided heavyweight support. He says Enron included Ms. Brownell's=
=20
name on its "priority list" of a half-dozen prospective FERC nominees. And=
=20
when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with=20
bitter memories of her 1997 decision, Mr. Lay says he phoned Karl Rove, the=
=20
White House's top political strategist, to tell him that "she was a strong=
=20
force in getting the right outcome" in Pennsylvania."=20
A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry=20
groups weighed in in favor of Ms. Brownell, but she declined to name any. M=
s.=20
Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf=
.=20
She didn't ask the White House who had supported her because, she says, "I=
=20
didn't want to be beholden."=20
Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties=
=20
with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the commission. Earlier this=
=20
spring, the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gore's closest=20
friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr. Gore's=20
campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms. Breathit=
t=20
through Democratic politics.=20
Ms. Breathitt says she wasn't very familiar with Enron's interests, but tha=
t=20
she accepted when Mr. Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restauran=
t=20
in April to meet Richard Shapiro, Enron's managing director for government=
=20
affairs. "Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners," Ms.=20
Breathitt says, adding that she always pays for her own meals.=20
Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr. Lay has been friendl=
y=20
with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past 25 years,=
=20
sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford. He'=
s=20
been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the late 1980s, he=
=20
ran then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's fund-raising drives in Texas.=20
After the younger Bush became governor, he appointed Mr. Lay to run the=20
influential Governor's Business Council. Mr. Lay also made Enron's fleet of=
=20
corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying=
=20
officials considering Enron projects.=20
In March 1997, Mr. Lay wrote Gov. Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas=20
congressional delegation to support export-finance credits critical to Enro=
n,=20
according to letters released by the Texas State Archivist's office. In Apr=
il=20
1997, when Enron was negotiating a $2 billion natural-gas joint venture in=
=20
Uzbekistan, Mr. Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the=20
Uzbekistani ambassador to the U.S. Six months later, another Lay thank-you=
=20
note concerned a phone call Mr. Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov. Ridge to=20
support Enron's plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market. "I am=20
certain it will have a positive impact," Mr. Lay wrote.=20
Mr. Lay says he hasn't sought Mr. Bush's aid directly since Mr. Bush won th=
e=20
presidency. Last month, he talked with the president briefly at a Houston=
=20
benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, on which Mr. L=
ay=20
serves as co-chairman. "It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishin=
g=20
or sitting around and having drinks," he says.=20
Not all Mr. Lay's initiatives have been successful. When Mr. Bush reneged i=
n=20
March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions =
in=20
carbon-dioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons, Mr. Lay says he=20
telephoned Mr. Cheney to complain. "The scientific evidence, although=20
certainly not conclusive, is pretty compelling that there could be a=20
climate-change problem," he says he told the vice president. "The=20
administration should still look very seriously at it."=20
Around the same time, Mr. Lay also called Mr. Rove, the White House politic=
al=20
adviser, to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp, the head of the moderate=20
Environmental Defense Fund. Messrs. Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found=
=20
little common ground. Later, Enron, which has plans to add emission credits=
=20
to the commodities it trades, joined a coalition urging mandatory reduction=
s=20
in carbon-dioxide levels.=20
But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr. Cheney's energy task force. =
In=20
April, Mr. Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and=
=20
later, with Mr. Cheney, whom Mr. Lay had come to know well when the vice=20
president was chief of Halliburton Co., a Dallas construction company. "We=
=20
built Enron Field together," says Mr. Lay, referring to Houston's new=20
ballpark.=20
In both meetings, say Enron and White House officials, Mr. Lay presented a=
=20
broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical system and used the=20
gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both cases, he argues,=
=20
pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system=
=20
that offers easy access to all.=20
The Cheney report uses similar language, describing the electrical grid as=
=20
"the highway for interstate commerce in electricity." As Enron sought, the=
=20
report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year=20
whether it makes sense to establish a national grid, and to identify=20
bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them. An=20
effort to make the grid national would enhance FERC's power, as Enron has=
=20
urged.=20
The report is mum on some Enron concerns, such as requiring utilities to jo=
in=20
regional transmission organizations, an idea strongly opposed by the utilit=
y=20
industry. A White House aide says the task force didn't want to get involve=
d=20
in such battles between industries.=20
As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be, Enron is=
=20
worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western stat=
es=20
and possibly in New York, should electricity rates surge this summer. Nevad=
a=20

=20
wholesale-electricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the=
=20
Golden State's economy. California and Oregon are contemplating=20
state-government purchases of major utility assets.=20
Enron's biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states, o=
r=20
perhaps Congress, to control prices, which could undermine Enron's business=
.=20
In response, Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers=
=20
in New York, who each have pledged $50,000 to pay for a media and lobbying=
=20
campaign. It also has hired former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot and dispatched=
=20
him to court Western politicians. Two weeks ago, Mr. Racicot had breakfast=

Though Mr. Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr. Racicot had joined the Washingto=

sell his plan for developing new sources of energy to Congress and the=20
American people, arguing that the country had a future of ''energy=20
abundance'' if it could break free of the traditional antagonism between=20
energy producers and environmental advocates.=20
Mr. Bush's plea for a new dialogue came as his administration published the=
=20
report of an energy task force containing scores of specific proposals --=
=20
many that he can impose by executive order -- for finding new sources of=20
power and encouraging a range of new energy technologies.=20
His critics swarmed over the specifics, noting that the plan set no targets=
=20
for improved energy efficiency, offered no short-term relief for=20
out-of-control electricity prices in the West and provided only modest=20
financing for research into clean energy technology.=20
The president appeared at a highly efficient heating and cooling plant near=
=20
St. Paul that burns a variety of fuels, including oil, coal and waste wood,=
=20
to sound a theme he plans to repeat day after day. The parties in the energ=
y=20
debate have ''yelled at each other enough,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Now it's time=
=20
to listen to each other.'' [Excerpts, Page A14.]=20
''Too often Americans are asked to take sides between energy production and=
=20
environmental protection,'' Mr. Bush added, before flying here, to a farmin=
g=20
town north of Des Moines, to continue his argument at a small biomass plant=
=20
that makes power by burning materials derived from animal waste and plants.=
=20
''As if people who revere the Alaskan wilderness do not also care about=20
America's energy future; as if the people who produce America's energy do n=
ot=20
care about the planet their children will inherit.''=20
Mr. Bush appeared to be weaving a careful political thread, arguing that if=
=20
America failed to act now, ''this great country could face a darker future,=
 a=20
future that is, unfortunately, being previewed in rising prices at the gas=
=20
pump and rolling blackouts in the great state of California.''=20
Mr. Bush also said rising energy prices had put an intolerable burden on=20
families and farmers. But some of the statistics in his own report seemed t=
o=20
undercut that claim. One chart showed that the share of disposable househol=
d=20
income spent on energy had declined to less than 5 percent today from 8=20
percent during the early days of the Reagan administration. (That percentag=
e=20
has begun to rise again, but only to the levels of the mid-1990's, before a=
=20
sharp drop in energy prices.)=20
Mr. Bush talked not only of blackouts but of blackmail, raising the specter=
=20
of a future in which the United States is increasingly vulnerable to foreig=
n=20
oil suppliers. He argued, for example, that the Arctic National Wildlife=20
Reserve, which he wants to open to drilling, can produce 600,000 barrels of=
=20
oil a day for the next 47 years. ''That happens to be exactly the amount th=
e=20
United States now imports from Iraq,'' he said.=20
Opening the Alaskan refuge to drilling is just one source of contention wit=
h=20
Democrats and some moderate Republicans, many of whom argue that the Bush=
=20
administration has put undue emphasis on increasing supplies of fossil fuel=
s=20
at the expense of the environment.=20
Critics say that although the report seems designed to suggest a balanced=
=20
approach, it minimizes the potential role of alternative sources of energy=
=20
and the possibility of reducing future demand through efficiency and=20
conservation.=20
''America must embrace the promise offered by new technologies,'' said=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut. ''The energy crisis i=
s=20
not an excuse for creating an environmental crisis.''=20
Republicans offered far more support for the president. Senator Frank H.=20
Murkowski of Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said he plann=
ed=20
hearings next week to begin consideration of 25 recommendations in the Bush=
=20
report that require legislative action.=20
''Not everyone is going to like this plan,'' Mr. Murkowski said, ''but at=
=20
least now we have a plan to kick around.''=20
He said the previous administration had failed to grapple with the nation's=
=20
energy sources through a comprehensive plan. Clinton administration officia=
ls=20
disputed the assertion and blamed Congress for failing to enact energy=20
legislation.=20
Yet even Mr. Murkowski sounded a note of caution about Mr. Bush's approach.=
=20
He said the report offered few immediate remedies for California's=20
electricity crisis or for rising gasoline prices. He said Republicans might=
=20
have to consider a gas-tax rollback or the temporary suspension of some=20
environmental provisions to address supply bottlenecks.=20
Mr. Bush was praised by many groups for laying out a long-term energy polic=
y.=20
His report contained 105 initiatives -- although many of them are=20
endorsements of actions already in place. And while in his public comments =
he=20
always started with talk of conservation, the report itself was much more=
=20
specific when it came to tapping new supplies.=20
''No matter how much we conserve, we're still going to need more energy,'' =
he=20
said here this afternoon. ''The State of California is the second best stat=
e=20
at conservation, and yet they are still running out of energy.''=20
Among those who took a different view was former president Jimmy Carter, wh=
o=20
wrote in The Washington Post this morning that the United States did not=20
confront an energy crisis comparable to those of 1973 and 1979.=20
''World supplies are adequate and reasonably stable, price fluctuations are=
=20
cyclical, reserves are plentiful,'' he argued. Mr. Carter said ''exaggerate=
d=20
claims seem designed to promote some long-frustrated ambitions of the oil=
=20
industry at the expense of environmental quality.''=20
Some chapters of the energy plan resemble the annual reports issued by ener=
gy=20
companies, with color photos of bears living happily in the wilderness,=20
forests that can absorb carbon dioxide and fly-fishermen wading in pristine=
=20
water, practicing the favorite sport of the report's main author, Vice=20
President Dick Cheney.=20
While the report clinically assessed all the available sources of energy an=
d=20
promised to encourage development of those that do the least environmental=
=20
damage, it fell far short of describing the moon-shot approach to efficienc=
y=20
and renewable energy that was an ambition of the Carter years.=20
In fact, federal spending on research and development of wind, solar,=20
geothermal and biomass energy sources, as well as on energy efficiency=20
technology, has never equaled the $3 billion spent in 1980, Mr. Carter's=20
final year in office, even after adjustments for inflation.=20
If the Bush plan were fully put into effect, it would potentially double wh=
at=20
the administration had planned to spend over 10 years for renewable energy=
=20
research and for tax incentives for people and companies that purchase=20
energy-efficient products, like hybrid cars.=20
But the estimated $10 billion commitment over that period is below what the=
=20
Clinton administration had projected spending for roughly the same period,=
=20
and well below what energy experts say would be required to make some=20
cutting-edge energy technologies commonplace.=20
''Americans spend $600 billion a year on energy,'' said John Holdren, an=20
energy and environmental policy expert at Harvard who helped draft a Clinto=
n=20
administration study of clean energy sources. ''The Bush people are proposi=
ng=20
to change habits by incentives that amount to about one-tenth of one percen=
t=20
of that amount each year. It's not very significant.''=20
Though the report devotes more chapters and more recommendations to measure=
s=20
related to the environment, conservation and renewable energy than those=20
related to traditional sources the impact of what the administration intend=
s=20
to do to increase traditional energy supplies greatly outweighs what it=20
aspires to do to diminish demand.=20
The report notes that efficiency in homes and offices could help reduce the=
=20
need for new power plants, which it says must total at least 1,300 by 2020.=
=20
But it adopts no goal for such improvements.=20
In the same manner, addressing auto efficiency standards, the report review=
s=20
how Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates improved the performance of=20
combustion engines in the 1980's. But it puts off any decision on whether t=
o=20
raise those standards now, saying the administration would wait for a study=
=20
to be completed.=20
The report is far less tentative in the area regulations it identifies as=
=20
hindering the oil, gas, nuclear and utility industries.=20
It mentions about a dozen areas -- including land-use restrictions in the=
=20
Rockies, lease stipulations on offshore areas attractive to oil companies,=
=20
the vetting of locations for nuclear plants, environmental reviews to upgra=

asked to reduce peak power use in California in coming months, but that is=
=20
far less than California officials want.=20
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, called the plan ''a bible=

for long-term energy production and not even a pamphlet for the urgent=20
short-term actions needed to help us get out of the crisis'' in her home=20
state. She particularly criticized Mr. Bush's refusal to call for electrici=

In what seems likely to be one of its most contested recommendations, the=

=09"If we fail to act, Americans will face more, and more widespread,=20
blackouts," Bush said. "America cannot allow that to be our future, and we=

He decried a "smorgasbord of handouts and subsidies for virtually every=20

=09On Capitol Hill, reactions to Bush's proposals fell predictably along pa=

=09Bush is the first president since Jimmy Carter in 1979 to ask Americans =

times. Carter proposed a windfall profits tax for oil companies and asked=

citizens to follow the speed limit, drive 15 fewer miles a week and carpool=

Thanks to technology, it can mean doing better and smarter and cheaper."=20
=09The plan leaves many issues to be hashed out. For instance, it directs E=
