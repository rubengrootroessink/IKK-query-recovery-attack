A first cut at the response to CDWP's most recent Notice and Invitation to 
Bid is attached for review and comment.  

Please note that it does not include information regarding the EPMI proposal 
or the EES proposal.  This will be added as received.  We will also need to 
attach forms of the EEI Master and ISDA Master prior to submission to CDWP.
