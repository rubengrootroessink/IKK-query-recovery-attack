****************************************************************
EARN MORE THAN MANY BANK CHECKING ACCOUNTS
WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT AT SCHWAB!
****************************************************************

Dear Schwab Signature Services(TM) Client,

Because you're a valued client, we wanted to let you know about
the many benefits of moving your Direct Deposit to Schwab.

Direct Deposit allows you to automatically transfer funds to
your Schwab account, where you can earn more than many bank
checking accounts.

With Direct Deposit, there are no hold times, so your money is
available immediately for investing or checkwriting.  Plus, you
save time because you don't have to mail checks or visit a
branch to make deposits.

If you already have Direct Deposit, many employers will allow
you to split the deposit between two or more institutions.  You
can keep some portion of your Direct Deposit where it is, and
move the rest to your Schwab account.

Select the link below for instructions on how to set up Direct Deposit.

For questions, call your Signature Services team.


Sincerely,

Mark Sifling
Vice President,
Electronic Payment Products
