I'll check the surf report and maybe go out earlier, and then meet up with
y'all. OR you could come towards the end of my session, and meet me. (We
need to take two cars anyway, because of C's bass, and other issues, I'm
sure.) Or, you could come out for a surf there, Jeffro, while the chickies
cool their heels on the beach (or at the local bar...). Bolinas is an easy
wave, and a great place to surf. But, it takes a south, which might not be
happenin'. We'll just have to wait and see.
