SUBJECT: ENERGY COST IMPACTS - SECOND REQUEST 

WE NEED YOUR IMMEDIATE HELP! 

In June, the CPUC allocated the largest electric rate increase in history.? 
The vast majority of the increase was allocated to the largest business 
customers, who received rate increases of 60% to 87%.? Some customers have 
reported June bills with increases as high as 140%. 

Now, the Assembly and Senate are about to act on legislation to deal with 
Southern California Edison's (SCE) nearly $4 billion under collection 
(debt).? As currently drafted, SBX2 78 would allocate all the SCE debt to 
business customers. 

The Senate has already passed SBX2 78 and the Assembly has scheduled a 
Friday, July 27 vote on the bill. 

It is critical that we understand the impact that higher rates are having on 
manufacturers and their ability to remain competitive in California.? Without 
clear examples of how increased electricity rates are impacting large users, 
our ability to stop additional cost shifts to industrial users is severely 
hampered. 

We need your help to make our message loud and clear.? If you have been hurt 
by the soaring cost of electricity, let us know your story in an email or 
phone call. 

Examples may be in the form of product price increases, plant slowdowns, 
layoffs, reductions in force, putting expansion plans on hold, sending 
production out of state, etc. 

It would be most helpful if we could use the name of your company along with 
your story, but if you prefer that your information remain anecdotal, we will 
respect your confidentiality. 
? 
If you have already responded to our earlier solicitation for information, 
thank you.? If you have an update, please let us know. 

Please reply by return email, fax (916/447-9401) or by calling me at 
916/498-3329. 

P.S.? We also need information from PG&E customers.? If the legislature 
agrees to the Edison deal, it is likely to become the template for repaying 
the PG&E debt.
