Within the context of the current situation it makes sense.  But are you
really intending that Enron will pay the difference between the bundled rate
and the cost of power purchased by DWR when Sutter gets a bill for that from
PG&E?  If you are this makes sense.  If not, we should not send it and need
to discuss it further.  Mike Day

Jeff and Mike--attached is a letter we propose to send to our customer
Sutter Health as a "we're here for you" type gesture.  There has been some
UCCSU-type noise from this customr and we want to try to head it off.  Could
you please review and comment on my language regarding the rate surcharges
and make sure I've got the point right? What I want to make clear is that
these rate surcharges have no bearing on our K (we're covering them) and
that our decision to D-DASR these accounts has no bearing on the effect of
such surcharges on the completion of our K.  Please let me know if this
makes sense.  We are trying to get this out in the am, so if you can comment
tonite or first thing tomorrow that would be great.  Just respond to my work
e-mail at msmith1@enron.com.  Thanks.  Mike Smith
