LOS ANGELES --- The Legislature likely will decide whether the state's thre=
e=20
investor-owned utilities will be able to recoup $4.2 billion from consumers=
=20
for the high cost of purchasing wholesale electricity this summer, a state=
=20
assemblyman said Thursday at a meeting of the California Public Utilities=
=20
Commission.

Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, told state regulators that because s=
o=20
much money is at stake, the Legislature is the best forum to determine=20
whether the utilities should recover billions in electricity costs that=20
consumers have not paid because of a rate freeze.  He said the Legislature=
=20
"will probably decide the issue" but that it also could end up in court. =
=20
Wright is chairman of the Assembly Utility and Commerce Committee.

The utilities commission had no plans to vote on the issue Thursday.  Rathe=
r,=20
it held its regularly scheduled meeting in Los Angeles to give consumer=20
groups the opportunity to voice concerns on a variety of issues, ranging fr=
om=20
electricity to telecommunications.=20

About a dozen groups appealed to regulators to solve California's electrici=
ty=20
crisis before prices escalate throughout the state.  They argued that=20
low-income and minority residents would be hardest-hit if higher prices and=
=20
the utilities' billions in costs are passed on to consumers.

The commission, the Legislature and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n=20
are working to resolve before next summer the issues that brought the state=
=20
to the brink of rolling blackouts this summer.=20

The unexpectedly high cost of power, coupled with rate caps for most=20
utilities in the state, left utilities with a shortfall between the wholesa=
le=20
price of power utilities paid this summer and what they were able to collec=
t=20
from consumers under a rate freeze.=20

The state's giant utilities - Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric - have filed petitions with state=20
regulators to recover at least $4.2 billion.  Though Wright criticized=20
aspects of the state's 2-year-old experiment with deregulation, "the=20
constitution doesn't allow regulators to put the utilities in an upside-dow=
n=20
situation," he said.=20

"It's of grave concern to the public that this commission seems more willin=
g=20
to bail out the utilities than to represent consumers," Doug Heller, an=20
assistant director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, told=
=20
the utilities commission.

The commission voted Thursday on one issue of importance to about 2,500 lar=
ge=20
businesses throughout the state.  The companies, which volunteered to recei=
ve=20
reduced electricity rates in exchange for having their power cut during pea=
k=20
periods of demand, helped keep California from suffering rolling blackouts=
=20
this summer.=20

On 17 days during the summer, state utilities called on large customers in=
=20
voluntary programs to cut power use.  Many of the companies had planned to=
=20
opt out of their contracts with utilities during a renewal period in=20
November.=20

But the PUC, citing a provision in the contracts, voted 4-1 to force the=20
companies to remain in the contracts until March.

Only large industrial and commercial customers who signed up for the=20
voluntary programs after 1998 can get out of their contracts in November.=
=20

Gary Fabrizi, founder of Premier Utility Consultants in Laguna Niguel, said=
=20
few commercial customers will be affected by the decision because most can=
=20
now opt out in March, before the peak summer demand and the anticipation th=
at=20
more emergencies will be called next summer.=20

But he said the vote limits the ability of businesses to make contracts wit=
h=20
other service providers, such as Enron Energy Services Inc.  of Houston,=20
before March.  That gives the large incumbent utilities, such as Edison and=
=20
PG&E, months to ramp up their programs to sell energy services to large=20
businesses.

"It's unclear if the commission is stalling or if they're trying to make=20
arrangements that coincide with other interruptible programs," Fabrizi said=
.

In a related matter, the commission approved an application by PG&E to sell=
=20
$1.4 billion in short-term debt, which the utility said it needs to cover t=
he=20
cost of wholesale power.  Edison was granted a similar request last month t=
o=20
sell $1.3 billion in short-term debt.=20

The only residential customers affected have been confined to SDG&E in San=
=20
Diego and south Orange County.=20
