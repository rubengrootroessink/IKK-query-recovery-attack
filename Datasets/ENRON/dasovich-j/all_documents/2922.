RE: Requests to Speak at FERC's November 9th Conference on California

Attached is FERC's Notice of the November 9th Conference, scheduling the 
meeting and setting out procedures for requesting an opportunity to speak.  
The conference will be held in Washington, at FERC's headquarters, beginning 
at 9:00 a.m.  Requests to speak should be directed to the Commission's 
Secretary, David Boergers, by e-mail and in writing, by Friday, November 
3rd.  Requests to speak should include the name, title and company or parties 
the speaker represents, along with a brief (not to exceed one page) sumary of 
the issues the speaker wishes to address.  Please let us know if you request 
a speaking opportunity, so we can attempt to follow-up with the FERC staff.

In addition, we will host a pre-meeting for those attending the FERC 
conference in our conference room on Wednesday, November 8th, from 2:00 to 
5:00 p.m.  In combination with our weekly conference call we can prepare for 
the FERC conference and begin planning our comments on today's order.

If you have any questions, please contact Julie Simon at 202-789-7200 or 
jsimon@epsa.org.
