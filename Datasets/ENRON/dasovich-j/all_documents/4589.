We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points 
with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today 
when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?

Subject: Talking points about California Gas market

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
