Energy Committee Members and friends,

I will be off on vacation this week from April 9-13, returning on the 16th.
Not that I won't miss you all and the issues
of great interest and drama, but it is past time to take a holiday with my
children on their spring break with some camping on the coast.

With John Redding also out this week on the shores of the Mediterranean in
Nice, France and K.C. Mares buried in his Exodus obligations,
Derek Naten of Roche Bioscience has graciously agreed to chair the energy
committee meeting this afternoon.  There is much
to discuss at today's meeting with the Governor's proposed rate plan and the
announced Chapter 11 reorganization by PG&E and your guest
speakers on energy R&D, Terry Searles of the CEC and Clark Gellings of EPRI.

Laura Goldseth will also ably respond to your needs this week as she is
able.  Her phone number is 408 501 7870.  I will stay in touch and
be able to respond to emergencies by phone.

Have a great week.  I look forward to seeing you again soon.

Justin
