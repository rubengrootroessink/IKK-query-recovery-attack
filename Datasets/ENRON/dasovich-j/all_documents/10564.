Hello Everyone,
Each year, we have an opportunity to recognize a faculty member who has
distinguished him/herself among his/her peers.  Faculty who receive the
Outstanding Teacher Award are recognized for this important accomplishment
by both the UC Berkeley Campus and the Haas School of Business.  The award
really does mean a lot to the faculty members, so if you feel strongly about
a teacher's performance, I urge you to reward them with a nomination.  Last
year's award went to David Levine (Core: Macroeconomics) with honorable
mentions to Michael Katz (Elective: Competitive Strategy) and Jonathan Berk
(Core: Finance).  All teachers that receive nominations will be recognized
in the SAC Newsletter.

Thanks to those of you that submitted nominations from your Fall 2000
classes.  We are currently soliciting nominations for Spring 2001 courses.
Just submit a written recommendation to me via e-mail based on the
guidelines listed below.  Alternatively, you may submit a hard copy to the
Evening MBA office. Only nominations with a written explanation will be
considered. The more compelling your recommendation, the greater the weight
it will carry.  The Spring 2001 nominations will be considered with the Fall
2000 nominations to determine the winner.  Please try to have your
nominations in by April 9th.

Thanks, in advance, for your support of this important and prestigious
award.
