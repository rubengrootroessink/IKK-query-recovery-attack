Jeff,

Thank you so much for all the info and the map you provided.

I went to the website of both Socal and SDG&E to get the tariff.  However, I 
don't really understand how they can be worked out into one.  If you can 
provide insights on that, or get the tariff numbers to me, I will be very 
much appreciated.  Above all, you are the expert!

Thanks again,

Ming

To get from the California border down to Mexico, you would get service off 
of SoCalGas' and SDG&E's tariff (i.e., you have to wheel through SoCalGas and 
SDG&E to get there.  There may be a single tariff for that service, however 
(rather than taking service off of two tariffs).  I'll try to get the tariff 
numbers and get back to you.  All the tariffs are on Sempra's website.

Best,
Jeff
