Hello all,

As you know every semester we provide parking passes or shuttle services
(from the South Bay or Peninsula) to and from Haas.  Every semester you
need to complete the attached  "Transportation Commitment Form," regardless
of the fact that you are staying with your prior transportation method.
 You have to fill out this form every semester.  You must return this form
by Friday, April 27 to the Evening MBA program office.  If we do not have
it by then we will assume that you do not need any transportation
assistance from us.

Please print out the attached Transportation Commitment Form.  You may fax
it back, e-mail it, mail it, or hand deliver it to us.  Any which way you
prefer, just before April 27, 2001.

Thanks!
