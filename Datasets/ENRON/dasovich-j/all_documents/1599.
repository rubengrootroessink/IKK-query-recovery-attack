Re:   Presidential Polls

----------------------------------------------------

I thought this information might be of interest to you.

Governor Bush leads Al Gore in two of three national tracking polls:

Bush 41%  Gore 37%...Voter.com/Battleground

Bush 44%  Gore 41%...Rasmussen Research

Bush 44%  Gore 48%...CNN/Gallup

Some historical perspective: Battleground had the most accurate polls over 
the past two Presidential elections.  Their final pre-election surveys 
predicted both races' margin within a point of the actual outcome.
