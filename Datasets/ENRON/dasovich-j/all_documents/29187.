FYI, I got a call from Chris Palmeri at Business Week about why Ken wasn't 
going to LA.  I said we can't trust them, their highest ranking legal 
official threatened to throw Ken in jail before he had even conducted an 
investigation, Dunn's committee voted to hold us in contempt for going to 
court to seek a neutral third-party ruling on our objections, and one of the 
committee members called him a fascist.  Any questions???

The reporter called Dunn, and this is what he was told...

Subject: Re: FW: Dow Jones Story w/ Overcharge Amounts

just a couple of follow up things. i spoke to senator dunn, he said the hold 
up is that you want to the confidentially ordered by a court so that a judge 
could enforce it. dunn doesn't want to involve the courts in a legislative 
proceeding. is that what this all boils down to?

also, dunn says that he couldn't throw ken in jail, because he hasn't 
personally been held in contempt and that there is no way he would depose him 
this soon. can you tell me what your lawyers exactly were afraid of?

thanks.
