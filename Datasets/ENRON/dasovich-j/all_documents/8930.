Please see attached draft memo.? There is no pride of authorship here, so 
slash and burn and challenge as you see fit.? Also, indicate in your response 
if you think we need to discuss live and if so, when.

Hope this isn't too far off the mark.? We also need to incorporate Mark's 
cash flow statement and assumptions into another attachment, as well as 
Jeff's thoughts on the funding of expansion.

Thanks! 
- Carolyn
