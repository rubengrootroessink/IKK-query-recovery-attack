I apologize that the earlier note from our MBA Social chair didn't reach
you earlier.  I want to clarify a couple of questions and reach out to you
to participate in tonight's competition.

Evening MBA's are eligible to compete.  Tonight will be the only night to
try out.   I understand that all of you have class until around 9:30 pm.  I
will not start the competition until 9:45 pm to give you a chance to
attend.  In addition, if you miss the first set of category competitions
there will be two more throughout the night that you can jump in and tryout
for.  The following is the breakdown of how the competition will run:

1st set - Science & Art/Literature  (Starts at 9:45 pm)
2nd set - Sports & Entertainment  (Starts 5 minutes after the end of set #1)
3rd set - History & Geography (Starts 5 minutes after the end of set #2)
4th set - All Categories for top 2 runnerups in first 3 sets (Starts 5
minutes after the end of set #3)

I will ask 15 questions for each set and take the top person who answers
the most questions in the set.  The second and 3rd place finishers of each
set will then be paired in a 4th set of competition where I will ask 15
questions from all the categories.  The winner of that set will be the 4th
member of the team.

PS - Beckett's is giving us $1 off on pints of Guiness and Caffrey's.

Address again is:
