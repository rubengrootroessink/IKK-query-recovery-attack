Jeff:

Following up on your request of last week, my records on offers made but not 
closed is pretty weak. All three utilities held numerous RFPs over the late 
summer autum.  We participated in all of them.  We ended up closing only 2 
transactrions as a reuslt of the RFP process and a 3rd was closed with SCE 
throught the broker market.  I do not keep offers made and not acceptable.  
There were quite a few of them.  SDG&E had the most RFPs, probably 4 -5 and 
we sent in prices for all of them.  SCE was in second with 3 or so and we 
were successful in 1.  SCE had several too and we were not successful, but 
the next day were matched up with them through the broker market at a lower 
price than we showed them in the RFP as the price had moved down.

Call me to discuss when you get in.
