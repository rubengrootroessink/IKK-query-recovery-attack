Yes on regulatory.  Discussion, not power point, followed by Q&A.  Kirk will 
send to you via email by noon your time an agenda and possibly a couple of 
graphics to guide the discussion.  Can you distribute to the group when you 
get them?  Does getting them by noon work OK?

just want to be sure that kirk is planning to walk us through the regulatory 
situation with regard to ERCs and RECLAIM and then available for Q&A.  Is he 
planning a power point or will it be discussion?  Did he provide youwith an 
agenda?
