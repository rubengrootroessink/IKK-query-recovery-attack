3 new plants to generate electricity within weeks=20



Increase in supply reduces threat of summer blackouts
By Ed Mendel=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 25, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that three new power plants wi=
ll=20
begin operating within 17 days, giving California its first new major=20
generators in more than a decade and easing the threat of blackouts this=20
summer.=20
News about the plants comes on the heels of other developments about=20
conservation and additional power supply that have given state officials=20
increasing confidence in California's ability to survive the power crisis=
=20
this summer.=20
"Optimistically," said Davis, "our conservation and generation effort will=
=20
help us minimize any disruptions this summer."=20

One of the new plants was scheduled to begin operating in August but instea=
d=20
will come on line Wednesday. Edison International's Sunrise plant near=20
Bakersfield will supply 320 megawatts. A megawatt can provide enough power=
=20
for 750 to 1,000 households.=20
In addition to the Edison facility, Calpine will open its 500-megawatt Sutt=
er=20
plant near Yuba City on July 2 and its 559-megawatt Los Medanos plant near=
=20
Pittsburg 10 days later. Both plants are expected to open according to=20
schedule.=20
"In the next 17 days we will put more power on line than California did in=
=20
the last 12 years," Davis said.=20
During the past decade, the governor said, the state added less than 1,000=
=20
megawatts with a number of small power plants, despite population growth an=
d=20
increased power demand from the high-tech industry.=20
The fast-track modernization of a 450-megawatt Huntington Beach plant is=20
expected by late August. The plant was shut down about five years ago.=20
By September, Davis said, the addition of eight to 10 small plants that=20
operate during peak-load periods, as well as increased power from a variety=
=20
of other small generators, will raise the total of new power coming this=20
summer to 4,000 megawatts.=20
As further protection against blackouts, state power buyers revealed last=
=20
week that in recent months they have been able to send some surplus=20
electricity to a Canadian utility, BC Hydro, which will return the power in=
=20
July and August.=20
Despite efforts to increase the state's energy supply this summer, more=20
ultimately will be needed. California has been importing about 20 percent o=
f=20
its power in recent years. Even though about a dozen power plants are=20
approved or under construction, Davis does not expect supply to match deman=
d=20
until late 2003. Until then, the state will need surplus electricity=20
generation to make the deregulated market work properly, experts say.=20
Davis has said in the past that California should add 20,000 megawatts of=
=20
power generation in the years ahead. A new state Power Authority has been=
=20
created that could construct or buy power plants if the private sector does=
=20
not build a surplus of electricity generation.=20
Also, state officials suggest the trend among Californians to conserve=20
electricity may grow.=20
The state is spending $850 million on conservation programs, including=20
funding for energy-efficient equipment and an advertising campaign. The=20
program gives refunds to customers who dramatically reduce their electricit=
y=20
consumption this summer.=20
State officials also expect electricity use to be reduced by "sticker shock=
"=20
from rate increases beginning this month for Edison and Pacific Gas and=20
Electric customers. Ratepayers are exempt from the increase if they use 130=
=20
percent or less of the baseline level of electricity, a minimal amount that=
=20
varies with regional climate zones.=20
A proposal to increase rates for San Diego Gas & Electric customers is=20
pending before the state Public Utilities Commission.=20
In addition to announcing the new plants, Davis yesterday reiterated his=20
demand that California deserves $8.9 billion in refunds from overcharges by=
=20
power companies. That issue will be the subject of mediation sessions that=
=20
begin today in Washington.=20
When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed regional price limits=
=20
last week, the regulators asked an administrative law judge to recommend=20
possible refunds by generators for overcharging.=20
Davis said the California negotiating team will be led by Michael Kahn,=20
chairman of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's=20
electricity grid.=20
Davis said Kahn's team will present information supporting California's cla=
im=20
of overcharging. The administrative law judge, Curtis Wagner Jr., suggested=
=20
last week that California may be owed a smaller amount, $2 billion to $2.5=
=20
billion.=20
The governor sent Wagner a brief letter replying to the judge's request for=
 a=20
list of issues that should be considered in the conference.=20
"Our list is short," Davis said in the letter. "The conference must address=
=20
the need to have FERC order power sellers to refund the estimated $8.9=20
billion they have overcharged the people of the State of California."=20
While that session is taking place, Davis today plans to meet in Sacramento=
=20
with President Bush's two new appointees to the five-member FERC, Pat Wood=
=20
III of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.=20
Davis said that when he met with the president last month, Bush agreed to=
=20
send Wood to California to investigate natural gas prices, which are severa=
l=20
times higher in California than in New York.=20
"We agreed that there is no explanation for the disparity of prices between=
=20
California and New York when it comes to natural gas," Davis said. "We agre=
ed=20
that was wrong."=20
The governor also said he will meet this morning with three former employee=
s=20
of Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant who have accused the company of=20
altering the plant's output to boost power prices.=20
The employees last week told a state Senate committee that they were ordere=
d=20
to reduce power during peak-load periods and throw away good replacement=20
parts, which sometimes delayed maintenance.=20
"There may be another side to the story," Davis said. "But these three=20
employees worked 20 years, had no reason to mislead the state Senate, and=
=20
they testified under oath."=20
Duke denied wrongdoing and said power was reduced at the request of the=20
agency that runs the power grid, the Independent System Operator.=20
A Davis spokesman said yesterday that he did not know if the former employe=
es=20
could qualify for a reward. In April, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer=
=20
announced a whistle-blower reward for information on price-gouging by power=
=20
generators.=20
Lockyer said the reward would be based on a percentage of what the state=20
recovers as a result of the information. He said the reward could be worth=
=20
$50 million or more.=20









Lucky Redding has energy to spare=20

community is an island. "And we feel very fortunate," says Violet Klaseen,=
=20
who has lived here 40 years.=20
Electricity rates in the San Diego area could climb an average 19 percent=

Redding runs its own power company. Redding Electric Utility operates outsi=

How did this working-class town near Mount Shasta get in this enviable=20
position? Was it business savvy? Luck?=20
"It was a combination of things," says utility director James Feider.=20
First came pain. Some utilities trimmed rates in the late 1990s as the stat=
e=20
moved to deregulate the energy market. But Redding Electric raised rates 23=
=20
percent to pay off $300 million in power plant debt and other costs.=20
Customers came unglued. Bills rose from 8 cents per kilowatt-hour to more=
=20
than a dime.=20
Today it's pocket money. Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. pay an=
=20
average 14.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. That figure is expected to climb in=
=20
coming weeks. PG&E customers pay an average 15.6 cents, among the highest=
=20
rates in the nation.=20
Redding's rate will return to 8 cents next year, once the utility pays off=
=20
most debts. The company serves the city's 80,000 residents.=20
The utility is also focused on the future while many other agencies scrambl=
e=20
to meet short-term demands. Redding Electric is expanding capacity of its=
=20
natural gas-fired power plant by about 50 percent.=20
When the project is finished next year, Redding will produce more than half=
=20
of its own electricity.=20
Enron Corp., the nation's biggest electricity trader, will also supply ener=
gy=20
to the city utility at 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Enron and Redding=20
Electric struck the deal last fall, before prices went from high to=20
astronomical.=20
Redding Electric is unusual among city-run power companies in California=20
because it has no direct ties to the major utilities.=20
"We've made some good strategic decisions," says Feider, who has run the=20
outfit since 1998. He's also president of the California Municipal Utilitie=
s=20
Association.=20
Gov. Gray Davis recently blasted municipal power companies, accusing them o=
f=20
selling energy to the state at rip-off prices. He threatened to seize their=
=20
electricity, saying, "We're going to get that power one way or another."=20
The governor said city-run companies have charged the state 10 percent more=
=20
than the average price demanded by private generators.=20
But Feider says the governor was out of line. Feider says Redding Electric=
=20
could have sold its power elsewhere for more profit. One of the governor's=
=20
top energy advisers has said outfits such as Redding Electric have played=
=20
fair with the state.=20
Feider also says his utility needed to boost its sales price to cover the=
=20
skyrocketing cost of natural gas.=20
"We're willing to be cooperative and bend over backward, and here we get=20
attacked by the governor," he says.=20
Redding officials stress the hometown customers come first.=20
"I don't think we owe the rest of the state anything," says council member=
=20
Pat Kight. On the other hand, "we don't want to be isolationists up here. W=
e=20
want to be good neighbors."=20
Redding provided the state with power late last year to help California avo=
id=20
blackouts. But it stopped selling to the state in January, after state grid=
=20
operators didn't pay a $5 million bill.=20
Redding is willing to help in a pinch, if the state can guarantee payment.=
=20
The utility also preaches conservation despite having power to spare. Energ=

The company was created in 1920. There are about 30 city-run electric=20

On Monday, officials from the state, the utilities and the generators meet=

Carolina-based company that owns three other power plants in California. Du=
ke=20
officials will be allowed to testify at a future hearing of the committee.=
=20
At one point during yesterday's hearing, Peace read from the lease that=20
allows Duke to run the 706-megawatt South Bay plant. It requires Duke to=20
operate and maintain the plant according to "prudent utility practices."=20
Peace asked the mechanics whether Duke met these standards.=20
Both mechanics, Ed Edwards Jr. and Glenn Johnson, said no.=20
"It's prudent to making money," Johnson said of Duke's practices. "It's not=
=20
prudent to operating it safely."=20
The mechanics said Duke powered the turbines up and down so often the=20
equipment was in jeopardy of breaking down. They also testified that=20
supervisors required them to throw away new spare parts, a practice they=20
believe led to longer outages because they had to keep generators offline=
=20
while more parts were ordered.=20
Johnson testified that Duke reduced the maintenance staff at the South Bay=
=20
plant to seven or eight mechanics from 35. He said when he started with=20
SDG&E, the company took special pride in careful maintenance policies=20
designed to keep the equipment operating smoothly.=20
That all changed, he said, under deregulation. It changed even more when Du=
ke=20
took control of the plant about April 1999.=20
"We were told we were no longer a family," Johnson said. "We were a=20
business."=20
And the business was lucrative, company officials had told the former=20
employees, even before prices started soaring last year.=20
About three months after the company took over the lease in April 1999, Duk=
e=20
held a party at which plant manager Tom Guthrie told workers the plant had=
=20
made as much money in three months as the company had expected in a year,=
=20
according to the former employees.=20
Last year, the company held a similar party to mark the first anniversary o=
f=20
the lease. Executives again were ecstatic. They told workers they had made =
as=20
much money in the first year as they had expected to make in five years, th=
e=20
former employees testified.=20
The company's prosperity has continued. During the first quarter of this=20
year, Duke reported that profits increased 208 percent from energy sales an=
d=20
trading.=20
Johnson also testified that Guthrie had told employees they weren't in the=
=20
electricity business, but the money-making business. As a result, he said, =
if=20
Duke could make more money selling the natural gas that powers the=20
electricity turbines, the company would shut the turbines down.=20
Guthrie's comments seem to contradict the plant's status as a "must-run"=20
plant that is required to take direction from the Independent System=20
Operator, which manages the state's electricity grid.=20
Attorney Michael Aguirre, who has criticized the Duke lease as a "sweethear=
t=20
deal," said he hopes the new information will help the public gain control =
of=20
the South Bay plant. Aguirre is suing Duke and other power companies, and h=
e=20
persuaded the former plant employees to testify.=20
"It's huge, because this means we can take back the plant," he said. "We ca=
n=20
operate the plant for the people of San Diego and lower utility bills."=20
Hall, the Duke vice president, said he does not expect the testimony to lea=
d=20
to a challenge of the lease.=20
"We're meeting all the contractual obligations with the Port of San Diego,"=
=20
he said. "We expect to be there for the duration of the agreement."=20
Port Commissioner Paul Speer yesterday said it was premature to discuss=20
voiding the lease.=20
During the first two years of the lease, Duke was required to retain all th=
e=20
SDG&E employees. The three former employees who testified yesterday,=20
including plant operator Jimmy Olkjer, were among the workers that Duke cho=

employees.=20

a=20
shortage that would produce bigger profits. He said perfectly functioning=
=20
steam turbines frequently would be powered down, even during times of high=
=20
demand.=20
When he asked why the units were taken offline, he said, supervisors told h=
im=20
they were "down for economics."=20
"Sometimes a unit would be down for economics for two or three days.=20
Sometimes it would be down for two weeks," he said. "In my opinion, it was=

down to boost prices."=20
Duke officials denied they withheld power to manipulate prices. They say th=

Chula Vista plant powered up and down to help balance the state's electrici=

Hall did say that sometimes the Chula Vista plant would alter its output in=

response to the energy market. "There are times when all the units aren't=

A state report released in March accused the company of withholding power 8=

California has been depicted as a power addict whose growing habit led=20
inexorably to the crisis that has roiled the state since May 2000.=20
Yet the state's electricity yen is the wrong target for blame--the least=20
volatile and least decisive piece of a larger puzzle, an analysis of=20
consumption patterns shows.=20
California consumption has been as regular as a heartbeat in the last decad=
e,=20
sloping upward gently with a blip each summer. In the last year, demand's=
=20
predictability made it the lone calm spot within a hailstorm of dizzying=20
price peaks and supply lurches.=20
Moreover, California 's power consumption increased far less than that of i=
ts=20
Western neighbors, on whose excess supply it had come to depend.=20
"Yes, demand grew in California , but what people who have that discussion=
=20
ignore is that demand in the rest of the West grew even faster," said Sever=
in=20
Borenstein, director of the UC Energy Institute in Berkeley. "We're all par=
t=20
of the same grid."=20
Within the complex, sometimes murky power picture, demand was a problem=20
hiding in plain sight.=20
Starting in 1998, energy agencies began to warn that its slow swell, couple=
d=20
with stagnant supply, had left California with wafer-thin power reserves. I=
n=20
retrospect, these agencies say, deregulation left them powerless to prevent=
=20
the impending collision between supply and demand.=20
When they hit head-on last summer, the amount of power used day to day by=
=20
Californians often had no relationship to the periods when the state=20
experienced blackouts or the highest wholesale prices, analysts said.=20
In the last 10 years, California 's power consumption has moved subtly, nev=
er=20
advancing more than 3.7% a year and, even at its height, lagging behind suc=
h=20
other measures as job growth and economic output.=20
In the early 1990s, recession savaged heavy-duty power users, ranging from=
=20
manufacturers to agricultural interests to the aerospace industry. The=20
industrial sector's usage actually declined from 1990 to 1995.=20
Overall, consumption inched up so slowly in the decade's first half--just=
=20
1.3%--that demand was of little concern as policymakers assembled the=20
mechanisms of deregulation, current and former industry officials say.=20
The system's reserve cushion--the extra supply available at peak times--was=
=20
estimated in 1993 at a robust 12% to 14.5%, without a single electron=20
imported from beyond California 's borders. With pressure off, utilities=20
shifted resources out of programs promoting conservation and redistributing=
=20
peak-hour consumption. Instead, they focused on new technologies that had=
=20
little immediate payoff.=20
"There was less emphasis on demand management," said Barbara Barkovitch, an=
=20
Oakland-based consultant who served on the California Independent System=20
Operator's board from its formation in 1998 until last June. "There was=20
nothing nefarious about it, but people always assume the future will be lik=
e=20
the present."=20
As the economy rebounded, consumption growth averaged about 3% a year. That=
=20
slight escalation--which fell within the expectations of forecasters at the=
=20
California Energy Commission--took on out-sized significance because it=20
occurred as supply stagnated.=20
"The problem was not one of demand in isolation, but that our demand kept=
=20
growing steadily, supply did not grow much at all, and the gap just shrank=
=20
progressively," said Ahmad Faruqui, the Palo Alto-based Electric Power=20
Research Institute's area manager for retail and power markets.=20
Regionally, the expansion was uneven, weighted toward the fast-developing S=
an=20
Diego area and Northern California 's tech corridor. Consumption in San Die=
go=20
Gas & Electric's service area rose more than 17% from 1995 to 2000 and, for=
=20
the decade, increased almost twice as much as in the state overall.=20
The commercial sector's usage grew twice as fast in the decade's last five=
=20
years as it had in its first half as the economic mix shifted toward servic=
es=20
and offices loaded up on energy-eating technology.=20
The heady affluence of the late '90s also inflated residential consumption.=
=20
Consumers splurged on bigger houses, pools and spas, more appliances and=20
up-to-the-minute gadgetry, said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area=20
Economic Forum. Fixed retail prices meant consumers had little incentive to=
=20
rein themselves in, analysts said.=20
"We decided we were not going to have a process for adjustment on the deman=
d=20
side," Borenstein said. "We relied entirely on the supply side and that=20
turned out to be a huge mistake."=20
Still, even as consumption grew, businesses became more efficient. Measured=
=20
per capita, California 's consumption remained modest compared to that of=
=20
less efficient, more weather-intensive states.=20
But gradually and quietly, the system's reserve margin shrank to 4% by 1998=
,=20
a third or less than they had been at their fattest. Even that depended=20
heavily on seasonal help from the other states that share California 's gri=
d,=20
help they were increasingly less able to give.=20
Electricity consumption in Arizona, Colorado and Utah grew at about twice=
=20
California 's rate from 1988 to 1998. It expanded three times as fast in=20
Nevada. In these states, too, supply did not keep up.=20
The collapse that started in May 2000 could have begun a year earlier if no=
t=20
for cool weather and plentiful rain, yielding cascades of Pacific Northwest=
=20
hydroelectric power.=20
At least six state, regional and federal energy agencies issued reports fro=
m=20
late 1998 to early 2000 warning that California 's reserve margin had=20
shriveled, that help from other Western states might decrease, and that the=
=20
state was one hot summer away from disaster.=20
"The Arizona-New Mexico-Southern Nevada and the California -Mexico areas of=

Council in its June 1999 summer assessment. "Those areas are experiencing a=

But in the deregulated system, regulators no longer had a decisive hand in=
=20
balancing supply and demand. Officials at the California Energy Commission=
=20
say even analyzing the situation became harder as utilities became less=20

"Things got sloppier," said Michael Jaske, the commission's chief forecaste=

since 1980. "The utilities started letting that stuff slide, poorer data wa=

=20
Marketplace incentives were supposed to replace government control, but new=

supply did not materialize even though rising demand had created a clear-cu=
t=20
opportunity.=20
Private generators say the system's uncertainties, plus California 's=20
environmental fervor and slow regulatory process, prevented the market from=
=20
working. Borenstein's assessment is blunt: "The reason that no one built=20
power plants was that no one thought you could make money at it."=20
Ultimately, the flurry of studies predicting an oncoming crisis circulated=
=20
among regulators and power industry insiders, but prompted little urgency=
=20
when it came to curtailing demand. The Davis administration focused on supp=
ly=20
instead, taking steps to expedite the approval process for power plants,=20
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.=20
"Hindsight is always 20-20," he said. "We weren't having blackouts in '99, =
so=20
it didn't pop up on anyone's radar."=20
Summer 2000 took care of that, hitting like a sonic boom.=20
Hot weather caused consumption to jump almost 4% year-over-year, double the=
=20
decade-long average. Peak demand from May through August was consistently=
=20
about 10% higher than in summer 1999, averaging an extra 3,200 megawatts pe=

The causal link between heightened usage and other pressure signals, from=

Or was it? Peak demand still fluctuated within a narrow range only marginal=

st=20
usage on summer's most brutal day--was lower than in uneventful 1999.=20
Moreover, after summer's heat ebbed, California 's consumption tapered.=20
Still, the power crisis' other symptoms raged on.=20
In November and December, wholesale power prices soared, California paid fa=

WASHINGTON -- Starting today, federal power regulators will begin trying to=

solve one of the riddles of the energy crisis: How much of a refund will=20

One thing seems clear: The reduction will be a lot more than the $125-milli=

Over the next 15 days--the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is mandatin=
g=20
no weekends off--warring representatives from power companies and the state=
=20
of California will sit at the same table in a government conference room=20
while a FERC task force wrestles the question to the ground.=20
The task is to determine the price that power would have cost if FERC's=20
decision to impose soft caps had been made not last week, but last fall.=20
It is a daunting mathematical problem, factoring in hourly charges during t=
he=20
last eight months. To come up with a total, federal regulators, state=20
electricity officials and power generators must determine what the highest=
=20
price for a megawatt should have been under the soft price caps now in=20
effect. Then they have to figure out which companies--if any--were charging=
=20
more.=20
Under the recent FERC ruling, the price of electricity during any given hou=
r=20
cannot exceed the actual cost of generating the least efficient--or most=20
expensive--power coming into the grid.=20
Curtis L. Wagner, the 72-year-old chief judge for FERC who is overseeing=20
negotiations on California 's overcharges, said of this morning's events: "=
It=20
will be a zoo."=20
Wagner, who headed into the weekend with three inches of documents to sort=
=20
through, explained that Gov. Gray Davis wants $9 billion knocked off the=20
amount the power generators charged California . "I don't really think it's=
=20
that high," said Wagner, predicting the refund will be more than $1 billion=
=20
but probably far from $9 billion.=20
"We have folks trying to do some adding now and some work on what the numbe=
r=20
should be," he said.=20
Wagner said the money at stake will be the most he has worked on in his=20
nearly three-decade career at the agency.=20
Until recently, the likelihood of massive refunds seemed nil. Although=20
California lawmakers--led by Davis--had demanded relief for costs that ran =
as=20
high as 10 times or more than the rates a year ago, FERC officials had not=
=20
agreed.=20
And their minds seemed set. When FERC first proposed remedies for the=20
California price increases late last year, commissioners said: "Refunds may=
=20
be an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental=20
solution to any problems occurring in California markets."=20
To date, FERC has ordered $125 million in refunds for alleged overcharges i=
n=20
January and February.=20
But with the recent appointment of two new commissioners by President=20
Bush--Republicans Patrick H. Wood III of Texas and Nora M. Brownell of=20
Pennsylvania--FERC's position softened, leading to the price mitigation=20
ordered last week.=20
Now FERC is taking a closer look at the prices already charged.=20
California lawmakers have pegged overcharges at nearly $9 billion since the=

Today, Wagner said he plans to make opening statements to the media. After=

behind closed doors. If the parties don't come to an agreement in 15 days,=

the downturn.=20
Only it isn't.=20
Despite the slowdown in the economy and in some areas of construction,=20
Bechtel and many rivals are still busy upgrading cellular networks, buildin=
g=20
railroads and airports, and completing new power plants.=20
"Our guys are working 80 to 100 hours a week completing deals," said John=

Siegel, vice president of marketing and strategy for Bechtel's power plant=
=20
construction division. "You walk around at 9 p.m. and everyone is still=20
here."=20
Overall, Bechtel's sales dipped 5 percent last year to $14.3 billion, but=
=20
that's still up 13 percent from 1999 and a healthy 74 percent from 1996. Th=
e=20

Bechtel isn't alone. Shares in Fluor, the second-largest engineering and=20

during the past 12 months. And some analysts are bullish on the future.=20
"We could be on the front end of a multiyear up-cycle," Merrill Lynch analy=
st=20
Fritz von Carp predicts.=20
CONTRARY CYCLES=20
Although the engineering and construction industry has long been vulnerable=
=20
to sharp downturns, von Carp said the cycles often differ from the rest of=
=20
the U.S. economy.=20
For instance, high energy prices usually spell bad news for most domestic=
=20
businesses. But an energy shortage could help spur a boom in new power=20
plants, refineries and pipelines -- lifting the petroleum sector out of a=
=20
decade-old funk. That has long been a major business for firms such as=20
Bechtel.=20
In addition, von Carp points out that government agencies typically garner =
a=20
large share of transportation revenue from gasoline taxes -- which aren't a=
s=20
sensitive to downturns as income taxes and capital gains. California and=20
other states have also increasingly walled off those funds, so politicians=
=20
can't raid the transportation war chests to pay other bills when budgets ar=
e=20
tight.=20
Government agencies and big businesses also tend to initiate major projects=
=20
when times are good. But because the projects often take years to start and=
=20
complete, they often wind up ramping up after the economy has already slid=
=20
into recession. "It is really a late cycle," von Carp said.=20
This isn't to say that Bechtel's business is humming across the board.=20
Bechtel Executive Vice President Jude Laspa said sales remain lackluster in=
=20
its mining and chemical division. (And despite von Carp's predictions of an=
=20
upswing in the petroleum industry, Laspa said sales haven't picked up so=20
far.)=20
"We have some very robust businesses, and some that are in a cyclical=20
downturn," Laspa said.=20
TIGHT MARGINS=20
Engineering and construction companies also have to be content with lower=
=20
profit margins than those in many other industries. Like its rivals, Bechte=
l=20
typically pockets about 3 to 5 percent of revenues after taxes, Laspa said.=
=20
Operating margins are closer to 7 to 9 percent. (By contrast, anything unde=
r=20
20 percent is considered anemic in the newspaper industry.)=20
"This is a low-margin business," von Carp said.=20
Industry players are also increasingly taking on more risk, bidding on=20
fixed-price contracts to compete. In the past, many firms charged by the ho=
ur=20
and profits soared when projects became mired in delays. Now that companies=
=20
are getting only a lump sum for a development, major setbacks in a project =
or=20
two could sink a firm.=20
Stone & Webster of Boston, for instance, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy=20
protection last year, largely because of delays in building a gas-fired pow=
er=20
plant in Tiverton, R.I. Shaw Group later acquired most of the firm's assets=
.=20
Meanwhile, Washington Group of Boise, Idaho, foundered after it acquired=20
Raytheon's Engineers and Constructors unit, igniting a nasty court battle.=
=20
Washington accused Raytheon of concealing problems with several of the=20
projects and demanded compensation; Raytheon blamed Washington for=20
mismanaging the projects and insisted it owed nothing.=20
Although Bechtel doesn't let outsiders review its books, analysts say they=
=20
believe the firm has largely avoided such problems and is financially solid=
.=20
Bechtel executives point out that the company is 50 percent larger than its=
=20
next-biggest competitor.=20
"Bechtel is considered in the industry to be the pre-eminent engineering an=
d=20
construction company," von Carp said. "It is a very good competitor with a=
=20
strong franchise in many markets."=20
ON TOP IN TELECOM=20
Bechtel has also enjoyed some luck lately.=20
For instance, some telecommunications equipment firms are doing so poorly=
=20
that one analyst compared it to a "nuclear winter." Dozens of data service=
=20
providers, such as NorthPoint Communications in Emeryville, have shut down.=
=20
Others have severely reined in their expansion plans.=20
But Bechtel's revenues are up 20 to 25 percent this year. George Conniff,=
=20
president of Bechtel's telecommunications and industrial business unit, sai=
d=20
his firm mainly serves financially solid firms, such as AT&T Wireless, whic=
h=20
are still going ahead with plans to add 8,000 new towers, despite the=20
slowdown. He also said the unit has picked up some consulting business=20
abandoned by equipment firms trying to narrow their focus to weather the=20
downturn.=20
"We're having a great year," Conniff said. "When the river is muddy, the fi=
sh=20
start to bite."=20
But no part of the business is doing as well as Bechtel Power.=20
A POWERHOUSE IN ENERGY=20
"The power business is doing spectacular," von Carp said. "It is the=20
strongest part of the market now, bar none."=20
Siegel said the company has 22 plants under construction worldwide -- up fr=
om=20
about nine four years ago -- and many more in the pipeline, particularly in=
=20
the United States. Siegel said the unit's revenue rose 15 to 20 percent las=
t=20
year and is on pace to match that this year. He said the firm could probabl=
y=20
land even more business if it had the ability to pursue and handle more=20
projects.=20
Through another unit, Bechtel is also investing in power plants under=20
development in Hayward, Pittsburg and San Jose. The company struck a deal=
=20
with San Jose's Calpine in 1998 to spend $1 billion building several plants=
=20
in the Bay Area. Under the deal, the companies will jointly own the plants=
=20
and split the profits down the middle. Because of the strong demand for=20
electricity in California , Bechtel spokesman Jeff Leichtman said it will=
=20
probably wind up spending at least $500 million more than originally=20
announced.=20
Bechtel doesn't own any existing plants in the United States, so it isn't=
=20
among those accused of gouging consumers in the recent energy crisis. But=
=20
that's partly an accident of fate.=20
The firm's investment arm teamed with PG&E in the late '80s to start buildi=
ng=20
plants. But in 1996, PG&E offered to buy out Bechtel for most of the U.S.=
=20
operations; Bechtel sold the rest of its U.S. stakes shortly thereafter.=20
But Bechtel kept the shares in its overseas plants and bought out PG&E a ye=
ar=20
later. Bechtel now operates the foreign plants through a division called=20
Intergen. It also owns more than half of Nexant, an energy consulting firm=

California could face an obstacle in its case for the full repayment it=20

Sacramento -- Five years after dismantling California's energy markets,=20
former Gov. Pete Wilson says he's proud of his role in deregulation and is=
=20
"stunned and outraged" that his successor tries to pin the blame on him.=20
Former state Senate President pro tem Bill Lockyer, now the state attorney=

=20
powerful energy executive -- and friend of President Bush -- in prison with=
=20

Former Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle, presently a lobbyist, now forwards e-=
=20
mail jokes to fellow Republicans with Davis re-election slogans, including:=
=20
"Davis in 2002: Your bridge to the 18th century."=20
These were the leaders who brought deregulation to California. As they enga=
ge=20
in deflections and defenses one year after the state plunged into crisis,=
=20
their comments also highlight a newer debate over unintended consequences,=
=20
the role of the federal government in making things worse, and the=20
neglectfulness of subsequent politicians.=20
For his part, Wilson has become increasingly angry at the Davis=20
administration's "offensive and unfair" claims that Wilson and the=20
Legislature got the state into this mess.=20
"I'm afraid they have reached the conclusion that the response has been too=
=20
little, too late to avoid what will be hundreds of hours of blackouts, and=
=20
that they better find a way to blame somebody else," Wilson said.=20
Davis, he said, has blamed "the new administration in Washington, the old=
=20
administration in Sacramento, power providers. It's interesting, because=20
there was not a peep out of the lieutenant governor (Davis) at the time=20
during what I thought was a fairly active and public debate. He was hardly=
=20
without a voice,=20
but he certainly was without comment."=20
Wilson said Davis' performance over the past year called into question Davi=

1998 campaign slogan. "I used to laugh when he talked about being the=20
best-trained, best-prepared candidate in history," Wilson said. "But what t=
he=20
hell."=20
DEREGULATION BILL
A tiny legislative committee that was dominated by state Sen. Steve Peace,=
=20
D-El Cajon, and then Assemblyman James Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, wrote th=
e=20
deregulation bill in 1996. Corporate lobbyists and utilities also had=20
tremendous sway over the legislation. Pringle, Lockyer and Wilson steered t=
he=20
legislation their way.=20
The bill was a reaction to movements under way at the California Public=20
Utilities Commission and in the federal government. The bill essentially=20
unbundled the big utilities' monopoly over power, separating control of=20
selling, marketing and producing energy.=20
It also was supposed to cut rates 10 percent and pay utilities hundreds of=
=20
millions of dollars for investments they'd made in nuclear power and other=
=20
energy plants.=20
Wilson said Davis should, in fact, be grateful that the 1996 deregulation=
=20
bill encouraged power companies to expand into California. He contends that=
=20
without the measure, the state would be faced with a regulated market and 1=
0,=20
000 fewer megawatts of power -- and more blackouts.=20
DAVIS' COMPLAINTS
Davis has continually said that California failed to build power plants in=
=20
the 12 years before his administration. In truth, seven smaller power plant=
s=20
were built during Wilson's eight years, and deregulation started the proces=
s=20
on a host of others that are now being approved more quickly by the Davis=
=20
administration.=20
"We wanted to entice investors," Wilson said. "You can't do that if they're=
=20
not allowed to compete."=20
Wilson acknowledges that the state misread exactly how quickly California=
=20
would grow. During the high-tech boom, Silicon Valley built acres of "serve=
r=20
farms" to supply the Internet that accounted for a large amount of the=20
increase in new power usage in California.=20
Peace has point-blank blamed executives at Cisco Systems. He has said they=
=20
should be thrown in jail for simultaneously supplying the server-farm boom=
=20
and opposing the building of a power plant in Santa Clara County. Cisco=20
opposed the 600-megawatt plant, it said, to protect the health and welfare =
of=20

"If I could repeal it and start all over again, I think that I would," he=

said.=20
But even Lockyer acknowledges that the Legislature needed to do something i=

federal government, which had already opened up the natural gas market.=20
"Our energy experts thought the PUC was doing it in a way that was overly=

subsidizing big business," Lockyer said. "The efforts were made to try to=
=20
figure out how to make the market competitive without tilting toward big=20
business."=20
The real killer in deregulation, Lockyer contends, is that neither the=20
Legislature (himself included) nor the governor paid enough attention to th=
e=20
supply end. That allowed a handful of firms to have near-total control over=
=20
power output, Lockyer said. Peace has called this the "domestic equivalent =

Lockyer has been busy demonizing power firms as well. He still faces=20
criticism for telling the Wall Street Journal his plans for Kenneth Lay,=20

Pending power plants in California face some problems=20
Posted at 10:14 p.m. PDT Sunday, June 24, 2001=20
BY STEVE JOHNSON=20

Mercury News=20


Although California's summer energy outlook seems to be brightening, state=
=20
leaders still are counting on new power plants to boost competition and low=
er=20
electricity prices in years to come.=20
They may end up disappointed.=20
Even with 42 new power plants in the works before the California Energy=20
Commission as of early last week, the state can't be sure of how much power=
=20
they will produce or what prices they will charge, experts say. That could=
=20
prove troublesome, since 70 percent of the power the state plans to buy=20
through long-term contracts is supposed to come from these new plants.=20
Nor is there any guarantee of the price these plants might charge for the=
=20
rest of their power on the spot market, despite last Monday's order by=20
federal regulators to generally limit spot prices across the West.=20
Like much of what has happened since the state passed deregulation, the=20
future appears cloudy. Here's why:=20
?Critics say the price caps ordered Monday by the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission contain loopholes that could allow California's electricity cost=
s=20
to soar on days when it is desperate for power. And when the Mercury News=
=20
asked 12 of the companies involved in the recently approved or pending powe=
r=20
plants if they could promise that their spot market prices would be cheaper=
=20
than what California has been paying recently, none could.=20
?Of the 25 mostly private entities involved in these new power plant=20
projects, only six are generators new to the state, and most of their plant=
s=20
are relatively small. That may slow the development of a more competitive=
=20
electricity market, which state officials say is needed to lower prices.=20
?More than a third of the electricity to be produced by these new operation=
s=20
would be controlled by firms accused in recent lawsuits or governmental=20
actions of questionable pricing and, in some cases, outright gouging. State=
=20
officials claim that some of these companies, among other things, have shut=
=20
down their plants when electricity demand was high to artificially crimp=20
supplies and inflate prices.=20
?Some experts doubt that all of the proposed plants will get built. Several=
=20
power companies acknowledged that the intense criticism of them by Californ=
ia=20
officials and uncertainties over the economic viability of owning plants he=
re=20
could cause them to delay or even abandon their projects. Others suspect=20
these firms eventually may cancel some of the plants they have proposed, to=
=20
keep power in short supply and prices high.=20
``I'm concerned,'' said California Public Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood,=
=20
when asked about the makeup of the firms proposing the new plants. ``It's t=
he=20
same cartel. We will have more generation, but we will have the same player=
s=20
owning and controlling it.''=20
Such comments irk power suppliers, who have repeatedly denied breaking any=
=20
laws or regulations governing the sale of wholesale electricity. Many of=20
these entrepreneurs find it particularly galling that the very state=20
officials accusing them of price gouging are begging them to build plants i=
n=20
California.=20
Few politicians have been as vehement in their denunciation of electricity=
=20
suppliers as Gov. Gray Davis. Yet he is among those relying heavily on the=
=20
new power plants these companies are developing to help pull California out=
=20
of its energy crisis.=20
``Eventually when supply and demand come back into something approaching=20
balance, there will be genuine price competition,'' Davis said in December.=
=20
He repeated the point earlier this month, proclaiming that ``by the fall of=
=20
2003, we will have more power than we need. That will solve the long-term=
=20
problem.''=20
Davis isn't alone. Although power costs have fallen in recent weeks and=20
federal officials may impose tougher price controls on electricity, the=20
assumption that more plants is the key to solving California's troubles is=
=20
taken as gospel by many state and federal officials.=20
It seems logical enough. More power presumably would not only ease the thre=
at=20
of blackouts, but relieve California of the need to pay exorbitant prices o=
n=20
days when electricity is in short supply.=20
But calculating how much more power the state will wind up with, based on h=
ow=20
many plants are on the drawing board, is risky, say some state regulators a=
nd=20
consumer advocates.=20
``I have no confidence at the moment that a majority of those new plants wi=
ll=20
ever materialize,'' because power companies are likely to maintain an=20
electricity shortage to keep prices high, said Michael Shames, of the Utili=
ty=20
Consumers Action Network. ``Why would they want to change what they've got?=
=20
They've got a sweet deal.''=20
Another reason plants might not get built is politics. Several firms with=
=20
projects in the works claimed that threats by state officials to seize thei=
r=20
plants or impose a windfall profits tax on their sales had made it harder t=
o=20
obtain financing.=20
``Every time these politicians start spouting off to improve their own=20
political careers, they don't realize the damage they're doing,'' said Gary=
=20
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum.=20
Just this month, Mirant Corp. of Atlanta received state permission to build=
 a=20
530 megawatt plant in Contra Costa County -- enough to supply power to abou=
t=20
400,000 homes -- and it has applied to build a similarly-sized generator in=
=20
San Francisco. But its spokesman Chuck Griffin said both projects are on=20
hold, until Mirant feels more comfortable about the state's political and=
=20
economic climate.=20
``We have to be able to determine that it's going to be a viable=20
investment,'' he said.=20
Even if all 42 plants are built, many of the companies proposing them were=
=20
skittish about promising cheaper prices. They said it depends on such thing=
s=20
as the future cost of natural gas, which many of their plants use for fuel.=
=20
One firm California is counting on is Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which=20
already commands a modest fleet of small plants in the state and is=20
developing nearly one fourth of the 42 new plants.=20
Although Calpine has earned huge profits in recent months, it has a=20
relatively good reputation among consumer advocates and state investigators=
=20
who have reviewed its confidential power sales data. Moreover, Calpine's na=
me=20
is conspicuously absent from recent lawsuits and federal legal filings that=
=20
have either accused other firms of gouging or questioned the reasonableness=
=20
of their prices.=20
Much of the power to be generated from Calpine's new plants will be sold in=
=20
long-term contracts to the state, according to company spokesman Bill=20
Highlander. But like other suppliers, he was vague about what it would char=
ge=20
for the rest.=20
``It kind of depends on a whole number of factors,'' Highlander said,=20
including how much people conserve and how much power California can contin=
ue=20
importing from other states. Since no one can predict such things today, he=
=20
added, ``that's what makes it so difficult.''=20
If anyone should be concerned about the price of power it's the folks at PG=
&E=20
Corp., who have blamed high electricity costs for forcing their utility --=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- into bankruptcy. But even they wouldn't=20
speculate about how much they would charge for the power from their 1,048=
=20
megawatt plant in Kern County, which is to be built by their unregulated=20
affiliate, PG&E National Energy Group. PG&E's energy trading arm is among t=

suppliers accused of questionable pricing practices, although PG&E official=

have denied any wrongdoing.=20
By the time the Kern County plant is done in two years, ``if we have a=20

The FERC loophole=20
Published Monday, June 25, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News=20
BY PETER NAVARRO=20
THE Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new wholesale price limits will=
=20
save the Western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricit=
y=20
bills. As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale=
=20
generators to extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into=20
recession.=20
FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and natural=
=20
gas shortages. In California, market manipulation has taken place on a=20
grand-theft scale.=20
In 1999, California's electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it=
=20
was almost $30 billion for roughly the same amount of electricity. This yea=
r,=20
California's bill is well on its way to $50 billion annually. To stop this=
=20
ripoff, Gov. Gray Davis proposed ``cost-based'' price caps. Such caps are=
=20
calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allowed to recover=
=20
its cost of production, including a fair profit.=20
Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at a=20
nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel plus profit. The oldest,=20
least efficient plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to=
=20
collect 20 cents plus profit. That proposal was categorically rejected by=
=20
FERC. Instead, the commission set a single price for all generators based o=
n=20
the cost of the ``least efficient plant.''=20
The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still allows=
=20
generators to extract billions in windfall profits from consumers. Under=20
FERC's rule, the least efficient plant will collect 20 cents a unit to=20
recover costs, plus its profit.=20
However, the most efficient plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt=
=20
also collects 20 cents per unit rather than a nickel and thus extracts a=20
windfall of 15 cents plus profit. Thus, under FERC's rule, wholesale=20
generators will still be able to capture billions of dollars extra from=20
consumers and businesses than under Davis' cost-based proposal.=20
FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic gaming that=
=20
has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure that during pe=
ak=20
times, when the price cap is being established, the most expensive possible=
=20
plant is in operation -- whether it needs to be or not. This will peg the=
=20
price at the highest level.=20
In addition, FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to run thei=
r=20
least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient plants are al=
so=20
the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air.=20
Moreover, the excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on=20
already stretched natural gas supplies. These least-efficient plants use up=
=20
to 40 percent more natural gas to produce a unit of electricity.=20
The bottom line: FERC's price limits will help California. But there still =
is=20
a danger that higher electricity costs could push California and the rest o=

Wagner said last week as he prepared for the marathon sessions. Once that's=

who has launched a criminal investigation of private generator charges.=20
The ISO has estimated that of the $9 billion in alleged overcharges, about=
=20
$4.7 billion was from private generators. The rest was charged by municipal=
=20
sellers and others who are not under the FERC's jurisdiction.=20
"We need the FERC to lay the basis for seeking refunds from private=20
generators, and we will use that as a basis for dealing with the generators=
=20
who are not under FERC jurisdiction," said Nancy McFadden, a Davis adviser.=
=20
McFadden also said the state won't agree to drop civil or criminal=20
proceedings against the generators as part of a refund settlement.=20
The generators and utilities -- which have denied overcharging Californians=

talks.=20
But one power generator, Spokane-based Avista Corp., did speak out about th=
e=20
possibility of refunds.=20
"We are opposed to retroactive refunds," said Avista spokesman Hugh Imhof.=
=20
"We believe it's fundamentally unfair to change the rules after the fact."=

And Mike Zenker, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Associates, a prominent=20
energy-consulting firm, said the settlement conference will likely include=

discussions of how state officials meddled in the fledgling market, which=

could affect California's ability to get refunds.=20
"You can bet that generators are going to argue that the response of electe=

On Friday, the FERC commissioners expanded the scope of the talks, saying t=

"We are eligible for some of the refunds," said Gloria Quinn, Washington,=

January column in Engineering News Record. "CURE has filed environmental=20

The company strongly denied allegations by three former plant employees tha=
