Jeff,

Thanks for the great weekend.  I had a great time with you guys up at
the dome.

I just talked to my friend Curtis Press and he said to have you give him
a call about Annie and Vegas.  From what I know he is a very good vet.
He will also definitely let you know if the surgery makes sense (for
Annie) and who he thinks should do the surgery, etc.

He works most days at the Mission Valley Pet hospital in San Francisco.
The phone number there is 552-1969.  He and his wife also own a pet
hospital in Larkspur.

Sean
