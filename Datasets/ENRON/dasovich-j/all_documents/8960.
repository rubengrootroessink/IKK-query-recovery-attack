Hope I  captured it all correctly - please feel free to make changes 
liberally.?  
?
I  imported the excel spreadsheets as pictures and then scaled them to fit 
the  page.? I didn't print it out to see if it looked funny - can someone do  
that and make adjustments accordingly?? Someone should also double check my  
calcs in ROE and asset turnover, just to be sure.
?
Highlight your changes on the doc and send it around  for review.
?
Thanks!
Carolyn
