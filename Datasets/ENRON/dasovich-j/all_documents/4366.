John,

This is the decsion you inquired about.  I am not sure how useful it is.  You 
may also see if the methodology for determining WACOG is part of the 
preliminary statement or rules in SoCalGas's tariff book, which is online.

This document is an .xif file.  You will have a better time viewing and 
printing if you "launch" it rather than "view" it.

Jeff,

This relates somewhat to your question of how the index is set.
