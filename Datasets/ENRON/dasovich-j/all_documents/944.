There is a Resolution from Keeley, Assembly Speaker Pro-Tempore.  This is an 
Assembly only resolution, not a joint resolution.  It does not change any 
existing statute.  

The resolution provides that the EOB, in collaboration with the CPUC, could 
determine when prices in the wholesale market were in excess of just and 
reasonable, they could appeal to FERC to lower the market prices to just and 
reasonable.  

The EOB shall direct the ISO to show cause why the price caps in the 
ancillary services and real-time energy markets should not be lowered to $100 
per MWh immediately and continue until at least March 31, 2001.  The report 
back to the Legislature by October 16, 2000, as to the status of wholesale 
electricity markets and the impact of electricity prices on California 
consumers and businesses.

IEP has formed a coaltion, of which we are a part, opposing the resolution.  
Likelihood is that the resolution will be passed, however.
