Hi again.  Good to talk with you on the phone today - it's been awhile and 
I'm glad you're taking the opportunity to ESCAPE THE EVIL EMPIRE for a few 
days.

Here's a rundown of the restaurants again:
Nobu - Asian
Union Street Cafe - American
Ruby Foo - Asian
Asia de Cuba - Asian/Cuban
Del Frisco's - Steak
Provence - French/Romantic
Periyali - Greek 
If you want Italian, there are supposed to be some good places on the Upper 
East Side but I haven't tried any yet.  
Mercer Kitchen - SoHo
La Grange - Great place for a Saturday Brunch in SoHo/Village Area
Cafe Lalo - Desert Place (Good Cheesecake  - it's where Tom Hanks went to 
check out Meg in You've Got Mail)

As for business, I am attaching the messaging points put forth by the 
Independent Power Producers of New York and the two-page summary of the focus 
group research we did back in April.  I will either foward you ALEC's Energy 
Day itinerary or FAX it to you.  I don't have it as an attachment.  Thanks 
for coming out here to do this, and I'll see you Thursday!
