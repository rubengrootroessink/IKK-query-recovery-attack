Jeff:

E-mail is down, so AOL is what I am using.  If I understood your question, 
the retained gen and QF is about double the residential load.   I attached a 
spreadsheet.   There is an anomoly I can not explain.  The PGE eneregy 
delivred was 81,923 MWH in 2000 and the governor's slide show 90,210 in 2001??
