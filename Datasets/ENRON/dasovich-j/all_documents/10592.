On interminable conference calls---on another right now.  Flight leaves at 
3:30 PM, which I think gets me there around 5 or 5:15 PM.  Why don't you just 
pick a restaurant and I'll meet you there.  I'm staying at 5th Avenue 
Suites.  If you want to eat at the resaurant at the hotel, that works for 
me.  I'll call you when (and if) I get off this call.

Best,
Jeff
