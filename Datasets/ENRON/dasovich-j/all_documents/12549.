Internet Daily for Tuesday, May 15, 2001

United, MSN in Net access deal

UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Microsoft's MSN announced a
marketing deal Tuesday that will include the airline launching a
co-branded Internet access service and a branded version of
Microsoft's Explorer browser software. United will become MSN's
"premier airline service provider" and be featured on its home
page. The custom Explorer will allow United customers one-click
access to their frequent flyer accounts, online booking, and
flight and gate information.

Wireless deals

Microsoft Corp. will deliver MSN content and services to
Handspring's new Blazer Web browser for use in Visor personal
digital assistants and other handheld devices using the Palm
operating system. Blazer is priced at $19.95. The company says it
allows access to virtually any site on the Internet, not just
those tailored for mobile access. MSN Mobile provides the default
home page on Blazer.

Yahoo said Web-enabled telephone users can access personal
finance information accounts established on the portal. The
company said its mobile service allows users to view bank,
brokerage and credit card account balances through Yahoo
Finance.

Juno profits from politics

Juno Online Services Inc. has found it can charge higher prices
for its online political ads because they get responses. "We have
been able to hold steady or raise our rates while increasing our
client base," Roger A. Stone, a Juno vice president and director
of the company's advocacy network unit, told the Dow Jones
Newswires. The ads most often encourage readers to send
issues-oriented e-mails to members of Congress or federal
administrators. Such ad sales have doubled each year since 1998,
Stone said.

Ask Jeeves' top questions

Driving directions, someone's e-mail address and "how much is
that French franc worth in real money?" were the most popular
queries at AskJeeves.com last month. Consumer comparison shopping
questions also made the top 10 list, including searches for the
best deals on used cars and airfare specials. "Where can I find
pictures of the latest hair styles?" was the 10th-most-asked
question.
