According to the LA TImes, we know the SEC has launched a preliminary 
investigation into whether Davis administration staff used inside information 
to buy stock.  In that case, it's a big question whether proprietary 
information not available to the public was properly safeguarded.

I think this is further evidence that the information requeted from Enron by 
the CA State Senate could be in similar jeopardy.
