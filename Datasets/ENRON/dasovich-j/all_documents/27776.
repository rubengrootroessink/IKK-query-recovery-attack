Davis loosens limits on older plants=20
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 12, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis on Monday waived all local smog rules that limited how long=
=20
older and dirtier natural gas-fired power plants can run this summer.=20
Davis said he issued the order under his emergency powers to help avoid=20
blackouts.=20
"We are doing everything possible to keep the lights on this summer," he=20
said.=20
The order modifies a directive that Davis issued Feb. 9 that required local=
=20
air pollution control districts to extend hours of operation when plants=20
approached their permitted limits. Plant operators offset the extra emissio=
ns=20
by paying the districts a "mitigation fee." Those fees fund programs that=
=20
reduce emissions from other sources.=20
Some municipal power utilities, however, argued that they shouldn't have to=
=20
make a case to the air district for additional hours when the need to provi=

Under the directive issued Monday, power production to meet demand anywhere=

Waiving the operation limits should encourage operators to increase the use=

"This will allow us to offer that excess capacity to the state," said David=

Wiggs, interim general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and=
=20
Power.=20
Air districts generally impose limits on hours of operation on a relatively=
=20
small number of older, dirtier plants, as a more economical alternative to=
=20
installing modern pollution controls. The order, which is effective=20
immediately, could provide up to 1,200 additional megawatts in the state th=
is=20
summer, enough to power about 900,000 houses, state officials said.=20
Kellan Fluckinger, an energy adviser to Davis, argued that in the long run=
=20
the directive will result in a net gain for air quality.=20
Expanding the use of the peaker plants, he said, will help avoid blackouts=
=20
and the attendant use of emergency diesel generators, which typically emit=
=20
about 10 times more smog-forming emissions than the dirtiest of natural=20
gas-fired plants.=20
In addition, the pollution mitigation fees paid to allow expanded operation=
=20
of the peaker plants would go toward local efforts to cut pollution from=20
other sources, such as diesel-powered trucks and water pumps on farms.=20
Several air districts, including those in the Sacramento region, offer=20
financial incentives to businesses to replace dirty diesel engines with=20
cleaner-burning ones sooner than they normally would.=20
"They have more applicants than the ability to fund them," said Michael=20
Scheible, deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board.=20
The governor's office also is expected to announce financial incentives for=
=20
companies to press their backup diesel generators into service to forestall=
=20
blackouts this summer, according to S. David Freeman, a top Davis energy=20
adviser.=20
"Whether or not we do that is still being discussed," Scheible said.=20
Under the plan, participating businesses would disconnect from the=20
electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 and turn on backup=20
generators.=20
The state would pay the companies for the power saved by converting to dies=

Public furious at 19% rate hike=20



PUC holds hearings, says its hands are tied

California tends to unanimity when it comes to electricity deregulation: Th=

legislature passed it unanimously in 1996, and people who testified at rate=

Speakers at public hearings in San Diego and El Cajon alternately demanded=

to spend large portions of their budgets on energy costs, he said.=20
"That's unacceptable, sir," he said as members of the audience clapped and=
=20
called out, "That's right."=20
Despite the appeals for tough action, Carl Wood, the only member of the=20
California Public Utilities Commission in attendance at yesterday's hearing=
s,=20
insisted that the commission was obligated to pass along the proposed 19=20
percent rate hike demanded by the California Department of Water Resources.=
=20
Under legislation passed earlier this year, the department began purchasing=
=20
power for state utility customers. The same legislation gave the department=
=20
the right to self-judge the reasonableness of its rate hike requests, a=20
function formerly allocated to the utilities commission.=20
That leaves the PUC with a limited role in the rate hike process, Wood=20
acknowledged.=20
"We are here to spread the pain," said the commissioner, who noted that=20
customers who use 130 percent or less of the baseline amount are shielded=
=20
from any rate hike by state law. The baseline allowance, which is printed o=
n=20
utility bills, is a subsistence amount of electricity that varies by locati=
on=20
and climate.=20
But Wood also said later, "We have to (raise rates) if we want to keep powe=
r=20
flowing."=20
San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob was not persuaded. Jacob said the=
=20
duty of the commission is to ensure just and reasonable utility rates for=
=20
Californians.=20
"The only way for the commission to fulfill its mission is to disobey the=
=20
(water department)," Jacob said. "I urge the commission to refuse the $915=
=20
million rate increase request from the DWR."=20
Nearly all other speakers agreed, with many blasting the notion that=20
consumers should be forced to pay for the fallout of a deregulation plan th=
ey=20
said was designed by major energy corporations for their own benefit.=20
"They spent the money, they had the party and now they are asking the littl=
e=20
guys to clean up the mess," said Frank Jordan.=20
Another speaker said the utilities commission would find options to the rat=
e=20
hike if it tapped into public outrage over the electricity crisis.=20
"Don't throw more money at the problem," said Robert Womack of La Mesa. "Gi=
ve=20
us the chance to throw our weight around -- and we have plenty of weight to=
=20
throw around."=20
Holly Duncan of Clairement was as upset over the rate hike process as she w=
as=20
over the increase itself. Duncan noted that the water department -- which i=
n=20
effect ordered the rate hike -- was declining to release its power purchase=
=20
contracts. That left her, she said, in the position of paying for something=
=20
that was negotiated in secret.=20
"Where is our systems of checks and balances?" Duncan asked.=20
The commission is expected to have a proposed rate hike plan ready by June=
=20
21, with a final vote on the increase slated for June 28.=20

Temporary takeovers to be spelled out in bill=20



By Bill Ainsworth=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 12, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Like nuclear weapons in the Cold War, the takeover of power=
=20
plants by the state has loomed in the background of the electricity crisis =
as=20
a weapon so scary and extreme it could never be responsibly used.=20
Assemblyman Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, wants to change that.=20
Vargas is promoting a plan that he says will avoid huge costs and years of=
=20
litigation by allowing the state to take over electricity generating plants=
=20
temporarily.=20
Once the electricity crisis has passed, the state would give back the plant=
=20
to its owner and pay rent for using it, rather than the high price of buyin=
g=20
it outright. Call it plant seizure lite.=20
The freshman lawmaker will present his plan today to the Assembly Judiciary=
=20
Committee, which is expected to approve the measure along party lines.=20
"It's a big deal to take over a person's property," said Vargas. "But this =
is=20
reasonable. It's rational. They forced us into it and it's time to fight=20
back."=20
Some believe the state, by seizing power plants, could obtain electricity f=
or=20
less than it pays in the existing market, which is widely deemed to be=20
overpriced.=20
But Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a=
=20
group of power generating companies, said the Vargas plan would hurt the=20
state's efforts to build enough plants to ease the crisis.=20
"I don't think there is such a thing as seizure lite," he said. "Any=20
discussion of plant seizures for a day or a lifetime has a devastating effe=
ct=20
on the business climate."=20
Even a temporary state takeover would discourage investors who want to buil=
d=20
new generating plants to increase the supply of electricity, he said. It=20
would also discourage bond investors whom the state wants to tap to repay=
=20
state taxpayers for buying high-priced electricity on the spot market.=20
Vargas admits that the governor could temporarily take over plants now=20
without waiting for legislative action. Still, he said, a bill would give t=
he=20
governor more support.=20
"It gives the idea legitimacy," he said.=20
At issue are the generating plants sold by the state's major utilities,=20
mostly to southern-based companies. Those companies have made huge profits=
=20
while charging skyrocketing prices that have caused the financial collapse =
of=20
the state's two major utilities.=20
Davis has portrayed those companies as ruthless price gougers that maximize=
=20
profits at the expense of California's economy. He has threatened to seize=
=20
plants, but then backed away. Few believe the centrist Democrat wants to ri=
sk=20
such a move that could alienate the business community, especially now when=
=20
the energy market is showing signs of stabilizing.=20
Additionally, a permanent takeover could force the state to pay billions of=
=20
dollars for an outdated, aging facility, said Vargas, because the value of=
=20
the plant would be determined by the high prices the plant is now charging=
=20
for electricity.=20
In his research, Vargas said he found that the U.S. Supreme Court in 1949=
=20
held that the state needs only to pay the rental value of a property it=20
seizes temporarily. On top of that, he said, the law specifies that the=20
Public Utilities Commission, controlled by Davis appointees, would determin=
e=20
the value of the rent.=20






New law bypasses PUC rate review=20



Water agency can set own prices
By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 11, 2001=20
SDG&E customers begin treading a path today to two rate increases likely to=
=20
raise their bills 35 percent, or about $1.7 billion, during the next year.=
=20
As if that were not irritation enough, consumer advocates and others famili=
ar=20
with the process say it violates long-standing principles of public=20
disclosure and oversight.=20
Public hearings today in San Diego and El Cajon and tomorrow in Escondido a=
nd=20
San Clemente will focus on a proposed increase of about 19 percent sought b=
y=20
the California Department of Water Resources.=20
This is unrelated to a request by San Diego Gas & Electric for a rate=20
increase of about 16 percent, which will be considered later this year.=20
The state water agency says it needs an increase to cover the cost of=20
procuring power. The department began buying power earlier this year when=
=20
utilities ran into financial trouble.=20
Until now, proposals for electricity rate increases have come before the=20
California Public Utilities Commission, a state constitutional body charged=
=20
with reviewing the proposals, taking public input, and setting rates at a=
=20
level that is just and reasonable.=20
Not this time.=20
The same law that authorized the Department of Water Resources to buy power=
=20
also empowered the department to judge the merits of its own rate increase=
=20
proposals. The department has determined its request for what amounts to $9=
15=20
million is reasonable.=20
The water department also has informed the utilities commission that it wil=
l=20
not provide the contracts under which it is purchasing electricity. The sta=
te=20
needs the increases to cover its costs under the contracts.=20
Gov. Gray Davis insists keeping these agreements secret is essential to=20
protect the state's position in bargaining for additional electricity=20
supplies.=20
The state utilities commission, meanwhile, is left to determine only how to=
=20
disperse the department rate increase among SDG&E customers, not how much o=
f=20
an increase is appropriate. The commission calculates that the Department o=
f=20
Water Resources' increase will add an average of 2.8 cents to the existing=
=20
rate of 14.4 cents per kilowatt-hour. That total includes a 6.5-cent charge=
=20
for power purchases plus fees for distribution and other costs.=20
Consumer advocates and critics say this a perversion of the commission's=20
purpose. The PUC was created to protect utility customers.=20
"SDG&E customers will be paying higher rates without any member of the publ=
ic=20
knowing the basis for the increase and without anyone allowed to see the=20
costs that we are paying for or the terms of the deal," said Doug Heller of=
=20
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "There is supposed to be a=
n=20
identifiable, calculable basis for any rate increase."=20
Attorney Michael Aguirre, who is representing Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante in a=
=20
lawsuit against power suppliers, said the process raises serious legal=20
questions.=20
"The governor has denigrated the PUC's function to that of a rate launderer=
,"=20
said Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor. "The legislature has passed a la=
w=20
that interferes with the constitutional function of the PUC."=20
Carl Wood, a member of the PUC who will attend the sessions today, agreed=
=20
that the process surrounding the department's rate increase is unusual. But=
=20
he said there is still opportunity for the public to comment on how to=20
allocate the increase.=20
Wood noted that the commission sought to shield low-and middle-income=20
customers from the brunt of similar increases recently imposed in areas=20
served by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. He said=
=20
the hikes in those areas are also "steeply tiered" to hit hardest those who=
=20
use the most power.=20
But Wood, a former utility workers union official who opposed deregulation,=
=20
conceded discomfort with the role that has fallen to the PUC.=20
"I would rather be in a more orderly, regulated world where the PUC had=20
sufficient authority to ensure reasonable rates," Wood said.=20
Jim Bell, a member of the Coalition for Affordable Power, a San Diego-based=

The commission's draft report was released last month but has received litt=

Duke Energy, which gets gas for its 760-megawatt South Bay power plant in=

"very valid," said Tom Williams, a company spokesman. The plant has had its=

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis agreed Monday to lift air emission limits on=
=20
heavily polluting power plants and allow them to run at capacity this summe=
r=20
as long as the electricity they produce is sold in the state.=20
State officials said the plants must be pressed into use to avoid blackouts=
.=20
Davis' executive order lets the generators build the cost of air pollution=
=20
fines into the price the state pays for electricity produced by natural=20
gas-fired power plants, said Catherine Witherspoon of the California Air=20
Resources Board.=20
Municipal utility districts--including the Los Angeles Department of Water=
=20
and Power--and independent power companies could supply as much as 1,200=20
megawatts from so-called peaker plants, facilities that generally are=20
permitted to operate for only a few hundred hours a year because they pollu=
te=20
so heavily. That is enough power for more than 1 million homes.=20
Other gas-fired power plants that have been shut down because of air=20
pollution restrictions also could be started up as a result of the order.=
=20
In a news conference Monday, state officials said the order will have the=
=20
effect of lowering air pollution by limiting the use of far dirtier diesel=
=20
generators, which industry could use if power supplies are threatened.=20
"If we don't get every last megawatt we can [from natural gas-fired plants]=
,"=20
said Witherspoon of the air board, "we will see people turning to diesel mo=
re=20
frequently."=20
Added Kellan Fluckiger, a top energy advisor to Davis: "If you don't run=20
these, you're either going to have outages or you're going to run something=
=20
dirtier."=20
Fluckiger said the order expands "the number of hours these things can run=
=20
and the amount of energy they can produce."=20
New natural gas-fired power plants emit about half a pound per megawatt-hou=
r=20
of operation of ozone-producing pollutants. The plants affected by the orde=
r=20
emit between two and five pounds of oxides of nitrogen per megawatt-hour.=
=20
If the plants are pressed into operation for 200,000 megawatt-hours this=20
summer, there will be between 400,000 and 1 million additional pounds of=20
oxides of nitrogen emitted into the air.=20
The state probably will end up paying the fees associated with the extra=20
pollution through higher electricity prices. The fees amount to $7.50 per=
=20
pound of oxides of nitrogen--or $7.5 million if the plants operate for=20
200,000 hours--and $1.10 per pound of carbon monoxide emissions. The money=
=20
would be used to reduce air pollution from other sources.=20
"Under this order, dirty power plants can run as long as they want and=20
pollute as much as they want so long as they pay into a fund," said Gail=20
Ruderman Feuer, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.=
=20
"Our concern is that there's no guarantee that the fund will result in=20
emission reductions any time soon."=20
A Ventura County air pollution control official said that running one peaki=
ng=20
power plant operated by Reliant Energy for one hour is the equivalent of=20
adding 20,000 new cars to Ventura County highways for an hour. Reliant Ener=
gy=20
could not be reached for comment Monday night.=20
"To the extent that they run when not needed for an emergency, it's going t=
o=20
put more air pollution into Ventura County skies and it's going to make our=
=20
air dirtier," said Dick Baldwin, air pollution control officer for Ventura=
=20
County.=20
Los Angeles DWP Director David Wiggs hailed the order, saying it was needed=
=20
so the city can sell the state as much as 1,000 megawatts of power this=20
summer.=20
"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our=
=20
excess capacity to the state," Wiggs said.=20
He added, however, that the city and state have not yet agreed on a price f=
or=20
the power. Wiggs said the city is "negotiating to get our cost as low as we=
=20
can legally charge" so that customers of the city utility district are not=
=20
subsidizing consumers in the rest of the state. Municipal utility districts=
=20
elsewhere in the state also are expected to benefit from the order.=20
Though the order was aimed at spurring municipal utilities to sell power to=

the state, it also applies to independent power producers such as Reliant=
=20
Energy of Houston and Duke of North Carolina--both of which have called on=

Davis to ease air pollution restrictions on their old natural gas-fired=20
facilities.=20
"This puts more money in the Texans' pockets and more air pollution in=20

Doug Allard, a Santa Barbara County air pollution control officer, also sai=
d=20
it seems as if the governor is giving private power generators much of what=

they had sought.=20
"We have serious concerns about the order," said Feuer of the Natural=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is already conducting a trial-like=

On Monday, FERC's governing board ordered its chief judge also to gather=20
evidence on whether two subsidiaries of El Paso violated agency rules on=20

"This order . . . expands the scope of the hearing in this proceeding to=20

decision. "I recognize the seriousness of natural gas prices in the=20

The ruling appears to be part of a shift toward a more assertive course by=

"It's about time," California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta=

pressure from the new Democrat-controlled Senate and from House Republicans=

As recently as March, the FERC board had ruled there was "no merit" to=20

longer and reduce the need to run dirtier diesel-powered generators often=
=20
used as backups.=20
"If you don't run these, you're either going to have outages, or you're goi=
ng=20
to run something dirtier," said Davis adviser Kellan Fluckiger.=20
Under the current state of emergency, the governor has sweeping powers to=
=20
make changes in the law.=20
The Davis administration roughly estimated that about 1,200 megawatts in=20
extra power could be produced and sold to California, enough to supply an=
=20
estimated 1.2 million homes. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,=
=20
which has been selling its extra electricity to the state, said it might be=
=20
able to supply 1,000 megawatts alone.=20
Under the current law, power plants in California are allowed to emit=20
specific amounts of major pollutants -- nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide=
=20
-- and then must shut down when they reach a federal and state quota.=20
The executive order allows power plants in California to bypass those=20
environmental standards as long as they sell the extra power to the state o=
r=20
another California-based utility. The order lasts until Davis rescinds it.=
=20
EXEMPTION TRADE-OFFS
In exchange for the exemptions, the power generators must pay penalties for=
=20
the extra pollution they cause. The fines would probably range around $37.5=
0=20
for every megawatt produced during these peak periods, according to Catheri=
ne=20
Witherspoon with the California Air Resources Board.=20
Although prices are falling, a megawatt hour has sold on the daily market f=
or=20
more than $500 -- at one point soaring to as much as $1,900.=20
Money from the fines would be put into local pollution-control accounts and=
=20
used to reduce emissions elsewhere, Witherspoon said. She said the governor=
's=20
order was the best way to get more power and still maintain environmental=
=20
standards.=20
Witherspoon said the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which needs t=
o=20
approve the new standards set by Davis, had been "very cooperative."=20
"Bringing the maximum amount of power out of natural gas capacity is really=
=20
going to help," Witherspoon said. "If we don't get every last megawatt we=
=20
can, we will see people turning to diesel more frequently."=20
The South Coast Air Quality District, which is the largest and most pollute=
d=20
area of the state, already has been allowing power plants to produce more=
=20
power in exchange for higher fines, said Ralph Cavanagh of Natural Resource=
s=20
Defense Council.=20
"The key is whether the mitigation fund being set up will actually be used =
to=20
offset pollution," he said. The "jury is still out" on how successful the=
=20
program has been, Cavanagh said.=20
Cavanagh agreed that using natural gas plants was much better than diesel,=
=20
something the Davis administration is considering. "Clearly we want to=20
suppress the operation of diesel," he said. "To the extent that it reduces=
=20
diesel, that is a benefit."=20
The state's municipal utilities have for months been asking Davis for=20
yesterday's exemption so they can run their natural-gas-powered plants=20
longer, and presumably make some money off the increase in sales. Power=20
prices are at their highest in history.=20
Davis has previously threatened the public utilities takeover because of th=
e=20
high prices being charged the state, which has spent about $8.3 billion to=
=20
purchase power since January. The utilities have said they are only passing=
=20
along the high cost of the natural gas used to produce the electricity.=20
"This was the issue we had to have solved or we could not offer any of our=

Department of Water and Power.=20
The price of the extra power is "being negotiated now with the governor's=

Federal regulators widened their investigation yesterday of a Texas natural=
=20
gas firm accused of inflating statewide energy prices, reversing an earlier=
=20
order that had partially exonerated the company.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's 4-to-0 ruling in the investigati=
on=20
of El Paso Corp., backed by Pat Wood, the Bush administration's new=20
appointee, was greeted by California's chief energy regulator as a turning=
=20
point in the commission's attitude toward state complaints of price gouging=
.=20
The commission's action "signals a whole new chapter of vigilant=20
enforcement," said Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities=
=20
Commission.=20
The federal commission reopened the question of whether El Paso rigged the=
=20
bid for a huge block of capacity on its gas pipeline in favor of its own=20
marketing affiliate, thus stifling competition that could have prevented=20
natural gas prices from soaring to the levels they reached last winter.=20
In the past year, gas from the Southwest has sold at the California border =
at=20
prices as much as 10 times the nationwide average, driving up the price of=
=20
consumers' heating bills and of electricity produced at power plants that r=
un=20
on natural gas.=20
In March, before Wood was appointed, the commission cleared El Paso of=20
complaints by California officials that the firm had engineered the takeove=
r=20
by its marketing arm of more than one-third of the space on its pipeline in=
to=20
California. That pipeline supplies half of the state's gas.=20
In the same ruling, however, the commission ordered a trial-like hearing on=
=20
the separate question of whether El Paso exercised near-monopoly market pow=
er=20
to boost its profits.=20
The PUC, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say El=
=20
Paso's pipeline affiliate and its marketing subsidiary combined to prevent=
=20
competing shippers from importing natural gas, jacking up prices.=20
The hearing, which has already stretched from an original schedule of four=
=20
days to more than five weeks, will now be expanded for evidence on=20
accusations that l Paso broke federal regulations against preferential=20
treatment for affiliates.=20
COMPANY NOT WORRIED
El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn said the probe would reinforce the=20
commission's original decision that El Paso was innocent of rigging the=20
pipeline bid.=20
"We're confident they'll use the same information to reach the same=20
conclusion," Dunn said.=20
Harvey Morris, the PUC's lead attorney in the case, said the order could le=
ad=20
to harsher penalties against El Paso if an administrative law judge found=
=20
wrongdoing.=20
Lynch said last week that El Paso should be forced to pay back California f=
or=20
what the state considers its excess costs during the 15-month contract=20
between the company and its marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy. The sta=
te=20
has never estimated that figure, but consultants for Edison say the alleged=
=20
market manipulation cost California an extra $3.7 billion.=20
The PUC first asked the federal commission to void the contract in April=20
2000. By the time the commission ordered a hearing, the contract was close =
to=20
its expiration date -- this past May 31.=20
Wood, who was sworn in to the commission last week, said in a concurring=20
opinion yesterday that such cases should be investigated promptly.=20
"In the framework of active energy markets, it is critical that the=20
commission act expeditiously on complaints," Wood wrote.=20
RAISING THE BAR
Wood's remark "seems to raise the bar for FERC" in its role as a market=20
watchdog, Lynch said.=20
There has been much speculation about how Wood's presence will affect the=
=20
federal commission, which has been at odds with California officials over=
=20
virtually every area of energy policy.=20
Wood, a 38-year-old lawyer, was nominated to the Texas Public Utilities=20
Commission by then-Gov. George W. Bush in 1995. At the time, Bush said that=
=20
Wood "shares my conservative philosophy" and would bring a free-market=20
approach to regulation.=20
Bush administration officials have hinted that Wood will replace Curt Heber=
t=20
as chairman of the federal commission, though White House spokesman Ari=20
Fleischer dampened the speculation last week, saying Hebert was not in dang=
er=20
of losing his job.=20
On his recent trip to the state, Bush said he had assigned Wood to=20
investigate the high cost of natural gas delivered to California.=20
Wood has spoken to Gov. Gray Davis twice on the phone about the energy=20
crisis. The two plan to meet in Washington on June 20, said Steve Maviglio,=
 a=20
spokesman for Davis.=20
"The governor was enthusiastic about Pat Wood after his conversations with=
=20
him," Maviglio said. "He feels the commissioner understands the issues out=
=20
here, and he promises to provide some relief in one form or another."=20
Davis declined to comment on yesterday's decision until he had time to read=
=20
it.=20
The PUC's Morris said that it was no coincidence that gas prices in=20
California had dropped dramatically since El Paso Merchant Energy's contrac=
t=20
expired May 31, and 30 competing shippers started to share the pipeline=20
capacity.=20
"It's no longer the 800-pound gorilla on the El Paso system," Morris said.=
=20
El Paso spokeswoman Dunn said prices had dropped because of a wide range of=
=20
factors, including mild weather, increased hydroelectric power production a=

If he had his way, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales said yesterday, he still wou=
ld=20
be opposed to construction of a 600-megawatt power plant in a neighborhood =
in=20
the southern part of his town.=20
But he didn't get his way, and so he was forced to do the best he could wit=
h=20
what he had, Gonzales admitted.=20
"My basic position was that this plant was coming to San Jose. It was a=20
situation where the hand was dealt to the city of San Jose," Gonzales said.=
=20
As a result, Gonzales and eight of the city's nine council members reversed=
=20
field dramatically last week and voted to approve the Metcalf Energy Center=
,=20
a $400 million power plant to be built by Calpine Corp. and Bechtel=20
Enterprises Holding Inc.=20
In November, Gonzales and the council had unanimously rejected the power=20
plant proposal, contending that it was too close to the residential Santa=
=20
Teresa neighborhood, that the plant belonged in an industrial area and that=
=20
it was contrary to the city's general plan for the area.=20
All of that is still true, although the environmental problems have been=20
dramatically mitigated, Gonzales said.=20
What changed is the political atmosphere surrounding energy decisions, and=
=20
the plain reality that the decision by San Jose's officials was going to be=
=20
cast aside.=20
"It became more and more clear the California Energy Commission was going t=
o=20
overrule our decision," Gonzales said.=20
"Given that inevitability, I felt it was important to act upon the request =
of=20
Calpine to sit down and talk."=20
The result, he said, is a "different facility" than the one the council=20
rejected in November, although there are plenty of skeptics who contend tha=
t=20
the new plant is not substantially different from the one the city rejected=
=20
eight months ago.=20
The most significant changes were in the protection of the neighborhood's a=
ir=20
quality by requiring more monitoring and stricter safety standards for the=
=20
handling of toxic chemicals.=20
The community also will have its own advisory committee overseeing the plan=
,=20
and air quality reports will be made regularly and publicly.=20
Calpine/Bechtel also agreed to cut back by 25 percent the number of times t=
he=20
facility will be shut down and restarted. Such events occur as demand ebbs=
=20
and flows, and every restart involves a period of unusually high emissions,=
=20
in much the same way that emissions rise every time a car is started.=20
But Calpine spokeswoman Lisa Poelle admitted that the demand for energy at=
=20
the new plant -- scheduled to open in mid-2003 -- is expected to be so high=
=20
that shutdowns due to a lack of demand are considered unlikely.=20
The new agreement also gives local business a spot at the head of the line =
-=20
- they have a three-month period where they're allowed to apply exclusively=
=20
for contracts for the power from the Metcalf plant.=20
"Most of the power will stay here in San Jose," he said.=20
Gonzales said he entered into negotiations with Calpine/Bechtel after meeti=
ng=20
with residents of the Santa Teresa neighborhood. He said he believes the=20
agreement responds to most of their concerns.=20
"Did we get everything they wanted? No. It was probably impossible to get=
=20
everything they wanted," he said.=20
In fact, despite all the negotiations, Gonzales is plainly disappointed tha=
t=20
he was forced to make the deal.=20
The plant "is still inconsistent with our general plan, and that is the cru=
x=20
of the whole process. The California Energy Commission was set up to decide=
=20
if they will override a local land-use decision. . . . Land use has become =
a=20
moot issue. And when we rejected it in November, it was based on the land=
=20
use.=20
"I acted on the same principles we had from day one -- do everything I coul=
d=20
to protect the neighborhood."=20
Gonzales steadfastly argued that he was not influenced by the array of=20
political and business interests that had lined up in support of the Metcal=
f=20
project -- including Gov. Gray Davis, every state legislator in the region=
=20
and the area's leading business and environmental organizations.=20
"The other part of the political structure has a very different job than I=
=20
have. I have the responsibility of protecting neighborhoods and the city of=
=20
San Jose," he said.=20
Gonzales also said he believed there would be no long-term political damage=
=20
to his bid for re-election next year.=20
His opposition to the power plant was based on his own agenda of protecting=
=20
neighborhood interests, a popular position that has guided the rest of his=
=20
activities, he said.=20
"The people of San Jose are my bosses," he said.=20
"I've continued to stay focused on things that were important to them in=20
1998. I said I was going to work on strong neighborhoods, traffic congestio=
n=20
and improving public education, and those are the things I've been working=

Blackouts' first birthday is this week=20

Mercury News=20


It was only a year ago that Californians scarcely considered their electric=
=20
bills, rarely thought twice before boarding elevators and never calculated=
=20
the kilowatts firing their hot tubs. For many, the biggest care last June w=
as=20
tracking portfolios on the Internet.=20
Now, if you want to follow your stocks consistently, you'd better have=20
bolstered your PC with a battery backup.=20
Sometime in the year since rolling blackouts first darkened the San Francis=
co=20
Bay Area last June 14, most Californians have gained a new obsession:=20
electricity. And though the power outlook has swung from hopeful to dreadfu=
l=20
and back again, many of us haven't lived quite the same ever since.=20
``Before, you might have the radio on all day, or the television; now, you=
=20
don't do that,'' said Doreen Hufton, 54, of Cupertino. ``We used to have=20
plug-in air fresheners. We've taken all those out now.''=20
The transformation has touched everything around us. Gov. Gray Davis, once =
an=20
all-but-certain presidential contender, is now fighting for his political=
=20
life. California wiped out its multibillion-dollar budget surplus to buy=20
power for its destitute utilities. And its economy, sixth largest in the=20
world, is threatened by troubles better-known in banana republics.=20
Beyond its borders, California has gone from admired trendsetter to a=20
national laughingstock; from political heavyweight to a beggar for mercy.=
=20
``We went from a holiday moment to a funeral,'' said Mark Petracca, a=20
political scientist at the University of California-Irvine.=20
More remarkable, Californians themselves -- full of optimism a year ago --=
=20
are now glum. Even the prospect that the crisis may ease isn't ending our=
=20
malaise, at least not yet.=20
``It's a wholesale change in attitude,'' said Field Poll director Mark=20
DiCamillo, who recently found Californians' optimism at its lowest level in=
 a=20
decade. ``This changeover from a very buoyant outlook to despairing about t=
he=20
future all happened in a very short period of time. I'd attribute almost al=
l=20
of that to problems with electricity.''=20
Lifestyle in flux=20
Even the hot tubs and white wines that, for many, epitomize California's=20
laid-back lifestyle are scrutinized over the power they demand for heating=
=20
and cooling.=20
The ``Energy Star'' label that shoppers hardly noticed a year ago is sudden=
ly=20
must-have. Local appliance and electronics stores say energy-efficient=20
washers, dryers and refrigerators fly off their shelves, along with=20
flashlights, batteries, generators and backup battery packs.=20
``It's all energy-saving -- that's all they want,'' said Pauline Lerma, a=
=20
customer service representative at Western Appliance. ``It's just boomed.''=
=20
With thermostats up this summer to save power, the state that invented casu=
al=20
Fridays is dressing down all through the week. It's more shirtsleeves and=
=20
fewer blazers at the Santa Clara County Government Center, where department=
=20
heads offer battery-powered fans to sweating staff. Even bastions of=20
formality -- the state Senate and courts, where coat and tie are standard=
=20
dress for men -- talk of loosening up.=20
California's newest residents, many of whom come from countries where power=
=20
shortages are routine, find the irony amazing.=20
``I can't believe this is happening in the richest country in the world,''=
=20
said Vandana Kumar, 37, who came to San Jose from Bihar, India, 15 years ag=
o.=20
Back in Bihar, people live with six hours of blackouts every weekday, from =
8=20
to 11 in the morning and 4 to 7 in the evening, Kumar said. Now they're=20
chuckling over California.=20
``They all know about it and it's a big joke,'' Kumar said. ``They say,=20
`Didn't you go there to get away from this?'?''=20
Kumar can take comfort in this: No one could have predicted the past year's=
=20
turn of events.=20
The June 2000 blackouts, in fact, were only partly related to the power=20
crisis they exposed, resulting mostly from record heat that overwhelmed the=
=20
Bay Area's long-inadequate transmission capacity.=20
But when nearly 100,000 customers went dark that day, the state gradually=
=20
began to notice a problem that had been building for months. Down in San=20
Diego, power prices were starting to soar.=20
The pace of change soon quickened.=20
By December state leaders were urging limits on holiday lights, natural gas=
=20
bills were skyrocketing and major utilities were nearing bankruptcy. The ne=
w=20
year brought first one electric rate increase, then another. And along the=
=20
way, the energy crisis became part of our lives.=20
California's lexicon in 2001 includes ``rolling blackout,'' ``ISO'' and=20
``outage block.'' And when Gov. Davis speaks of ``QFs'' on TV, referring to=
=20
alternative energy producers, at least some of his viewers know he means=20
qualifying facility.=20
The state's troubles have had impact far beyond its borders. Because the=20
energy crisis is widely thought to stem from California's 1996 decision to=
=20
deregulate its electricity markets, other states are fleeing the=20
once-burgeoning deregulation movement.=20
``It's dampened interest,'' said Suraj Kanhouwa, an economist with the=20
federal Energy Information Administration. ``Other states that were on the=
=20
cusp of deregulation are in a wait-and-watch mode. The California experienc=
e=20
is unfortunate, it was not anticipated, and it's raising a lot of=20
questions.''=20
Political agendas, too, have been derailed coast to coast. Gov. Davis and=
=20
President George W. Bush campaigned to reform education. Now, it's all abou=
t=20
energy, a concern that's sinking approval ratings for both. Davis, in=20
particular, seems to get more national exposure these days in the comics th=
an=20
he does on the political circuit.=20
Last week, for instance, the Pretzel Logic strip treated readers to the son=
g=20
``Proud Davis,'' to the tune of ``Proud Mary'' (``Rollin' -- rollin' -- We'=

``If you came to work this morning and neglected to put your pants on, you'=

be the butt of jokes,'' said state librarian Kevin Starr. ``California didn=

After a year of bickering and precious little progress, Democrats and=20
Republicans still talk of solving the power crisis. But many Californians=

don't see the current problems going away anytime soon.=20
``It isn't like El Ni=0Fo, which we know is eventually going to stop,'' sai=

Petracca, the political scientist, recalling the weather phenomenon that=20
drenched California three years ago.=20
Culture shift=20
Starr thinks California is going through a transformation in its identity,=
=20
which he refers to ``a cultural paradigm shift.''=20
``The previous paradigm was that California was a colonized resort, that al=

today.''=20
And Californians are also realizing -- having weathered earthquakes, drough=

Davis' con job=20
Governor withholds truth from taxpayers about state's electricity crisis




TOM MCCLINTOCK
Senator McClintock represents the 19th Senate District in the California=20
Legislature. His website address is www.sen.ca.gov/mcclintock=20

In a free society, California's electricity problems would have corrected=
=20
themselves long ago. A shortage develops, electricity becomes relatively=20
scarce and prices rise. As prices rise, consumers reduce their demand while=
=20
producers develop more generation. Consumption declines, production=20
increases, prices fall. The result: low prices and abundant electricity.=20
In California's society, a simple shortage becomes catastrophic. As prices=
=20
rise, the government begins heavily subsidizing electricity purchases. This=
=20
drives prices still higher while hiding the reality of those prices from=20
consumers. Meanwhile, government officials threaten producers with the=20
seizure of their assets and imprisonment if they set foot in California. Th=
e=20
result: Consumers will see surcharges tacked onto their power bills and tax=
es=20
for years to come to pay for the subsidies, while investors who planned to=
=20
come to California to build more power plants decide to invest elsewhere.
There is a very simple truth that California's governor just can't seem to=
=20
grasp: Governments can hide prices, but they cannot set them. When Gov. Dav=
is=20
buys power for 50-cents per kilowatt-hour and sells it back to consumers fo=
r=20
seven cents, consumers haven't been spared the other 43 cents. It simply en=
ds=20
up on their tax bill. Already, the state's treasury has lost more than $8=
=20
billion (about $950 for an average family of four) in this manner.
To fill this growing hole in his budget, Davis approved the biggest bond=20
measure in history to be repaid with crushing surcharges on consumers' futu=
re=20
electricity bills, averaging about $2,000 per ratepayer.
To keep consumers from revolting over those surcharges, the administration =
is=20
now struggling with how to disguise them. It is doing so by tinkering with=
=20
baseline prices.=20
Different "baselines" for usage will be adjusted to determine who has been=
=20
virtuously frugal and should be rewarded with subsidies and who has been=20
profligate and should be punished with sky-high rates. What makes this=20
fundamentally unjust is that the question of "fairness" depends on an=20
infinite combination of factors that government cannot foresee.=20
It is impossible for government to account for these infinite variations in=
=20
personal circumstances and any preferential pricing scheme is bound to crea=
te=20
countless injustices.=20
There are four principles that government in a free society should instill=
=20
into the pricing structure. They are the four principles that California's=
=20
government has violated.
The first is freedom of choice. In 1996, consumers won the right to choose=
=20
the provider that offers them the best deal for electricity. Although the=
=20
state's electricity supply collapsed before those choices materialized, the=
=20
fact remains that the ultimate defense against price gouging is the ability=
=20
to take your business elsewhere. Gov. Davis and the Legislature took that=
=20
right away from consumers.
The second is equity. When the price of electricity falls, so should our=20
rates. But they won't, because of billions of dollars in surcharges Gov.=20
Davis is adding to future electricity bills.
The third is the truth. Consumers deserve to know the price they're paying=
=20
for electricity when they buy it. This is the only way they can decide how=
=20
much they need and what they're willing to pay for it. The governor's=20
policies have denied them this information.
The fourth is justice. In a just society, a consumer would pay only for his=
=20
or her own consumption - no more and no less.=20
When politicians intervene, the politically favored always end up benefitin=
g=20
at the expense of the politically weak.=20
It shouldn't surprise anyone that family electricity bills have been=20
subsidizing businesses for years.=20
