Subject: RE: New booking request for Dasovich, Jeff

Hello there. I have made reservations for Jeff. If he is wanting to use
frequent flyer mileage for the other ticket, the number to call is
800-421-4655 then press 4. I made those kind of reservations one time, and
the airline agent screwed them all up and ended up being the biggest
headache for me, so I don't touch them any more. Also, the waldorf towers
and waldorf astoria both are sold out for those days. Does he have a couple
of other choices? Enron's preferred hotels are: Drake, Hilton and Towers,
Intercontinental, Loews Metropolitan, Millennium Broadway, Millennium
Hilton, New York Palace, Penninsula, Plaza, St Regis, and W hotel. Let me
know if you want me to check any of those.

thanks
cynthia
