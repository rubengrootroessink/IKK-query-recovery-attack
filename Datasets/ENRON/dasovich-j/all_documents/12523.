David/Sam/Sandi/Jeff,

I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with Mike, Gary and I last 
week at your offices in San Francisco.  The meetings were very informative 
and will certainly help us in our strategy development.  I sent out the 
weekly report to all of you this morning and will keep you on the list, 
unless you request to be removed.  I hope that our team can call upon you 
from time to time for advice and assistance.

I was short of cards, so for those that didn't get my contact details, please 
see below:
