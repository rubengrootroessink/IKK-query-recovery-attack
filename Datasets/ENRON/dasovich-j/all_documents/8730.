tonnes a year of newsprint and paperboard, as well as a sawmill and 
Ste-Aurelie Timberlands Co. located in the U.S. state of Maine. The Quebec 
City mill employs 1,200 people and is one the largest private employers in 
the city.
Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
Daishowa Forest is a wholly owned subsidiary of Daishowa Paper's Daishowa 
North America Corp. unit in Canada. Enron Industrial Markets is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. of the United States. 
Daishowa purchased the Quebec City mill in 1988 from Reed International Plc . 
It has since improved the plant and modernized paper and paperboard machines. 
The sale requires the approval of Canadian and U.S. governmental authorities 
and closing is expected around the end of March 2001.

unauthorized home taping of programs distributed via digital set-tops. This 
allows copyright owners to minimize cannibalization of their home video 
revenues while maximizing PPV system operator revenues.
Tom Carroux, director of sales at Macrovision, said, "We are pleased that 
Enron has chosen to incorporate Macrovision's copy protection technology into 
its broadband infrastructure. The video on-demand market is poised to grow 
rapidly as digital set tops are deployed in increasing numbers and more 
bandwidth becomes available. We believe that copy protection will help system 
operators and program suppliers increase their buy rates for new Hollywood 
movies."

El Paso Energy completes $24 billion purchase of Coastal Corp.

01/30/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - El Paso Energy Corp. said Monday it completed a $24 billion 
acquisition of The Coastal Corp., creating the nation's fourth-largest energy 
company. 
The deal between the two Houston-based companies was completed hours after it 
won approval from the Federal Trade Commission.
El Paso agreed to sell $112 million in investments in 11 offshore pipelines 
to win regulatory approval. That concession eased concerns about the recent 
consolidation of the gas-transportation market, said Molly Boast, the acting 
director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition. 
El Paso already owned the largest natural gas pipeline network in the 
country, and it increased that network by buying Coastal. It will operate a 
58,000-mile pipeline system and hold operations in wholesale marketing and 
trading of natural gas and power, oil refining and gasoline marketing. 
The merger will result in layoffs, but the new El Paso Energy Corp. provided 
no numbers. The company also said it expects an increase in hiring over the 
next year. 
Coastal shareholders will receive 1.23 shares of El Paso common stock for 
each share of Coastal common stock. El Paso also will assume about $7 billion 
in Coastal debt and preferred stock. 
Within the energy business, El Paso will trail only Exxon Mobil Corp., 
Chevron Corp. - which is buying Texaco - and Enron Corp., said executive vice 
president Ralph Eads. 
El Paso and Coastal also announced fourth-quarter earnings on Monday. 
Excluding special items, El Paso reported earnings of $456 million, or 73 
cents per share, up from $295 million, or 48 cents per share a year earlier. 
Revenue more than tripled to $7.5 billion from $2.4 billion. 
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to 
earn 67 cents per share. 
Including one-time gains and losses from asset sales and other items, El Paso 
had fourth-quarter net income of $127 million. 
In its final quarterly earnings report as a stand-alone company, Coastal 
reported record net earnings of $208.3 million, or 93 cents per share, 
compared to $169 million, or 78 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts had 
expected 91 cents per share. 
Coastal had fourth-quarter revenues of $6 billion, nearly double the $3.2 
billion a year earlier. 
For the year, Coastal reported net income of $654.4 million, or $2.96 per 
share, on revenues of $18 billion, compared with earnings of $498.9 million, 
or $2.30 per share, on revenues of $10.3 billion in 1999. 
In late morning trading Tuesday, El Paso shares rose $1 to $64.10. The 
company's stock has doubled in the past year. 
Coastal stock closed Monday $79.50, $2.50 higher.

Enron Agrees to Buy Canadian Paper Mill for Undisclosed Price

     Houston, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, said it agreed to buy a Canadian newsprint mill
from Daishowa North America Corp. to expand its pulp and paper
businesses.
     Terms of the sale of the plant in Quebec were not disclosed.
Enron bought a recycled newsprint mill in Garfield, New Jersey, in
July, the company said.
     The purchase is part of Enron's plan to apply its gas- and
power-trading model to paper. The plants will allow Enron to learn
how the paper business operates and give it a supply to sell as it
develops a paper-trading business.
     Enron's trading unit matches up buyers and sellers of paper,
and develops contracts it can sell to customers who want to lock
in prices for the commodity.
     Daishowa North America Corp. is a unit of Shizuoka, Japan-
based Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co. Shares of Houston-based
Enron fell 87 cents to $79.90 in early afternoon trading. Daishowa
Paper Manufacturing rose 7 yen to 367 in Tokyo.

California Power Exchange to Close as Crisis Lowers Volume

     Pasadena, California, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The California
Power Exchange, the market where most of the power used in the
state was once bought and sold, will end daily and day-ahead
trading by noon tomorrow, a victim of the state's energy crisis.
     The state's 1996 deregulation law created the exchange as a
market where buyers and sellers could buy power and where prices
would be posted to ensure openness and encourage competition. It
began operations in March 1998.
     The state's three biggest investor-owned utilities were
required to buy their power there until last month, when the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized California
utilities to enter into forward contracts to buy power, bypassing
the exchange.
     Power prices have soared in California during the last month
to 10 times as much as year-ago levels. The high prices were
bankrupting the utilities, and the state is now buying power them
and turning to advance contracts that lock in lower prices in
return for agreements to buy power for years.
     With no requirement that companies trade on the exchange,
volume has fallen from an average of 536,000 megawatt hours before
the FERC order to less than 25,000 this week.
     The exchange will continue to arrange delivery and payment of
trades made until it shuts down tomorrow, spokeswoman Beth
Pendexter said. No firings were announced.
     The exchange said it will continue to perform all contract
settlements and scheduling services for market participants.
