Very, very busy.  I thought I was leaving Sempra-land for some well deserved
sanity...no such luck.  When I look at what the politicians, regulators and
inept utility executives have accomplished here in California it just
staggers me.  A friend of mine who is the Senior Advisor for USAID in the
Caucasus tells me that people are just incredulous that the most significant
state in the most powerful country in the world is facing black-outs.
Perhaps we need to send Loretta to Kazakhstan.....

Other than that, PG&E-land is interesting.  Lots of smart, nice people.
Some very motivated, many not.  More like a utility than Sempra.  If I'd
only taken that job with Natural Gas Clearinghouse in 1990......of course if
I did, I be living in some very nice but miserable town in Texas instead of
God's country (as Florio calls SFO).   Still remodeling at home, but I'm a
long way from being finished.  Keeping busy and trying to keep perspective
on things.

How about you ?  Haven't heard anyone complain about Jeff in some
time.....Let's do lunch sometime.
