I guess it doesn't matter whether you or I are "unreasonable;" the leg has

The attached news accounts provide more evidence of: the impact of 
communications industry growth (broadband) on electric grid (Silicon Valley

potential for the recently passed leg (Energy Security and Reliability Act) 
to reduce need/impact of all of above via distributed generation technologies.
