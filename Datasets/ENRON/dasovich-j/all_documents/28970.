I had MRW pull together a list of the QFs that have indicated that they are 
going over to PG&E's $53/MWh deal.  As you can see, it is quite extensive.

Alan,

Attached is a list of QFs in PG&E's bankruptcy case with stipulations, 
motions, and/or orders on file for assumption based on stipulations with 
PG&E to receive a fixed 5.37 cents/kWh energy payment for five years.

If you have any questions, give us a call.

Roger
