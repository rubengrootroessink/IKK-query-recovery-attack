It's crunch time on power rates
By Carrie Peyton

(Published May 7, 2001)=20
In a San Francisco hearing room, lawyers settled into squeaky green seats,=

The Governor's Office knew that business and utility lawyers were asking fo=

The right rates could spur conservation, reduce summer blackouts and drive=

and kill jobs, regulators have been warned.=20
The PUC, which regulates rates, has been gathering data to decide which=20
consumers will get hit hardest by the $4.8 billion rate hike approved in la=
te=20
March. Normally, it takes six months to a year to make such decisions.=20
Now, the PUC is trying to do the job in about six weeks, and Walwyn is=20
scheduled to release her draft decision Tuesday. Community hearings will be=
=20
held across the state before commissioners vote May 14, two weeks before th=
e=20
new charges start showing up on customers' bills June 1.=20
Hanging over it all have been two patches of fog. The state did not give=20
regulators the details on how much money it thinks it needs in rates until=
=20
Wednesday -- so late it was "useless" for this round of rate design, said a=
=20
source familiar with the process.=20
The wait for the data has been "just purely frustrating and leaves everyone=

in the dark," said Ed Yates, vice president of the California League of Foo=

Processors.=20
And the governor, who outlined some general ideas for rates in a speech Apr=
il=20
5, followed up two weeks later by trying to submit, as written testimony, a=
=20
short question-and-answer summary and slides from his Web site.=20
"There's no meat on the bones. There are hardly any bones," said Bob=20
Finkelstein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.=
=20
Ultimately, the judge refused to admit Davis' offerings as testimony, letti=
ng=20
them into the record only as "reference items" that do not carry the weight=
=20
of evidence.=20
The governor's press office has said it believes Davis' opinions will be=20
thoroughly considered by the commission in that format.=20
Davis gave the PUC the same template he gave the Legislature, said spokesma=
n=20
Steve Maviglio, and "the outlines of the plan are clear." He added that PUC=
=20
staffers assured the Governor's Office the information was "acceptable."=20
The episode was nerve-wracking for participants because of the clout Davis =

ng=20
arguments on two key issues and scores of smaller ones, often with hundreds=
=20
of millions of dollars at stake:=20
First, how can rates be designed to encourage conservation?=20
Borenstein, who heads the University of California Energy Institute, urged=
=20
the commission to get tough with virtually everyone, despite political=20
pressure. Big users should be forced onto real-time rates that fluctuate wi=
th=20
the power market, and household users should get rebates for cutting use an=
d=20
face steep charges if they surpass baseline rates.=20
Such calls have met with strong opposition from businesses least able to cu=
t=20
consumption when prices are highest, such as canneries that operate around=
=20
the clock and department stores that want to stay open at peak hours.=20
A second, equally contentious issue is who should bear the brunt of the rat=
e=20
hike.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch, the commissioner assigned to oversee this rate=
=20
case, suggested early on that her colleagues should consider reversing a=20
long-standing policy of charging the biggest users some of the lowest price=
s.=20
Before this year's twin rate hikes, PG&E's household rates averaged more th=
an=20
10 cents a kilowatt-hour while its largest industrial customers paid less=
=20
than 5 cents. Heavy industries contend such imbalances are fair because the=
=20
biggest power users cost less to serve. They consume steady amounts of=20
electricity around the clock, while homeowners' consumption shoots up durin=
g=20
high-priced peaks.=20
The overall rate hike approved unanimously by commissioners March 27 gives=
=20
PG&E and Edison the right to collect the equivalent of an extra 3 cents for=
=20
every kilowatt-hour of electricity they sell.=20
There are at least two ways to do that: Charge everyone 3 cents more or sen=
d=20
everyone's rates up about 29 percent for PG&E customers and 26 percent for=

Edison's.=20
"Any time you use an equal-cents allocation, it's going to be to the benefi=
t=20
of smaller customers," said Sharp, PG&E's rate director. The equal-cent=20
method is also fairer than equal percentage hikes, she said, because those=
=20
are based on "very, very old" calculations about how much it costs to serve=
=20
different customers.=20
But Edison has taken the opposite stand, urging the commission to go easier=
=20
on its biggest customers, with rate hikes that top out at about 30 percent=
=20
for any one group. "We want to ensure that the increase is allocated fairly=
=20
among customer classes," said Akbar Jazayeri, Edison's manager of pricing a=

?????Edison Lacks Enough Veteran Linemen
?????This is bad news for anyone in Edison territory. The utility can't=20
afford to alienate its veteran linemen because there aren't enough to go=20
around. Journeymen are in short supply, drawing big signing bonuses and=20
promises of generous overtime. Edison was trying to hire more than 100 when=

?????Linemen like to see themselves as roughneck heroes, riding into town t=

the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 47. "I think our=

members would probably offer to work for free if they thought it would help=
.=20
They like working for Edison. It's a pride thing."

?????Team Spirit Takes a Hit
?????You see this ethos in Kansas City, home of the International Lineman's=

Rodeo. Every September, hundreds of utility field-worker teams pour in from=
=20
as far as Jamaica and England to test their skills and stamina against othe=

k=20

?????Last year, Edison's senior team--45 years and older--placed fourth out=

of 213. It was a huge coup and a career highlight for team member Joe Baker=
,=20
a crew foreman and 25-year Edison veteran working out of the Barstow office=
.=20
His parents came down from Iowa to watch. His wife and son--an Edison=20
apprentice--were cheering from the bleachers. Baker had been training for=

?????Seven months after his big win, Baker watches as pieces of Barstow go=

funny, like it's all your fault."

?????Union Opposed Deregulation Plan
?????For decades, Edison's linemen enjoyed a strong safety record,=20
top-of-the-line equipment and lifetime job security. Then came=20
deregulation--a concept that the linemen's union opposed long before the 19=
96=20
state law was adopted, convinced it would destabilize their lives.
?????They were downsized. Their jobs were contracted out or given to=20
temporary workers. They felt exposed and vulnerable. As early as 1998, an=

days."

Joe Baker, a 25-year Edison veteran who works in Barstow, says he's noticed=
 a=20
change in public attitude since power crisis began.
BRIAN WALSKI / Los Angeles Times

?????The utility was on the TV news every night. Linemen began spending mor=
e=20
time with customers, explaining, defending. They blamed the state regulator=
s=20
who set up the dysfunctional market and the energy suppliers who took=20
advantage and reaped huge profits, but they also wondered: Why isn't the=20
company doing more to get the facts out? Why isn't it being more aggressive=
?
?????In February, the union launched its own campaign, organizing a protest=
=20
march at a Huntington Beach generating plant owned by AES, a giant=20
Texas-based energy wholesaler. The message was that Edison was the victim o=
f=20
gouging by the generators. But what motorists saw as they drove by were ang=
ry=20
picketers at a power plant, wearing Edison hats and jackets. Victim and=20
villain were confused. The problem was too complex to fit on a placard. No=
=20
more protests are planned.
?????Soon after Edison's belt-tightening, the electrical workers union file=
d=20
objections with the state Public Utilities Commission, arguing that the=20
layoffs and overtime restrictions would seriously reduce the level of servi=
ce=20
in Edison territory--a violation of PUC rules.
?????Two months later, the PUC agreed and ordered Edison to restore jobs an=
d=20
hours that could affect service. By then, some linemen argued, it was too=
=20
late. "The customers will remember we weren't there for them," says Lopez, =
a=20
longtime union activist and an officer of Local 47.
?????Even after the PUC ruling, overtime restrictions for routine work=20
continue to cut linemen's pay by at least 20%, far more in some cases. It's=
 a=20
traumatic loss for those who have grown accustomed to fat checks, and to=20
nearly doubling their base pay of about $65,000.
?????"For someone with no college degree, earning six figures is not bad,"=
=20
says Russ Neal, a supervisor in the Santa Ana distribution center. "But kee=
p=20
in mind, this job is hard on personal lives. A lot of these guys are paying=
=20
ex-wives, child support. They're not all choosing between a boat and a=20
camper."
?????For some, the change has been a partial blessing. Elite "troublemen"=
=20
like Lopez, who are the first on the scene of an outage, get to sleep throu=
gh=20

?????"Having Dad home has been wonderful," says Peggy Lopez, Ernie's wife o=
f=20
20 years. "We have a son, and there's been a lot of bonding lately."
?????But they all miss what the linemen call blood money. The Lopez family =
is=20
scaling back on weekend trips and dinners out. Peggy wonders whether she'll=

need to go back to work after staying home for 11 years with her two=20
children. Nine-year-old Albert is in tears after a day of teasing at school=

?????"We hadn't shared with the children how serious it was," says Peggy.=
=20
"Afterward, he and Ernie had that talk. Now we just pray that things get=20
worked out."
?????Job-wise, Edison's linemen are probably safe, no matter what happens.=
=20
After all, someone has to keep the power going, even through bankruptcy or=
=20
state ownership. Still, it's unsettling. Linemen who were once disciplined=
=20
for accidentally tripping brief outages are now ordered to cut off customer=
s=20
for an hour at a stretch. They're nervous and distracted. They want this=20
crisis to end, but see no end in sight. Supervisors worry about their=20
linemen's ability to concentrate, to stay focused. After all, in this job, =
a=20
moment's carelessness can be deadly.
?????"It's important that we talk to them more and let them vent a little,"=
=20
says Bob Woods, who manages Edison's Santa Ana operating center. "When you=

?????Into Woods' office walks Paul Miller, a clean-cut 34-year-old=20
troubleman, earnest, eager. He's been with the company 15 years. His job is=

pink slips. More than 100 executives work a week for free.
?????"It's very depressing," says Donald Fellows, who once designed power=

grumpy when talking about his current job: manager of revenues and tariffs.
?????Pure frustration, he huffs. He spends far too much time in hearing=20
rooms, listening to "self-serving drivel" from Edison's many critics and=20
second-guessers, who seem to pass right over the numbers Fellows so=20
meticulously gathers.
?????In his view, state regulators micro-managed Edison into this mess, by=

forcing it to buy power on the volatile spot market. Wholesale prices=20
exploded, from 3 to 30 cents a kilowatt. Now the people who made the rules=

are blaming Edison for letting it happen. And getting away with it.

?????Consumer advocates are hostile, suspicious. The commission compromises=

by raising rates about 10%. Edison's stock plunges, at one point losing hal=

?????Panicked Retirees Flood Firm With Calls
?????The winter passes in a painful fog of uncertainty across the bland=20
1970s-era Edison complex, home to 4,000 engineers, lawyers, managers and=20
clerks. Employees keep their heads down, but they cannot escape the crisis.

brown-bag sessions on resume writing and interview techniques. It startles=

deal with all the calls.

weeks now, the businesses have had to shut down several hours a day. Some=

?????As the company's value dives, it takes down children's college funds,=

troubled by the steep erosion of service.
?????Ballance is close to tears as he guts his construction budget, canceli=
ng=20
orders and contracts that were eagerly placed just six months earlier. This=

was going to be a big year, a chance to fix Edison's aging collection of=20
poles, substations and wires.
?????He hesitates, scarcely believing what he is about to say: "We're=20
knowingly taking on risk. . . . If we get extreme temperatures this summer,=
=20
only a few pockets out could cause serious problems."
?????Through his office window, he looks out on a trail of hulking=20

evidence that Edison is still the proud source of power for Southern=20
California. What he doesn't know is that the lines themselves will soon be=

caught up in the energy debacle.

?????An Odd Sense of Hope and Mission
?????Along with nail-biting anxiety, January brings an odd sense of hope an=
d=20
mission to Edison headquarters. State and federal legislators are finally=
=20
paying attention, trying to understand what happened. Auditors are going=20
through the books. Gov. Gray Davis says he will consider a state plan to=20
rescue California's private utilities, but with a daunting pair of=20
parameters--no utility bankruptcies and no rate increases.
?????Edison must analyze hundreds of contract, rate and transmission-cost=
=20
variables--months of work--within a couple of days. At last the problem=20
solvers have something to sink their teeth into.
?????"I've seen this time and again over the 21 years I've worked here," sa=
ys=20
an optimistic Charles Basham, who runs Edison's internal Web site and=20
considers himself its unofficial historian. "We work best in a crisis."
?????Corridors that thread past gray cubicles and into wood-paneled executi=
ve=20
offices are strangely silent. No gossip around the water coolers. No shriek=
s=20
of exasperation. Just lots of conference calls and long nights with cold=20
pizza and coffee.
?????Alan J. Fohrer, who helped design the San Onofre nuclear plant, has co=
me=20
back to help. These days he runs Irvine-based Edison Mission Energy, a=20
fast-growing, unregulated sister company to Southern California Edison that=
=20
owns and operates generating plants around the world.
?????Fohrer's wife is out of town. At dawn he dashes home to Arcadia to wak=
e=20
his kids before they notice he's gone, make their lunches and get them off =
to=20
school. Then he rushes back for another day of calculations.
?????After 36 hours, Fohrer wears a tentative smile. There is a way--if a=
=20
series of events falls perfectly in line--to pay off Edison's debts without=
=20
raising rates.
?????"We have an opportunity," says the 50-year-old executive, laying out a=
ll=20
the little pieces. "But we have to move quickly. The problem gets bigger=20
every day."
?????Weeks pass. Fohrer's plan becomes moot because state legislative=20
proposals keep adding demands: Edison must hand over a chunk of company=20
stock. Or all of its prized hydroelectric system. Or its valuable=20
transmission lines. These ideas come and go, almost whimsically, without ev=
er=20
taking solid form. The urgency that once distracted Edison employees=20
dissolves into a numbing sense of powerlessness.
?????Fohrer--intense, serious, focused, a veteran of the 1990s deregulation=
=20
debate, when he says most of his ideas were ignored--struggles for words to=
=20
describe his frustration, then finally sputters, "This is silly."
?????He graduated from USC in 1973 with a degree in civil engineering. He=
=20
dreamed of designing huge, complex structures like oil refineries, and talk=
ed=20
to all the major international firms. Then Edison courted him, and Fohrer w=
as=20
charmed. Edison was at the tail end of a five-year hiring binge, ramping up=
=20
to design and build dozens of new power plants for the fast-growing state.
?????The expansion didn't last long. Inflation hit, raising the cost of=20
construction. The Arab oil embargo struck, straining supplies and making=20
conservation look like a good idea. The Three Mile Island nuclear plant=20
leaked radiation, setting off a fierce antinuclear backlash. Edison built=
=20
only two generators after 1973.
?????None of that compares to the current mess, says John L. Jurewitz, an=
=20
economist and Edison's manager of regulatory policy. Like many veterans, he=
=20
knows precisely when it started: April 1994, when the PUC announced that it=
=20
was moving to an open retail market.
?????"Starting at that point," Jurewitz says, "we were in damage control=20
mode."
?????Edison executives worked with state legislators to fashion the 1996=20
state law that became the framework for restructuring. But Ballance, Fohrer=
,=20
Jurewitz and others directly involved in those talks insist that what they=
=20
lobbied for was a far cry from what was later implemented.
?????They want the world to know that, as Fellows puts it, "the utility was=
=20
dragged into this kicking and screaming." They highlight passages and fax=
=20
reports and letters dating back to 1993.
?????But the old papers are dense and complicated. Southern California=20
Edison--big, familiar, accessible--continues to be a target.
?????The engineers shout at the television. They cringe at the morning=20
newspaper. They riffle through their files to find the old documents that=
=20
will prove their point. But by then it's too late. The media, the=20
politicians, the public have moved from one oversimplified idea to the next=
.
?????And these consumer advocates!
?????"How do they get coverage so easy just because they sound good?" asks=
=20
Danny Haberern, an engineer who lost his Illinois railroad job when the lin=
e=20
went bankrupt, then fled to a "safe," regulated utility. He's now district=
=20
supervisor in Edison's Montebello center. "I don't get it."
?????Edison is getting bundles of hate mail. Edison is the butt of shock=20
radio programs. Edison employees are being snubbed at their children's=20
basketball games.
?????It's not our fault, they say, a little too desperately. We never wante=
d=20
to sell our power plants. We asked for long-term contracts four years ago. =
We=20
pleaded for a rate hike in December. When we ran the system, it never faile=
d.
?????Facing the new market, Edison slashed its staff through a series of=20
layoffs and voluntary retirements in the mid-1990s. In 1998, to comply with=
=20
deregulation, it sold 12 gas-fired power plants and bought the electricity=
=20
back through a state-supervised market where prices fluctuate daily.
?????Other retailers are invited to jump in and compete, but retail=20
competition never materializes in force, and prices do not drop but soar. B=
y=20
last December, it is clear that the market is dysfunctional. Under the=20
deregulation law, Edison cannot respond by raising rates. By the end of the=
=20
year, the utility is out of cash and comes within a filament of cutting pow=
er=20
to customers.
?????Back in the old days, John Ballance could make a troubled generator=20
continue running if the grid needed juice. He could get on the phone and te=
ll=20
the manager, "You'll just have to hang on for a few hours, until we get pas=

?????Now those same plants go offline whenever the new owners say, and all=

the begging in the world won't bring them back.
?????In February an international energy firm, PA Management Group, names=

Edison the most reliable utility in the Western region, based on 1999=20
figures. The veterans chuckle. They know it will be many years before Ediso=

?????Ballance leaves for a long-planned family vacation, to visit his new=

he says. He checks the Internet for news every morning and night, and draws=

?????It's only after his return that Ballance learns the state will buy=20
Edison's transmission grid--half of his job--in exchange for a "bailout." T=

Utility Bills Are Just One Way People Pay for Energy Crisis=20
Money: From hotel rates to zoo admission, fees are being added.=20

By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????Do you depend on a dry-cleaner? Dine out now and then? Do you patroniz=
e=20
a hair salon, pump iron at a gym, send flowers occasionally or plan to take=
 a=20
vacation this year?
?????If so, you'll probably be paying an energy surcharge on those and many=
=20
other goods and services. In some cases, you already are.
?????Visitors at the San Diego Zoo found a $1.50 "energy assistance fee"=20
tacked onto the admission as of last week. The Water Grill in downtown Los=
=20
Angeles raised prices about 3% last month. And the San Francisco Federal=20
Reserve Bank predicts the average Californian will spend at least $750 extr=
a=20
over the next year on new energy-related costs.
?????Hotels were the first to pass on the pain of the state's spiking utili=
ty=20
costs, but now the practice is spreading. The result: Many Californians wil=
l=20
get stung by the energy crisis multiple times: once through rate hikes comi=
ng=20
next month, then again and again through special fees tacked on by business=
es=20
coping with their own power bills.
?????The surcharges aren't popping up just on luxuries such as a stay at a=
=20
beach-side inn or an hour in a tanning bed. Even staples such as milk could=
=20
cost more.
?????Milk processors have asked the state Department of Food and Agricultur=
e=20
for a price adjustment, a shift that--if approved at a hearing late this=20
month--could bump up costs at the supermarket. And gasoline prices--already=
=20
about $2 a gallon--could be nudged further upward if summer blackouts shut=
=20
down refineries and pinch fuel supplies.
?????For some Californians, the risks are more basic. Some businesses,=20
reluctant to raise prices too high for fear of scaring off customers, will=
=20
offset soaring utility costs by laying off employees, cutting wages or=20
slashing benefits.
?????"We will see an impact on unemployment rates, we will see an impact on=
=20
wages, we will see an impact on benefits," said Shirley Knight, assistant=
=20
state director of the National Federation of Independent Business. "When=20
you're a small business owner and your [power] bill triples, you simply hav=
e=20
no choice."
?????Four months after the energy crisis hit California full force, financi=
al=20
repercussions continue to multiply. The state is spending upward of $50=20
million a day buying energy for struggling utilities, and the sale of $12.5=
=20
billion in bonds to return that money to government coffers is clouded by=
=20
politics and a legal dispute.

?????Summer Blackouts Threaten Economy
?????The state's $1.25-trillion economy, while still strong, is already=20
showing wear and tear as uncertainty about energy costs and supply endure,=
=20
some economists say. A summer of blackouts, meanwhile, threatens to hurt=20
business productivity, discourage new investment and push inflation rates u=
p,=20
they say.
?????"Elevated energy costs present a significant drag on the economy and c=
an=20
be expected to reduce growth and economic output and employment," a study b=
y=20
the Bay Area Economic Forum said. The study said 42% of Bay Area businesses=
=20
report that power problems have already hurt their profit margins and their=
=20
competitiveness relative to competitors outside the region.
?????Steven Cochrane, a senior economist at Economy.com in West Chester, Pa=
.,=20
is not surprised: "There are strong downsides to this [energy crisis] for t=
he=20
state both short term and long term. Everyone is watching California."
?????For most residents of the Golden State, the most visceral blow will be=
=20
felt through rate hikes, beginning--but probably not ending--with the=20
increase reaching as high as 46% for some that will show up in June bills.
?????But the effects go far beyond that, and some analysts are attempting t=
o=20
quantify them. The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank study estimating a $7=
50=20
annual hit for an average Californian figures $250 for electricity bill=20
increases, $200 for additional natural gas charges and $300 for the indirec=
t,=20
day-to-day costs that will rise because of power-related surcharges and pri=
ce=20
hikes.
?????The report's authors emphasize that their figure "would rise=20
substantially" if the full increase in wholesale electricity prices borne b=
y=20
the state was taken into account.
?????Even so, $750--representing 1.5% of the average Californian's annual=
=20
income--is a very real bite, especially for the poor. Already, community=20
organizations report increases in calls for help from people forced to choo=
se=20
among keeping their power on, buying food or paying for day care.
?????"It's that whole fixed-income thing," said Dennis Osmer, who runs a=20
nonprofit organization in Santa Cruz County that helps the poor pay their=
=20
energy bills. "If they're living on Social Security and just getting by, an=
y=20
kind of increase in anything can push them right off the edge."

?????Extra Outlay Just 'Sunk Down a Hole'
?????Veterans of the state's consumer groups warn that the consequences of=
=20
the energy crisis for Californians--and the fiscal health of the state as a=
=20
whole--are staggering, and not yet fully known. Harry Snyder, a senior=20
advocate for Consumers Union, likens it to "a 7.0 earthquake that hits=20
everyone, everywhere."
?????"Wherever you turn, there's an impact," Snyder said. "The cafe owner=
=20
around the corner said his utility costs doubled in the last year and are n=
ow=20
the same as his rent. A friend who owns a bakery says his suppliers have=20
added a 20% surcharge. This all gets passed on to us, and it's just money=
=20
sunk down a hole--it's not spending that advances our well-being in any way=
."
?????California business owners say they have little choice but to tack on=
=20
costs to help with their own ballooning bills. And they say that along with=
=20
the rising natural gas and electricity bills, they have been hit with a jum=
p=20
in the minimum wage--by 50 cents in January--and high gasoline prices.=20
Workers' compensation rates are up as well.
?????Hotels, which spend about 3.6% of their revenue on energy costs, led t=
he=20
charge in passing on the extra expense. In January, most began adding fees=
=20
ranging from $1 to $4. Stay at the venerable Westin St. Francis on San=20
Francisco's Union Square and you're looking at $2.85 extra per night, per=
=20
room. At the Quality Inn in Mammoth Lakes, it's $2.50.
?????In San Diego, the zoo added the energy charge Thursday. Though many=20
visitors might not think of the zoo as a big energy gobbler, public relatio=
ns=20
director Ted Molter said many exhibits consume lots of kilowatts.
?????Reptiles, for example, require warm temperatures and lighting, while=
=20
pumps and filtration systems run constantly to keep water clear in the=20
underwater viewing portion of the hippo enclosure.
?????Molter said the zoo, a nonprofit organization, experienced a 290%=20
increase in the amount it pays per kilowatt hour during the last year. "We=
=20
don't take this fee lightly and look forward to the day when we can roll it=
=20
back," he said.
?????At the Calistoga Village Inn & Spa near Napa, Manager Gisela Schaefer=
=20
said the natural gas bill has risen 500%--to $7,000 in March--making a pric=
e=20
increase at the 41-room compound inevitable. The spa includes numerous=20
energy-guzzling Jacuzzis, pools and saunas, and its natural hot springs=20

?????But Californians need not travel to the wine country to experience=20
energy surcharges. At Foasberg Cleaners in Long Beach, owners in February=
=20
posted signs announcing a fee--about 3% per item--to account for spiking=20
utility costs.
?????Vice President James Foasberg said the cleaners' natural gas bill has=

tripled in the last year, and he expects his June bill from Southern=20
California Edison to show a 40% increase in his electricity rate.
?????"We hate to do this, but we have no choice," said Foasberg, who has al=

Question Remains Who'll Take Brunt of the Rate Hikes=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--When the California Public Utilities Commission approve=

how the pain of almost $5 billion in increased power charges will be shared=
.
?????Everyone from the governor and the PUC president to consumer groups an=
d=20
industry associations has weighed in, with about 20 plans.
?????They all say their formulas translate into equitable charges that will=

encourage serious energy belt-tightening.
?????The PUC, as the state's chief regulator, must decide how to divvy the=

?????Beginning today in Santa Monica, the commission will hold a series of=

?????PUC officials say rates will increase by an average of almost 30%. The=

question is: Who gets hit the hardest?

utilities and customers alike.
?????The PUC not only must assess a welter of competing proposals that=20
sometimes clash head-on. It also must design the rate structure without=20
knowing with certainty how much money the state will need to buy power in t=
he=20
future.
?????Roughly half of residential users--including low-income customers--wou=
ld=20
see no rate increases, and that number could grow, experts say, if customer=
s=20
conserve significantly. Under proposals from Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and=
=20
Southern California Edison, rates for heavy users would increase by 50% or=
=20
more.
?????One battle shaping up is over whether residential customers alone shou=
ld=20
pay for the increased cost of delivering power to those conserving enough t=
o=20
be exempted from the rate hikes. Or should it be shared with businesses and=
=20
other nonresidential customers?
?????The answers are politically and economically tricky because someone is=
=20
going to feel the pinch.
?????"It is enough money to cause a noticeable increase for customers to wh=
om=20

?????PUC President Loretta Lynch, Gov. Gray Davis and others say rates shou=

?????Some proposals call for four tiers of residential users; others for fi=

?????Under Southern California Edison's proposal, residential customers wou=

baseline less than six months a year would see a 45% increase. Above that,=

industrial customers.
?????The California Large Energy Consumers Assn., representing big steel an=
d=20

Riordan and Freeman's Feud Erupts in Public=20
Power: Each questions the other's role in keeping the city free of=20
California's energy crisis.
By MICHAEL FINNEGAN and TERENCE MONMANEY, Times Staff Writers

?????With California mired in energy troubles, Mayor Richard Riordan and hi=
s=20
former power chief S. David Freeman trumpet the extraordinary fortune of Lo=
s=20
Angeles: no rate hikes and no blackouts.
?????Yet Riordan and Freeman have sullied their mutual success story by=20
waging bitter campaigns to discredit one another--at first behind the scene=
s=20
but now in public.
?????Pettiness, ingratitude, conflicts of interest, overblown claims of=20
achievement: Such is the back and forth between two leaders who would seem =
to=20
have good reason to pat one another on the back.
?????To Freeman, who has resigned as general manager of the L.A. Department=
=20
of Water and Power to become chief energy advisor to Gov. Gray Davis, it=20
seems Riordan resents his high-profile role in trying to steer California o=
ut=20
of the energy crisis.
?????So the mayor, Freeman charged, has elbowed his way into energy issues=
=20
that he is ill-equipped to handle and taken steps along the way that could=
=20
harm the environment.
?????"With all due respect, I have 25 years of experience and knowledge--an=
d=20
he has 25 days," Freeman said. "But he's the mayor, and he didn't like it=
=20
that I didn't just say yes to everything he came up with."
?????To Riordan, Freeman's efforts to fight air pollution have given short=
=20
shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in Los Angeles. The mayor=
=20
said Freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest betwe=
en=20
his city and state roles in the power crisis. And he scoffed at Freeman for=
=20
saying he had lifted morale at DWP.
?????"Morale was terrible under him," Riordan said. "I mean, they are so=20
relieved right now."
?????The backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really abou=
t=20
egos. City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter sees Riordan and Freeman as proud,=20
successful men unable to say, "I couldn't have done it without X, Y and Z."
?????"Each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being=
=20
recognized as the boss," she said.=20
?????Much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings. And the mayo=
r,=20
a Republican multimillionaire, has taken pains to play down his dispute wit=
h=20
Freeman, a liberal Democrat from Tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speak=
s=20
with a Southern drawl.
?????In an interview after his resignation, Freeman laid out the conflict=
=20
point by point, often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor. One of his=20
concerns, Freeman said, was that Riordan in his final two months as mayor=
=20
could reverse the agency's progress in protecting the environment.
?????Freeman cited Riordan's plans concerning coal-fired power plants in=20
Nevada and Utah that are partly controlled by the DWP, the nation's largest=
=20
municipal utility. The first is the Mohave Generating Station in Laughlin,=
=20
Nev., a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that=20
shrouds the Grand Canyon. The DWP had planned to sell its stake in the plan=
t,=20
but Freeman said Riordan ordered him to back out of the sale.
?????He described the mayor's move as a sign that Riordan and his appointee=
s=20
on the board that oversees DWP were "completely insensitive to the fact tha=
t=20
that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the=
=20
West."
?????"I've worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity=
=20
into the DWP policy," Freeman said. "And I am concerned as to whether the=
=20
current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity, and what they=20
might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we've made."
?????The other plant is part of the Intermountain Power Project in central=
=20
Utah. Riordan has proposed building a new coal-fired generating unit there,=
=20
but Freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause.
?????In both cases, Riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance=20
between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of Los=20
Angeles at an affordable cost. By keeping its share of the Mohave plant and=
=20
expanding the Utah plant, Los Angeles can avert the astronomical price hike=
s=20
of natural gas--and the sharp rise in ratepayers' bills that would follow,=
=20
Riordan said.=20
?????Natural gas, which provides 26% of the fuel for DWP plants, causes les=
s=20
air pollution than coal, which provides 51%. The rest is mainly nuclear and=
=20
hydroelectric. Los Angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part=20
because the DWP relies less on natural gas than most other California power=
=20
providers.
?????"I favor clean air and more natural gas, but not to the point where=20
we're going to destroy the economy of Los Angeles," Riordan said.
?????On the Mohave plant, Riordan questioned the benefit of selling the=20
city's share to a buyer that would simply continue running it.
?????"It's still going to be coal-driven," he said. "How does selling it he=
lp=20
the environment?"
?????The tension between the two has built steadily as the state power cris=
is=20
has worsened. With the charismatic DWP chief drawing favorable news coverag=
e=20
in stories on how L.A. has dodged the crisis, Riordan and the DWP=20
commissioners began to view him as "too big for my britches," Freeman said.
?????The conflict reached its peak on April 17, the day Freeman resigned to=
=20
become the governor's advisor. The DWP board president, Kenneth T. Lombard,=
=20
said the mayor told commissioners that day that "it made the most sense to=
=20
release him immediately."
?????"All we were doing, frankly, was release him from his responsibilities=
,=20
and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us,"=
=20
Lombard said.
?????From Riordan's standpoint, Freeman needed to be stripped of his=20
authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest: The city=
=20
utility sells surplus power to the state, so Freeman would be on both sides=
=20
of the sales.
?????Freeman, who had voluntarily bowed out of a DWP meeting on the state=
=20
power crisis earlier that day, was outraged at his sudden release, in part=
=20
because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees. In an=
=20
interview, he called the conflict of interest assertion "complete malarkey.=
"
?????"The insinuation that I have done anything less than protect the=20
interests of the city of Los Angeles is bordering on slanderous, considerin=
g=20
what I've accomplished here," he said.
?????Brian D'Arcy, who heads the union local that represents 6,000 DWP=20
employees, agreed that Riordan and his commissioners "kind of ran him out o=
f=20
here. For David to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a=20
howdy-do is absolutely tacky," D'Arcy said.=20
?????Riordan said Freeman deserves "an A-plus" for his work at DWP. The may=
or=20
conceded that he knew of nothing that Freeman had done "to hurt Los Angeles=
."=20
But, he added, "when you have a conflict of interest, you have to act befor=
e=20
anything happens."
?????Freeman has long bridled at the oversight of DWP, not just by the mayo=
r,=20
but by the agency's board and the City Council. In 1998, he called for City=
=20
Charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of=
=20
directors. The proposal went nowhere.
?????Freeman's concerns were echoed in a report to be released Monday. The=
=20
Rand Enterprise Analysis report was commissioned by the DWP. It calls for=
=20
restructuring DWP management much the way Freeman proposed. But Riordan and=
=20
Galanter, who chairs the Council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources=

Committee, rejected the concept.

Cheney Rejects Price Caps, Aid for Calif. Power Crisis
By DOYLE McMANUS and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers


?????WASHINGTON--Vice President Dick Cheney said Friday that there is littl=
e=20
more the Bush administration can do to alleviate California's energy crisis=
=20
this year and declared his opposition to further federal intervention in th=
e=20
energy market even if the problem threatens the nation's economy.
?????"It's all you can do in the short term," Cheney said of the modest=20
energy conservation measures President Bush announced earlier this week, su=
ch=20
as turning down air conditioners in federal buildings.
?????In an interview with The Times, Cheney, whom Bush has put in charge of=
=20
designing a new national energy policy, said he strongly believes that ener=
gy=20
prices should not be capped or regulated under any circumstances.
?????He said he disagreed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's=
=20
decision last month to place limits on wholesale electricity prices during=
=20
emergency shortages.
?????"I'm a skeptic. I've never seen price regulations that I've felt very=
=20
good about," Cheney said.
?????"If I had been at FERC, I would never had voted for short-term price=
=20
caps. But that's their decision. . . . I hope for their sake, and=20
California's, it works."
?????FERC, an independent regulatory commission, decided April 25 to cap=20
wholesale prices when statewide electricity reserves fall below 7%, using a=
=20
formula pegged to the cost of production for the least efficient generating=
=20
plant.
?????Consumer groups and Democratic members of Congress have criticized the=
=20
decision as too soft, but Cheney--like other advocates of=20
deregulation--condemned it as a step too far.
?????"Price caps are not a help. They take us in exactly the wrong=20
direction," the vice president said. "The way you address these issues is y=
ou=20
either have to reduce demand or increase supply. And anything that doesn't =
do=20
that is counterproductive, especially if it takes us in the opposite=20
direction, which to some extent price caps may because they discourage=20
investment."
?????"Ultimately, I think we're going to be better off if we have a=20
deregulated energy market in this country," he added.
?????Asked whether he might soften his opposition to price controls if the=
=20
energy crisis began to produce significant damage to the national economy,=
=20
Cheney shook his head ruefully.
?????"I start with a strong view, based on prior experience, that governmen=
t=20
should intervene in the marketplace with great reluctance.
?????"I admit that I was traumatized in my youth by being part of the Nixon=
=20
wage and price controls," he said with a wry smile. In 1971, when President=
=20
Nixon sought to tame inflation with federal controls, Cheney was an obscure=
=20
White House official.
?????"I remember how we started out with 14 pages of regulations . . . whic=
h=20
I typed up myself." A few years later, "we had a roomful."
?????More important, Cheney recalled, the Nixon price controls led to a=20
series of "unintended consequences," including a decline in domestic=20
production of oil, increased reliance on foreign energy sources and the=20
failure of the U.S. automobile industry to build fuel-efficient cars.
?????Cheney, speaking in his West Wing office, acknowledged that the=20
administration's tough position against price caps could offend many=20
California voters in the short run, but he said he was confident that=20
Californians would come to accept his position in the long run.
?????"There is a much greater willingness today . . . to have this debate,"=
=20
he said.
?????Cheney said the administration has done "virtually everything" that Go=
v.=20
Gray Davis has asked, except to impose price controls.
?????"We're doing everything we can. Remember, we've been here 100 days. Ou=
r=20
predecessor left this area virtually untouched, I think primarily because i=
t=20
involves very tough issues. It means you've got to go out and address some =
of=20
the most sensitive political issues . . . and we're doing that. That should=
=20
have been done years ago. If it had been done years ago, California wouldn'=
t=20
have trouble today."
?????Cheney said the national energy policy manifesto he plans to issue lat=
er=20
this month will touch on California--but largely as an example for the rest=
=20
of the nation to shun, not as a focus for federal action.
?????"We talk about California; there are a lot of examples there in terms =
of=20
what needs to be done and, to some extent, what to avoid. . . . [But] the=
=20
things we focus on with respect to policy are long-term in nature and aren'=
t=20
going to provide any relief this summer."
?????Cheney offered a glimpse of his strategy for building political suppor=
t=20
for a national energy policy that is expected to promote domestic productio=
n=20
of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power.
?????Contending that technological advancements have reduced the=20
environmental risks of oil and gas exploration on public lands, he said, "W=
e=20
can, in fact, have both: a clean environment and adequate supplies of energ=
y."
?????While Cheney has been criticized for emphasizing the supply side over=
=20
energy conservation, he said, "Conservation has a role to play, but it's no=
t=20
sufficient. You cannot build an energy policy just on the notion of=20
conservation. . . . People have used the conservation arguments in order to=
=20
avoid some of the tough issues associated with increasing supply."
?????Acknowledging that increased reliance on nuclear power--an issue he ha=
s=20
embraced--has been a tough sell, Cheney said public attitudes appear to be=
=20
changing. He said he recently asked a group of moderate lawmakers whether=
=20
they would be open to construction of new nuclear power plants. "Nearly eve=
ry=20
hand went up," he said, touting the "environmental values" of nuclear power=
.
?????Cheney also said that, although he believes that unilateral economic=
=20
sanctions "rarely work," he understands there are "special problems" in=20
removing sanctions against oil exporters such as Libya and Iran. Bush has=
=20
said he has no intention at the moment of removing sanctions on Libya and=
=20
Iran; Cheney said he favors a review of sanctions.
?????The task force report will deal with another controversial proposal:=
=20
industry efforts to allow federal authorities to exercise the power of=20
eminent domain to obtain rights-of-way for new electrical transmission line=
s,=20
as they already do for gas pipelines.
?????Cheney would not say whether the task force would recommend that=20
authority. But such a proposal is likely to face opposition from state and=
=20
local officials.

Rolling Health Hazards=20
Summer Blackouts May Pose Public Health Risks=20

On May 1, just prior to putting the finishing touches on this column from m=
y=20
El Cerrito home, I heard the low, mournful howl of a disaster siren in the=
=20
neighboring city of Richmond. A car had slammed into a utility pole, knocki=
ng=20
out electrical power to the General Chemical Corp. plant.=20
The company's backup generators had failed to kick in and the ensuing power=
=20
outage tripped a safety valve which shut down the compressor. After power w=
as=20
restored, the safety valve would not reopen, causing a leakage of sulfuric=
=20
gas into the air. By the time workers plugged the leak, approximately 100=
=20
people, all in Richmond, had arrived at area hospitals with minor ailments.=
=20
Although not caused by the state's energy crisis, this electrical outage=20
highlights how the prospect of chronic blackouts could pose some very real=
=20
and unexpected threats to public health. So far we have been lucky, with=20
planned rolling blackouts lasting no longer than about 90 minutes.=20
But if sudden, unexpected shortfalls in electrical supply cause outages=20
lasting longer than a few hours, Californians may face such health hazards =
as=20
unclean drinking water, food spoilage, vaccine shortages, heat stroke and=
=20
disabled and elderly residents living without electricity.=20
For instance, widespread outages could affect the availability and safety o=
f=20
water supplies. Local water districts are concerned that the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission has not exempted their facilities, such as pumping=20
stations that transport water uphill and treatment plants that purify water=
,=20
from rolling blackouts.=20
"In addition to our own facilities, outages could affect the State Water=20
Project and the Central Valley Project's ability to get water to us," said=
=20
Marty Grimes, public information representative for the Santa Clara Valley=
=20
Water District, which provides wholesale water supplies to Santa Clara=20
County. On the retail level, some of the smaller suppliers lack large stora=
ge=20
tanks and would themselves run out of water quickly.=20
If treatment plants go off-line, water quality might also decline in some=
=20
areas, in which case consumers would have to boil their tap water for at=20
least 20 minutes before drinking it. "We are doing all we can to minimize=
=20
this possibility and see it as unlikely," says Grimes. "If that were to=20
happen, we'd be ready to inform everyone in the affected area immediately."=
=20
To help keep the water flowing during outages, the district has installed=
=20
backup generators in treatment facilities and key pumping stations, and is=
=20
keeping Anderson Reservoir as full as possible. "It is high enough in=20
altitude that electricity is not needed to get the water to our treatment=
=20
plants. Gravity does all the work," says Grimes.=20
The district also recommends that consumers use less water when the weather=
=20
is very hot or outages are likely to occur. "In essence," says Grimes,=20
"saving water can save energy."=20
Since refrigerators and freezers run on electricity, when the power goes ou=
t,=20
so does your ability to keep perishables fresh. One health risk occurs when=
=20
somebody carelessly reheats and eats yesterday's frozen casserole long afte=
r=20
a blackout has already thawed it back to life.=20
"It goes way beyond spoilage," says Susan Conley, director of food safety=
=20
education for the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the U.S. Department=
=20
of Agriculture. "If, because of the blackouts, the temperature in the=20
refrigerator or the freezer goes above dangerous levels, then you could hav=
e=20
a problem with bacterial contamination," such as botulism.=20
Contrary to popular opinion, simply sniffing around is not a good way to te=
ll=20
whether food is safe to eat, since not all bacteria produce noticeable odor=
s.=20
A better course is to learn how to keep your food cold for as long as=20
possible and which foods last for how long at what temperatures.=20
For instance, a blackout lasting under four hours will not spoil the food i=
n=20
your refrigerator. A freezer will keep frozen food safe for at least a day.=
=20
To keep the cold air inside, keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed=20
unless you absolutely need to retrieve food.=20
Some foods, muffins for instance, will last longer than others, such as egg=
s.=20
For an easy-to-read spoilage chart that recommends when to use, refreeze or=
=20
discard various foods, go to the USDA's Keeping Food Safe During A Power=20
Outage page. It also has a collection of practical tips, such as safe=20
temperature levels, using thermometers, and handling dry ice.=20
As for food spoilage at grocery stores, I asked a butcher at Armond's Quali=
ty=20
Meats in El Cerrito how well the meats in the store's refrigerated glass=20
display counter would hold up during an extended outage. He said they would=
=20
keep the counter closed; since the case is kept at just above freezing, the=
=20
meat would remain safe until the next day.=20
Medical facilities also rely upon refrigerators to keep perishables cold an=
d=20
safe. Unfortunately, like water facilities, smaller clinics and hospitals i=
n=20
California are not exempt from planned blackouts, although major hospitals=
=20
are.=20
According to Dr. Barbara Ramsey, medical director the Native American Healt=
h=20
Center's community health clinic in Oakland, if power goes down for more th=
an=20
two hours, their biggest problem will be vaccine spoilage. In addition,=20
replacing them may also prove difficult if power outages to other clinics=
=20
across the state or nation result in widespread shortages.=20
"We have episodic vaccine shortages without blackouts," she says, largely=
=20
because drug manufacturers allegedly limit the supply of medicines to impro=
ve=20
profit margins. "We just had one with tetanus. For those vaccines that aren=
't=20
profitable, I would see a particular risk."=20
Ramsey recommends that parents of children between 15 months and 30 months=
=20
and 4 to 6 years get them vaccinated as soon as possible, especially if the=
y=20
expect to enroll them in a school or day care center that requires=20
inoculations prior to admission. Often, says Ramsey, "the parents go, 'Oh,=
=20
the kid turned 4 but I've two years to do these vaccines.' Then suddenly th=
e=20
parent wants boosters given today because preschool starts tomorrow. But if=
 I=20
don't have the vaccine, tough luck."=20
Otherwise, having experienced a rolling blackout a few weeks ago, she gives=
=20
mixed reviews about the clinic's ability to operate without power. Since th=
e=20
clinic is "a fairly low-tech operation," Ramsey says she is confident that =
it=20
can continue to provide basic services, with the exception of the EKG machi=
ne=20
and dental equipment. "Just to shine that light in your mouth requires=20
electricity," she says.=20
Other medical issues must be dealt with in the home, especially for elderly=
=20
and disabled residents. Medicines kept in the refrigerator can spoil,=20
life-support equipment can shut down, and heat stroke can result in serious=
=20
illness or death. Some Bay Area communities plan to open summer "cooling=20
shelters" for seniors during hot days.=20
Keeping tabs on San Francisco's homebound elderly and disabled residents=20
during a disaster is largely the responsibility of a volunteer disaster=20
preparedness program called NERT, for Neighborhood Emergency Response Team.=
=20
In other cities it might go by another acronym, such as NEAT (Neighborhood=
=20
Emergency Assistance Team) or CERT (Community Emergency Response Team).=20
While distributing informational flyers, Susan Yip, NERT coordinator for Sa=
n=20
Francisco's Balboa Terrace neighborhood, noticed some notes pasted to a fro=
nt=20
door indicating that a disabled person lived inside. So she left a note of=
=20
her own asking if the occupant would like to contact her in order to be=20
placed on a list of local residents who may have special needs during a=20
neighborhood-wide emergency.=20
"His son phoned me and told me about his father, who lived alone in the=20
house," was in his late 90s, mostly bedridden, and on an oxygen machine, sa=
ys=20
Yip. "He explained to me which window to climb in and that he has a chair=
=20
right there to jump down on, that kind of thing."=20
Not long after, a rolling blackout hit the neighborhood. She quickly paged=
=20
the son, they met at the father's house, and went inside together.=20
Fortunately, the oxygen machine did not depend upon AC power and was=20
operating normally. "Because the rolling blackout happened during the dayti=
me=20
and it just lasted an hour and a half, it was just a good drill for us," sh=
e=20
says.=20
Yip is more concerned about the consequences of nighttime outages. "If it=
=20
were dark and he went to turn on his light and that didn't go on, there mig=
ht=20
just be that fear of what's going on." So an important part of a NERT=20
volunteer's job is providing neighbors with information, reassurance and a=
=20
sense of hope.=20
Even in a power outage, the greatest impediments to good health are apathy=
=20
and ignorance. So if we take steps to protect health and safety during the=
=20
energy crisis, then the next string of blackouts may end not with a trip to=
=20
the hospital and a lot of embarrassing questions, but with an excuse to sit=
=20
on the front porch and enjoy the balmy evenings of summer.=20
If you would like a NERT volunteer to visit an elderly or disabled San=20
Francisco resident during a community-wide emergency, call (415) 554-9960. =
If=20
you live in another community, contact your local fire department for=20

U.S. considers withdrawing lawsuits against coal industry=20
Pollution controls affect power plants=20

Washington -- The Bush administration is considering pleas from coal and=20
electric companies to drop a series of government lawsuits initiated by the=
=20
Clinton administration to require the utilities to install modern pollution=
=20
controls on old, coal-fired power plants.=20
The request, which the coal industry says would let it quickly increase its=
=20
output of power, has touched off a debate within the administration. Christ=
ie=20
Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which=20
initiated the litigation, is resisting the industry's suggestion, while Vic=
e=20
President Dick Cheney and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham are sympathetic.=
=20
The Bush administration is determined to increase the nation's use of fossi=
l=20
fuels to produce power in response to what it deems an energy crisis.=20
The coal industry says the EPA's enforcement of the Clean Air Act is=20
preventing investments that would generate tens of thousands of megawatts o=
f=20
electricity from existing coal-fired plants and that the cost of new=20
pollution controls would have to be paid by consumers.=20
"There is a recognition that plants aren't modernizing because the burden i=
s=20
too onerous," a White House official said yesterday.=20
Discussions within the administration about the lawsuits have intensified i=
n=20
recent days, as the White House completes a report by a energy task force=
=20
headed by Cheney. The report is to be printed this evening.=20
"The coal industry is pushing very hard to lock this in and make it part of=
=20
the report," said an environmentalist who has been following the case=20
closely.=20
At stake are emissions that would cost millions of dollars to control and=
=20
that account for a significant share of the nation's air pollution.=20
The Clean Air Act exempted many older plants from strict emissions controls=
,=20
but required modern controls when owners modified plants in ways that=20
increased emissions.=20
For years, the agency says, plants evaded the requirements by insisting tha=
t=20
certain modifications were merely "routine maintenance." But the agency fou=
nd=20
that a number of major electric utilities had been modernizing their plants=

with projects that increased emissions.=20
Since 1988, the EPA has sued 11 companies over controls at 49 power plants.=

If the administration dropped these lawsuits and otherwise softened=20
regulations, the council argues, coal-fired plants could provide an increas=

A penny here, a penny there, a megawatt here and a megawatt there, for=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co it all adds up -- maybe.=20
In the fervent hope and fear that each tiny zap of electricity is going to=
=20
count this summer, PG&E is offering owners of private swimming pools $20 if=
=20
they set their pool timers to operate the pumps during off-peak hours.=20
Shifting 15 megawatts off peak demand, the daylight time of day when power=
=20
shortages are most likely to occur, may sound like a drop in the bucket. Bu=
t=20
PG&E says 134,000 private pools exist in Northern and Central California, a=
nd=20
that's enough to save 15 megawatts, or enough to power 15,000 homes at any=
=20
one moment.=20
And that could add up to a sizable savings in light of the grim predictions=
=20
for this summer.=20
The Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power market,=
=20
estimates that on any given day in June, the state will fall 6,815 megawatt=
s=20
short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dark.=20
So PG&E figures every bit of conservation helps, even pumping dirt and debr=
is=20
and other foreign matter out of swimming pools at night or in the early=20
morning.=20
To qualify for the $20 check -- a one-time rebate, owners of in-ground=20
swimming pools must agree to set their timers to operate the pumps between =
8=20
p. m. and 10 a.m.=20
The offer does not extend to public pools for public health reasons or to=
=20
solar-heated pools, which do not use power from the grid.=20
"Obviously, this is not a silver bullet to solving the energy crisis, but i=
t=20
is one BB among many," said Staci Homrig, a PG&E spokeswoman. "Every little=
=20
bit helps, and this is just our latest among many programs offering=20
incentives to customers who are more energy efficient at home." Other PG&E=
=20
programs include offering $3 off energy star-labeled compact fluorescent=20
lamps, which use 75 percent less energy than standard incandescent bulbs; $=
75=20
rebates for Energy Star-labeled clothes washers and $50 for dishwashers. PG=
&E=20
also offers $75 rebates for refrigerators that meet the 2001 Department of=
=20
Energy efficiency standard.=20
Some pool installation companies say the $20 offer sounds like a good idea,=
=20
generally. But they caution that pool owners who operate their sometimes=20
noisy pumps only at night may run into problems with local noise-abatement=
=20
ordinances.=20
"If you run your pumps at night, then you are going to hear it running," sa=
id=20
John Maguire, owner of the Pool Man, which serves Sonoma County. "But I'm=
=20
sure PG&E will get a good response -- a lot of people will be happy to take=
=20
$20."=20
Other pool experts said, however, that the most modern pool equipment is ve=
ry=20
quiet and pumps manufactured in recent years should not cause a noise=20
problem.=20
Generally, though, the reaction was that PG&E probably could spend whatever=
=20
money it has left more wisely.=20
"The trouble is that $20 is not a whole lot of money," said Rick Wolpin,=20
director of Sales and Marketing for Lifetime Pools in Palo Alto. "If it was=
=20
$20 a month off their bill, I could see people jumping at it."=20
At least one pool owner agrees.=20
"I don't think 20 bucks is much of an incentive, but I probably would have=
=20
done it anyway -- and also take the $20," said Deborah Clark, who has a lap=
=20
pool in her San Jose backyard.=20
Indeed, most pool owners already shut their pumps down during the day, said=
=20
Randy Saunders, division manager for Adams Pool Solutions based in=20
Pleasanton. "I would bet 90 percent of the pool owners would be happy to do=
=20
that because the backyard pool doesn't care what time of day it is as long =
as=20
it gets four to eight hours of circulation," Saunders said. "I think it's a=
=20
terrific idea, assuming PG&E can afford it."=20
PG&E officials say they will have little problem coming up with the $2=20
million or so the program may cost if 80 percent of its pool-owning custome=
rs=20
enroll in the program.=20
PG&E's Homrig said all the rebates will come after the bankruptcy filing, a=
nd=20
so will not be affected by its filing for Chapter 11 on April 6. She said t=
he=20
money for the rebates will come from the utility's customers, who pay a sma=
ll=20
portion of each month's bill for energy efficient programs.=20
To make sure that those who sign up for the $20 are actually turning off=20
their pumps during the day, PG&E plans random inspections, Homrig said. The=

Gov. Gray Davis is not a party to the suit, but "is supportive of any effor=

to make sure FERC does its job," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.=20
No one answered the phones at the federal commission's media office=20
yesterday, and commission officials could not be reached for comment.=20
Late last month, the commission ordered a one-year cap on electricity sold=

But the Democratic governor and state power regulators dismissed the cap as=

Reno -- California's energy crisis is possibly the best thing to happen to=
=20
Nevada since gangster Bugsy Siegel chanced upon a backwater town called Las=
=20
Vegas in the 1940s.=20
Construction workers are scrambling not to erect new casinos but nearly a=
=20
dozen new power plants -- an ambitious scheme hatched by state leaders and=
=20
power companies to profit from California's chronic shortages.=20
While California may get fresh power supplies, Nevada, by hosting the plant=
s,=20
will benefit from additional tax revenues and jobs, a more stable electrici=
ty=20
network and a level of energy self-sufficiency the Golden State can only=20
dream of achieving.=20
And, to a great extent, Nevada's gains will be financed by California=20
ratepayers.=20
"While you guys in California have been putzing around politically, we got=
=20
together and figured out what to do," said Nevada state Sen. Randolph=20
Townsend,=20
chairman of the Committee on Commerce and Labor that oversees energy matter=
s.=20
"We're bringing the same mentality to power plants that we brought to=20
casinos," he said. "You build, and then you build some more."=20
In embarking on an unprecedented energy building boom, Nevada's first=20
priority is to secure enough electricity to meet all its needs for years to=
=20
come.=20
No less importantly, though, the state is looking to position itself as the=
=20
battery pack of the West -- a regional energy hub that will be to electrici=
ty=20
what Texas is to oil.=20
California's acute need for juice, at virtually any price, is what will mak=
e=20
this otherwise fanciful goal a reality.=20
"Our strategy is to overbuild," Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn said during an=20
interview in his Carson City office. "We have short-term plans and long-ter=
m=20
plans, and those plans affect California tremendously."=20
Those plans also include trade-offs that some environmentalists fear place=
=20
business interests ahead of natural resources, as well as hardball tactics=
=20
intended to force generators to provide at least a portion of their output =
to=20
Nevada, rather than sell it all across the border.=20
"Energy developers are looking at us with big grins and drooling chops," sa=
id=20
Jane Feldman, a spokeswoman for the southern Nevada branch of the Sierra=20
Club. "This really makes us nervous."=20
While California Gov. Gray Davis has been forced to take a crash course in=
=20
energy issues, Nevada's Guinn boasts 20 years of experience in the utility=
=20
business, including a stint as head of Southwest Gas Corp., a leading natur=
al=20
gas supplier.=20
He said he has discussed California's energy troubles with Davis several=20
times, and each time urged Davis to be more aggressive in building new powe=
r=20
plants.=20
"I think he's frustrated that he can't move as fast as we can," Guinn said,=
=20
with a satisfied smile. The Nevada governor is a Republican. His California=
=20
counterpart is a Democrat.=20
Of course, Nevada's commitment to energy independence is not solely the=20
result of political will. It also is what the gaming industry wants, and=20
Nevada lawmakers take notice when the casinos flex their considerable muscl=
e.=20
Today, Las Vegas is the fastest-growing city in America, and the glitzy=20
gaming palaces that are its lifeblood soak up about 10 percent of all=20
available power.=20
Casinos and related sales and services account for no less than 60 percent =
of=20
Nevada's economy, according to the state Commission on Economic Development=
.=20
Six of every 10 Nevadans work for a casino or a casino-related company.=20
"The casino industry cannot tolerate blackouts like you've had in=20
California," said Harvey Whittemore, legislative counsel for the Nevada=20
Resort Association in Las Vegas. "We need predictable and reliable energy=
=20
resources."=20
Not surprisingly, Nevada legislators voted last month to halt deregulation =
of=20
the state's electricity market in its tracks and to shield local utilities=
=20
from the sort of financial ruin that led Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to fi=
le=20
for bankruptcy protection.=20
They also wasted no time in rolling out the red carpet for power companies=
=20
eager to build new plants while California electricity prices remain at sky=
-=20
high levels.=20
The governor stood alongside executives from four leading power companies t=
o=20
announce that his state will fast-track approval of new plants so it can=20
double Nevada's electricity output within just two years.=20
A licensing process that might take as long as four years in California has=
=20
been reduced to months in Nevada.=20
"We don't want to be like other states, like California, who can't control=
=20
their own destiny," Guinn said.=20
This is music to the ears of power companies, which see Nevada as an=20
affordable and hospitable base from which to pump electricity into the=20
captive California market.=20
"If you could, you would build all your California plants in Nevada," said=
=20
Jack Farley, president of western operations for Houston's Reliant Energy.=
=20
"The political climate is more stable, there's no state income tax and the=
=20
labor is cheaper."=20
Reliant will spend about $1 billion on three new plants outside Las Vegas,=
=20
which together will generate enough power to light about 1.4 million homes.=
=20
North Carolina's Duke Energy Corp., meanwhile, is looking to build a=20
sprawling facility near Las Vegas capable of lighting more than 1 million=
=20
homes and a second plant about half that size near Reno.=20
Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman, said one reason power companies are heading=
=20
into Nevada is because they hope to rapidly recover their construction cost=
s=20
from California consumers.=20
"Clearly, building a plant rapidly in a market that has a shortfall is an=
=20
objective," he said. "The sooner you get to a market that has a desperate=
=20
need for power, the better off you will be."=20
In a desert canyon outside Reno, along the same path once followed by the=
=20
ill-fated Donner Party, the West's newest power plant is due to begin=20
operating by the end of the month.=20
The $130 million facility, bankrolled by brokerage Morgan Stanley, will not=
=20
only fuel Reno's lavish resorts but also pump electricity over the mountain=
s=20
and into neighboring California.=20
Huge gray transformers and turbines dominate the construction site as worke=
rs=20
battle dust storms and the harsh sun to meet their deadline.=20
"If we could have a year to do this, it would be simple," said Ray Kaufman,=
 a=20
technical consultant with Energy Services, the engineering firm hired by=20
Morgan Stanley to build the plant. "Doing it in four months is very=20
difficult."=20
State officials insist that no environmental regulations were waived to get=
=20
Nevada's new power plants off the drawing board in record time. They say th=
e=20
normally slow bureaucratic process was simply streamlined.=20
Consumer activists are not so sure.=20
"The state is moving too fast," said Kalynda Tilges, a spokeswoman for Las=
=20
Vegas' grassroots Citizen Alert. "There needs to be more discussion."=20
At the same time, she and other activists worry that Nevada will be giving =
up=20
precious natural resources for power plants that will be producing=20
electricity for consumers elsewhere.=20
The new plants require groundwater for cooling -- something Nevada does not=
=20
have in abundance.=20
"I don't think most Nevadans realize what's happening," Tilges said. "They=
=20
have no idea how much groundwater will be used, and how much of the power=
=20
will be going to California."=20
To ensure that at least some of the output stays close to home, Nevada=20
authorities have driven a hard bargain with power companies. Access to=20

Florida shrugs off Calif.-blackout scenario=20
Posted at 7:38 a.m. PDT Monday, May 7, 2001=20
BY JOAN GRALLA=20
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Florida is confident it will not face next year the=20
rolling power blackouts that have bedeviled California, but one analyst who=
=20
foresaw trouble for the West Coast says the same problems may lie ahead for=
=20
the Gold Coast.=20
California's self-imposed black eye with deregulation has left a number of=
=20
states, from Wisconsin to Florida, disinclined to go ahead with similar=20
plans. That is especially true in the Southeast, where states have less=20
reason to deregulate because their power costs are fairly low.=20
Florida residents are not expected to experience soaring power prices this=
=20
summer when the thermometer rises since power companies say they have enoug=
h=20
supply to meet customer needs.=20
But whether Floridians run short of power next year might be decided by=20
factors beyond the state's control: how hot the summer is, whether utilitie=
s=20
accurately predict demand growth, and whether they can add new power as fas=
t=20
as they project, analyst Mark Bernstein recently told Reuters.=20
``Two-and-a-half years ago we said California could face a problem. It wasn=
't=20
a prediction, it was one of our scenarios,'' said the policy analyst with t=
he=20
Santa Monica, California-based think tank RAND.=20
But California ran into some tough luck, including a drought that dried up=
=20
hydropower. ``For California to have the problem it had, everything had to =
go=20
wrong,'' Bernstein said.=20
California's crisis stems from a flawed 1996 deregulation plan that allowed=
=20
wholesale energy prices to soar but capped retail rates. The result has bee=
n=20
rolling blackouts, soaring prices and the bankruptcy of the state's biggest=
=20
utility.=20
Bernstein sees an eerie similarity between what California experts said two=
=20
years ago and what Florida analysts now say. ''What they're saying in Flori=
da=20
is the same thing they said in California a couple of years ago. We're not=
=20
predicting problems in Florida, but if you look at the direction they're=20
going in they could have the same problems as California.''=20
Tom Ballinger, an energy supervisor with the Division of Safety and=20
Electricity Reliability for Florida's Public Service Commission, said he wa=
s=20
confident the state could meet demand.=20
For 2002, for example, the peninsula area, which accounts for some 90 perce=
nt=20
of Florida demand, has a 19 percent reserve margin. That will climb to 26=
=20
percent by 2005 before drifting back down to 23-25 percent in the years=20
ahead.=20
``The peninsula in times past has gotten by with a 15 percent reserve=20
margin,'' Bernstein pointed out.=20
DEREGULATION LOOKS LESS DESIRABLE=20
Back in 1995, Wisconsin was tracking California on the path to electricity=
=20
deregulation, although it planned a slower approach. But the process ground=
=20
to a halt after California's problems singed its reputation, economy and=20
living standards.=20
``When California occurred, it froze everybody,'' said State Rep. Tim Hoven=
,=20
a Republican from Port Washington and chairman of the Wisconsin Legislature=
=20
utilities oversight committee. He said the state now was focusing more on=
=20
reliability, adding, ''We don't want to duplicate what they did in=20
California.''=20
In an interim report, a Florida study group recommended creating a=20
competitive wholesale market.=20
That would not be done by requiring utilities to divest themselves of=20
generators, as New York State has done, for example; Florida utilities woul=
d=20
transfer power sources to an affiliate or third party, said Billy Stiles,=
=20
executive director of the Florida Energy 2020 Study Commission.=20
Once the generators were transferred, the utilities would have long-term=20
contracts with their old units -- unlike California, whose utilities could=
=20
buy only on the spot market. The amount of power Florida utilities contract=
ed=20
for would decline over time, opening the market up to merchant power plants=
,=20
Stiles explained.=20
``Once the transition is over ... they have the ability to buy (power) from=
=20
anybody selling in the market, including their own affiliate or merchant,''=
=20
he said.=20
Florida's deregulation proposal stalled partly because of concerns that=20
consumers might not get repaid for the hugely expensive power generators th=
ey=20
helped pay for in the form of higher electricity rates.=20
The study group proposed transferring power plants at their book value: how=
=20
much the plant is listed at on the utility's balance sheet. But some critic=
s=20
charged the plants were worth more than their book value, and after they we=
re=20
transferred they eventually might be sold to other independent power=20
producers.=20
``There was a belief that the gain on the sale of plants will escape=20
recognition of the regulator ... that the customers will be deprived of tha=
t=20
gain,'' Stiles said.=20
He did not agree that power plants necessarily would fetch more than their=
=20
book values. Still, he added, ``some mechanisms may need to be devised to=
=20
recognize that gain.''=20
FLORIDA SEES POWER SUPPLY AS SATISFACTORY=20
Among the concerns Bernstein raised about Florida's plans were questions=20
about whether its utilities might experience delays in building new power=
=20
sources.=20
``If those plans actually emerge on time, maybe they'll be OK, but years of=
=20
experience on things like this (shows) things get delayed,'' the RAND analy=
st=20
said.=20
Ballinger, the Florida Public Service Commission expert, recognized that as=
 a=20
risk, but only over the longer term. He said he was confident the utilities=
'=20
demand projections, on which the state relies, were solid.=20
``They're looking at it all the time,'' he said, explaining that utilities=
=20
routinely analyzed population growth, customer accounts, the economy and=20
other factors.=20
Bernstein also raised the possibility Florida's weather might turn aberrant=
,=20
with a warmer winter than usual, for example, which could raise demand for=
=20
cooling. Balllinger said the state's assumptions -- compiled from data=20
provided by its utilities -- were based on normal temperatures.=20
Although parts of the Northeast such as New York have gone ahead with at=20
least partial deregulation, they had a fairly strong incentive to do so.=20
New York's retail rates ran around 14.2 cents per kilowatt hour, according =
to=20
the Energy Information Administration. In contrast, Floridians paid only=20
about 8 cents, and such low rates were the norm for most states in the=20
Southeast, giving them less incentive to deregulate.=20
``I don't think you're going to see deregulation in the South anytime soon,=

Unplugged=20
Mankind has lived thousands of years without electricity. The Amish still d=
o.=20
Californians may have to. We called an Ohio hardware store to find out how.=
=20
May 7, 2001=20
By ANDRE MOUCHARD
The Orange County Register
This spring, nearly 16 months after Y2K failed to unplug our=20
electricity-addicted world and just weeks before we figure to get browned o=
ut=20
by our erratic power suppliers, Southern California is turning its eyes to=
=20
the Amish of northern Ohio.=20
The Amish, like us, are busy. They run farms and small manufacturing=20
companies and even dabble in real estate. And while they might shun things=
=20
like SportsCenter and Marilyn Manson, they're not totally without comfort.=
=20
The Amish, like us, like their clothes clean, their food hot and their coff=
ee=20
beans ground to a powder suitable for drip-style brewing.=20
What the Amish don't like is electricity. They live as plug-free as possibl=
e.=20
Here in backward Southern California (where an almost totally non-Amish=20
population sucks down more electricity than anybody in the world) many wond=
er=20
how. Hence our sudden interest in northern Ohio.=20
"Nowadays, we get calls nearly every day from people in Southern California=
,"=20
says Glenda Lehman-Ervin, marketing director of Lehman's Hardware and=20
Appliances Inc., a Kidron, Ohio-based retailer that, since 1955, has=20
specialized in selling non-electric appliances to, among others, the Amish,=
=20
survivalists and Martha Stewart.=20
Lehman's, which is privately held, says only that its non-electric applianc=
e=20
sales to California have "dramatically increased" in the past year,=20
particularly as power outages and rate hikes have become the norm.=20
"Apparently, there is some concern out there about electricity."=20
Apparently.=20
So even with a blackout summer only weeks away, it's not too late to go=20
plugless. The process might not be cheap. It might involve some damp=20
undergarments. And it almost certainly won't include a curling iron or a ha=
ir=20
dryer. But some unplugging - without batteries even - is possible.=20
Here's a breakdown of some non-battery-powered devices that can unplug the=
=20
most electric of all events - the morning ritual:=20
STEP 1: WAKING UP=20
One way to save a lot of electricity would be to sleep in so long that you=
=20
get fired. You could then hang out all day by a pool or the ocean and live=
=20
almost exclusively on solar power.=20
Sigh.=20
Let's assume you're not yet so dedicated to easing our strained power grid.=
=20
Let's assume you've got to wake up. To do that, unplugged, you'll need a=20
mechanical alarm clock.=20
Mechanicals are no oddity. They dominated time keeping from about 1000 AD=
=20
until just after World War II. Most run on power generated by gravity or=20
springs. And when they're attached to bells, they double as extremely loud=
=20
alarm clocks.=20
Some companies still make mechanicals (one way to find them is to look on t=
he=20
Internet under the words "mechanical alarm clocks"). Some say new mechanica=
ls=20
aren't as good as old mechanicals. But one company that made the old=20
mechanicals is still around.=20
A new Westclox mechanical will cost about $20, and a near antique - from th=
e=20
early 1900s - will run around $50, according to Aaron Kaplan, owner of=20
Friendly Clock and Watch Repair in Santa Ana.=20
"They're still pretty functional," Kaplan says. "If you maintain them=20
properly, they'll keep time to within a minute or two."=20
Amishness rating: 100=20
STEP 2: CLEAN DUDS=20
In the larger world of waking up and putting on clothes, one thing is alway=
s=20
true: clean and dry is better than dirty and wet.=20
In Southern California, most clean, dry clothes come out of a washer and=20
dryer, two machines that also are electricity hogs.=20
But it doesn't have to work that way.=20
An Amish family, for example, might get its clean, dry clothes from a=20
washboard (technology circa 500 AD) and a clothesline. That's fine if you'v=
e=20
got about eight hours to get ready for work and you don't mind a T-shirt th=
at=20
crunches.=20
Other unplugged washing options are hand-cranked, mechanical washers follow=
ed=20
up by hand-cranked ringers that make line-drying faster. Lehman's sells a f=
ew=20
of these products. There are also dozens of alternative energy washers and=
=20
dryers on the market. Like clocks, those can be found over the Internet.=20
A San Diego company, Explorer Appliances, even sells an alternative energy=
=20
combo device, a washer/dryer that runs on propane, natural gas or even=20
wind-created power. The machine also drinks less water than conventional=20
washer/dryer combos, according to Explorer VP Paul Real.=20
What it doesn't provide, necessarily, is socks that come out of the dryer=
=20
toasty warm.=20
"Centrifugal force," Real says, describing how the washer-dryer dries. "Tha=
t=20
gets almost all the moisture out."=20
Unplugging other parts of the morning's clothing thing isn't that tricky. Y=
ou=20
can find irons that reuse heat from the stove. Lehman's also sells an iron=
=20
that runs on burning embers. "You need a small shovel or something to get t=
he=20
embers in there. It's kind of fun," spokeswoman Lehman-Ervin says.=20
Amishness rating: 75 (subtract 25 points if your clothes are synthetic or=
=20
brightly colored.)=20
STEP 3: VITTLES=20
Eating plug-free isn't as easy as it looks. You can eat raw stuff, but that=
's=20
probably going to involve a refrigerator and, in most homes, that involves =
a=20
plug. You can decide to cook some stuff, look at your gas-powered range, an=
d=20
think you're OK. But you're not. Check out the oven. Electric. Bummer.=20
Anyway, all of this gets particularly tricky in the morning. Breakfast is a=
=20
huge electricity user. Milk (if it's cold) needs a plug. Toast has its own=
=20
plug-in machine. Same for waffles. And coffee, the absolutely must-have dri=
nk=20
for most morning routines, needs a plug-in machine for brewing and another=
=20
plug-in machine to grind the beans.=20
Or not.=20
See, the good news is there are non-electric versions of virtually every=20
kitchen appliance. The fridge can run on propane or natural gas or wind if=
=20
you're so inclined. (Check the Internet under "alternative energy=20
appliances.") And Lehmans, among others, sells wood stoves, including a mod=
el=20
that has a catalytic converter that'll make your wood-stove electricity fre=
e=20
and a smog-buster at the same time.=20
"Think about your car 30 years ago. You didn't have airbags or seat belts a=
nd=20
things like that. And it didn't get good mileage. Well, wood stoves have=20
gotten a lot better over the years, just like cars," Lehman-Ervin says.=20
Lehman's and others also sell toasters that toast using the heat from the=
=20
stove and a waffle iron that does the same thing. The company (as well as=
=20
some coffee shops) also sells hand-cranked coffee bean grinders, something=
=20
that's quiet and, because it doesn't generate a lot of bean-burning heat,=
=20
better for the coffee. After that, you can use a water-drip device to make=
=20
the coffee without a plug.=20
If you care to go further, you can grind your own grain and churn your own=
=20
butter with non-electric devices.=20
"We even have a hand-crank blender," Lehman-Ervin says.=20
"The Amish like it for milkshakes, but out there, in California, maybe you=
=20
could use it for margaritas."=20
Not before work.=20
Amishness rating: 10=20
STEP 4: BLOW DRYING=20
"Sacrifices must be made."=20
That's not the opening line to your pink slip. It's what Lehman-Ervin and=
=20
others say when asked about how to unplug the morning routine. Essentially,=
=20
there are parts of waking up and getting ready for work that must be change=
d,=20
not unplugged.=20
"There is no non-electric blow dryer, except maybe when you stick your head=
=20
out the window of your car or something," Lehman-Ervin says.=20
Curling irons fall into this category. Electric shavers, too, but they're=
=20
easy to replace with foam and hot water and a razor.=20
Television, CD and DVD players, Nintendo - they all need a plug or a batter=
y=20
which, for our purposes, rule them out. Same for microwaves and trash=20
compactors.=20
Eventually, unplugging - even in the morning - boils down to a question of=
=20
"what you really need vs. what you simply want," Lehman-Ervin says.=20
"The biggest benefit is self-sufficiency. As you're finding out in=20
California, it's not always great to rely on somebody else to maintain your=
=20
lifestyle.=20
"But there are many, many people in this country who don't have electricity=
=20
or who have unreliable electricity, and they manage to wake up and get read=
y=20
for work.=20
"If you absolutely have to have something, there is probably a non-electric=
=20
version of it."=20
So how can you find out more?=20
"Uh, with a computer," Lehaman-Ervin says, laughing.=20
And that, she adds, "needs a plug."=20

Mexico Continues Power Exports To California

state-owned power utility the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) will=20

electricity supply from the northern Mexican state of Baja California would
continue to be exported to the United States, Mexican financial daily El

capacity a priority. Interconnection capacity currently stands at 400=20
megawatts,
he said. New transmission lines, to be completed by 2002, will boost

Texas is an extreme example of the haphazard way electricity grids develope=

in the U.S. Until the 1960s, most power plants were built near the customer=

But the old-line Texas utilities, which have long benefited from the state'=

plentiful supplies of fuels such as natural gas and lignite coal, were=20
reluctant to join in this wave of interconnections. Back then, in the mid- =

surrounding states weren't planning big enough plants to back up the huge n=

=20
petrochemical industry. "There was no big money to be made by shipping powe=
r=20
one way or the other over the lines," says Reliant's Mr. Schaeffer.=20
By confining their grid to Texas, state utilities also avoided oversight by=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Thus, FERC couldn't force Texas t=
o=20
send power out of state in case of an emergency.=20
The state's dominant utilities -- Texas Utilities Inc., the Dallas-based=20
predecessor of what is now TXU Corp., and Houston Lighting -- went to great=
=20
lengths to ensure there were no interstate connections. The switches at a=

hydroelectric plant on the Texas-Oklahoma border were wired to prevent powe=
r=20
from flowing between the states. Elsewhere along the border, a system of=20
relays was installed to prevent unauthorized interstate transmissions.=20
Only one big utility didn't like the setup: Central & South West Corp., a=
=20
Dallas holding company that owned power plants in both Texas and Oklahoma. =
In=20
1976, it faced a crisis. If it couldn't show that its plants in both states=
=20
were interconnected, it ran the risk of being broken up under a federal law=
.=20
The law, which barred holding companies from owning unconnected utilities i=
n=20
separate states, was decades old. But, until then, it hadn't been strictly=
=20
enforced.=20
On May 4, 1976 -- eight days before the Securities and Exchange Commission=
=20
was set to consider the matter -- Central & South West took an extraordinar=
y=20
step. At 5:30 a.m., it sent one of its line crews to secretly rewire a=20
substation in Vernon, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, allowing power to fl=

freely between the two states. For a few hours, the grids were connected by=
 a=20
minuscule thread. Later that morning, officials at Central & South West=20
phoned other Texas utilities to tell them the company was engaged in=20
interstate commerce.=20
Texas' other major utilities reacted angrily. "The sons of bitches are tryi=

to steal my lignite!" Texas Utilities Chairman Louis Austin bellowed,=20
according to former Texas Public Utility Commissioner George Cowden, who=20

Around noon, Houston Lighting cut its system off from the rest of the state=

utilities. Texas Utilities followed suit hours later. By day's end, the=20
state's utilities had broken the grid into a half-dozen pieces.=20
That same day, one of Texas Utilities' chief lawyers, a 6-foot-6 former=20

Woolridge, which represented Texas Utilities.=20
Alan Erwin, a state utility commissioner in 1976 who still has the souvenir=

on his desk, used the wiring episode as fodder for a 1979 novel, "The Power=

the nation turns to Texas for electricity. Texas refuses to ship the=20
electricity, fearful that other regions would drain it of "what little chea=
p=20
fuel was left." Ultimately, Texas becomes a scapegoat and ends up seceding=
=20
from the union.=20
In reality, the outcome was less dramatic. The grid conflict wound its way=
=20
through many courtrooms. Central & South West -- recently acquired by=20
American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio -- lost almost every round.=
=20
After about four years, the utilities hashed out a compromise, at the urgin=
g=20
of the federal government.=20
Rather than link the Texas grid to the East, so that electricity could flow=
=20
freely across state borders through alternating-current cables, they agreed=
=20
to build two direct-current lines. Operators could control the flow over=20
these bridges, which at peak capacity could carry a mere 820 megawatts. The=
=20
parties to the deal, which included the federal government, agreed these=20
links wouldn't bring the Texas grid under federal jurisdiction. Today, Texa=
s=20
power continues to be regulated in Austin, not Washington.=20
"It's just a Texas thing," says Pat Wood III, chairman of the state utility=

commission and a recent Bush administration nominee to FERC. "We want contr=
ol=20
of our own destiny."=20
That independent attitude has extended in recent years to Texas'=20
business-friendly approach to deregulating its power industry. Unlike=20
California, with its stringent emissions and zoning rules, Texas has made i=

quick and easy for power companies to locate their plants almost anywhere=

they can find a place to hook up to the grid. Last year, Texas completed a=

projects under way. Unlike most other states, it decided to charge grid use=
rs=20
a flat rate to move power anywhere in the state, so they could put plants i=
n=20
low-cost rural areas, far from their customers.=20
Those policies, as well as projections that the state's electricity demand=

Running for cover
California's political gridlock is so bad that one observer equates the=20
situation to the uncertainty and confusion of a mob during a riot.

"Politicians respond when there is a quantifiable problem," said Dan Walter=

political columnist for the Sacramento Bee newspaper. But the energy crisis=

But a governor and a legislature bent on self-preservation may be unwilling=

"We hope the legislature doesn't become dysfunctional because there's some=

stuff that's gotta move," said Tom Williams, a California-based spokesman f=

Duke Energy.=20

One of many priorities is legislative action on the proposed Southern=20

ay=20
is an almost mandatory fix to the imbalance between wholesale and retail=20
markets. Approval of this item has been clouded by questions about the valu=
e=20
of owning only a portion of the state's transmission system. Members of=20
Davis' own party appear unconvinced by arguments that SoCal Ed could follow=

"I've never been afraid of bankruptcy from the beginning," Democratic Senat=

The outlook for action on the second big legislative item may be even worse=

"Californians are paying for a product below cost. Customers need to see th=

CALIFORNIA'S RISING DAILY ELECTRICITY BILL

Against this fast-changing backdrop, annual assessments for summer power=20
supplies for California and the West are being released. Perhaps more than =
at=20
any other time, the politics of energy are as critical for industry insider=
s=20
to understand as the more traditional forecasts of hydro flow, gas=20
availability and transmission constraints.=20

Bleak assessment
By those more traditional measures, the summer power assessment is bad=20
enough. Below-normal precipitation in the Northwest has led power planners =
to=20
say for months the region will be short of power. The California Independen=
t=20
System Operator (ISO) said if consumers use the same amount of electricity=
=20
this summer as last the state could face 34 days of rotating blackouts.=20

The Western States Coordinating Council's summer assessment forecasts a pea=
k=20
demand of 53,893 MW in the U.S. portion of its California-Mexico subregion.=
=20
Load management and interruptible demand are expected to account for almost=
=20
1,000 MW of demand, leaving a net internal demand of 52,899 MW, expected fo=
r=20
August.=20

But California's tight power supply market may be squeezed further by=20
conditions in the Pacific Northwest. There, electricity prices have recentl=
y=20
outpaced California's, according to daily prices reported by Megawatt Daily=
.=20
Those high prices suggest the Northwest's hydro shortage is driving the=20
region's crisis, said Doug Logan, principal with RDI Consulting.=20

MONTHLY PEAK PRICE TRENDS IN THE WEST SPREADSHEET

"California is screaming, but the Northwest is desperate" for power, he sai=
d.=20

Market vulnerabilities
Published reports also suggest that almost anything short of a cool summer=
=20
will overtax supplies and lead to rolling blackouts in California. Unexpect=
ed=20
power plant outages also could trigger blackouts and price spikes, a=20
possibility some say points to market manipulation by power generators.=20
Others say the outages are a natural result of running older plants harder=
=20
and longer than ever before.=20

For example, Duke Energy's 165-MW Oakland plant, built in 1895 and=20
revitalized in 1978, typically ran no more than 70 hours a year, said=20
spokesman Tom Williams. During 2000, Oakland ran for 800 hours before its=
=20
turbines burned up. Its loss prompted a call from the California ISO, which=
=20
said the plant was still needed for baseload operation, Williams said.=20


The danger for much of California is that as the state's older generating=
=20
plants are called on to run harder and longer this summer, they will break=
=20
down more often and add to the supply problem. With supplies constrained, t=
he=20
loss of even a single plant could throw the market into turmoil.=20

"It doesn't matter what the market demand is like if supply is tight," said=
=20
Papalexopoulos. Under tight supply conditions, "every market breaks down."=
=20

Another critical factor will be environmental controls mandated by the=20
federal Clean Air Act and administered by state air quality management=20
districts. Plants whose NOx emissions exceeded permitted levels last year h=
ad=20
to enter the market to buy emission credits. At one point, demand for the=
=20
credits was so high they were all but unavailable at any price. When credit=

willingness (or ability) of air quality management districts to ease or=20

CALIFORNIA SUPPLY & DEMAND FROM ECONOMIC FORUM SPREADSHEET

Kern River rescue
One bright spot seems to be natural gas supplies, which appear adequate or=

the fast-track approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of a 13=

California. The expanded capacity will import relatively low-cost natural g=

But even this bright spot looks a bit cloudy, said Mike Farina, a power=20
