Diesel Fuel Storage Tanks in Los Angeles

I pieced together some initial information on the prospect of installing 
diesel fuel storage tanks in the Los Angeles area.  Much depends on the 
location of the storage facility as well as on the type (i.e. above or below 
ground) and size of the facility.  Listed below are a few agencies that have 
a hand in overseeing fuel storage tanks.

Fire Department
The Fire Department requires permits and review of plans for fuel storage 
facilities.  One of three permits applies - division 4, division 5 or special 
permit - depending on the facility (above ground, below ground, quantity 
stored, area of storage facilities, etc).  The permit paperwork looks quite 
comprehensive including a range of information from ownership to 
geological/groundwater measurements.  However, once the application is 
complete, the Los Angeles Fire Department said they usually turn the permit 
around in a day.  The proper fire department to contact depends on the 
location of the site.  [LAFD - 213-485-7543]

Los Angeles County 
Industrial Waste permits are only required for tanks that discharge waste, so 
for storage, no permit is required.  However, the County approves fuel 
storage for either a spill containment plan or double walled + leak sensor 
construction. Underground storage of hazardous materials is of concern to the 
County, but it is unclear where the fire department leaves off and the county 
picks up.  In cities where the fire department does not process permits for 
fuel storage, the County plays a larger role.  [LA County Environmental 
Programs - 626-458-3517]

California EPA
License/permit processes seem to have been passed down to local levels, 
though I believe that EPA has installation and/or engineering requirements 
for fuel tanks.  I was not able to reach a contact, but I was advised to 
speak with the Engineering Unit - 916-341-5775.

Zoning & Building Requirements
Zoning restrictions exist in Los Angeles and building permits are required as 
in any facility.  Narrowing the location or locations under consideration for 
the tanks will help the information search.  


My initial impression is that this is a comprehensive process, but not 
necessarily any worse than other cities.  The process is unlikely to change - 
for better or worse - any time real soon.

Please contact me with any questions or if you need more in-depth information
