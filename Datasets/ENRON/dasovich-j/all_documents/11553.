A brief summary of Phil Angelides=01, comments during yesterday=01,s Sacram=
ento =20
Press Club lunch:

The majority of his speech was about underinvestment in infrastructure=20
rather  than energy issues. He did say, however, that the current energy=20
crisis is a  manifestation of that underinvestment, which has not allowed=
=20
public projects to  keep pace with growth.

He sees justification for a public power authority in that energy should be=
 =20
treated as a public need that engenders private progress and goes beyond=20
normal  market forces. He offered mortgages as an analogy; home ownership w=
as=20
determined  to be so important to Americans, he said, that instead of leavi=
ng=20
it to the  extremes of the market entities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,=
=20
the VA and  others were created to ensure that reasonable cost funds would =
be=20
available.

During the Q&A, Angelides said $4.125 billion in interim financing is  line=
d=20
up but that the agreement will expire on May 8. The immediate problem is =
=20
that because of AB 1, the PUC must take the unusual step of setting the=20
bonding  authority needed to back this financing that would buy down the=20
general fund  (the Treasurer normally doesn=01,t need special approval by a=
n=20
agency). Because of  the utilities=01, court challenges, it is unlikely tha=
t the=20
PUC will be able to  grant legal bonding authority in time to close the=20
financing. Therefore,  Angelides is asking the Legislature to give the=20
Treasurer=01,s office authority to  issue a bond to at least cover the inte=
rim=20
financing. That authority is needed  by the end of this week, he said=20
(although some press accounts have changed that  to next week).

The Treasurer=01,s legal consultants have determined that AB 1 is outside t=
he =20
scope of bankruptcy, and that the PUC=01,s ability to act in accordance wit=
h AB=20
1  is unaffected by the bankruptcy court.

The quicker the general fund gets taken out of the process, the better, =20
Angelides said. Unless he is given authority to secure financing that will =
=20
return money to the general fund quickly, the state=01,s ability to meet al=
l=20
its  other needs will soon be threatened and credit will be downgraded (not=
e:=20
S&P  announced a downgrade late yesterday). The general fund needs some=20
"breathing  room," and he believes bonds can be sold by the end of June tha=
t=20
would take the  state out of the power purchasing business.

He noted that the bond process will require DWR to produce a finance plan =
=20
that will lead to public disclosure of many of the arrangements Davis has=
=20
kept  secret.=20

He concluded by saying that three things must happen to ensure that the=20
state  can meet its power and financial needs under current spending=20
projections:

1. The general fund has to be removed as the source of funding for buying =
=20
power. He said a plan =01) if there is one =01) should be made public as to=
 how=20
this  will be done.

2. QF=01,s have to get on line =01) he said about 60% are currently on line=
..

3. The price of power has to stay at "obscene" levels, rather than =20
"horrifically obscene" levels.
