AB 2198 Telecommunications: local telephone service competition. Author: 
Pescetti Introduced 2/24/00
Sponsor: Author
Summary:
This bill would state the intent of the Legislature to require the commission 
to remove barriers to local telephone service competition in all 
unincorporated areas of south Sacramento County, to the extent not preempted 
by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.

Position:
This bill requires a specific area of California to remove barriers to 
competition. Are there telecom Munis? is this preemptive to possible 
legislation on Electric Munis? Should we watch the Bill?
