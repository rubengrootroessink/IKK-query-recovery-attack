> Subject: Response to PG&E Request for Interim Relief
>
> On September 15, PG&E filed a motion seeking a ruling on its request for
> interim relief.  They basically want treatment similar to that provided in
> the GRC, so that whatever outcome is adopted in PBR be effective as of
> January 1, 2000, regardless of when the final decision comes out (mid- to
> late-2000 is my best guess).  I'm beginning to draft a response opposed to
> such treatment, and propose that it be a joint filing with other parties
> that wish to oppose such treatment.  I hope to have a draft out by the end
> of Monday; the response is due on Thursday, September 30.
>
> There is a broad strategy call that has to be made at the outset to
> determine whether we should oppose or support PG&E's request.
>
> As most of you will recall, PG&E requested approval of annual attrition
> adjustments in its GRC.  This request was opposed by a number of parties,
> and I believe that PG&E won't get this part of its GRC request.  They
> don't
> have attrition now, and the Commission denied Edison's request for
> attrition in its 1995 test year GRC.
>
> If my prediction proves correct, such an outcome obviously strengthens our
> hand in any PBR proceeding, since the comparison of any proposed PBR
> annual
> update mechanism of "CPI-X" will be to a revenue requirement that does not
> have any such annual adjustment.  Therefore ratepayers would be
> demonstrably worse off with PBR then they are without it, and hopefully
> the
> Commission would either adopt a very high productivity factor ("X") or
> make
> appropriate adjustments somewhere else in the mechanism.

> However, there is always the risk that the Commission will give PG&E what
> it asks for in the GRC.  According to PG&E's 2/26/99 Amendment to
> Application, citing its GRC brief, "PG&E presented its Attrition proposal
> as an alternative to PBR in the event that PBR is not approved in a timely
> manner.  That is, if the Commission approves this request for PBR interim
> relief, there will be no need to implement Attrition even if it is
> approved
> in the GRC decision on a contingency basis as requested."  In other words,
> agreeing to interim relief in the PBR would eliminate the possibility of
> getting a GRC decision that revives the attrition mechanism, thereby
> avoiding the possibility that we would have to argue that a "CPI-X" should
> be compared to the automatic attrition increases adopted in the GRC.

> TURN would tend to err on the side of assuming that in the GRC the
> Commission will continue to find that attrition adjustments no longer make
> sense, and therefore oppose the proposal for interim relief in this
> proceeding.  However, because this does create some risk that we'll end up
> in a worse litigation position in the PBR if the attrition adjustment is
> adopted in the final GRC decision, I thought it important to bring this to

> join us in our response to the motion.
