Subject: California Q&As for South America

Rick,

At Jose Bestard's request, Keith Miceli has developed the attached Q&As on 
the California situation for use by government and regulatory affairs 
professionals in their interactions with officials in South America.  The 
brief would also be distributed to the South America management team.  Could 
you or a member of your staff review this document and let me know whether 
you are comfortable with it?  Any changes or comments would be appreciated.

John
