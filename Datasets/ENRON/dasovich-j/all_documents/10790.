Breathitt wants more attention on Calif. gas
Although the energy spotlight has been on California=01,s electricity crisi=

FERC Commissioner
Linda Breathitt said at the American Gas Association=01,s FERC Natural Gas=

Two issues pending at FERC are whether to re-impose price caps on secondary=

transactions and whether to cap prices on gas sales, Breathitt said.
In addition, FERC recently issued an order to help remove obstacles to=20

supplies into the West (GD 3/15). In the order, FERC sought comments on the=

The commissioner also voiced concern over a California issue that sits at t=

Meanwhile, Breathitt suggested local distribution companies in California=

need the ability
to use risk management tools. Policies should be in place to give gas buyer=

an incentive to use
such tools, including price hedging and the efficient use of storage, she=

said.
But regulators should be careful in noting the difference between hedging t=
