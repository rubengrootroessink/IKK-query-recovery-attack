I spent the last few days with Rod at a CFEE conference, and he is definitely 
going to run..he doesn't think that the election will occur until June so we 
will at least have him in Sacto until then.  The CFEE conference was the best 
that I have ever attended, there were 10 members of the legislature there, 
and though the focus was on air quality and power plants, the members were 
expressing their frustation with the administration in not looking for 
solutions and only pointing fingers..besides contracts and expidited siting, 
a large part of the discussion was on educating the public...Senators Kuehl 
and Machado are planning on putting together a public service announcement of 
some sort  for members to use in their districts on how to conserve 
energy..do we have anything that would be helpful?  Dion Aaroner , who chairs 
the Assembly Democratic Caucus, and Rod will be doing a briefing for the 
members on energy in January, do we have any basic information, like a 
glossary of energy terms that I could give her, I will be with her next 
Thursday.  Dion is also talking to the speaker today, briefing him on what 
the govenor has been doing, and asking him to call the govenor to talk about 
changing his tactics.
