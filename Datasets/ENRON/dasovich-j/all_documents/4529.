Hi everyone:

Just talked to Scott -- he is in DC all week -- his modem is broken on his 
computer and he asked me to let you all know that if you need him to please 
try him on his cell phone (503) 807-2935.  I will be out of the office the 
rest of the week (use or lose vacation!), but will be checking voice mails 
and would be more than happy to pass on anything to Scott -- call me at the 
number below -- I will be retrieving messages.

I will be checking my email as well, (but will be checking voice mail more 
frequently than email),  feel free to send anything to me that you need Scott 
to see.  

Thanks!

Tracy J. Cooper
