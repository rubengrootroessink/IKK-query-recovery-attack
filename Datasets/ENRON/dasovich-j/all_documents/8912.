We just received a phone call from the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
Republican staff inviting Enron to meet in California on February 21 with 
Chairman Tauzin, Rep. Joe Barton, and other Republican committee members.  
The Committee intends to hold three meetings, probably in Pasadena, of a fact 
finding nature.  The meetings will be CEO level and will not be official 
hearings.  Instead, the meetings will be more in the nature of a roundtable 
session.  The three groups being invited are:  a)generators/marketers; b) 
IOUs; and c) State and consumer groups.  The Chairman is interested in 
hearing about solutions, and less interested in "who's to blame."    Other 
participants in our group are:  Dynegy, Southern, Reliant, Duke, Calpine, and 
Williams.  They intend to also include a few natural gas suppliers in our 
group.   Our session is expected to start at 10:00 a.m.  Although they are 
asking for CEO level participation, I expect we could substitute someone 
under that rank.  However, I would recommend we try to accommodate their 
request for CEO attendance given the meeting with be with Chairman Tauzin.  
Enron historically has not had close ties to the new Chairman.
