Jeff,

Please check with Belden or I if you are going to use these curves for 
anything other than internal analysis or high-level negotiating.

If you need help converting into quarterly numbers, let me know.

Remember that the total cost of wholesale power includes ancillary services 
which you can estimated to be 5% of these amounts.  I.e., 105% of the curve 
price is the average power cost including A/S

Alan
