Subject: socal gas 

i just got word from one of my counterparties that socal gas was trying to 
implement a new policy that would allow for them to call "customer specific 
OFO's"  for high inventory, much like PG&E already does.  the implication was 
that this would be done very quickly.  what my counterparty wanted to know is 
-  do  we see anything in socal gas's tariff that would allow for them to do 
this?  my first thought was - no.  can you provide any insight on this matter?
