Jeff - I'll be there, 10:00 right? Are the directions at the bottom of this
email to your office? I'm getting giddy just thinking about the fun times
we'll have.

If you are planning on attending Saturday's session, here is the scoop:

1) Please e-mail Jeff to RSVP
2) If you were not at our Tuesday's meeting, attached are two spreadsheets
of the work we covered - you may want to read before Saturday.  I have put
names next to some questions based on what Christine put together.  If you
don't see your name and plan on coming, either pick a question or address
another area.
2.5) Chris Sklarin will be sending the third
3) Directions are below on how to get to Jeff's office
4) It's almost over!! :)  See you on Saturday!!

-Jackie

(I think that we will need to celebrate after the March 8th class!!
Jonathan?)



Jackie, The spreadsheet is attached, pls. distribute to our study group (I
don't have all the e-mail addresses).

The additional questions for any newcomers that can be answered are:
1) Compare the five options given in 'The Decision'.  (Jonathan, Alyson)
2) What would happen if all manufacturers (including GM) all retained their
original warranty plans.  (Jeff, aiaz)
3) When should the change be implemented?  (nick, Courtney)
4) Should the change be implemented for all cars, non-luxury? luxury?
(Cathy, Chris)
Answers should be backed by data (numbers, tables, etc) rather than just
qualitatitve answers.

Crystine
