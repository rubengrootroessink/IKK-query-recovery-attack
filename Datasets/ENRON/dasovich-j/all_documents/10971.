Dear Silicon Valley Leader:

Please plan to join the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, San Jose Mayor
Ron Gonzales, Santa Clara County Supervisor Jim Beall and other key
community leaders for a "Santa Clara County Energy Summit II."

The goal of the Summit is simple - and critical: What IMMEDIATE steps can
each of us individually and collectively take to get California through the
summer months, to minimize rolling blackouts.  With that in mind, we will
focus on QUANTIFIABLE deliverables relative to conservation, load management
during peak periods, generation and state policies.

Special thanks to SVMG Member Company, Synopsys, for offering to host the
Summit, which will take place On Friday, May 4, from 8 a.m. (sharp) until 12
Noon at their Sunnyvale company site, 455 North Mary Avenue, Building 2.

Invitations and registration materials to follow.  If you have any
questions, or require additional information, please call the SVMG offices
at 408/501-7864, or simply respond to this e-mail.
