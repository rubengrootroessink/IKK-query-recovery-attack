THE PRICE INSTITUTE GIVES A BOOST TO LESTER CENTER ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMS
 The Price Institute, a longtime supporter of the Lester Center for 
Entrepreneurship & Innovation, has made a long-term commitment to the Lester 
Center in the form of a $750,000 gift. The money will be received over the 
next five years and will support the Harold Price Entrepreneurial Leadership 
Program, which supports the Entrepreneurs Association and its affiliated 
programs: the Partners for Entrepreneurial Leadership (PEL), the Berkeley 
Solutions Group, the venture capital internships, and other student programs. 

"The Lester Center and the Haas School are very pleased with the leadership 
and support provided by the Price Institute and its president, Gloria Appel," 
says Jerry Engel, executive director of the Lester Center for 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation. "The Price Institute has always been 
interested in our students and the fine entrepreneurial experience we strive 
to create for them. They have been there as our partner for over a decade."

The Price Institute has been awarding fellowships to selected Haas School 
first-year MBA students since 1986 to recognize their entrepreneurial 
aspirations and development. Two $5,000 Price Institute Fellowship awards, 
administered by the Lester Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, are 
awarded each year to eligible students interested in an entrepreneurial 
career.

Through the years, the institute has given programmatic funding, which to 
date totals close to $800,000. The institute has pledged to raise its total 
donation to more than $1,300,000 by the year 2004.

Founded in 1979 by Harold Price, the Price Institute is nationally known for 
its support and development of entrepreneurship. 

KNOWLEDGE AND THE WEB: THE FUTURE OF THE NEW ECONOMY
 Most people doing business today have had to deal with issues of 
intellectual property and knowledge creation--and if that business is on the 
web, these issues come up at light speed. The Haas School will delve into 
these issues as part of a larger discussion of knowledge at the upcoming 
Fourth Annual Knowledge Forum. 

The conference, "Creating and Exploiting Knowledge Assets in the 
Internet-enabled Economy," will take place at Haas on September 29 in the 
Arthur Andersen Auditorium. 

The lineup of distinguished scholars and industry leaders includes Ikujiro 
Nonaka, Xerox Distinguished Professor in Knowledge at the Haas School of 
Business; Roger Siboni, BS 76, CEO of E.piphany and chair of the Dean's 
Advisory Board; Sabeer Bhatia, founder of Hotmail and CEO of Arzoo.com; and 
David Teece, Mitsubishi Bank Professor of International Business and Finance 
and director of the Institute for Management, Innovation, and Organization.? 

Joining Nonaka and Bhatia in the afternoon session on "Leadership for 
Knowledge Based Innovation" will be Kei-ichi Enoki of NTT DoCoMo, Japan's 
leading mobile phone company.? In May, Enoki was named one of the 25 leaders 
in e-business by Business Week for his push to create i-mode, a mobile 
net-access service in Japan that now has 6 million users.? Teece will close 
the conference by moderating a panel on "Value Creation in the New Economy."

The forum registration fee is $100 and includes lunch and conference 
materials.? Register by phone at 510-642-4041 or send e-mail to 
conference@haas.berkeley.edu.? Haas faculty and students may attend the 
knowledge forum lectures free of charge, but they must call or e-mail to 
reserve a space.? For more information, visit the Knowledge Forum web site at 
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~imio/knowledge/index2000.htm or call

Administration and director of the University of California Energy Institute,

high price of gasoline to the high oil prices and a tight refining market in 
California.

Times business section September 15 discussing the problems that electricity 
deregulation has run into and arguing for the need for real-time retail 
pricing.

entire article at

.

David Aaker, professor emeritus of marketing, was quoted in US News and World 
Report on September 11. The article "Guarding the Brand is Job One," was 
about the Bridgestone/Firestone recall. Aaker commented that it was important 
to take responsibility for product failure, not try to shift the blame. 

The Register quoted Hal Varian, dean of the School of Information Management 
and Systems and Haas professor, and Carl Shapiro, Transamerica Professor of 
Business Strategy and director of the Institute of Business and Economics 
Research (IBER), in an article titled, "Bubble Economy Gurus Rate Amazon's

Borenstein was quoted in a September 7, San Francisco Chronicle article on 
electricity rates, saying that it is easy after the fact to argue that San 
Diego Gas & Electric should have hedged electricity prices, but the hedge 
price could have just as easily been higher than the price SDG&E ended up 
paying.

the state of the economy.
