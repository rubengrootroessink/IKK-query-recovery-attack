Good Afternoon,
Yesterday my inbox, all my personal e-mail folders, and any document
attached to an e-mail were lost.  Nothing happend specifically to cause
this.  We do not know where the data went and have been unable to retrieve
it.  Please, if you know anything about Outlook or data recover, I need your
help.  I rely on e-mail not only for communication but to transfer and
receive very important information - some of which will be lost permanently
unless I am able to restore the files.  I also use my e-mail as a form of
record keeping and information storage, which helps me to do my job.
Please, if you can help or know someone who may, get in touch with me.  My
direct line is 408-501-7870.  Thanks - recovering this information will make
me very happy!!!

Laura
