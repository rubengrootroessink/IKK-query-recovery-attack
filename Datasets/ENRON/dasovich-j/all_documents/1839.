So sorry, I thought I had sent out this e-mail on my last day 9-6-00. Instead 
I had saved it as a draft. Some of the information is out of date, but useful 
for reference.

Interconnection Workshop Report:  The supplemental CEC Draft Committee Report 
was issued 9/1/00. The Report will be heard at the CEC on 9/7. We will have 
an opportunity to file written comments on the draft report if the issue is 
not fully addressed at the hearing.  Written comments must be served on the 
99-DIST-GEN(2) service list and received by the Energy Commission by 5:00 pm, 
Pacific Daylight Time on September 15, 2000.  No late filings will be 
accepted under any circumstances.  For purposes of meeting the deadline, 
however, you can e-mail your comments to Scott Tomesheski at 
tomashe@energy.state.ca.us by the above-mentioned deadline. We will still 
need to file an original and 10 sets of written comments to the Energy 
Commission docket office.

The Siting Committee is expected to release a revised report by September 
29th.  The full Commission anticipates considering the supplemental 
recommendation for approval at its October 18th business meeting.

 Bob Frank has been added to the distribution list.

Interconnection Rules: The interconnection rules do not address Exporting. 
They do not prevent Exporting. This is good because modification to the rules 
would have to be done by petition to modify the final decision  

Interconnection Agreement: We managed to not exclude Exporting from the DG 
interconnection Agreement. however, the agreement does not explicitly 
address. Exporting. It allows for supplemental agreements to be attached to 
the extent that they are under the CPUC jurisdiction. If the CPUC asserts 
jurisdiction over the retail wheeling, the agreement will be valid and will 
need additional attachments. Modifications to this document can be done by 
Advice Letter filing. 

Interconnection Application: This document does not include exporting, except 
if you are QF and exporting under 100 kW. Once approved, modifications to 
this document to this document can be done by Advice Letter filing. We may 
want to address this issue in written comments by 9/7. We may also want to 
wait how the CPUC rules on retail wheeling and then address the issue.


ISO issues: The ISO will be filling at the FERC metering and scheduling 
requirement for DG units - Participating Generators or other. The ISO intends 
to file at FERC shortly. I asked Jeanne Sole of the ISO to contact Sue with 
the schedule.In short the ISO would like to require that gross Load and 
generation be Scheduled by the ISO at the transmission as well as 
Distribution level. The ISO intends to require all participating generation 
of 1 MW and above and all Generation of 10 MW and above to meter there gross 
generation (whether for self consumption or export. They intend to require 
telemetric meters, resulting in high installation, purchase and operational 
costs. They also intend to apply GMC and TAC on gross generation including 
generation for self consumption.
