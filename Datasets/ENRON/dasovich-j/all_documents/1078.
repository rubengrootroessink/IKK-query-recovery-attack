Jeff,
     I chuckled to read about Dan being the center of Dante's Inferno core,
but quickly was overcome more by disdain of the simpleton Mr. Palast's
wretched journalistic license.  Why don't you get Skillings, Michaels,
McCrae, Levin et al to answer all the preposterous revisionist pablum that
is saturating the marketplace as we speak?  Is there or was there only one
Jessie Knight who lived that 6-year hell to have crap like this spread
about?  Where are all the direct access/bilateral
contract/anti-poolco/anti-Hogan/anti-Harvard Electricity Group/anti-command
& control proponents?  It is sad for me to hear the deafening silence out of
a community that I helped lead to battle and to leave and see that most have
abandoned the cause to leave it the world to the government infidels that
want to and will certainly re-create the Gulag.
