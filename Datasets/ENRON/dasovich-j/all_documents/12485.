MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY (MOT) RECEIVES $1.5 MILLION ENDOWMENT FOR SUMMER 
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM
 With the financial backing of a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm, 
the Haas School of Business, the College of Engineering, and the School of 
Information Management and Systems are launching an innovative program that 
blends academic training in entrepreneurship with hands-on industry 
experience at Silicon Valley startups.? 

The Mayfield Fund, a top-tier venture capital firm headquartered in Menlo 
Park, California, has committed $1.5 million to fund the new program at UC 
Berkeley, to be called the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program. The new 
program will be administered by the Management of Technology Program (MOT), a 
partnership created in 1988 by the above three units of the UC Berkeley 
campus. Under the UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program, graduate students 
selected from the College of Engineering, the Haas School of Business, and 
the School of Information Management and Systems work as summer interns at 
venture-backed high tech firms in Silicon Valley.? 

"I don't believe any other university offers its graduate students such 
rigorous training in starting new high-tech ventures, from both a business 
and a technology perspective," explains Richard Newton, dean of the College 
of Engineering.? "Add to that the opportunity to work directly for the CEO of 
a high-tech startup as part of the academic experience, and we have created 
something truly extraordinary for our students."

The first group of UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows was announced this week, four 
each from the College of Engineering and the Haas School, all with extensive 
technical training and previous work experience in high tech. The names of 
the fellows will be announced at a later date.  In addition to the summer 
internships, UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows participate in intensive classroom 
work, intended to blend the practical experience gained through their 
internships with the challenge and growth of a series of graduate seminars on 
technology and entrepreneurship. 

"The UC Berkeley Mayfield Fellows Program is a great example of the way in 
which we're succeeding at blending hands-on industry experience at Silicon 
Valley companies into the Haas academic experience," says Andrew Isaacs, 
executive director of MOT. "The joint MOT-Lester Center collaboration on this 
program makes this new venture all the more exciting."

The Mayfield Fund has made the $1.5 million commitment to UC Berkeley as part 
of its support of the Center for Information Technology Research in the 
Interest of Society (CITRIS), being created within UC as a focal point to 
apply advances in information technology to the solution of society's most 
critical needs. "Mayfield is excited by the opportunity to participate with 
UC Berkeley in a program that will enrich the entrepreneurial experience for 
graduate students," said Michael Levinthal, Mayfield Fund general partner. 
"The continual success of startups that have flowed from UC Berkeley to the 
Bay Area and beyond is exceptional, and Mayfield is proud of our association 
with this process."

CALIFORNIA'S SLUMPING ECONOMY FACES MULTI-YEAR RECOVERY, SAYS RESEARCHERS
 As California's prosperous glow begins to tarnish, the state as a whole 
faces sharply escalating unemployment rates, a leveling off or decline in 
home prices, rising office vacancies, and reduced construction over the next 
two to three years.? These are the conclusions of Professor Dwight Jaffee and 
California economist Cynthia Kroll of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and 
Urban Economics.

In the center's recently released Spring 2001 Research Report, Jaffee and 
Kroll point to the vulnerability of California, and particularly of the San 
Francisco Bay Area, as the US economy slows.? The authors look at the state's 
experience in past recessions and conclude that a two to three year 
adjustment period is likely before the state resumes expansion.

Jaffee and Kroll point out that the major stock price adjustments that 
occurred earlier this year reflected real changes in the economic factors 
driving California's economy.? Driven by expansion of dot-com and high tech 
sectors, computer programming employment alone grew by over 90,000 jobs in 
2000, with much of this increase found in the San Francisco Bay Area.? The 
bursting of the dot-com bubble and subsequent lay-off announcements leave 
this sector -- and the Bay Area -- particularly vulnerable.

The real estate market will also feel the effects in coming months, and the 
impact on the office real estate market is likely to be substantial. In fact, 
prices have already begun to decline in this sector. San Francisco's SoMa 
(South of Market) district, which has recently put on the market many offices 
geared toward dot-com-type firms, is most likely to suffer as a wave of these 
companies goes out of business.

The authors argue that office rent's could drop substantially -- at least 10% 
in San Francisco's downtown area and perhaps as much as 50% in the areas most 
heavily affected by the dot-com bust. Dropping rents could temper the rise in 
vacancies.? Companies that were previously forced out of the market by 
sky-high lease prices are now looking at reduced rates.

The residential real estate market will also be affected by the economic 
adjustment. Kroll and Jaffee expect the high-end residential real estate 
market, previously fueled by stock market gains, to contract the most as the 
crop of dot-com employees who found their way to quick wealth sell their 
newly overpriced homes. Lower- and mid-range markets will see more moderate 
price adjustments.

Based on past history, the researchers maintain that job losses and declining 
real estate prices could continue for two to three years.? They point out 
that in the longer term, both Silicon Valley and California as a whole have 
shown an economic resilience and the ability to resume expansion after a 
slowdown or recession.

UC BERKELEY TEAMS WIN TWO REAL ESTATE CHALLENGES 
 Victory came to the Haas and other UC Berkeley graduate students who 
participated in the two most recent real estate competitions: the National 
Association of Industrial and Office Properties (NAIOP) Challenge and the 
Bank of America Low-Income Housing Challenge. 

NAIOP Real Estate Development Challenge  The Shovel returned to Berkeley last 
Thursday, May 3, as the Berkeley team took home this symbolic prize of the 
NAIOP Real Estate Development Challenge. The NAIOP competition is a challenge 
between graduate students at UC Berkeley and Stanford and is sponsored by the 
San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the National Association of Industrial and 
Office Properties.  This year's challenge: What is the economic future for a 
strip of land and buildings on a former military base, on an island, in a 
tertiary market of the Bay Area, Mare Island. Teams of five students proposed 
the best use, design, financing, and marketing of a commercial real estate 
project.  In addition to strong market analysis, community buy-in, and a 
financial analysis that supported their phased development, the Cal team 
added something new: a dynamic marketing plan, including a 3-D video montage 
of site context, present and planned buildings and renderings, landscape, and 
waterfront. 

"Clearly the team leveraged the best talent of each member, orchestrating a 
comprehensive program for the base reuse," said Steve Chamberlin, adjunct 
professor at Haas who teaches real estate courses. "The city of Vallejo and 
the site developer, Legacy Properties, acknowledged how much they benefited 
from the Challenge exercise."

UC Berkeley's 2001 NAIOP team included Aimee Einstein, MBA 02; Jonathan 
Fearn, Masters of City Planning 01; Chiendao Glasgow, Masters of Architecture 
01; Maria Iniguez, MBA 01; and Sara Williams, MBA 02. UC Berkeley's team won 
the competition last year, bringing the decade-long battle with Stanford to a 
tie, five wins for each university. Winning this 12th Annual Cal-Stanford 
Real Estate Challenge changed the overall score to UC Berkeley - 7, Stanford 
- 5. 

 Bank of America Low-Income Housing Challenge?  Berkeley's team also won the 
Bank of America Low-Income Housing Challenge, a competition among several 
west coast graduate schools, in which each team must identify a viable site, 
gain community support, and then design, finance, and market an affordable 
housing project. A panel of professionals judges the projects. 

Berkeley's multi-disciplinary team proposed a project called Gateway Landing, 
to be located in downtown Oakland. The project proposed 70 units of housing 
affordable to families earning $20,000 - $40,000 per year. The project 
incorporates components of sustainable development, including energy 
efficiency design, links with public transportation, and programs for 
residents to aid upward mobility. In recognition of their efforts, the team 
received $2000, which they will donate to Urban Ecology and the East Bay 
Alliance for a Sustainable Economy. Copies of the team's final proposal are 
available on the web at http://sites.netscape.net/gtwylanding/sub1.htm.

This year's team consists of Paul Correa, Masters of City Planning (MCP) 01; 
Alexandra Galovich, MBA 02; Shinichiro Ikeda, MCP 01; Christia Mulvey, MCP 
01; Bao-Tran Truong, MCP 01; and Madeleine Zayas-Mart, MCP/Masters of 
Architecture 02. 

Final presentations were held on Wednesday, May 4, at 9:30 a.m. at the Bank 
of America Building in San Francisco.
