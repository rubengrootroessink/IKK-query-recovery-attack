couldn't possibly sneak out tomorrow, this week is just too insane, can we
please hook up next week? i'm going to LA for work early next week, so maybe
we can lunch or coffee on thursday or friday? and guess the fuck what? i got
an art studio! in SF! and it's cheap! and i can ride my bike there! it's
truly amazing, and i have raphael to thank for having good connections and
