Subject: Home Depot Question 

Professor, 

As part of the assignment you ask us to evaluate the time series changes of 
Home
Depot's profitability relative to previous years (last question in section 
b.). 
However, given that we have only 2 fiscal years of balance sheet data we can 
only calculate one year of ratios (ROA, ROE, etc).? How are we to answer the 
question given our dilemma?
