I have just heard?from a member of AReM?that Linda Serizawa,  Commissioner 
Wood's advisor, has stated that Commissioner Wood is at this moment  drafting 
the decision on direct access.? She indicated that a draft order  would be 
released, but would not say when.? She stated that ABX1-1 directed  the CPUC 
to set a date at which time a customer would no longer have the right  to 
switch to an ESP, and indicated that this order, as it is currently drafted,  
establishes that date.? Apparently there was great hesitancy when making  the 
statement "as it is presently drafted," indicating that Wood is getting a  
lot of pressure not to set the date.? 

It seems that now is the time  for WPTF, and its member companies, to exert 
as much influence as possible on  Bilas, Duque and Brown to ask that the 
order be held until such time as the  Legislature first has the opportunity 
to correct ABX1-1.?
