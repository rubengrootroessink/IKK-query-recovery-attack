Additional Talking Points 

1. Grace Period for Direct Access

Customers should be given at least the next 6 months to contract away from 
the Utilities w/o any penalty.


2. Fees must Promote Direct Access

Any fees that are charged to switching customers should be of a fixed nature 
(reset annually) and have a long-term amortization (10 years).


3. CDWR needs to have incentives to minimize cost and should have some Risk / 
At a minimum, need Sunset language

Without the right incentives, CDWR may not make the right decisions.  Need to 
push this into the market as quickly as possible.


LANGUAGE CHANGE --

As much as possible, remove the ", including the payment of fees or 
surcharges, " language in the middle as it seems to be covered by the last 
sentence.  I don't want to invite surcharges
