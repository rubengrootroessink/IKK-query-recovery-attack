Hi Avrim:

So sorry this took me so long, and I hope you haven't already left---I
recall you saying that you guys were leaving on the 1st, which I hope i=
s
the case.  Anyway, hope that this finds you before you depart.

First, if you didn't buy a "Plan du Paris" ("map of Paris, in English) =
on
your first trip, I highly recommend it. All Parisians use it, it costs
about $10-15 and you'll use if for all your other trips to Paris.  It's=
a
must for getting around the town.  Every street in the city; all the
"arrondissements": map of the subway system, etc.

OK, here goes.  It's been a while, and I don't have my "Plan" with me h=
ere
in Mexico, so I'm working from memory.  Hope that it's helpful.  Once
you've bought your "Plan," you can reference my suggestions and get
yourself oriented, link the walks together, etc.

For an exotic (and cool) experience, go to "the Mosque" ("La Mosquee=
")
in French.  It's in the southeastern part of the city (15th
arrondissement, or 5th?).  Go the cafe in the mosque and have tea.  =
It's
just very cool.
La Rue Moufftard (sp?).  It starts on the top of the hill where the
Pantheon is (across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens).  It's a=

neat little street that winds down the other side of the hill.  Go
before noon when the market fills the street---you can buy a few thi=
ngs
and picnic in the Luxembourg Garden.
Speaking of the Luxembourg Gardens, it's a neat place.  I'd take a w=
alk
through---check out all of the "espaille'd" fruit trees----truly a w=
ork
of art.
Walk to the other side of the Garden (opposite from the Pantheon sid=
e)
and find the "St. Sulpice" church.  Very cool neighborhood (St. Germ=
ain
des Pres neighborhood).  The church is on a square; there's a lot of=

very nice cafes and restaurants, and it's the site of the famous "Le=
ft
Bank" fashion center.
While you're over there, wander to the Montparnasse neighborhood and=

stop in at the "Rosebud" bar.  Hemmingway and the gang drank there.
It's small, the waiters where little white coats and they play real
vinyl records of the best jazz anywhere.  Best of all, it's not
pretentious.  It's hip.
Also there is a cemetery where many famous folks are buried (includi=
ng
Serge Gainsbourg)----cemeteries are of course a big deal in Paris, t=
he
most notable being the Pere LaChaise Cemetery, where Jim Morrison is=

buried. They're Interesting enough, but I don't know if I'd go out o=
f my
way....
In the Latin Quarter (5th arrond), check out "L'Ecluse," right on th=
e
river at the Quai les Grands Augustins, just off Boulevard St. Miche=
l.
Little wine bar with tasty things to nibble on.  Great place to take=
a
breather in the late afternoon (somewhat) in style.
The Picasso museum in the "Marais" neighborhood is an absolute must.=

And while you're there be sure to cruise the neighborhood.  Very
gentrified these days (and it's the gay neighborhood), but been
renovated into a lot of very impressive art galleries and fashion
houses---very neat.
While there (in the same neighborhood) go to the "Place des Vosges."=

Unreal big old square from way back when---great to look at and ther=
e's
shops and cafes.
The "Institute du Monde Arab" is on the Mitterand's "seven great
projects."  Architechturally magnificent and the exhibits inside are=

modest and very impressive.
Rue de la Roquette is now extremely hip---on the east side of the
Bastille behind the "new opera" (if you get a chance go an opera
there---very populist experience and fun.  Roquette is where the clu=
bs
and the musique are.  General hip-dome (and if you're inclined to do=

some real people-watching, go to Boulevard St. Germain and sit outsi=
de
at Les Deux Magots or Caf=E9 Fleure and watch away).
Find on your map the church St. Eustache.  Walk around east of it fo=
r
some very cool neighborhood viewing?used to be big wholesale butcher=
s
and such (extension of Les Halles, which is now a big shopping mall =
but
used to be Paris' outdoor market).  From there walk to "Place des
Victoires, or Place des Notre Dame des Victoires (I can't remember).=

And look for Gallerie Vivienne, too---Belle Epoque little food a
shopping corrider?very neat.
And finally, while your over there, go to the Palais Royale (by the
Louvre), which is where Louis XIV grew up as a boy---fantastic
courtyard, controversial artwork (black and white striped columns);
walk to the opposite end, exit the courtyard out the back and contin=
ue
walking in the neighborhood.

I'll leave the museums, etc. to you.  Sorry to quick and dirty.  Have a=

great time.  See you soon.

Best,
Jeff=
