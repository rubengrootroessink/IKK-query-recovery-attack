Are you proposing to have a conference call on this?  Alan, remember we 
talked to Tim about meeting with the traders about this - what is the status 
of that?   

Here are my comments.  In general, I don't think we should refer to WPTF 
arguments where we have made our own arguments, in particular on number 5.  
We should summarize EES/EPMI's arguments as I did in my proposed draft answer 
to this question.  With respect to answers to questions 2 and 4,  I think we 
should make more legally-oriented arguments essentially restating the 
arguments we made in EES/EPMI's comments to FERC, along the lines of my 
proposed draft answers.  Although the Commissioners will not read our 
pleadings, they are likely to read our answers to these questions so this 
will give us an opportunity to summarize our pleadings.  In addition, these 
are positions that we have already agreed to and discussed.  For those of you 
who don't have my suggested draft answers, they are attached.

Here's a short but sweet draft.  Alan will be providing data and Ron will be 
providing some additional language on question 5 (or whichever one talks 
about J&R rates).  We're also still trying to get the chart referred to in 
Question 2 -- so for now we have no answer for that one.

I'm in the office Wed but in a few meetings.  Call or e-mail comments.  415
