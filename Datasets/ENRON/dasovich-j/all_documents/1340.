NEW STUDENTS GET SETTLED AND GET STARTED
 New students admitted to the Haas School have had a couple of weeks to get 
acclimated, find a good, cheap place for lunch, and get their class schedules 
set. As usual, the school has admitted statistically stellar classes in all 
four programs, but the numbers don't tell the whole story.

The professional accomplishments of this year's new MBA class are wide 
ranging. There is a student who is a baker and a juggler, one who holds a 
Ph.D. in pharmacology, and another who was the second-place champion at the 
US Junior National Judo Competition.? The 241 class members have an average 
of 5.6 years of work experience, slightly more experience than previous 
classes. The median GMAT was 690. There are 31% women and 31% international 
students in the class, which makes the class more diverse than those at most 
other business schools. 

It is the nature of the Evening MBA program to attract a diverse group of 
professionals, and this year is no exception. Among the 112 consultants, 
engineers, and managers admitted to this year's class, there is a student who 
has founded a major biotech firm, another who is a practicing physician, and 
one who builds and retrofits bridges for CalTrans. In the Evening MBA 
program, 70% of the class is multilingual, with 22% of the class speaking 
four languages. The median GMAT score was 690 and they average 7.1 years of 
post-university work experience. 

The Haas Ph.D. program enrolled a small group of 21 highly qualified 
candidates. This year more than a third of the new students are women and 41% 
are international students.? Their average GMAT score is 720. 

The Ph.D. program and the Institute of Management, Innovation & Organization 
(IMIO) awarded their first multi-year Sasakawa Fellowship this year. The 
award went to Geoff Edwards, an incoming doctoral student in Business and 
Public Policy. Edward's research interests include antitrust economics and 
firm behavior and strategy.

As one of the most popular undergraduate majors on campus, the Haas 
Undergraduate program always attracts the cream of the crop of continuing Cal 
and incoming transfer students.? This year 100% of the 207 admitted students 
have enrolled at Haas. The average GPA of the admitted Cal students was 
3.62.? Dan Himelstein, director of the Undergraduate Program, says of the new 
class, "They are anxious to make the most of everything the Haas School has 
to offer."

THE NEXT NEW THING: NEW COURSE OFFERINGS AT HAAS
 Every semester the Haas School offers new courses both to reflect changing 
business needs and to explore new ways of thinking. Last year the list of new 
courses was dominated by a plethora of e-commerce offerings; so far this 
year's new courses are more varied. Of course the new and existing Internet 
related courses are still very popular.?  One of the new courses this fall is 
part of a broader new partnership between the Haas School and Boalt School of 
Law. "Law and Strategy of E-Commerce," taught by Pablo Spiller (Haas) and 
Robert Merges (Boalt), brings top CEOs and intellectual property lawyers to 
campus to share their knowledge with both business and law students. The 
course covers the legal and non-market environment of e-commerce. It provides 
an introduction to the economics and law of intellectual property and applies 
them directly to established and emerging e-business strategies.  The other 
new courses offered this fall are: 

"The Transformational Effects of e-Business" taught at the Darden Business 
School and transmitted to Haas (the first class in the Haas-Darden-Michigan 
partnership). 
"Contemporary Philanthropy" taught by Fran Van Loo 
"The Entrepreneurial Cycle" (a student-initiated course) 
"Social Venture Entrepreneurship" (also  student-initiated) 
"Economics of Information" taught by Yale Braunstein (an existing SIMS 
course, being offered to Haas and Engineering students for the first time as 
part of the MOT program) 
"Managing in the Internet Age" taught by Suzanne Stout 
"Implementing Mergers, Acquisitions, and Joint Ventures in the Internet 
Economy" taught by Gary McBride 
"E-Commerce In Supply Chain Management" taught by Dorit Hochbaum


HAAS RANKS #2 IN SURVEY OF BEST BUSINESS SCHOOLS FOR HISPANIC STUDENTS
 Haas ranked #2 in Hispanic Business Magazine's survey of business schools 
that was published in the September issue. 

The ranking was based on the following factors: the number of Hispanic 
students enrolled, the percentage of full-time Hispanic faculty, the 
availability of special Hispanic student recruitment programs and student 
services, retention of Hispanic students, and reputation of the institution 
based on this year's US News & World Report.

Magazine) 1. University of Rochester, William Simon Graduate School of

LEADING EDGE CONFERENCE BRINGS THE NEW ECONOMY TO HAAS
 Staying on the leading edge takes work and the group of MBA students who 
organized the third annual Leading Edge conference have definitely done their 
homework. The roster of keynote speakers includes Jim Clark, founder of 
Netscape, Healtheon/ WebMD, and MyCFO, Inc.; David Ditzel,CEO, Transmeta 
Corporation; and George Shaheen, President and CEO of Webvan Group.

The Leading Edge is a student-run technology conference that provides a forum 
for technology leaders to present how their businesses are reshaping the 
technology and broader business communities. It is also an opportunity for 
these professionals to engage in a dialogue with Haas students, alumni, and 
attendees. 

Over the two days of the conference, attendees will have a choice of 
participation in 13 panels led by representatives from Ariba, Ask Jeeves, 
Cisco Systems, Commerce One, Healtheon/WebMD, Jupiter Communications, 
Loudcloud, Napster, Nortel Networks, Omnisky, Red Herring Communications, 
Shockwave.com, WebTV, and Yahoo! Topics will range from the future of online 
education to varying qualities of venture capital. 

The conference kicks off on Friday night with a keynote address by Shaheen 
and a networking reception, followed by a Product Fair. On Saturday, events 
start bright and early with registration and breakfast at 8:00 a.m. Clark and 
Ditzel will both give addresses on Saturday.  

Tickets to the conference will be available during the conference 
registration window, which will run from September 13 at 12:00 p.m. through 
September 18 at 5:00 p.m.? The first step to getting a ticket is to submit an 
online request for a ticket for Friday, Saturday or both days of the 
conference. Tickets to attend on Friday are $10 and tickets for Saturday are 
$50. Then, once the ticketing window is closed, the organizers will conduct a 
random lottery to determine the actual ticket distribution.

HAAS CONFERENCE EXAMINES CRISES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET
 The recent upsurge in California housing prices has created new challenges 
for families in both the middle and lower income brackets trying to find 
housing, for employers trying to attract and retain employees, and for policy 
makers trying to expand transportation infrastructures. The Berkeley Program 
on Housing and Urban Policy Conference will discuss these housing and urban 
policy issues at its Second Annual Research Conference on Monday, September 
18, at the Haas School's Arthur Andersen Auditorium. 

California State Treasurer Philip Angelides will address prospects for 
affordable housing finance in California in his keynote address. Speakers 
from development, government, and nonprofit sectors will debate which 
policies and actions will improve the delivery of housing in the state. 
Special emphasis will be placed on issues of smart housing investment in 
urban areas, the impacts of welfare reform on needy families, and the 
programmatic experiences with HOME, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and 
other federal subsidies.

"This annual conference honors the memory of Don Terner, a pioneer in 
providing affordable housing. He was a major force in improving housing 
opportunities for all citizens," said John Quigley, who holds the I. Donald 
Terner Distinguished Professorship shared by the Haas School and the College 
of Environmental Design. Quigley directs the Berkeley Program on Housing and 
Urban Policy.

The Haas School, the College of Environmental Design, and the Goldman School 
of Public Policy sponsor the daylong conference. While the event is sold out, 
those interested in the agenda of the conference can visit the web site at 
http://urbanpolicy.berkeley.edu for further information.

FACULTY NEWS: FUNDING FOR HEALTH CARE STUDIES AT HAAS
 Paul Gertler, professor at the Haas School and the School of Public Health 
and faculty director for the Graduate Program in Health Management, and 
Kristi Raube, adjunct professor and executive director of the Graduate 
Program in Health Management, have received funding for three new research 
initiatives.

financing healthcare for the poor, to be conducted by Raube, Gertler, and 
Severin Borenstein, the E.T. Grether Professor in Public Policy and Business 
Administration, over the next 18 months. 

For a separate study, Gertler received a $300,000 grant from the California

medical provider bankruptcies in the past year. 

Raube also received $29,821 in funding for a 6-month study of pharmaceutical 
management practices among safety net providers in California from the 
California Program on Access to Care.
