Alan,

I am still pulling together info on PG&E's resources/generation.  Once I have 
that assembled, I will incorporate it in the model along with the UMFOR data 
on SCE that you sent me.  Meantime, this is roughly the same version of the 
model that you already have.  It may represent an update from one I had sent 
to Tim and Jeff earlier, however.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to 
give me a call.
