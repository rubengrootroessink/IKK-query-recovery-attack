MBA 01, MBA 02 & Evening MBA classmates

The Haas Entrepreneur Association in conjunction with the Lester Center for
Entrepreneurship is pleased to bring you the opportunity to meet and network
with venture capital professionals at the annual VC Roundtable Dinner.

Details are below:
VC Roundtable Dinner
Monday, November 6 from 6:30pm - 9 pm
Mings Restaurant in Palo Alto

WHAT IS THE VC ROUNDTABLE?
An opportunity to meet and network with 20+ venture capitalists from both
early stage and late stage firms. We have already received great interest
from a number of VCs who attended last year. To give you an idea of the
event, a list of the attendees from last year is attached below. The
planned format for this event will be pre-dinner drinks with all the VC
representatives. You will then have the opportunity to have dinner with 2
VC professionals and approximately 7of your MBA classmates (exact number to
depend on final confirmations). During dinner, you will rotate tables so
that you can meet with 2 more VC professionals in an intimate setting.

HOW DO I SIGN UP FOR THIS EVENT?
The cost for this event, which includes dinner, will be $25 per person*. Due
to limited space, invitations will be given on a first-come, first serve
basis (defined by submitting the check for $25) . We do not plan to
organize transport to the
restaurant, but highly recommend carpooling depending on your location.
*Please note that the cost of the event is to partially subsidize dinner,
which is also partly funded by your membership dues.

We would also ask that each attendee submit a short bio (no more than one
page please) to distribute to the VCs in advance. This will also help us to
match you with VCs who have similar interests/backgrounds at the event. This
bio should address what you feel is most relevant with regard to the 
following:
1. A bit of personal background (undergrad institution/major, industries
you've worked in, and anything else about your background you feel is
relevant)
2. Why you are interested in VC?
3. Do you have a particular industry or sector of interest?
4. Do you have a business plan that you want to pitch to a VC? If so, in
what industry/sector? (Again this is to help us place you at tables. You
probably don't want to be pitching your radical new b2b idea to a a VC
interested in biotech research.)

Please let us know by replying to this e-mail whether you would like to
attend this event. We will confirm your attendance once we receive payment
for $25. Please make your check out to 'UC Regents' and put it in Nitin
Chellaram's mailbox in the MBAA lounge (you will find the mailbox under
'Exchange Students').

We will need your $25 payment, your firm commitment to attend and your bio
(in Word format) by 16th October. Additional details will be sent out
following your confirmation for this event.

Thanks and best regards,
Your Haas EA Team - Nitin Chellaram, Todd Wehmann, Christine Mar
