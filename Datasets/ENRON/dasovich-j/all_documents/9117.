Dear fellow green marketer;
Has "green marketing" become a conflict of terms in California? It would
appear so.  I can only speak for myself when I say that the past few
years of work, money and time should not be so easily written off.

I have been sensing the feelings on Capital Hill and there are a number
of legislators very sympathetic to us.  If we can start speaking to one
another, there may exist an opportunity for support from the state for
a) our past efforts, and  b) new legislation to keep retail
deregulatrion alive (or resuscitate).  While we never a very cohesive,
unified group during deregulation, it would make sense to present
ourselves as a unified group at this juncture.

Please contact me and let me know if you have an interest in discussing
measures that we would wish the legislature to take on our behalf.
There's strength in numbers.

Rick Kohl
