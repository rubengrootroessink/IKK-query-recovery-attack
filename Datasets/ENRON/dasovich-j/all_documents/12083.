I think the meeting is on Wednesday, but if you can be there (Sacremento, I 
expect) you should.  As I mentioned in my voicemail, I think the meeting will 
not be particularly substantive;  more likely it is a photo op for the 
governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators.  Based on your 
message below, should we still plan to send somebody?  I still think we 
should if we can manage the legal risk.

Mike:  would you be able to attend as well?

As I indicated in my VM, I will be in LA early Tues morning. Would you like 
to talk about the isuues before your meeting--or would you like me to go?

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/
