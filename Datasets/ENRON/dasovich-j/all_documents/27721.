In advance of the CPUC's meeting June 19 when they will consider suspending 
direct access, we would like to send a letter from Ken Lay to the top 
businesses, CEOs and members of the Coalition for Energy Action urging them 
to weigh-in with the PUC.  AReM has already issued a media advisory alerting 
the press to the PUC meeting.  Please review the attached letter, and let me 
know if you have any comments or changes as soon as possible.  If we send 
something out, it will need to go out first thing Monday morning.

Thank you.
