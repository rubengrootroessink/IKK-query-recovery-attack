We are now finished with the Spring 2000 schedules. If you call InfoBEARS
at 510-642-9400, you should be able to access your spring schedule.
Alternatively, you can go to InfoBEARS via bearlink.berkeley.edu  If you
have problems, let me know. DISREGARD waitlist numbers in InfoBEARS. I will
send waitlist numbers tomorrow that are correct.

If you wish to make further modifications to your schedule, you may do so
beginning January 18, 2000.

Shawn
