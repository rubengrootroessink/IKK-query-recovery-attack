 Subject: survey technology







Thanks to the brilliance of our colleagues, we don't need my feeble cgi
programming skills after all; we can use the www.inetsurvey.com site to
host the survey and gather feedback. Now we just need to crystallize our
survey questions; I will take care of getting the survey set up on this
site.
Since 3 of us don't have class tonight, I am available to phone conference
between 6-8; alternatively I can meet anyone at school (same timeframe).

Jonathan
