Hi all,

I hope the Financial Times has been working with you to get the paper
delivered to you. For those of you who are still having trouble, I have
arranged for 20 papers a day to come to the Evening MBA Program office as a
work-around for the rest of the term.  We will keep a few days worth as
space allows.

Please follow a couple of ground rules so that this will work for everyone:
*Please be considerate and only take a paper if you are sure that you did
not receive one at home. Do  not take one just because you left yours at
home. If you want to review the paper at Haas before class, please use the
Web or the Long Library copies.
*In the event of a delivery problem, please call or e-mail the Financial
Times (see below), unless they have just told you that they cannot get the
paper to you. In this case, ask FT to mail the paper to you instead of
reluctantly trying to get a carrier to go to your house.
*Be patient if you come to the office and we have run out of papers. We
will try to increase the number of back-ups if necessary.
*When you come to the office to pick up a paper we will have a list for you
to record the missed delivery. Please help us to track the problems.

We received our first papers today and have last Friday's as well.

For contacting the Financial Times in the event of problems or address
changes, please ask for Gayle at:  FT Education [fteducation@etcdata.com]
or (800) 628-8088.

I hope this is helpful to those of you who have had severe problems with
the paper.

Have a great SHORT week and a happy Thanksgiving.

-Shawn
