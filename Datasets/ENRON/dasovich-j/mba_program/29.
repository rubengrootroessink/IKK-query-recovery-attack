Hi Everyone,

Below are notes on some courses/faculty that are new to the Evening MBA 
Program.

E264; Hi-Tech Marketing; Gadbois
Though I haven't seen Raymond Gadbois' teaching evaluations from other 
institutions, he is currently VP for Corporate Marketing at PeopleSoft.  
Previous to that he worked at Oracle as Marketing Director/Applications 
Division/Product Marketing Manager.  Mr. Gadbois has an MBA from UCLA, is a 
triathlete, and a pilot.

E259-2; Leading Change and Leveraging Culture; Chatman
Professor Jenny Chatman has taught both the day and evening core OB courses 
consistently earning above a 6.0.  Jenny has taught this elective course in 
the Executive Program numerous times and, again, gets consistently high 
ratings.  This course will likely be focusing on leadership skills, cases, 
and a fair amount of self-assessment in the leadership area.  

E296-5; European Financial Markets; Portes
Professor Richard Portes is visiting from London Business School.  He is an 
expert in the European Monetary Union and will spend considerable time on 
this topic.  The difference between this course and Professor Rich Lyons' 
International Finance course is that this course will focus on Europe, will 
be a bit more "macro", and study the institutional implications of the common 
currency.  Rich Lyons' course will be focusing more on international 
corporate finance relevant to multinational treasurers, CFO's, etc.  

E234; Corporate Finance; Das
Professor Das is visiting from Harvard this year and is currently teaching in 
the day program.  I have heard he's a great teacher and, as you might 
suspect, this course will be case-based.

E-296-3; Foundations of E-Business; Tachibana
We have detailed course outlines in the office for Tachibana's course.  Ken 
is a Haas MBA and has an MS in computer science and in engineer-economic 
systems from Stanford University.  He is Vice President of Services of 
RAINfinity, which is a startup focusing on scalability and reliability 
solutions for e-commerce.

BA295; Entrepreneurship
Although this is a day course and is offered on Fridays, history indicates 
that there will likely be room available for evening students if you have a 
flexible enough schedule.

BA296-6; International Business and Japan; Lincoln
This course offered on Mondays from 6:00 - 8:00 pm.  Course description now 
on the web.  Remember, for evening students this course can only be taken for 
one unit and counts as an academic one-unit course.

Please be sure to check the course descriptions on the web for each of these 
courses.

That's it!

Cheers,

Diane
