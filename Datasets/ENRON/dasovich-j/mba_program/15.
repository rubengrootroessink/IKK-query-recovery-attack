Can you really get help at the click of a button?  With our new improved
web based helpdesk system we are getting very close.  Haas Computing
Services (HCS) is pleased to announce the on-line Service Request
System.  Help is now just a click away at
http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu/ Book mark it now or, if on site, just
type the word =0F"helpdesk=0F" in the "Location" or "Address" field of your=
 web
browser and you'll be immediately transported to the Service Request System=
.

It couldn't be simpler=0F. no need for email delays, voice mail or busy
signals.  Phoning and email are now completely optional.  Any Haas faculty,
staff or student can now open and track his or her own service request
on-line.

As you launch the web site, you will need to sign in using your NT login
and password.  Once logged in, you can enter a request, check the status of
requests, update your helpdesk user profile, view the entire job queue, or
check the queue for your department.  The system is intuitive and is
described in detail on the homepage.  A brief summary of the request entry
process is included below.

What=0F's different about this helpdesk system is that it puts the customer=
 in
the driver's seat.  You will be able to submit a request, or follow up on a
request whenever you need to.  Your request will be captured in the
database in your own words so nothing is lost in translation.  The web
based system permits you to enter a request from anywhere you have access
to a browser, even if your email is not working.  It will permit you to see
the entire history of your service request with the assigned technician's
progress updates.  You can also see requests made by other customers in
your department or in the Haas community.

What remains the same with this new system is the same high quality service
provided by the support staff.  You will still have a single point of
contact for requesting technical services.  Both Haas Media Services and
the Marketing and Communications Web Team have joined HCS in using this
system to track their service requests.  Routine service requests will be
assigned to a support staff member within one business day of entry.  The
person to whom the request is assigned will still be contacting the
customer within one business day to initiate problem resolution.  Higher
priority requests will receive expedited service.

To take advantage of this new system, customers must be HCS account holders
(e.g. Haas students, faculty or staff) and have web browser capable of
running java scripts.  We recommend using either Netscape or Internet
Explorer version 4.0 and above.

Haas Computing Services staff have developed and tested a system that we
believe suits your needs.  We are pleased with the increased accessibility
and heightened direct customer-to-technician interaction this new on-line
system provides.  We trust that you, our customers will also find the
system useful and we welcome your feedback on how we can further improve
our service.

Entering a Request:

Enter "helpdesk" in your browsers URL box or go to
http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu .  Login using your NT Haas domain login
and password.  Click on "Enter Request".  The system will default to your
name, or you can enter the last name of another person for whom you need to
enter a request.  You'll need to enter a descriptive subject line and
provide some details regarding the kind of service you need.  After you
have finished entering your request be sure to click the submit button at
the bottom of the page.  Once you request is submitted it appears in the
helpdesk queue.  From there our helpdesk operator will assign your request
to the appropriate person.
