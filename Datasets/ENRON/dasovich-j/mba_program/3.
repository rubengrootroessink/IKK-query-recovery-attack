Evening MBAs,

Many of you will start registering tomorrow. If you can't register
tomorrow, remember that we are not a first-come first-served program...just
register by May 19. Please be sure to email me your ranked preferences (see
After You Register, below). Below is an overview of the registration
process for your reference:


REGISTERING: You can call Telebears at 510-642-3400 or go to Telebears via
bearlink.berkeley.edu. If you are unsure of your appointment time, you can
log on the web and it will tell you when your 24-hour period begins. After
your appointment time, open hours are Mon.-Fri. 7-8 a.m. and 7 p.m. to
midnight. Call us at 510-642-1406 if you need your PIN number.

You may sign up for as many classes as you like at this stage. We will
determine who can get into oversubscribed/full classes after May 19. You
will be given the opportunity to tell me which 'extra' courses to drop
after registration ends May 19. After this time, we will SERIOUSLY
discourage anyone from keeping more than 9 units. Keep in mind the policy
regarding materials costs, below.

Please keep in mind that we will not know which classes you get into until
the end of May.

CLASSES ON THE SAME DAY: The system will allow you to sign up for classes
that meet on the same day. Just follow the instructions to "OK" a time
conflict.

OVERSUBSCRIBED CLASSES/WAITLISTS: If a class is full, sign up ANYWAY. We
will allocate seats based on priority (number of semesters completed in the
Evening program). If all members of a cohort cannot get into a class, all
of the people with the same seniority will be randomly selected for the
class and waitlist.

Classes likely to be oversubscribed:  E248/Telecomm, E259-2/Leadership,
E262A/Product Mgmt, E295/Entrepreneurship. If you are signing up for one of
these classes, choose a back-up classes.

DAY CLASSES: You cannot do anything to register for day MBA classes until
August 28. This allows all of the day students to work with their
department to register. You may want to sign up for an Evening back-up now,
in case you don't get into the day class of your choice. We have a list of
day classes in the office for you to consider now.

AFTER YOU REGISTER: Email me to give me your rank-ordered preferences and
total number of desired units by MAY 19TH. For example:

1. E203, Finance
2. E248, Telecomm
3. E296, Supply Chain
             Total units: 6

After we are done registering May 19, we will determine which classes you
get into. We will look at your preferences and work with you to drop you
from the extra classes. Your choice of preferences does not AT ALL affect
which courses you get into.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR MATERIALS COSTS: After May 19, if we contact you to drop
courses and you decide to keep extras, you are responsible for paying for
READERS for the classes you drop later (if another student can't use the
materials). Effective this fall, if you are on a waitlist and you drop a
class because you got into a class for which you were waitlisted, then you
do not have to pay for the reader. This policy regarding readers has been
in place to minimize the costs to the program, incurred as people shop
around.

CLASS REMINDERS:
-First-year students register for one section of E203 unless you were
waived.
-Entrepreneurship REQUIRES the core Finance course (taken in a PRIOR
semester).
-E239/Investments meets TWO days per week some weeks--Monday/Wednesday
-E278/Ethics and E259-3/Managing... are academic one-unit courses

ONE-UNIT CLASSES: Register for one-units in our office beginning next
Monday. Please keep in mind that the classes are competitive and you are
more than likely to only get one. If you really need the units next fall,
be sure to sign up for a normal class. If you only want one unit, Ethics
and Managing in the Internet Age are much less competitive. REMEMBER: These
one-units are not first-come first-serve either, so just sign up next time
you are here BY MAY 5. Registration for these courses is not available in
TeleBEARS. Here are the dates again:

E296-1 Nonprofit Boards, all day
 September 16 and October 28, 2000.

E291B-1 Speaking for Management
              meets Sept. 16 and Oct. 7

E291B-2 Diversity Management
              Games meets Oct. 28 and Nov. 11



A NOTE REGARDING THE NEW REGISTRATION SYSTEM USED BY THE DAY PROGRAM:
You may have heard from day students that they are using a new registration
system to bid for fall classes this month. Day students have always used
some kind of system to preregister for classes, while Evening students were
using Telebears. The Haas school has made an investment in a computer
system known as Online Registrar to allow MBAs (including Evening students)
to enroll in classes and "avoid" the hassles of the campus Telebears
system. The day program is successfully testing the new system now and we
hope that we can make necessary modifications and upgrades so that we can
all be online in time for Spring 2001 registration. We'll keep you posted.

If you need any help registering, please don't hesitate to call our office
at 510-642-1406. I will send you updates as needed.
