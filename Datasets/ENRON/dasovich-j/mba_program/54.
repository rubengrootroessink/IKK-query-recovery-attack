What library/information services do you need or want to support your
studies here at Haas?

I'd like to make the EvMBA information services a lot better, but I need
your input.

Rather than conduct a survey that would limit your thinking, I'd like to
challenge you to provide me with constructive criticism of the current
EvMBA library services as well as directions and ideas for where to go
from here.

Please don't limit yourself to the 'library' box! Be creative! Surprise
me!

Thanks!

Sue the Librarian
