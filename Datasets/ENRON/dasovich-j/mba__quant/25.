Dear E204 students,
The attached file contains data for the NFL rating (NLP) problem #3
in the Team Project #1 Assignment that is being handed out this week.
Make sure you belong to a team.  I am collecting the teams and will
send an updated list after class on Thursday.
Problem #3 states that you can download the NFL data from the
E204 website but I was planning to hand the problems out next week
but decided to give you extra time for this one (two weeks).  It will take
a little extra time to get this on the web site, so please refer to the
attached file as needed.
