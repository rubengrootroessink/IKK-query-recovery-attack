Jeff:

Attached are the two memos:

1.  The quick draft of a memo on electricity supply/ demand in the West and
California
2.  A slightly revised memo on the San Diego prices.  The only change is in
a footnote pointing out that, even with the increases and without the
rebates, San Diego residential bills are below the national average.

Please confirm your receipt of this email -- I am not certain about your
current email address.

Regards,
Fred
