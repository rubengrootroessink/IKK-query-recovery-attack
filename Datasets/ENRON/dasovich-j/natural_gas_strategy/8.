Baldwin reports as follows:

I spoke to Jerry Miller, PG&E, today concerning the unbundled CTA storage
option now being drafted in the PG&E tariff. Here is a summary of what we
reviewed.

Assuming that the tariffs are approved and operational by October 1st, CTA
customers will have the option to elect "Alternate Resources" as prescribed
in the documentation now being reviewed and avoid any future allocated
storage service cost. As the new rates will separate out these storage cost
components, both the market and would be suppliers of alternate resources
will be able to determine the future PG&E cost avoidance. Under the current
rules, CTAs are required to inject certain quantities of gas into storage
during the storage injection season. These gas volumes would be purchased by
the Core Procurement Group pursuant to the formula contained in Schedule
G-CFS. To the extent that the customers have paid for storage services in
their bundled transportation rates upto this October election, PG&E offers
this perspective. Residential customers , whom generally are not currently
participating in the CTA program, will not receive any compensation for
bundled paid to date storage service components prior to their election.
Commercial customers whom are participating in the CTA program will not
receive any compensation for bundle storage cost prior to their election.
However, Jerry suggest that this is not a real issue owing to the fact
commercial customers do not pay for storage services until the winter period
commencing November.
