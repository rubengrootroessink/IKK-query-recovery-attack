 I agree Michael, its good. My only suggestion is to add a bullet
collecting
 the benefits for the core aggregation program, suggesting that the
 unbundling of balancing and storage and interstate capacity,
combined with
 the billing credits will help make the program more economically
viable and
 revive the opportunity to offer competitive benefits to core
customers.
