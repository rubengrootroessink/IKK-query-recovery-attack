Hi Everyone,

We only have FOUR (yes, 4!) people signed up for the Deans' Dinner on
Tuesday, February 29!  This is a great opportunity to talk with Dean Tyson
in a small informal environment, and I hope more of you will take advantage
of this opportunity.

Pleaes stop by the office to sign up!

Cheers,

Diane
