Thanks for the kind thought, Jeff.

I've done a bit of work on the plan you sent - take a look and see if 
suggestions make sense to you. I particularly would like to see agreement  
among the team on a way to prioritize projects (A, B, C or whatever) and also 
on using team consensus to determine same. As noted, Paul should be the final 
arbiter if the team gets "stuck."

After you review and finalize the plan, I'd like you to send final to Paul 
for his review and approval (or he may want to discuss with you) and a copy 
to me as well. I think the next step will be for you to present to your team 
mates to get their buy-off and help them understand the process. An obvious 
option is to share with and get the reactions of your team mates before you 
send to Paul. I leave that choice in your capable hands!

Let me know what goes on - and let me urge you to move on this quickly - I 
think Paul would appreciate your efforts. 

Best Regards.

Wow.  I'm speechless.  I wish you the very best of luck.  You've clearly got 
more important things to think about.  I'm rooting for you.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Glad to hear from you.

Frankly, it's been a hectic week out this way as well - you may have heard 
about the HR organization being restructured. Well, it has been and yours 
truly now has until July 31 to find a job inside the company or hit the 
bricks! Not a pleasant prospect. 

I knew Enron was going to be dynamic and ever changing but I'd hoped to get 6 
months or so under my belt before it started!

In any case, I'm going to be going through the company-provided 
resume'/interviewing/job search workshops starting today. It's a humbling 
experience and also a good dose of reality - I've been the one to organize 
and conduct these types of workshops for the last 3 organizations I worked 
for and now the shoes on the other foot!

I've rambled enough - glad you found my address and I'll be reading your plan 
within the next day or so - then I'll get back with you. 

Best Regards, Jeff and thanks for your follow through.
