A Message from your EES SAP Team,

As you already know, the legacy MSA system for EES is scheduled to go away on 
July 1, 2000 with the implementation of SAP.  In order to smooth the 
transition, the EES SAP Team will start distributing key information to every 
employee at EES through Lotus Notes.  With this in mind, attached below are 
several files that will help ease the transition to SAP.  Please keep this 
e-mail for future reference.

For these and other helpful documents, please visit the Apollo website ( 
http://sap.enron.com/ ) or our EES SAP website

with any changes going forward.
