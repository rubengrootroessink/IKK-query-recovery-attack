Subject: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets

Attached please find the Regulatory Risk-Responsibility Matrix developed by 
Jim Steffes.   One of the first steps in building the Regulatory Risk process 
is to establish responsibility for the current assets owned/managed by 
Enron.    The matrix provides a listing of assets that Jim has pulled 
together, however, there my be more that you know about.  Please indicate the 
person(s) who will manage the Regulatory Risk with each of these assets and 
if there are additional assets not noted on the matrix, please inform me of 
them by Friday, February 18.

Thanks and please don't hesitate to call with questions.
