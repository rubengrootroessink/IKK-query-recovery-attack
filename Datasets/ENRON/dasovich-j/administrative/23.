The attached updated table includes all the approved RCRs for CA, FERC and 
other.  It also includes all the RCRs I know about in the rest of the West.  
Joe/Mary/Paul/Leslie, please add others in if any are missing.

No other work is approved that requires use of outside resources.  Further, 
our attorneys have been advised that, even if a matter is approved, they have 
no authorization to spend money on that matter until they obtain approval 
from the Enron lead.

If we need outside resources not covered by these RCRs, you must prepare a 
new request and send it to me and Paul, we will submit it.  If we submit it 
by Wednesday, we are supposed to have an answer by Friday.  Emergency, 
same-day approvals are also possible (I have personal experience).  We have 
the best case for approval if we can somehow put a number on the commercial 
value of the work.  Let me know if you need a copy of the blank RCR form.

I continue to use the unfortunately garish color coding of yellow for FERC, 
blue for CPUC, and green for non-CA state matters.
