Effective, February, 25, 2000 all of the  (Friday) monthly department 
conference calls will be held at 10:30am cst instead of 9:00am cst..   The 
call in number of 1-800-283-1805 will remain the same.  

I do have a request, with Rick's group increasing in size the number of lines 
for my favorite number (1-800-283-1805) is limited.  My request is, within 
each office would you please gather as one big happy family and dial into the 
call (if/where possible) to help with the number of available lines.  If down 
the road I see the need for more lines I will have to change the number.    
Also, below is a list of the remaining calls for the year.

Thanks and please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.
