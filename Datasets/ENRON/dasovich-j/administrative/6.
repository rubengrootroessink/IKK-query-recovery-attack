Jeff,

Glad to hear from you.

Frankly, it's been a hectic week out this way as well - you may have heard 
about the HR organization being restructured. Well, it has been and yours 
truly now has until July 31 to find a job inside the company or hit the 
bricks! Not a pleasant prospect. 

I knew Enron was going to be dynamic and ever changing but I'd hoped to get 6 
months or so under my belt before it started!

In any case, I'm going to be going through the company-provided 
resume'/interviewing/job search workshops starting today. It's a humbling 
experience and also a good dose of reality - I've been the one to organize 
and conduct these types of workshops for the last 3 organizations I worked 
for and now the shoes on the other foot!

I've rambled enough - glad you found my address and I'll be reading your plan 
within the next day or so - then I'll get back with you. 

Best Regards, Jeff and thanks for your follow through.
