Michelle,
We have corrected Mr. Dasovich's tuition reimbursement to non-taxable.  Due 
to SAP configuration, the system will not deduct any taxes from his pay until 
the total is refunded.  Therefore, on his 8/31 paycheck, he will not have a 
tax deduction for FICA/SS/MED.

Thanks,
Andrea

Hi Andrea,

Jeff Dasovich (508152) received his latest tuition reimbursement on 7/31/00, 
unfortunately it was not supposed to be taxed.  A letter was sent with his 
tuition on 4/15/00 that was paid correctly - but I think Gwen forgot to send 
it with the July claim.   It is being required by his Managing Director, Rick 
Shapiro, and should therefore not be subject to income tax.  Can you please 
process a refund for the the taxes that were taken?  I will insure that we 
send the letter with all future claims.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on ext 36023.

Regards,
Michelle
