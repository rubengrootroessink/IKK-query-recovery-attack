Yes, I would like to be apart of any meeting that covers DG from the 
regulatory side.  My comments would most likely focus on the interconnection 
issues, rather than the who the competitors should or shouldn't be.

Subject: Developing Enron Position on DG Issues for Use in California

Please forward this along to anyone else whom you feel needs to be included.  

We recently discussed having a meeting in Houston to hammer out the Company's 
position on issues related to distributed generation.  Would be useful to 
have that meeting as soon as we can, since we'll need to let the California 
Commission know our position on the following issues by February 1st:

Utility participation in DG--should utilities participate?--(and implications 
of such on market power, interconnection, safety & reliability, rate design 
and cost allocation).
Whether net metering should be expanded and applied to all DG.
Consumer education about the availability of DG.  Is there a need for it?
Suggestions for outreach that state government could offer to local 
governments with the intent of helping locals streamline environmental review 
of DG.


In addition, we'll need to express our view on the following issues by March 
17th:

Should the utility be required to establish an unbundled distribution 
wheeling tariff?
Whether a DG selling "excess power" to the grid is a "public utility" in 
California.
Whether the CPUC or FERC has jurisdiction over sales of "excess power."
Does California need to establish scheduling and dispatch protocols to 
support DG sales of "excess power?"
What concerns, if any, should California have with respect to DG and the 
possibility of locational market power?
What should rates look like for standby charges, bypass charges, stranded 
costs?  Is there a role for PBR?

Is it possible to have the meeting next week?  I can be in Houston on 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

Best,
Jeff
