 <<Erin Brockovichrev3.doc>> 

Dear all, here is a proposed quid (separation of ownership of DG from 
dispatch) pro quo (discounts, exit fees, standby charges reasonable to DG).? 
Not intended to supplant? UC/CSU's excellent 8 points but to put some flesh 
on the bones of some of those points. Main idea is that if ORA et al receive 
support for separation of ownership from dispatch, we can be supportive of 
reasonable rates pertaining to DG.? Please comment.
