From discussions with PACAF, USARAK and the NAVFAC Contracting Officers, we 
are aware of the following procurements that are intended to be released as a 
multi-base effort with a single solicitation.  This supersedes my last 
transmission on this subject, because the Navy has just released a new RFI 
for a grouped series of bases in California.

 1.  Navy, Southwest. 

  a.  Pt Huneme/Pt Mugu were intended as the first procurement on a bundled 
basis, but they are on hold awaiting funding for Phase 2.  They need to do 
life cycle cost analysis,  system condition assessment, and inventory.  A 
draft RFP will be issued to industry for comment.  The final RFP, 
optimistically (according to the NAVFAC SWDiv Commander) could be out as 
early as this quarter.  Doug Powell, the Contracting Officer, says a more 
realistic date is April-May of 2000.  However, Ralph Torres, the NAVFAC 
Business Line Manager for this procurement, is attending a PACFLT meeting 
this month in Hawaii to try to hurry this up. 
  b.  A new RFI has just hit the street, due 15 Nov 99, for electrical, gas, 
water, and wastewater privatization at 5 USN locations in Southern 
California.  These are Naval Warfare Assessment Station, Corona, CA; Naval 
Air Station, Fallon, NV; Naval Air Station, Lemoore, CA; Naval Weapons 
Station, Seal Beach, CA (Main Station); and Naval Weapons Station, Seal 
Beach, CA (Detachment Fallbrook).    

 2.  Marines,Southwest.  

  a.  NAVFAC intends to combine 29 Palms, MCLB Barstow, MCAS Yuma and MCRD 
San Diego into one procurement.  We have responded to the RFI, as we have in 
the case of the Navy, 1.a, above.  NAVFAC has has funding for Phase 2 for 
Barstow and 29 Palms, but not for the other two yet.  The RFP is expected to 
hit the street in the April-May, 2000 time frame.

  b.  NAVFAC intends to combine Camp Pendleton, a large base in CA, with a 
small base used for mountain warfare training at Bridgeport, CA.  The 
combination is being made for funding lines and chain of command reasons.  
The real plum here is the very large Marine base at Pendleton.  The RFP  is 
currently scheduled for release April, 2000, but we think it will be a few 
months later to have the above 4-base procurement hit the street first.

 3.  Navy, Northwest.  NAVFAC intends to release virtually all their 
Northwest activities in a single solicitation.  This includes the following 
locations:

  -Naval Subase bangor
  -Camp Wesley Harris
  -Olalla Housing
  -Port Hadlock
  -Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport
  -Naval Station Bremerton
  -Naval Hospital Bremerton
  -Jackson Park Naval Houising
  -Naval Fuel Depot Manchester
  -Naval Station Everett
  -Naval Radio Station Jim Creek
  -MWR Pacific Beach
  -Naval Air Station Whidbey Island
  
EFSI was invited to present at their Industry forum in Seattle where this 
procurement was announced on 4 Aug 99.  An  RFI is out, with response due 15 
Nov 99.  The final RFP is scheduled to be released in Jan 01.

 4.  Joint Regional Privatization Project (JRUPP) Alaska.  This is an 
agreement with the USAF and the US Army to combine their facilities at 
Elmendorf AFB, Kulis ANG Base, the Army National Guard Base, and Ft 
Richardson all into a single procurement.  DESC is the project manager.  An 
RFI for these locations just hit the street.  Our retired friend, USAF COL 
Don Michael Bradford instigated this joint procurement, and is still a good 
source of information in the Pacific.  Procurement is being accelerated with 
the USAF catching up to where the Army is, so schedule for an RFP is 
currently unknown.  USAF RFIs have just been published.
