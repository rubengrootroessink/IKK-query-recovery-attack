Have you had a chance to take a cut at that transaction description for 
Edwards yet?  I would like to get it to them for their chop this week, if 
possible.  There has been a local storm of feces for employing outside 
counsel (Squeri) apparently without Ms. Sharp's approval.  I don't know what 
procedures Regulatory uses for outside counsel, but I have had to tell Jeff 
that I can't pitch in and pay for  a part of Joe any more.  My boss got his 
tail twisted, and now apparently has to respond to Pai/White on the matter.  
Also, let's please discuss the strategic status of Edwards and how to go 
forward.  Since Bear Trap yesterday, Edwards has been removed from the list 
of authorized projects to pursue because it does not meet the TVC 
threshhold.  However, I think its strategic value is such that we should not 
cavalierly cast it aside.  What do you think?

Please give me a call.  I tried to contact you, but, alas, your line is as 
busy as usual.
