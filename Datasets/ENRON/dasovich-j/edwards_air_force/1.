(See attached file: ~0064565edwards.doc)

Here is our draft of the transaction description for the privatization of
the electrical distribution system at Edwards AFB.  Please edit to ensure
that the description matches what Edwards intends to do and email to me.
We will use your edited version to characterize the transaction to the
CPUC.

Thanks,
Bill Gang
