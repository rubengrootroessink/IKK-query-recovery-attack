Wattage Monitor Service Teams Help Lower Electric Bills 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- As summer temperatures continue to
heat up and electricity prices do the same, Wattage Monitor Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: WMON) offers consumers an escape by locating a
competitive supplier that can lower their bills.
    Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric can choose to buy electric power
from 14 other companies besides their regulated utility.  Most of these
competing companies allow Wattage Monitor system users to switch to their
service automatically.  And there are savings to be had.  In some cases
competing suppliers are offering as much as $120 per year in savings or more.
    "With the surge in power prices has come great interest in saving on
electric bills," notes Gerald R. Alderson, President of Wattage Monitor.  "In
response we have expanded our service, sent consumer service teams to
San Diego to help consumers choose a supplier and have made it easier to
switch on-line at http://www.wattagemonitor.com or through our toll-free 
service
reached by calling 1-888-WATTAGE," he added.
    The California electricity market is in a significant transition from a
regulated market to a competitive one.  But like telephone long-distance
service, a consumer must switch to a competing supplier to lower their bill.
As consumers increasingly become aware that they have a choice and switch,
competition is expected to produce even greater savings.  But consumers must
act to realize the savings available.
    Wattage Monitor is a nationwide, free to consumers service that offers
residential and commercial electric consumers their specific electric service
options through its website http://www.wattagemonitor.com or its toll-free 
service
888-WATTAGE.  Consumers may also easily and conveniently enroll with the
supplier of their choice.  Competing electric suppliers' rates and services
are posted by zip code.  Simple, straightforward, comparative and all in one
place.
