CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Stumbling points in California's deregulated power 
markets this summer need to be explored urgently to avoid nationwide 
electricity restructuring problems, a key U.S federal regulator said Tuesday. 
"There is a crisis of confidence in our electricity markets," said Bill 
Massey, a commissioner with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
addressing a Chicago conference. 
There is concern that California's early restructuring problems will throw 
into disarray deregulation progress in other states.

"As California goes, so goes the country," Massey said. 
Heat waves have sparked strong demand in California this summer, and a lack 
of adequate power supplies have led to soaring wholesale power prices. 
Customers in San Diego have been exposed to these price surges, and many have 
seen retail rates more than double.
