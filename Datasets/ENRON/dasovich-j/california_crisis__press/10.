CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Most state residents will see a 5 percent drop in 
electricity rates next month, the first step toward a 15.5 percent decrease, 
under a plan approved Tuesday by state utility regulators. 
The Public Utilities Commission hasn't yet issued a written order, but voted 
unanimously to approve an amended plan that conforms with the wide-ranging 
deregulation bill the Legislature passed this year. 
?


Public Service Company President Gary Long said if there are no appeals, and 
no problems in the details of the written order, customers should be seeing a 
16 percent rate drop by the end of the year. 
Part of that reduction will be a 5 percent cut by Oct. 1. 
Most New Hampshire homeowners would save about $13 off a typical monthly 
electric bill under a 15.5 percent rate decrease. 
Granite State Electric and the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative already 
have restructured themselves to allow their combined 100,000 customers to buy 
power from other companies.
