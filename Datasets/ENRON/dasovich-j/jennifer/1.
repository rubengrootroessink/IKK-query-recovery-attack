Jeff 

Again, here is PG&E trying to shoe horn us on this tap vs. bus connection 
issue.  If you are not familiar with this issue, EES elected to utilize the 
single tap termination @ the PG&E Bullard Substation in our proposal to 
CSUF.  This single tap option was provided to us by PG&E in their 
Informational Review.  PG&E itemized this cost in the Informational Review at 
$178,000 and this the figure we used.  

During past meetings, PG&E has stated that this tap option is no loger 
availabele.  PG&E has stated that it is reserved for future expansion and we 
must go with a bus connection.  Of course going with a bus connection adds 
cost to the scope of work that PG&E will provide at the Bullard Sub.  My 
question is there any avenue to contest this?  Would PG&E have a design in 
place or have notified the PUC of their intentions to conduct this work?  If 
you could give me some suggestions, I would appreciate it.  Or your 
thoughts.  I just do not want to yield to PG&E if there is something I can 
do.  

Thanks

Richard/Rob,

In this email I was requesting to confirm the tap/4 terminal vs buss issue.
Any progress?

Thanks!
