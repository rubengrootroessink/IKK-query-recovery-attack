Hi Jeff, Aiaz,

Attached is my roommates ebay capstone project I mentioned, figured it would 
give us a good
background for the case...it was a last minute project (as i can attest to by 
the NO sleep I got
from being in the room next to him the night before the due date :)
so it's a little rough, but good "leisure reading" :)

I don't have Anil's email, so could one of you please forward to him?
Thanks,
Kelly,
still cracking the whip on this project :)
