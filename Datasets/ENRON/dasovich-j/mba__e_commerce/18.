Hi guys,

A couple of announcements (in addition to what Amir already said):

- Additional Readings (The Bear Stearn Report on B2B Marketplaces)
This report is from Sept of 1999 and it is 196 pages long.
Hints:
1) You do not need to read 200 pages for next class
2) Do not print this report!!! (leave some trees for next year)
3) Browse the first 75 pages (easy read) in addition to regular class
readings

- As all of you now, the Onsale case is due next Monday

- Special Topics for today's class:
1) ebusiness and Asia market
2) ebusiness technology overview (hi-level understanding of key technology
layers).

See you all tonight,
