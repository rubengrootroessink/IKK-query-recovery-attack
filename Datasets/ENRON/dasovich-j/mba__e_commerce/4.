 OK this has started out as one heck of a day, but first here's my draft.

Now the competitive section needs to be beefed up.  Sama: I did not have an 
electronic copy of the grid we worked on, and it didn't make sense to call 
you at 2.00 a.m. in the morning.

Versata's e-mail is very erratic right now, from dealing with clones of the 
Love virus.

I got stuck for 45 minutes in BART this morning, just before we pulled into 
19th street, Oakland.

Things to do:

1. Sama, we need to merge our sections
2. Sama, can you send me the competitive grid. I'll see if I can work that in 
before class, if not it'll have to be done either during or after class 
tonight.
3. Exec summary of our section
4. My stuff is 4 pages single spaced right now, and some of the competitive 
stuff has yet to get in.  Add to that the three scenarios we did (and the 
additions from yesterday), that makes another 3 pages, plus the SWOT makes 
another 4? We have some serious precis writing to do.

Later...

Aiaz
