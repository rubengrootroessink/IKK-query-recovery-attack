Jeff,

I was talking with my boss and the VP of BizDev at my company, and mentioned
Casbah and Perfect, briefly mentioning what they did.  They seemed excited
by the idea and want to talk with the guys at Perfect.  Of course, I did not
tell them any more than is already published on Casbah's website, and I made
it clear to them that I had signed an NDA.  Do you think it would be OK if
my VP BizDev called the guys @ Perfect to discuss a potential alliance?

Also we need to let Perfect know that I'm working at Versata, and make sure
that there is no conflict of interest.

Let me know your thoughts ASAP.

Aiaz

Ok,  I just got a note from Mike who said he'd like to meet for lunch and
an afternoon meeting next week.  Does that work for folks?  Say, Friday?
Please advise.

Unfortunately, I was sort of hoping to meet on Sunday, but Saturday may
work.

Are you guys in class tonite?  If so, let's talk then.

Lets get things started with a conference call to Cheryl.  This will ensure
that we don't take up too much of Mike's time.

Also, what time are we planning to meet this weekend ? How about 11 am
Saturday? Alternatively, we could split it up with Kelly and I meeting in
Berkeley, and you guys hooking up in the city.  I cannot do Sunday, so let
me know if Saturday works.  Maybe we can do the call on Saturday, in which
case we have to be prepared with a set of questions.

FYI.  Should we try to do a call with Cheryl this week, or shoot for Mike
when
he gets back on the 10th?  I've sneaking suspicion things will be more
productive with Mike.  Whatever you folks would like to do's fine with me.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Sorry I missed you as well.  Unfortunately, I am currently out of the
office...yet again...on a personal vacation....in Kauai..the islands send
their greetings. My business trip to Palm Springs was great, but I was only
in the office for a couple of days before my vacation started.

I'll be back in the office April 10.  If you want to chat sooner than the
10th and check out our demo, you can give Cherryl Ricketts a call and she
should be able to help you out.  I don't remember her direct number, so you
can call our general number 650-858-1000 and ask for her.  Otherwise, I'll
be happy to chat as soon as I return to the office on the 10th.

Take care,

Mike D.

Greetings Mike:  Hope your travels were good.  Any chance of getting
together in person or by phone this week?   Also, we were interested in
mucking around with the demo.  I'm assuming we'd need to do that in your
offices, rather than remotely.  Would it be possible to play around with
the demo?  Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff
