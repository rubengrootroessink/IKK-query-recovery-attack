Jeff,

Sorry for the delay in responding.

As for initiatives.  I have a VERY tentative product roadmap that plots the
Perfect course for the next 12-18 months.  Here's what I've come up with so
far.

Keep in mind that anything past V2.0 is a pure WAG.  Also, if you have any
questions about any of the specific features, just let me know and I'll try
to explain.

Also keep in mind that the name so companies mentioned for the integration
pieces is only tentative.  These are companies we are working with but have
NOT finalized any formal agreements as yet.

Regards,

Mike D.

Hi Mike:

Hope all is well.  The PDR you sent us several weeks ago is very
informative, but a tad unwieldy.  Do you have anything that focuses in on

1) what the 3-5 major products/initiatives are that you're currently
working on (e.g., "develop capability to integrate ERP and supply chain
management software")
2) what the 3-5 major products/initiatvies are that you'd like to make
happen a little further down the road (e.g., 6-12 months from now)?
3) a description of those products/initiatives
4) the plan to execute on those products/initiatives?

Thanks alot.  And have a great weekend.

Best,
Jeff
