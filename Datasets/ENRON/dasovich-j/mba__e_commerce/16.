What's up for the meeting?? Someone let me know, I won't have access to my 
email after 3:30.
Cell # is:  510-410-4433.
I'd prefer meeting on Sunday vs. Saturday...but either one would work if 
necessary.
Both days, prefer after 10:30am.
Aiaz - if we meet on Saturday, I'd be driving up from the south bay, so I 
wouldn't be able to give
you a ride...
