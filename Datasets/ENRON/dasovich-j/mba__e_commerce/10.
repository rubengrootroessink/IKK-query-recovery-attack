Hi guys,

As Amir mentioned in class, the last case is Commerce One(already posted).
It is a case developed by Amir and myself with a lot of help from Commerce
One's management. The case is still a DRAFT version because I would like to
get feedback from all of you as you read it and think about the questions
asked.

As you write the last case assignment, please reply to this message
answering the questions below.  Please be as honest as possible (won't
affect grade in any way) and compare this case with other good cases that
you have had in other MBA courses.  Thanks.

How was the case overall? (1 Bad, 5 Excellent)
Did it provide enough info?
or was it too much irrelevant info?
Did you had to go an look up more info?
Too much product explanations?
Is everything clear?
What can we take out?
What ca we add?
Comments?

Your GSI,
