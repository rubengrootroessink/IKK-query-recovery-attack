Hi Evening MBA students,

The University Health Services Office just informed us that the $253 Health 
Insurance Waiver credits will be reflected on September billing statements.

So, if you submitted a health insurance waiver on time, you don't have to 
pay the $253 that you see on your August statement and you won't be charged 
a late fee because of it.

Thanks,
TJ
