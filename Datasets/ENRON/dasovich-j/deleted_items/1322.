California Regulators Claim Structural Separation Action Caused Electrical =

TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Jul 31, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- A former member of the C=
alifornia Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and his former chief of staff t=
estified today that the electric energy crisis plaguing their state can be =
directly traced back to structural separation actions the Commission took y=
ears earlier. During day two of a Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) s=
tructural separation workshop they warned that granting the AT&T request to=
 break up BellSouth into wholesale and retail companies would be leading Fl=
orida consumers down that same path. G. Mitchell Wilk and Carl Danner told =
the PSC today that the California Commission's concerns about possible util=
ity generation market power led it to force utilities to sell off fossil fu=
el generating plants. This action ultimately resulted in rolling black outs=
 and forced utilities and ultimately the State to buy that power back at hi=
gher prices. "Florida can learn through California's mistakes. A breakup wi=
ll intensify a contradiction between cost-based wholesale prices and subsid=
ized retail rates. Since retail processes must follow wholesale costs, a br=
eakup will accelerate an end to forced subsidies," said former PUC Commissi=
oner Wilk. "The costs of the breakup are large and will affect all customer=
s. By contrast, the alleged benefits are entirely speculative, and have bee=
n forcefully disputed." Danner also told Florida Commissioners that a break=
up would be costly and difficult to reverse. "The public wants convenience =
and simplicity, but will get more confusion, complexity and cost," said Dan=
ner. "Competitors will see this as one more means to use the regulatory pro=
cess against one another by trying to plunge the PSC into micro-management.=
 All this new industry cost will be paid for by consumers and will subtract=
 from Florida's economy." Wilk added that a true debacle in what is now an =
efficient and evolving telecommunications network might occur through struc=
tural separation actions. "California failed by seeking to deregulate elect=
ricity generation, while using a highly-regulatory approach to do so," said=
 Wilk. "The breakup proposal here in Florida would attempt the same by adop=
ting highly intrusive regulation, at a time when there is robust competitio=
n in the state. It would be economically counterproductive for the consumer=
s and impede on the evolution of technology in Florida." CONTACT: BellSouth=
