I will be happy to cover for Alan and yourself.  The week of August 13, I'll be in the office on Monday and Friday, in Portland Tues-Thurs.  The following week I am planning on being in Portland on Monday and Tuesday and in the office on Wednesday and in Vancouver on Thursday and Friday  (WSCC WMIC meeting).

Kind Regards,

Dave

I would like to distribute this when I leave on vacation on Saturday 11 Aug.  I have implicated you as my backup.  Please let me know if you cannot serve, espcially if you too will be on vacation.

Alan
