Cmmr. Bilas issued an alternate yesterday on the suspension of direct
access.  The draft is for informational purposes only -- no comments are
allowed.

Essentially the draft updates his alternate from June.  It does not suspend
direct access but opens a proceeding addressing issues surrounding the
suspension. The alternate contains some good language slamming DWR and its
potentially high price contracts.

I do not have an electronic version of the  alternate.  Let me know if you
want a faxed copy.
