Dear Member of the Haas Community:

 Due to the discovery of a suspicious substance at the Haas School, the entire  
 Haas School complex has been closed by order of the police and fire 
 departments. The complex will remain closed all day and evening, Wednesday 
 October 17, 2001. We anticipate the School will be open tomorrow, but you may 
 wish to check before coming in tomorrow.

 Sincerely,

 Benjamin E. Hermalin
 Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
 (acting on behalf of the Deans Office)
