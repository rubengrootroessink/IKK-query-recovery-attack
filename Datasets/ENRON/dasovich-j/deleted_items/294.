Hi ARM,
 
Attached are my edits to Dan's first draft.  I have confined them to
re-writing the proposal, I think the procedural and lead in stuff is
very good.  I think we have some difficult choices to make on the
proposal itself so that we can give Dan more direction.  In addition,
after we settle on the proposal itself, the document needs some
salespersonship:  why the proposal is a good thing and should be
supported by the commissioners.
