>Dear Evening MBA students,
>
>We enjoyed providing you with an overview of the Haas Alumni Network and 
>our online services at our pizza presentations in mid-November.  Some of 
>you were unable to attend our session because your class was not held on 
>that Thursday night and we tried to find a suitable classroom/presentation 
>space for a session this week, but there is nothing available during your 
>7:30 p.m. break.  So, we have decided that we will hold more information 
>sessions about the Haas Alumni Network next semester in order to 
>accommodate your needs.
>
>In the meantime, if you have any questions, please consult the Haas Alumni 
>Network brochure you received in your mailbox earlier this semester, visit 
>our website (http://www.haas.berkeley.edu) for detailed overviews and 
>updates, or contact my office at 510-642-7790 for assistance with 
>registration to the Online Community.
>
>Good luck with your final projects and exams.
