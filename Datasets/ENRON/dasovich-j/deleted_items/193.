Hmm - I vaguely remember you making a similar slip last year. Are you sure
you are licensed to operate your mail program?

Hope your summer has been good and that the Mendocino ranch is coming
along
splendidly. Trust you are on the short list to assume the leadership
position
over there, though I hope you don't have to move to Houston!

See you in a week or so.

Rgds
Jonathan
