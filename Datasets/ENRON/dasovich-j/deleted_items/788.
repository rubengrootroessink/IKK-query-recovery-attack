VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Is it 1999? If you looked at Tuesday's fundings you might think so as 25 companies pulled in almost $300 million. Cogent Communications, a high-speed ISP, raised $62 million in a Series C and also landed an additional $99 million credit facility. The majority of the company's previous investors participated in the equity round including Broadview Capital Partners, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Oak Investment Partners. 

It was also a big day for CENiX, a designer and manufacturer of high-speed optoelectronic interfaces, which raised $52 million in a combination of second round equity and debt financing. The company raised $34 in equity from previous investors including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Dongah Elecomm, and Cisco.

Another startup that came in with a big early-round was Avaki, which raised $10 million in the second tranche of its Series A, capping the round at $16 million. The developer of distributed computing technology for enterprises got first-round funding from Polaris Venture Partners, General Catalyst, and Sofinnova. Post-money valuation was $25 million.

Meanwhile there was a strong showing in private equity as two firms closed over-subscribed funds. Berkshire Partners said it has closed Fund VI with $1.7 billion, about $450 million above its target. And the Riverside Company closed its third fund at $413 million, 65% ahead of its goal. The secret to their success? Both firms will concentrate on buyouts and other private equity deals and avoid venture capital investments. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Rethink, Rebuild, Rebound

This is the worst downturn ever to hit Silicon Valley,
but it's hardly the first. So VentureWire is convening
a summit conference of CEOs, COOs, CFOs, and others
who've lead venture-backed companies through such times
before. We've chosen them for their years of experience
and for their ability to share it as coaches, mentors,
board members, and friends. Join us for an intense day
of guidance an inspiration from those who've been
through boom and bust and boom again.

Healthcare Outlook: Biotechnology  Pharmaceuticals:
development, delivery and distribution

Tremendous competition exists to find the new technology
that will identify new drug targets. Bioinformatics
companies that can bring precision to the R&D process,
but yet, may never be profitable. An expensive and
pitfall ridden drug approval  process.  A complex
business landscape created by the mergers of giant,
multinational pharmaceutical companies and upstart
biotech ventures. In the span of one day Healthcare
Outlook will address these issues and look at the
business plans of 50 private companies that promise
to innovate an industry. Industry executives, leading
academics and venture capitalists will meet to lend
perspective and point out opportunities along the
complicated life cycle of developing a drug.
