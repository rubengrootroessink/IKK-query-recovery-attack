If you end up in San Francisco.......

Amy and I are planning to meet you all for drinks at Kell's.  Then we're going to Cobb's Comedy Club for the 8pm show.   Will Durst is the headliner - a current events/political humorist.  We'd love to share a laugh with you all!  Feel free to join us.  You can reserve tickets ($13) at : <http://www.cobbscomedy.com/>

See you Friday!
Tina

Hello everyone,

If you're in San Francisco this Friday, come join Enlai, Rolf, Gerry and 
myself at Kell's for a drink.  We plan to meet there at 6, and everyone is 
welcome!  I know it may be tough to choose between Kell's in the City and 
Gordon Biersch in Palo Alto, so just let your Friday afternoon location make 
the choice for you.

Kell's Irish Restaurant & Bar is located at 530 Jackson St.  The cross street 
is Columbus and their phone number if 415-955-1916.

Hope you can make it.

Steve
