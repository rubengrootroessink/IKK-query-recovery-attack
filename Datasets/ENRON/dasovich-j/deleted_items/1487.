MARKETS HOLD MARGINAL GAINS

U.S. equities are higher midday amid a lack of substantial 
market-moving equity or economic news. Chip stocks like Advanced 
Micro Devices (AMD,16.34,f2) are helping to pace the advancers 
while the economic slate is empty today. U.S. Treasuries and 
European markets are higher.

As of 11:48 a.m. EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 
0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite Index is 0.8% higher. The S&P 
500 Index is up 0.5%. Semiconductor and utility shares are 
pacing the advancers while oil and construction issues are 
leading the decliners.

Semiconductor issues are higher as a Merrill Lynch analyst 
raised 4Q earnings estimates for Advanced Micro Devices to a 
loss of $0.15 per share from a loss of $0.23 per share, citing 
better-than-expected demand for the Athlon processor. Atmel 
(ATML,7.35,f1) is also trading higher after an AG Edwards 
analyst raised his rating on the stock from buy to strong buy.

Shares of TMP Worldwide (TMPW,44,f1) are higher after the 
provider of the popular Monster.com web site reported that it 
would not increase its bid for competitor HotJobs.com 
(HOTJ,10.36,f1), saying it had offered "full and fair value" for 
the entity. On Monday, HotJobs said that it would accept 
Yahoo!'s (YHOO,17.75,f1) $436 million competing offer if TMP did 
not increase its proposal, which has shrunk since June given 
declines in the company's stock.

Apple Computer (AAPL,22,f1) is up slightly following news that 
it expects to incur a fiscal 2002 loss at its retail stores, 
contrary to previous forecasts, citing the slowdown in the U.S. 
economy and PC market, exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. In 
an SEC filing, the California-based computer maker also stated 
it plans capital expenditures for 2002 of $200 million.

Following yesterday's positive Internet-related news, Amazon.com 
(AMZN,10.96,f1) is benefiting from a report that customers at 
its web sites ordered 37.9 million items during the holiday 
season as of Dec. 21, including over 10 million orders at sites 
outside the U.S.

----------------------------------------------------------------

TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY

U.S. Treasury prices are higher toward the long-end ahead of the 
record $23 billion 2-year note auction. Friday's economic plate 
is full as initial jobless claims, originally scheduled for 
release this morning, will be released tomorrow. In addition, 
consumer confidence figures, the Chicago Purchasing Managers' 
Index, new and existing home sales, and durable goods orders 
will be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------

WORLD MARKETS

European markets are higher with the Bloomberg European 500 
index up 1.3% as of 11:48 a.m. EST, led by manufacturing and 
auto shares. In economic news, French business confidence rose 
to 90.0 in December, higher than the 89.5 estimate per Bloomberg 
and November's 89.0 reading. On the corporate front, Nestle SA 
(NSRGY,52,f1) paid $641 million to General Mills (GIS,52,f2) in 
a joint venture giving it the rights to Haagen-Dazs in the U.S. 
and Canada. The euro is trading higher versus the U.S. dollar. 
Despite overnight gains in European oil-related issues, crude is 
trading lower in the U.S. ahead of tomorrow's expected 1.5 
million barrel per day production cut by OPEC.
