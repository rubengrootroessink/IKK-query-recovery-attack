Please respond to Jeff,

They are working on amendments for SBX 1.  Regarding the governance bills,
speculation is that they working with the Administration to determine
exactly who should have oversight.  The Migden bill is problematic for the
Senate Committee because they are not inclined to give oversight to an
agency which can be overridden by the Feds.  The Speier bill is more
feasible for their purposes, except that it directs the CPUC and not Freeman
which could be a problem if they want to create a new super-agency.
