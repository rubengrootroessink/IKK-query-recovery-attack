> Subject:	DAC meeting recap, action items and proposals
> 
> Thanks to everyone who joined us this morning in the Capitol - we had a
> very productive meeting. My apologies to those of you who called in but
> were unable to hear everyone. Tomorrow's noon conference call will not
> have that problem because we will all be calling in. To recap for you and
> anyone else who missed the meeting, here's a brief summary of actions we
> decided to take in the next week:
> 
> In short, we agreed that maintaining DA requires us to go directly to the
> people who are planning to take it away, namely, Loretta Lynch and Phil
> Angelides. Before the August 23 PUC meeting we need to convince the PUC
> and the Treasurer that 1) there is a way to maintain retail choice that
> will not impede bond sales and reasonable bond ratings, and 2) that the
> DAC is willing to work with both offices to find that solution. 
> 
> There are 5 action items we must complete before the PUC meets on August
> 23:
> 
> 1. Draft a letter for the PUC, Angelides and the Governor that discusses
> what principles the DAC is willing to support as we work toward a solution
> that includes DA  - Edelman drafted, awaiting DAC approval.
> 
> 2. Submit a filing to the PUC by this Friday that includes language from
> Enron's PUC proposal (discussed in today's meeting and attached below) -
> AReM counsel to draft and submit.
> 
> 3. Send letters to the PUC in support of AReM filing  - DAC members that
> are non-traditional PUC filers but support AReM's filing should do this.
> 
> 4. Set up a preliminary meeting with a few DAC lobbyists and a top
> Angelides staffer - Dominic Dimare.
> 
> 5. Set up meeting with Angelides, Allen Zaremberg  and DAC members -
> Dominic Dimare.
> 
> At the request of a number of DAC members, we have set up a conference
> call for tomorrow to regroup and get a status report on these 5
> deliverables, with specific emphasis on revising/approving the letter,
> legislative next steps and brainstorming potential PR tactics.
> 
> The dial-in information is as follows:
> 
> Date: 		Thursday, August 9
> Time: 		Noon - 1:00 pm 
> Dial-In #:	505)766-5458            
> Code: 		657648
> 
> Let me or Tracy know if you have any questions. EM.
