Today's Elec Power Daily says that EPSA is coming out with a study on the reduced prices to endusers from open access.  Will whoever gets it send it to this group?

Also, couple other items that may be of interest.  The RTO West order (p. 23) states that the Commission does not require a cost/benefit analysis for RTOs, but does not preclude one.  Maybe the EPSA doc will be helpful for this.

Also, the Commission in the RTO West order states that an RTO needs to reflect "least cost planning" and recognize how planning and expansion will consider both wires and non-wires solutions in the decisionmaking process (p. 14).  Mike Roan gives a good discussion of how he has walked TOs through why the RTO operator needs information and control to do a good job and make the best decision (and this order requires the "least cost", ie, that control area black boxes won't get us there.)  MIKE, can you respond to this group with your argument?  THANKS
