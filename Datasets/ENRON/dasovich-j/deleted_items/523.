The attached indicates that UC/CSU are still not fully back to DA.  Does it make sense to try and get their help in making sure that the legislation does not limit their return to DA?  What is our current relationship with that customer?   

Also, does anyone have any problems with Govt Affairs using this information when we are asking for "clarification" on the July 12 date?  It may be helpful to highlight for the key legislative members exactly who they are hurting with their decisions.

Thanks,

Jim
