Subject: MOU - Update


The following are some of the proposed amendments to SBX2 78, in
concept.
The amendments were developed by the Administration and Assembly
Democratic
leadership and have not been finalized, nor have they been run past the
Senate in full detail.  It is unlikely that the Assembly will take the
bill
up this week.

Direct Access: SBX2 78 will contain the final DA provisions from ABX2 82
which are located in Water Code Section 80110.  The amendments, in
short,
provide that customers may switch during open enrollment periods
provided
that there is enough head room and in proportion to the customer class.
The
Assembly has apparently convinced the Treasurer that DA can exist
provided
there are non-bypassable charges and specified exit fees.

Threshold: The payment threshold will be lowered to 20 kw for 100% of
the
undercollection despite the Senate's objections.  Lowering the threshold
to
20 kw will probably force some of the liberal Democrats off the bill but
will bring even more of the moderate Democrats on to the bill.

Tax Refund: SCE will keep the $400 million projected tax refund and not
have
that amount applied towards the bonding amount.

Easements: The easements are currently in the bill, however, they may
need
to come out in order to secure moderate Democratic votes.

Renewable Portfolio Standard:  The RPS from ABX2 82 will be included in
SBX2
78.
