Hey Jeff.   I had an interesting conversation this week with Jason Kreizenbeck from Micron about their frustration with Pacificorp, especially in Utah.   I recall that you had a different contact there, and I also seem to recall that they were a company that you and/or Karen had worked well with on the California crisis.  I'm thinking there may be some way to use them to help us on the RTO issues.  Could you give me a call with your thoughts on Micron?  Thanks.  #612-339-4599
