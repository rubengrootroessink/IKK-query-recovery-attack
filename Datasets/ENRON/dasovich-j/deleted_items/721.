Wind Market Power 

As strong winds blew in from the west on October 24th, Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest retail wind purchases in America's history to a large crowd of excited onlookers gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms. 
 
Amidst cheers and applause, Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind. The Penn Quakers are buying 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) - the output of five turbines or the equivalent of 5 percent of its electricity - from the Community Energy-Exelon Power Team's 15 MW and 9 MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset Township. 
 
With these turbines only just beginning to turn, multiple conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet retail consumer demand for wind energy. All those standing on the reclaimed mine land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power and the power of the retail marketplace.
 
Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring Nittany Lions of Penn State University. Penn State University is purchasing more than 13 million kWh, the production of three turbines, from Community Energy. For a land grant university, it's hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy farm.
 
In third place is Carnegie Mellon University, which created crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser, acquiring 4.8 million kWh. Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving, Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next year.
 
Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle, with purchases of about 4 million and 3 million kWh respectively. 
 
We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples. If you are interested in buying wind energy, contact Community Energy at www.newwindenergy.com <http://www.newwindenergy.com>. 
 
In fact, if just 660 institutions buy at least the output of one large wind turbine, Pennsylvania's retail consumers can insure that 1,000 MW of new wind energy are built and operating. By harnessing the power of the retail market to wind power development, that goal is very achievable. 
 
Though not in the top five, the Environmental Protection Agency, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia have all also made major purchases. Every one of these purchasers understands the price of wind energy, but more importantly, they understand its environmental, public health, and energy security value, showing that Oscar Wilde wasn't right about everyone when he said "nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."
 
Stunningly, 75 percent of the wind power from these two wind farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind 1.5 MW machines. 
 
These turbines, which make 11-20 full revolutions per minute, are the largest manufactured in the United States, and their blades are longer than previously used to be more efficient in the moderate-but-steady wind at these locations. All told, they will generate enough electricity for 8,000 homes, or about 63 million kWh of electricity - with no soot, mercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or sulfur dioxide. In contrast, typical system power in this region would emit about 75 million pounds of carbon dioxide, 568,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, and 177,000 pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to provide the same amount of electricity.  
 
But aside from the important environmental benefits, the wind projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset counties. Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms, with the owners receiving $3,000 to $4,000 for each tower erected on their land, which they continue to farm. Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on reclaimed strip and deep mines. Construction of the two wind farms required about 40 labor years of employment and will require about four full-time equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites. The sites generate local property taxes and, if yesterday's dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication, at least a modest tourist industry! 
 
This was all made possible by a great project team and every member deserves a hearty "well done." Although construction only took about 4? months, project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about two years ago. Zilkha Renewable Energy, Atlantic's development partner, provided project financing, as did The Reinvestment Fund's Sustainable Development Fund, with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others. Exelon Power Team is the wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers.  
 
On a sad note, Nick Humber, an Enron Wind employee who was instrumental in moving the projects to fruition, died when his hijacked plane crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Another plane that crashed in Somerset County was only about 15 miles from the wind farm. Nick's contribution to the project leaves a stunning memorial, reaching into the sky, with clean, affordable, home-grown electricity that supports our communities. We are glad that Nick's brother was able to attend the dedication. 
 
As the tragic events of Sept. 11 spur renewed patriotism and interest in domestic safety, it is important to recognize that the Community Energy-Exelon wind farms will help to increase America's energy independence and security. More wind farms can only do us more good. 
 
"Conservation is a moral issue," said President Teddy Roosevelt, "for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and continuance of the nation." 
 
In these times, conservation of America's environment and protecting the nation's safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to wind and other renewable energy resources. To all involved with this project, but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's words, we salute you.
