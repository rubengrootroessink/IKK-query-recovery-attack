You should find this interesting:

	Jeff/Sue - for the issues re direct access, surcharges, etc

	Mike - Great concern for SCE undercollection and who pays for it.  I want to keep Hanson focused on the power plant at their site, but it is obvious that this group would be a natural support for a strategy that would create a bundle of money from QF restructuring.
