Hello Gang!

Last year, we had a successful tradition of hosting Friday night Happy Hours 
in the heart of Silicon Valley and my favorite place - the famous city of 
Palo Alto.  So, to continue this EvMBA tradition, you, your significant 
others, and friends are invited to taste the best garlic fries in town and 
drink some specialty beers at Palo Alto's Gordon Biersch located at:

640 Emerson St. (near Hamilton)
Palo Alto 94301
(650) 323-7723

The gathering will take place this Friday, October 26th, at 6:00 and 
continue through the night with a possibility of dinner and dancing 
afterwards.

See you all there,

Natalia Rachelson
