I would agree that we may need to conference on this.  I agree with some of
the points that Janie brings up and would like to discuss with the group...I
am available most of the day if we have a conference call.

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.

Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation 
Thank you,
