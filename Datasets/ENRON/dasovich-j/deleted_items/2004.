Do you have any more info about the meeting on the 13th.  It looks like mid
morning would be a good time (if the meeting is still going to happen).  I
obviously understand if you have bigger issues to deal with, but I have to
arrange plane flights for myself and Marc if necessary.

I hope things are going well.
