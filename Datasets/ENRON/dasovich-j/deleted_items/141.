Can a humbler, more-informative Enron refuel investor enthusiasm?=20
That's the hope of Kenneth Lay, founder and chairman as well as the once an=
d once-again chief executive of this Houston energy and trading company. En=
ron has been regarded as one of the nation's most innovative -- though bede=
vilingly complicated -- companies. Mr. Lay acknowledges that Enron, which g=
rew into a colossus over the past decade with a hard-charging, in-your-face=
 management style, has "lost some credibility" with the investment communit=
y.
"I want to make sure we restore that credibility," he said in an interview =
last week.=20
He promises fuller disclosures, and Enron has a lot riding on whether inves=
tors find them sufficient -- and soothing. Last summer, the company's stock=
 price hit $90 a share, giving Enron a dazzling price-to-earnings ratio exc=
eeding 60. As of 4 p.m. in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stoc=
k Exchange, Enron was at $37.76, up $1.41, sporting a more-conventional P/E=
 ratio of about 21 times this year's expected earnings.=20
The stock slide has multiple causes, including uncertainty about trading pr=
ofits, due to the slower economy and a drop in energy prices as well as mou=
nting concerns about the difficulty that investors face in figuring out how=
 the company's extremely complex operations make money.=20
Layer on management turnover. Earlier this month, Enron lost its chief exec=
utive when Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's longtime lieutenant and handpicked s=
uccessor, unexpectedly resigned after only about six months in the top job.=
 The 47-year-old Mr. Skilling was widely credited with helping to build Enr=
on into the nation's leading energy trader and personified the company's br=
ash manner. During an investor conference call in April, for example, when =
a caller criticized Enron's schedule for releasing financial information, M=
r. Skilling responded by calling him an "ah." Mr. Skilling, who is on a riv=
er rafting trip, couldn't be reached for comment but others at the company,=
 including Mr. Lay, say it was an unfortunate word choice that continues to=
 haunt the company. At the time, Mr. Skilling said he regretted if anyone w=
as offended by his remark.=20
Though Mr. Skilling initially said his resignation was strictly for persona=
l reasons, he added in a later interview that his own feelings of failure o=
ver the plummeting stock price had contributed greatly to his early departu=
re. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay resumed the chief executive's job that he had p=
reviously held for 15 years.=20
Jeff Dietert, an analyst from Simmons & Co. International in Houston, figur=
es that Enron's P/E is likely to be permanently lower, though still somewha=
t higher than the average for its peer group. Mr. Dietert views Dynegy as t=
he premium energy stock, which will fetch the highest trading multiple.=20
While Mr. Lay insists that Enron's overall operating and financial conditio=
n is very strong, the unexpected exit of Mr. Skilling has some wondering if=
 "there isn't another shoe about to drop," says Carol Coale, an analyst at =
Prudential Securities.=20
To lessen such concerns, Mr. Lay promises to address the longtime analyst a=
nd investor complaint that Enron doesn't provide enough information about i=
ts extremely complex operations, which include not only construction of nat=
ural-gas pipelines and power plants but the trading of an ever-expanding ar=
ray of commodities. Nowadays, Enron trades everything from telecommunicatio=
ns capacity to weather-linked derivative contracts.=20
"I truly do not understand all their financial arrangements, and I've sent =
information on their deals to accountant friends and they don't understand =
them either," says Rebecca Followill, an analyst at Howard Weil, who refers=
 to Enron's accounting methods as a "black box."=20
Yet analysts long put out buy recommendations on Enron stock, in large part=
 because the company has issued consistently strong earnings. In 2000, for =
example, the company reported net income rose 10% to $979 million on revenu=
e that more than doubled to $100 billion. Assets over the past five years m=
ore than quadrupled to about $65 billion.=20
"When the stock price and earnings were going up so quickly, less attention=
 was paid to the quality of earnings," says Zach Wagner, an analyst at Edwa=
rd Jones in St. Louis. With the stock price down, "Enron has to show that t=
hey do have quality earnings. The only way to do that is to open up the boo=
ks," he says.=20
Mr. Lay says Enron will start putting out more detailed information on indi=
vidual business segments and "give a better idea of the profitability of va=
rious businesses" such as its wholesale-services category where a lot of bu=
siness activities gets lumped.=20
In another bow to criticism, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow as of Ju=
ly 31 quietly ended his ownership and management ties with certain limited =
partnerships. Over the past two years, Enron has placed billions of dollars=
 of assets and millions of shares of its stock into complex transactions wi=
th these partnerships. Enron executives say the transactions were perfectly=
 proper and that the company asked Mr. Fastow to take part in the deals, wh=
ich were done to reduce the risk of fluctuating market prices. An Enron spo=
kesman says Mr. Fastow has no comment on the matter.=20
Yet some analysts say they have been concerned about having Enron's top fin=
ancial executive in a fiduciary position at entities that, at least potenti=
ally, stood to gain if the company lost in the transactions -- and vice ver=
sa. Mr. Lay says the transactions involving Mr. Fastow had become a "lightn=
ing rod" for criticism so "we're better off not doing it."=20
Of course, it's still a challenge trying to make sense of these transaction=
s. Consider the following snippet from Enron's second-quarter report concer=
ning some Fastow-related deals: "Enron has entered into agreements with ent=
ities formed in 2000, which included the obligation to deliver 12 million s=
hares of Enron common stock in March 2005 and entered into derivative instr=
uments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forwar=
d contracts executed in 2000. . . . In exchange, Enron received notes recei=
vable from the Entities totaling approximately $827.6 million. In addition,=
 Enron entered into share settled costless collar arrangements with the Ent=
ities on the 12 million shares of Enron common stock. Such transactions wil=
l be accounted for as equity transactions when settled. Enron received a $6=
.5 million note receivable from the Entities to terminate share-settled opt=
ions on 7.1 million shares of Enron common stock. The transactions resulted=
 in noncash increases to noncurrent assets and equity."=20
Reading Enron's financial statements can make "you kind of step back and sa=
y, `What?'" says Jeff Dietert, the analyst at Simmons.=20
Enron faces challenges beyond just financial opaqueness. It is owed $500 mi=
llion for power delivered to California's troubled utilities -- a much bigg=
er unpaid tab than analysts originally believed. In India, Enron is having =
difficulty getting paid for electricity from its 65%-owned, $3-billion Dabh=
ol power project because of a dispute with government officials over power =
prices. Mr. Lay says Dabhol is among the approximately $5 billion in overse=
as assets that Enron plans to sell over the next three years while keeping =
$4 billion in such holdings.=20
Mr. Lay also must create a post-Skilling succession plan. He says he will s=
oon recommend to the board the names of one or two executives to join him i=
n the office of chairman.=20
When all is said and done, will the world really see a softer side of Enron=
? "I'm not sure that Enron is exactly humbled," says UBS Warburg analyst Ro=
n Barone. "But they're certainly under a new kind of pressure."

The State PG&E's Power Bill May Go Up Energy: The PUC wants to shift some o=

 a 12% rate hike for SDG&E.

SACRAMENTO -- California regulators plan to shift roughly $250 million a ye=
ar of the cost of buying power for the state away from financially troubled=
 Southern California Edison to Pacific Gas & Electric, which already is in =
bankruptcy.=20
The move, part of a draft decision issued Monday by Loretta M. Lynch, presi=
dent of the state Public Utilities Commission, is a step toward completing =
plans for repaying the state treasury for money spent buying electricity on=
 behalf of the state's three major private utilities--Edison, PG&E and San =
Diego Gas & Electric.
The PUC also issued a draft decision that would increase the electricity ra=
tes of San Diego customers by an average of 12%.=20
Another draft decision would suspend the ability of electricity customers s=
tatewide to choose their own power provider. That decision was a blow to el=
ectricity-generating firms, such as Enron and AES NewEnergy, which had lobb=
ied hard to maintain the ability to sell directly to customers--mostly larg=
e businesses--that have chosen not to buy power from the local utility.=20
The five-member commission will vote on the measures Sept. 6.=20
The proposals are designed to assure a flow of revenue to the state Departm=
ent of Water Resources, which has been buying power for utility customers m=
ost of this year. The state's power crisis saddled the utilities with so mu=
ch debt that earlier this year they became financially unable to buy power =
on behalf of their customers.=20
The Department of Water Resources has been paying for power out of the stat=
e treasury. To reimburse the treasury, the state plans to float a $12.5-bil=
lion bond issue. Those bonds would be paid off by customers of the three ut=
ilities.=20
One of the issues before the PUC has been how much of the cost of those bon=
ds should be carried by each of the three utility companies.=20
The Department of Water Resources had proposed charging each utility the sa=
me amount per customer. But the PUC's proposed order calls for splitting th=
e cost among the utilities according to how much it costs the department to=
 provide power to each of them. "The utilities argued that it was discrimin=
atory to have their customers subsidizing other customers' costs," Lynch to=
ld a news conference. "And we agreed."=20
"Instead of giving all utilities the same allocation of cost equally," she =
said, "we instead dig down behind the numbers to determine how much it actu=
ally costs" to serve each of the utility's customers.=20
The PUC's analysis determined that the cost of serving Edison is lower than=
 the cost of serving PG&E. The resulting decision shifts $500 million in pa=
yments from Edison to PG&E over the next two years.=20
Edison customers, however, will not see a drop in their electricity bills. =
Whatever money is left over after the Department of Water Resources takes i=
ts share can be used by Edison to cover the costs of its own power producti=
on and purchases. The PUC is now holding hearings to determine just how muc=
h of what is left over should go to Edison.=20
Whether the rates paid by PG&E customers would actually go up under the PUC=
 proposal remains unclear. But PG&E officials condemned the shift as unfair=
.=20
"If adopted by the [PUC] this would lock our customers into 40% to 55% high=
er rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Sou=
thern California Edison and SDG&E," the company said in a statement. "This =
massive cost shift was not proposed by DWR, discriminates against PG&E's cu=
stomers, and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost ju=
stification by DWR or the [PUC]."=20
The PUC's actions are intended to convince Wall Street that the state will =
be able to repay the bond issue. In general, the draft orders issued Monday=
 mirror an earlier proposed agreement that essentially insulates the Depart=
ment of Water Resources from PUC reviews of electricity rate increases. But=
 the decision by the PUC to alter the way the department's power-buying cos=
ts are allocated among the major utilities was a significant change.=20
Steve Maviglio, Gov. Gray Davis' press secretary, said the fact that the PU=
C was putting in place the legal machinery necessary for the bond sale is "=
a positive step in moving the ball forward."=20
Maviglio denied that PG&E was being punished for choosing bankruptcy earlie=
r this year rather than cooperate with the Davis administration on a possib=
le rescue plan. "It's all based on numbers and math; politics is not in the=
 equation," he said.=20
Spokesmen for Edison and SDG&E said they needed to study the draft decision=
s before commenting. The PUC will require the Department of Water Resources=
 to give it an updated revenue requirement in February, spelling out the ag=
ency's actual expenditure for the last year. That information will be used =
by the PUC to decide whether to adjust the electricity rates of utility cus=
tomers up or down. Any changes would show up in customers' bills next June,=
 Lynch said.=20
If approved by the full PUC, the proposed agreement would mean that the Dep=
artment of Water Resources, which has entered into $43 billion in long-term=
 contracts for power, will not be subject to PUC reviews. Lynch said state =
legislation gives the department the responsibility to review its own costs=
.=20
That lack of independent review worried consumer advocate Lenny Goldberg, a=
 lobbyist for the Utility Reform Network. "Just accepting DWR at whole clot=
h is an abdication of how ratepayers ought to be treated," he said.=20
Goldberg said he hopes the Legislature passes a bill by Sen. John Burton (D=
-San Francisco) that would give the PUC authority to scrutinize the water a=
gency's costs.=20
But Davis' advisors say such scrutiny could frighten Wall Street investors =
and hurt the state's ability to sell bonds at a favorable price. The propos=
ed PUC order raising electricity rates for many of SDG&E's 1.2 million cust=
omers would become effective no later than Oct. 1. Rates for PG&E and Ediso=
n customers were increased earlier this year. The average rate hike for SDG=
&E customers amounts to 1.4 cents per kilowatt-hour--less than half of the =
rate hike approved for utility customers elsewhere.=20
Lynch said the proposed increase for SDG&E is lower because its customers b=
ore the full cost of electricity in California's haywire electricity market=
 last summer. While Edison and PG&E customers were protected by a rate free=
ze, SDG&E customers saw their bills double and in some cases triple before =
the Legislature stepped in to cap rates last September.=20
To encourage conservation, the San Diego rate hike is structured so that re=
sidential customers who use no more than 130% of a baseline amount would no=
t experience any increase. Baseline is the number of kilowatt-hours that su=
pposedly meets the minimum needs of an average household in a particular re=
gion. The average increases would be 18% for small commercial customers and=
 19% for industrial firms.=20
The move to suspend the right of consumers to buy power directly from gener=
ators would put an end to one of the major selling points for the state's f=
ailed 1998 deregulation plan. Supporters of direct access, as the consumer-=
choice provision is known, were especially dismayed that the PUC said it wo=
uld suspend choice retroactive to July 1. Some companies, including AES New=
Energy, had pushed in recent weeks to sign up new customers before the opti=
on was eliminated. Those contracts would appear to be invalid if the PUC ad=
opts the draft decision.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the suspension of the so-called direct a=
ccess program "is incredible bad news for business."=20
"It appears the only way to escape the California energy debacle is to esca=
pe California," she said.=20
State officials have said they could not allow direct access in order to en=
sure that all customers pay their share of the cost of reimbursing the stat=
e for its power purchases.=20

Enron Names Whalley, Frevert to Chairman's Office (Update1)

Enron Names Whalley, Frevert to Chairman's Office (Update1)

     (Adds background on the executives in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, named company executives Greg Whalley and Mark
Frevert to the office of the chairman, two weeks after the
resignation of Jeffrey Skilling as chief executive.

     Whalley, 39 years old, was also named president and chief
operating officer. He previously held those titles for Enron
Wholesale Services, the energy- and commodity-trading unit that
accounted for almost all of the company's $50.1 billion in second-
quarter revenue. Frevert, 46, was chairman and chief executive of
Wholesale Services. He was named vice chairman, Enron said.

     Skilling, Enron's CEO since February, and Chairman Kenneth
Lay were the only executives in the office of the chairman, which
decides company strategy. Lay, who preceded Skilling as CEO, took
back that job after Skilling resigned. Lay's contract has been
extended to 2005.

     Skilling said Aug. 14 he resigned for personal and family
reasons, though he later said the recent drop in Enron's stock
price contributed to his decision. Shares of Houston-based Enron
have fallen 55 percent this year.

     The stock rose $1.41 to $37.76 yesterday.

Enron denies seeking sanctions over Dabhol

NEW DELHI: US energy trading major Enron Corp has denied approaching Washin=
gton seeking sanctions against India over the dispute with the Maharashtra =
government over the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project, even as domestic fin=
ancial institutions hinted at increasing their exposure in the project by a=
bout $483 million (Rs 2,270 crore) for its completion.=20
In a letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, a copy of w=
hich was available with The Times of India, Enron CEO Kenneth said: "A rece=
nt story in the Financial Times, which mischaracterised discussions with me=
, appears to have caused significant, unintended concern. Counter to the im=
pression given in the story, I have not asked anyone in the US government t=
o consider imposing sanctions."
Lay said in his letter that Enron's approach was to settle the issue amicab=
ly by selling its stake. "Furthermore, I did not say that the Dabhol power =
plant had been expropriated. Upon questioning from the publicator (publishe=
r) I did factually explained the several possible options available, includ=
ing how one might get to expropriation and about the US laws in place to pr=
otect its businesses. However, that is far from suggesting that we have dec=
ided to pursue these mechanisms," Lay said.=20
"Our preferred approach approach continues to be to resolve this issue amic=
ably by selling our stake to Indian governmental and financial institutions=
," Lay said.=20
However, Lay tempered his conciliatory stand by adding, "Without agreement =
on that, we have little choice but to follow the termination procedures joi=
ntly agreed under the power purchase agreement."=20
Lay also sent copies of the letter to finance minister Yashwant Sinha and p=
ower minister Suresh Prabhu.=20
PTI ADDS: The IDBI-led FIs' consortium may increase their exposure to enabl=
e the project to be completed and negotiate Daphol Power Company's equity a=
t a 25 per cent discount to its face value.=20
The FIs are exploring a possibility of taking out offshore equity by invest=
ment institutions and utilities after 12-18 months from Phase-II completion=
, the report said.=20
If this proposal was accepted by the joint committee of the FIs, then IDBI'=
s revised exposure would be at Rs 2,742 crore from existing Rs 2,121 crore,=
 ICICI Rs 1,904 crore from Rs 1,473 crore, SBI Rs 2,261 crore from Rs 1,749=
 crore, IFCI Rs 587 crore from Rs 454 crore and Canara Bank Rs 526 crore fr=
om Rs 407 crore.=20
"Even in the best case, the exposure requirements from domestic institution=
s exceed the prudential exposure norms," the report quoted FI sources as sa=
ying. Subsequent participation by all other FIs and banks like IDFC, PFC, P=

FIs may also seek a guarantee from the Centre as a backup for their exposur=

The stock market posted modest losses Monday after Friday's big rally, as t=
rading volume slowed to a crawl.=20
In commodity trading, natural gas prices plunged to 18-month lows amid an e=
xpected drop in demand from electricity generators this week.
On Wall Street the Dow industrials eased 40.82 points, or 0.4%, to 10,382.3=
5 while the Nasdaq composite slipped 4.39 points, or 0.2%, to 1,912.41.=20
On Friday the Dow soared 194.02 points and Nasdaq jumped 73.83 points after=
 Cisco Systems said its sales so far this quarter are meeting expectations.=
 The report raised fresh hopes that the technology sector is bottoming.=20
But the bulls couldn't keep the momentum going Monday. Losers outnumbered w=
inners by 17 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 20 to 16 on Nasdaq=
.=20
A weak report Monday on existing-home sales in July may have weighed on inv=
estor sentiment.=20
NYSE volume was anemic; it was the fourth-slowest full-day session this yea=
r.=20
"For the market to make a convincing case that we've ended the decline, it'=
s going to have to put together a few days in a row of advances or people a=
re going to look upon up days as an isolated situation," said Barry Hyman, =
chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.=20
Still, some analysts argued that the lack of heavy profit taking Monday was=
 a good sign.=20
"I would have thought that . . . we would have given back half of Friday's =
gains, and we didn't," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst for Prudential Se=
curities.=20
In the bond market, long-term yields were marginally higher.=20
Commodity trading was dominated by the action in natural gas prices. Near-t=
erm futures in New York fell 16.2 cents to $2.54 per million British therma=
l units, an 18-month low.=20
Traders said cooler weather in much of the country this week is expected to=
 cut demand for electricity to run air conditioners. Many power plants use =
natural gas to generate electricity, so gas demand could slide.=20
Among Monday's highlights:=20
* In the tech sector, Cisco slipped 24 cents to $18.01, Compaq lost 38 cent=
s to $13.27 and Veritas Software was off 66 cents to $34.83.=20

NEW YORK -- Technology shares tried, and failed, to buck the negative trend=
 and turn in a positive performance. After spending much of the afternoon i=
n the black, they turned lower during the final minutes of trading.=20
Old Economy stocks spent most of the session on the downside and offered up=
 more examples of how employment softness is extending beyond technology.
Traders said it was disappointing that stocks couldn't advance again, but t=
hey noted the pullback was modest and hardly canceled out Friday's surge. "=
I think the market is telling us it doesn't want to go down dramatically fr=
om here," Charles Johnson, head of trading at Blaylock & Partners, said.=20
Mr. Johnson said the market is moving on sparse volume, indicating an absen=
ce of big institutions whose buying power can help create a solid floor.=20
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.82 points, or 0.39%, to 10382.35 a=
nd the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.39 points, or 0.23%, to 1912.41.=20
On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners outpaced advancers 1,760 to 1,360=
. Volume on the Big Board was 849 million shares, with up volume of 359 mil=
lion and down volume of 479 million.=20
It was a tale of two directions for Internet stocks. Providers of services =
such as online security were among the session's best-performing groups, wi=
th Vignette gaining $1.06, or 15%, to $7.93, Check Point Software adding 91=
 cents, to 34.79 and CheckFree rising 1.70, or 8%, to 22.75.=20
But Internet-commerce stocks were among the session's weakest performers, w=
ith eBay declining 2.61, to 56.40, HomeStore.com off 2.98, or 14%, to 18.60=
 and Yahoo shedding 69 cents, to 13.42.=20
Old Economy stocks moved marginally on word that cutbacks were occurring. D=
eere fell four cents to 43.91 on plans to sell its Homelite consumer-produc=
ts business and restructure its construction and forestry division -- moves=
 that will result in a pretax charge of as much as $240 million and the eli=
mination of 300 jobs.=20
Georgia-Pacific fell 15 cents to 37.02 after saying it will shut four paper=
 machines at its Camas, Wash., mill that are responsible for 11% of white-p=
aper output. The move will eliminate 250 positions.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase added 17 cents to 41.10 after a report in the Financial T=
imes that the bank has begun its third round of cost-cutting since merging =
with Chase Manhattan during the past year.=20
Cutbacks in the technology area continued. Hughes Electronics, the General =
Motors unit that operates DirecTV, tumbled 20 cents, to 19.45 on plans to l=
ay off about 800 employees to cut costs amid a slow economy and several dis=
appointing quarters at its flagship satellite-broadcast unit.=20
Savings and loans were the session's worst performers, for a second day, on=
 sentiment that profits won't be as robust now that the Federal Reserve may=
 be close to finishing its interest-rate reductions. Mortgage lenders whose=
 volume benefits from lower rates include Astoria Financial, which dropped =
1.22, to 55.85, New York Community Bancorp, which fell 1.97, or 5.1%, to 36=
.92 and Washington Mutual, down 1.71, to 36.25. The savings and loans still=
 have their champions, including Lehman Brothers analyst Bruce Harting, who=
 called the selling "irrational," and said the stocks have a lot of merit.=
=20
Water and gas utilities were the day's strongest groups, but their gains we=
re lukewarm, illustrating the lack of a breakout by any sector. American Wa=
ter Works added 1.26, to 34, Enron was up 1.41, to 37.76 and Nicor fell two=
 cents to 38.98.=20
Tyco International rose 21 cents to 53.61 after being named to the "Top Pic=
ks" list at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. Tyco "offers the `complete package' =
for investors, with growth plus cash flow and acquisition acumen," said ana=
lyst Harriet Baldwin, who has a 12-month price target of $81.=20
Gilead Sciences rose 1.25, to 61.76 after Germany's Degussa Corp. said it b=
ought the remaining 49% stake of Proligo LLC, a genetics concern, from Gile=
ad for $14.3 million.=20
Bergen Brunswig added 1.45, or 6.4%, to 24.10 and AmeriSource Health gained=
 2.81, to 65 after the Federal Trade Commission ruled the nation's third- a=
nd fourth-largest drug wholesalers can proceed with their $7 billion merger=
.=20
NRG Energy gained 84 cents, to 18.24 after Banc of America Securities start=
ed coverage of the stock with a buy rating. NRG's expansion plans "offer ge=
ographic, functional and fuel diversity," analyst Ali Agha said in a note t=
o clients.=20
Williams-Sonoma added 76 cents, to 32.97 after jumping 13% on Friday when t=
he kitchen and bath-products retailer posted second-quarter net income of t=
wo cents a diluted share, beating analysts' expectations for break-even res=
ults.=20
Quest Diagnostics gained 1.12, to 65.86 after Morgan Stanley initiated cove=
rage with an outperform rating. "Baby boomers, price discipline and genomic=
s are driving top-line growth" for the clinical-laboratory operator, Morgan=
 Stanley analyst David Zimbalist said.=20
Blockbuster shed 1.60, or 7.3%, to 20.35 and Movie Gallery dropped 3.55, or=
 11%, to 27.75 after an article in Barron's said Hollywood studios and cabl=

 five film studios announced a joint venture to deliver video on demand thr=
ough the Internet.=20
Best Buy was unchanged at 61.23 after showing a loss for most of the day, p=

Brokerage houses edged lower after Goldman Sachs again cut its full-year ou=

Enron works to shore up confidence=20
Taking a long view=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Even though nothing major appears to be wrong at Enron Corp., investor conf=
idence in the world's largest energy trader remains shaky.=20
Wall Street stock analysts agree with Houston-based Enron that its core bus=
iness in wholesale energy trading and marketing is strong. But investors ar=
e concerned over a series of issues that when taken together give them paus=
e about Enron's stock.=20
Among them: whether the "real" reason for CEO Jeff Skilling's sudden depart=
ure two weeks ago is still to come out; who will replace Skilling; analysts=
' inability to get a detailed understanding of Enron's financial performanc=
e because Enron hasn't given them more detailed and segmented data; and ong=
oing disputes surrounding a power plant project in India.=20
"The first thing they need to do is they need to get investor confidence ba=
ck," said Carol Coale, a Prudential Securities analyst in Houston who follo=
ws Enron. "There's 10 points in the stock related to uncertainty surroundin=
g Skilling's sudden departure."=20
It may take a quarter or two for investors to believe that "there was not a=
nother shoe to drop related to Skilling's resignation," she said.=20
Enron's stock already had taken a beating this year, trading as high as $82=
 at the end of January and closing just under $43 before Skilling's announc=
ement.=20
After Skilling, a key player in Enron's transformation from a pipeline comp=
any to a trader of energy and other commodities such as metals and pulp and=
 paper, said he was leaving Enron for personal and family reasons, the stoc=
k fell further, closing at $36.25 four trading days after the announcement.=
=20
The stock rose $1.41 to close in regular trading at $37.76 Monday.=20
Enron, analysts said, should be able to boost investor confidence by taking=
 a number of steps.=20
One -- expected to happen today -- is the naming of potential successors to=
 Skilling.=20
But the company also give must analysts the financial data they've been see=
king, resolve the India situation, sell off underperforming international a=
ssets and turn out positive earnings reports.=20
Enron got a fresh round of questions after Skilling left. That was despite =
assurances from Skilling and Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who stepped back into =
the chief executive and president roles, that Skilling wasn't fired and no =
negative disclosures about Enron were on the way.=20
Even though many analysts, some of whom met with Lay after Skilling left, g=
enerally seem to believe both points are true, investors apparently remain =
skeptical, especially in light of Enron's stock performance this year.=20
The stock took a big hit when Enron's broadband business fell apart as the =
telecommunications industry melted down.=20
Some analysts, though, believe Enron and Skilling oversold the business and=
 that some on Wall Street overvalued it. Based on certain calculations, Enr=
on touted broadband as an enterprise worth as much $40 a share in the stock=
 price.=20
Enron's link with telecommunications meant it got caught both on the upside=
 and downside of the bubble, said Raymond Niles, an analyst at Salomon Smit=
h Barney. Before Skilling left, the broadband reaction had already come out=
 of the stock, he said.=20
"The fundamentals do not justify the stock drop to the magnitude we've seen=
 this year," said Lay, noting that second-quarter net income rose 40 percen=
t year over year. "Enron has performed incredibly well."=20
Lay said attacks by Gov. Gray Davis and others in California on Enron and o=
ther out-of-state energy companies also dragged the stock down. But Califor=
nia's energy crisis is on the path to resolution and the "blame game" has t=
apered off, he said.=20
In a blitz of recent meetings with analysts and fund managers, Lay said Enr=
on would respond to requests for more detailed and segmented financial data=
, but without divulging information that is proprietary or damaging to its =
competitive position.=20
Analysts likely will see some of the new data at the end of the third quart=
er and even more by year's end, Lay said. Whether what's provided satisfies=
 them remains to be seen.=20
"The struggle is it's hard to project Enron earnings," said Jeff Dietert, a=
n analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston. "It's hard to develo=
p metrics that you can use to project their earnings. ... There are still q=
uestions as to how they make their money."=20
Enron, Coale said, tends to group businesses into one sector so "that it is=
 difficult to see the trees that make up the forest. We refer to their earn=
ings as a black box."=20
Investors also harbor fears about Enron's cash flow, said Andre Meade, an a=
nalyst at Commerzbank Securities. He described it as more of misperception =
than a problem, as the cash flow can be "fairly lumpy" because of the way E=
nron's trading business operates.=20
When Lay names two Enron executives to join him in the office of the chairm=
an, they will be seen as the probable candidates for chief executive. But o=
ther Enron executives not named to the office also may be on the CEO short =
list, Lay said.=20
It could take as long as two or three years to groom a successor, which wou=
ld also give Wall Street time to become comfortable with the person.=20
Names bandied about on Wall Street as possible successors included Mark Fre=
vert, CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Lawrence "Greg" Whalley, chief opera=
ting officer of Enron Wholesale Services; and Dave Delainey, CEO of Enron E=
nergy Services.=20
Enron is also working to resolve the disputes surrounding its Dabhol power =
project in India.=20
Enron holds a 65 percent stake in the project, which it's seeking to sell. =
But Enron says any deal must allow it to recover its approximately $1 billi=
on in costs, which include $875 million of equity investment and unpaid bil=
ls for power the plant has supplied.=20
Lay also expects to announce some large asset sales in the next 12 to 18 mo=
nths.=20
Enron plans to stay on its current strategic path, which includes broadenin=
g its trading into a range of other commodities.=20
"We're just going to keep doing what we're doing," Lay said. "The most impo=
rtant thing right now is to continue the strong performance at Enron, and e=
ventually the market will catch up with us."
