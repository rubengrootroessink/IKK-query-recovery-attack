winter is here!  I had to be the master of ceremonies yesterday for a groundbreaking event (one of my charitable deals) and I just about froze to death--the temp dropped almost 30 degrees from morning till afternoon.  Minneapolis got snow but it didn't really stick.  I have heard that we're going to have a really tough winter.  Maybe I should take that package and move to California!  I hadn't looked at the stock yet today...I've had lots of folks calling me and wanting to know what's going on.   I think it's going to take us 2 years to get the price back.
 
I keep on thinking that we're going to be taken over....GE or someone.  I wish it would be 3M, then the headquarters would be here!
