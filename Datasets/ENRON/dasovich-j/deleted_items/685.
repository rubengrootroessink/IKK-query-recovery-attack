In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language
that was added at the end of the first sentence and not replace it
unless we can get a clearer statement from Jeff of what he means.
Jeff-can you come up with something clearer? Barbara
