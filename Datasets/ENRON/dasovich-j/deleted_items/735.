TOP MANAGEMENT


* Original Management Team Departs at RLX	top   mail <http://people.venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IJQQMHJNII> 	
HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Most of the original management team has left RLX Technologies, a supplier of Web servers founded earlier this year by ex-Compaq computer executives. Earlier this week VentureWire reported that Michael Swavely, formerly president and chief operating officer, had left the company last week, and that Gary Stimac, chairman and CEO, will step down from the CEO position. Company spokesperson Patrick Kimball confirmed that there have been additional executive departures. 

Among those leaving were chief financial officer, J Tempesta; vice president of development, Keith McAuliffe; vice president of systems engineering, Ronnie Ward; and vice president of business development, Bob Jackson. The company said it will seek replacements.

A spokesperson said that the executives chose to leave the firm as RLX underwent restructuring. In August, the company laid off 17% of its staff, or 20 employees, citing a slow market for IT products. 

RLX Technologies has raised $59 million in financing from ComVentures, IBM, Ignition, Soros Private Equity Partners, and Sternhill Partners.

* IntellectExchange Hires President and CEO; Raising Capital	top   mail <http://people.venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=ILHKKPHNII> 	
BEDFORD, MASS. -- IntellectExchange, which assists companies in finding experts to solve business, technology, and research problems, said it appointed Jonathan Rubin as its first president and CEO. The new executive told VentureWire that the company is raising its last stage of seed financing. 

Mr. Rubin, 42, joins the company from E-Sync, where he was CEO. He was introduced to IntellectExchange through technology executive search firm the Onstott Group, based in Wellesley, Mass. He has also been named to the company's three-member board.

The CEO said that the company is raising its final piece of seed funding for $1.5 million. He expects to close the round by the end of the year. The company has raised $2.5 million from individual investors to date. The money will be used for sales and marketing and product development. The company could go after its Series A as early as the second quarter of 2002, he said. 

Mr. Rubin said the company is in the early stages of talking to two different companies about acquiring them. Both companies approached IntellectExchange, he said, adding, that if the deals were to be done, they would be in the form of cash and stock.
