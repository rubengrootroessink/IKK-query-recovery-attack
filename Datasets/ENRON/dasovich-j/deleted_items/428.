I formally got invited to an Enron function in Washington on October 4th and 5th, so this one is yours.  I'd collect the $1,000 stipend for sure.

I send you the written material on this--let me know if you haven't rec'd in the next few days.

Thanks,

- Rob

Bob:

Having Jeff Dasovitch represent Enron would be great with us.  I am sorry,
however, that you will not be able to make it as I had heard great things
about you from and via Chris Castaneda.  You have an impressive and
enthusiastic fan club.

Please accept my thanks for responding to the invitation and arranging for
Jeff.  You've guaranteed the success of the plenary.

Would you send me the direct contact information for Jeff?

Again, thanks

Tim Hodson
