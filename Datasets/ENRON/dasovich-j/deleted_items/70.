Yes.  Likely not 100% of what you're looking for, but likely some info that will be useful.

Best,

Do we have any recent presentations, position papers, memos, etc. on (1) the CA history/situation  and (2) Enron's role in the market.  Kind of generic, but I am putting together a presentation for potential investors in CA deals.
