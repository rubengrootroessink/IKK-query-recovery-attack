I apologize for the repeats to some of you, but my first emails were not
getting through to everyone, so I'm using a different address this

> Fellow students,
>     The Haas EvMBA Golf Classic tournament dates and info have been
> finalized and now the fun begins..... sign-ups and team organizing!  A
> short recap for those who don't already know.... the Haas Evening MBA
> Board has decided to put together a Fall Classic golf tournament to help
> facilitate networking and recruiting for the evening program.  Networking
> with Alumni, other students and corporate recruitors has always been
> difficult due to the incredibly chaotic schedules of the evening students.
> This tournament will allow you, the evening students, to meet and network
> for an entire fun-filled day with those that are crucial to your success
> while in the program, and after graduation.  Haas Faculty and staff are
> also invited to further enrich your golfing experience!!!  The tournament
> organizers will organize teams based on common interests, as well as golf
> skills!
>     The tournament will be at the scenic Diablo Grande golf course on
> Sunday, Oct. 7th and will be a scramble format.  This format is a "best
> ball" type format which will allow even the most inexperienced of golfers
> to participate in the fun.  A team player can only add to the success of
> the team, and never take away from it.  For those who don't own clubs, we
> will be organizing club rentals - so don't let that hold you back!  At the
> same time, we have chosen a course which is one of the most difficult and
> technical courses in the Bay Area so that the more experienced golfers
> will still be quite challenged.  The tournament will begin about 12:30
> with a shotgun start and will include a gourmet catered awards banquet
> afterwards.  Bus transportation will also be offered for those who prefer
> not to drive to the course, which is located east of the Altamont pass.
>    The $100 cost of the tournament includes the green fees, cart, golf
> gifts, prizes, awards dinner and bus transportation.  In addition, all
> remaining proceeds will go to a local charity - the Oakland Technology
> Exchange (OTX).  OTX teaches Oakland students in computer repair,
> troubleshooting and building.  The groups rebuilds thousands of donated
> computers and installs them in the Oakland schools, as well as
> distributing them to the students who complete their computer course to
> take home.  They also award academic college scholarships and give the
> recipients laptops to take with them to college.  To give you an idea of
> the value of this price, the green fee alone for Diablo Grande on the
> weekend is $100 per golfer.
>    Attached is a flyer and a sign-up form for the Haas EvMBA Golf Classic.
> Please send in your forms and checks to the Evening MBA Office as soon as
> possible.  Since spots are limited, students will be admitted on a first
> come first served basis.  Since we understand how difficult it is to spend
> even more time away from your family, any available slots after all
> students have had a chance to sign up, will be opened up to
> spouses/significant others.
>     All questions/comments can be sent to me at this return address.
> Thanks for your time and send in those checks and forms immediately to
> reserve your spot!!
