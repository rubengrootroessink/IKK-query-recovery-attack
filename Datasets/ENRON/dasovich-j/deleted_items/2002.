Just wrote Brad a note saying that you guys are lined up to be in Houston on
the 13th.  If he keeps the meeting, he's going to want good information on
you guys prior to that.  If he writes back and confirms today.  I think
you'll need to get him stuff via FEDEX no later than tomorrow.  That going
to work?

Green, but it didn't seem to matter. 

Hope to hear back from you later today. 

We saw Del McCourey last night - so much fun.  We are going to a bluegrass
jam with Esquire Dan tonight.

I'll get back to you today.  Houston is dealing with some pretty big 
issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.  How's 
the weather in the big apple?  You vote for Green or Bloomberg?

Do you have any more info about the meeting on the 13th.  It looks like 
mid morning would be a good time (if the meeting is still going to 
happen).  I obviously understand if you have bigger issues to deal with, 
but I have to arrange plane flights for myself and Marc if necessary. 

I hope things are going well.
