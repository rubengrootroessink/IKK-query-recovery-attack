4. Streamlined, Enhanced Features on Retirement Planner 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
The year's fourth quarter is a good time to review your 
retirement planning. Our latest version of Schwab's Retirement 
Planner makes it easier than ever to see how your retirement 
assets may grow to meet your retirement goals. 

For example, the new version of Planner no longer requires you 
to input returns on investments, instead we'll show you what 
returns you may achieve. The new Retirement Planner will 
automatically factor in volatility and risk associated with a 
particular portfolio. It will rapidly calculate 5,000 potential 
scenarios and generate projected results over a given time frame 
by utilizing the selected assets in your Schwab portfolio.  

It provides valuable data for your retirement roadmap. You can 
even sign up for periodic email reminders to revisit your plan! 
Check out these new features at Retirement Planning.
