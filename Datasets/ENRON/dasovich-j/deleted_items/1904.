Internet Daily 
for Friday, November 2, 2001

Dot-com layoffs rise

Plummeting air travel demand took its toll of Web travel sites 
last month and helped cause a 60% rise in the number of Internet 
job losses in October. Almost 5,000 positions were cut in the 
industry, according to a report by Challenger, Gray and 
Christmas. "Sites specializing in airline reservations and 
travel planning experienced a substantial falloff in business, 
which led to over 800 cuts," he said.

Prodigy Communications  hopes to entice new customers by selling 
a low-cost Internet access device and offering them three free 
months of Web access service. An announcement of the offer will

known as NIC, was developed by Oracle Corp.'s  New Internet 
Computer Co.

Amazon.com, Citibank join for credit

Amazon.com  introduced the Amazon Credit Account, the online 
equivalent of a department store credit card. The account is for 
use on most of the company's Web site, but does not cover gift 
certificates or purchases made through partner Circuit City. 
"Amazon Credit customers can enjoy their purchase and hold on to 
their money for 90 days before making a complete payment without 
any interest," said Steve Frazier, vice president of hardlines 
at Amazon.com. Citibank's  Commerce Solutions unit is making the 
credit program available.

Xbox, World Series, anthrax boost sites' traffic

Fox Sports' recently redesigned Web site has experienced a 17% 
rise in visits, fueled by its TV network's coverage of the World 
Series and the site's own intra-game public opinion polls. 
Jupiter Media Metrix  also reported Major League Baseball's Web 
site saw its traffic fall 40% last week. Drugstore.com welcomed 
almost 1.1 million visitors during the period. That's a rise of 
67% over the previous three weeks' average. And Xbox.com has had 
a 54% riser in traffic (1.1 million visitors) as the Nov. 15 
launch of Microsoft's  new game console nears.

DC seeks kid-friendly Web zone

Members of the House of Representatives' telecommunications 
subcommittee are pursuing the idea of creating a kid-friendly 
area on the Internet. Sites designed for children could be 
established at a domain such as www.website.kids.us, and would 
bar pornography and other inappropriate material, Reuters 
reported. A proposal has been introduced by Rep. John Shimkus, 
R.-Ill.
