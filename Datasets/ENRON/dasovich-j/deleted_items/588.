Here is a copy of the economists letter the Independent Institute released on health care.  It is about 330 words long.
  
http://independent.org/tii/news/OpenLetterHealthCare0002.html
 

Here is my first draft of a letter to economists for power price caps.  It is 275 words long, so we have some room.

 

The tricky thing here is the interplay between retail and wholesale price regulation that is not present in other price control situations.  In other words, the public utility nature of retail prices complicates things a bit, so our letter will have to be careful about not losing support from economists who wonder if this is really about a natural monopoly situation--at retail at least.

Maybe instead of price decontrol at retail we can just call for a move toward real-time pricing.

Comments appreciated.

- Rob

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

David

>>Dear Rob,

>>The photocopying figure is for the thousands of letters and forms to
>>be copied for the mailing as well as the records of those who agree
>>as signatories.  It is important that we keep an accurate record of
>>each and every piece of communications, especially for the
>>signatories.  In many cases, we have found that we will have resend
>>the letters because of bad addresses and from requests of other
>>economists who hear about the Open Letter.
>>
>>Hence, the photocopying figure is a mixture which will continue
>>throughout the project.
>>
>>As for the sponsorship, my suggestion is really two-fold:
>>1.  The funding come from a non-industry entity not identifiable with
>>Enron so that the project not even have the suggestion of
>>impropriety.  As with all of our supporters, we would also not
>>identify the funder with the project, but if asked, we could state
>>that no industry support was involved.
>>2.  The Open Letter have listed as co-sponsors various non-energy
>>industry related groups, including possible consumer, labor,
>>academic, environmental, health, business and other groups.  The goal
>>here is to reinforce the fact that the case against price controls is
>>one that is supported by a wide range of people who indeed would
>>suffer enormously from such harmful policies.
>>
>>I would be delighted to discuss these and other matters in a
>>conference call on Friday morning or Monday afternoon.  Please just
>>let me know what might work for you.
