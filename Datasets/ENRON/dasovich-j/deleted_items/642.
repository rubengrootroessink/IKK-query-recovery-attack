FERC held its meeting today.  Big things happened.

Northeast

FERC approves PJM conditionally as the RTO "platform" to be used to form on=
e RTO in the northeast.  FERC rejects the New York and New England RTO prop=
osals and directs the three ISOs and all interested parties to participate =
in a mediation led by a FERC Settlement Judge with assistance from outside =
consultants.  The purpose of the mediation proceeding is to facilitate the =
formation of a single RTO in the Northeast.  The mediation must begin withi=
n one week from today and must conclude 45 days thereafter.  The Judge must=
 then submit a report to the Commission 10 days thereafter, which will incl=
ude an outline of the proposal to create a single northeast RTO, milestones=
 for the completion of intermediate steps, and a deadline for submitting a =
joint proposal.

While the Commission has not formally extended the RTO implementation date =
(currently December 15, 2001), Chairman Hebert made comments a couple of we=
eks ago and again today that perhaps the December 15, 2001 may have to slip=
 some.  We will continue to monitor this issue.

Donna Fulton is sending separately a write up of similar action the Commiss=
ion took with regard to the Southeast RTO effort. =20

Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
