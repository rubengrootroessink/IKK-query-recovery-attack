"Wireless is the next big thing--in five years it will be ubiquitous."  This quote has been repeated every five years for the last fifty years.  Are we finally there yet?  We invite you to this year's inaugural UC Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum where we will look forward to a stimulating discussion covering the current status of the worldwide wireless business environment, as well as best practices learned from decades of starting, growing, and investing in businesses that rely on mobile technology, and trends for their success.
