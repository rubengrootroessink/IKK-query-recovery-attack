A Cool Heat Wave

From August 6 to August 10, record peak electricity demand driven by a swel=
tering heat wave severely tested the reliability of the competitive PJM mar=
ket. The PJM market passed its stress test with little public notice or cre=
dit. As usual, only ships that sink or planes that crash draw headlines.

With air-conditioners battling near 100-degree temperatures, consumers set =
three new peak usage records on August 7, 8, and 9, with demand hitting 53,=
 464 megawatts (MW), 53,910 MW, and 54,176 MW respectively. These new recor=
ds smashed the old peak of approximately 51,700 MW set in a 1999, and contr=
ibuted to unhealthy air in large parts of the Mid-Atlantic region. They als=
o highlight the need to enact better demand response programs and energy ef=
ficiency policies in order to reduce the strain placed on power supplies as=
 well as to protect the environment and public health.=20

The ability of the PJM competitive market to meet record demands and keep c=
onsumers cool sharply contrast with California's inability to keep the ligh=
ts on even in periods of low-seasonal usage from late 2000 through March of=
 this year. Speaking of PJM's impressive reliability performance, PJM Presi=
dent Phil Harris concluded, "This week's accomplishment is testimony to how=
 effective markets and efficient operations work in harmony to reliably ser=
ve the electric customer." But keeping the lights on should never be taken =
for granted.

Prior to restructuring, in January 1994, rolling blackouts occurred through=
out the PJM power pool when demand for about 45,000 MW couldn't be met. The=
se blackouts occurred primarily because huge numbers of plants, which were =
rate based and operated by fully regulated monopolies or non-utility genera=
tors with PURPA contracts, experienced mechanical and fuel problems at the =
same time.=20

This painful experience ensured that policymakers made reliability a top pr=
iority and a major topic of discussion when enacting the state's Electricit=
y Competition and Customer Choice Act in 1996, asking questions like, would=
 a competitive market attract sufficient investment to build necessary plan=
ts? Would existing plants perform better or worse and experience less or mo=
re outages? Could consumers be paid market prices to reduce demand at peak =
usage times in order to increase incentives for energy conservation?=20

The last five years and meeting record peaks both in 1999 and 2001 answer t=
hose questions and prove the reliability of the competitive PJM market. The=
 market is producing lots of new generation - most of it new natural gas pl=
ants and some wind power, and all of it much cleaner than the coal and nucl=
ear plants which dominated the generation market more than 10 years ago. Pl=
ants in PJM have never operated better and have reduced their forced outage=
 rate by about 50 percent since 1996. Additionally, a few customers partici=
pated in PJM's emerging demand response programs during the August 2001 hea=
t wave.=20

But many more customers would reduce usage in peak periods in return for ma=
rket-based compensation if they only had the ability. Though demand respons=
e has its nose under the generation tent, it still hasn't reached most Penn=
sylvanians. Neither Pennsylvania nor any other state has taken policy steps=
 to ensure that a necessary infrastructure of time-of-use meters and applia=
nce control devices is deployed throughout every home and business, a failu=
re which amounts to regulatory malpractice. Until the Pennsylvania Public U=
tility Commission requires the deployment of these available technologies o=
ver a reasonable period, prices for electricity will remain higher than the=
y need be, pollution will be worse than it should be, and reliability will =
be less than it could be.=20

Keeping the lights on
During the recent heat wave, PJM encouraged general restraint in usage, imp=
lemented its demand response programs, and reduced voltage by 2 percent to =
3 percent for brief periods - undetectable to most customers. Beyond not fa=
iling, the system performed so well in large part because of the competitiv=
e market, not despite it. Several factors worked to maintain system reliabi=
lity, including better power plant performance, new generation, imports, sk=
illful management of the operation of the transmission system and demand re=
sponse.=20

Improved Generation Plant Operation. Of all these factors, dramatically bet=
ter plant performance is the single, biggest key to competitive PJM's impre=
ssive reliability performance during the last five years. Generating plants=
 are operating much more reliably now than during the monopoly era. In 1996=
, the forced outage rate at PJM generation plants was 12.7 percent, meaning=
 that a plant scheduled to be available was in fact unavailable for operati=
onal reasons 12.7 percent of the time. The forced outage rate of generating=
 facilities in PJM declined to 11.2 percent in 1997, 6.5 percent in 1998, 5=
.7 percent in 1999 and to 5.2 percent in 2000. In 1996, when you really nee=
ded a generator, there was a 1-in-8 chance that the unit wouldn't be availa=
ble. But in 2000, the odds that a generator would be forced out of service =
at any particular time had fallen to 1 in 20.=20

Under price regulation, generators for the most part got paid even if their=
 plants were unavailable to generate electricity because of operational or =
maintenance problems. With the move to market-based prices, generators have=
 a built-in incentive to be there, especially when demand and prices are hi=
gh. Even the PJM capacity payment - still a relic of rate-based generation =
- has moved from a payment simply because a plant was physically built, to =
one based upon the generating unit's historical availability to provide gen=
eration when needed. The decline in unforced outage rates is a testament to=
 the change in how generators get paid. At the 5.2 percent 2000 average for=
ced outage rate, about 3,000 MW would have been unavailable - at the 12.7 p=
ercent average forced outage rate for 1996, more than 7,300 MW would have b=
een unavailable. Every generation owner deserves credit for this superb per=
formance.=20

New Generation. Another reason the lights are staying on despite record pea=
ks is the new generation built to serve the Mid-Atlantic market. The develo=
pment of competitive power plants continues to accelerate in PJM, with over=
 4,000 MW scheduled to come on-line in 2002, and even more for 2003. In con=
trast, demand in 2002 is expected to grow by less than 1,000 MW.=20

The Mid-Atlantic experience documents that new generation can be supplied i=
n a competitive market. The market is delivering plenty of new generation t=
hat is dramatically cleaner and more efficient than that built during the m=
onopoly era. Transparent prices in a competitive, efficient market are enco=
uraging investors to build. Unlike the previous generations of power plants=
, no captive monopoly consumer had to guarantee any investor in a new gener=
ation plant a single penny return of the investment or a single penny retur=
n on the investment. Unlike many of the previous generation of power plants=
, these new plants use mostly natural gas instead of coal or nuclear fuel, =
cost billions less to build, can be planned and built more quickly, and don=
't pollute nearly as much. And these plants will never receive a penny in s=
tranded costs.
=20
Imports. The PJM transparent competitive market sends price signals to gene=
rators in its territory - to encourage them to build new supply and to keep=
 their plants in service and available, especially at peak demand - as well=
 as to national electricity markets, especially in the Midwest and Virginia=
. Peak demand and relatively high peak prices in PJM enabled PJM to benefit=
 from surplus supplies in adjacent regions and import significant amounts o=
f electricity - often over 3,000 MW of net imports - when it was needed mos=
t.=20

PJM Operations. Properly managing the electric grid isn't an easy task on a=
 typical day, but during a heat wave it's particularly challenging. In Augu=
st, PJM showed exceptional restraint and skill in managing a potential cris=
is without overreacting, relying on the market and voluntary reductions whi=
le avoiding the more intrusive controls at their disposal. The 2 percent to=
 3 percent reduced voltage levels for a few hours were the only non-volunta=
ry reductions, measures imperceptible to most consumers.
=20
Demand Response. PJM called upon industrial customers to curtail usage thro=
ugh traditional interruptible service in which large customers receive a di=
scounted rate in exchange for having service interrupted when supply is lim=
ited, and requested that all customers, especially large industrial custome=
rs, voluntarily limit consumption and turn on on-site generation. PJM also =
successfully utilized several new, market based curtailment programs, and e=
stimates that approximately 2000 MW of peak load was avoided through incent=
ive programs and implementation of its pilot demand-side response program. =
There was an increase of nearly 400 MW of Active Load Management (ALM), whi=
ch accounted for a good portion of the demand response programs instituted =
by PJM. Unlike the previous year, ALM was not excluded from participating i=
n the PJM demand response programs. Additionally, about 100MW of non-ALM re=
sources have enrolled in PJM's emergency and economic programs. While this =
represents a humble start, the effects during the peak hours can still be s=
ignificant.=20

Prices. Peak demand produces peak prices in a competitive market, but PJM m=
arket prices remained well under control because new development, imports a=
nd plants in service provided adequate supply, and because PJM has a market=
 rule limiting bids to $1,000 per MWh. Average peak hour prices (7 a.m. to =
11 p.m.) at the PJM western hub were about $250 MWh. In many hours, prices =
remained less than $100 MWh, while during a few hours prices were constrain=
ed by the $1,000 rate cap. These peak prices are quite moderate compared to=
 the extreme volatility that was seen in the Midwest in 1999, with prices r=
ising to several thousand dollars per MWh, or the recent price spikes in Ca=
lifornia.=20

Indeed, one-year forward contract prices within PJM have collapsed since Ju=
ne, and the August heat wave hasn't reversed the sharp declines. An all-hou=
rs 2002 PJM contract now can be had for about $29.00 per MWh. June, July, a=
nd August 2002 contracts have fallen 50 percent from summer 2001 prices.

These forward prices are now reflecting the PJM spot market prices that fel=
l in 2000 compared to 1999, and have hovered around $30.00 per MWh for the =
last 24 months. Both the PJM spot price and the forward contract price are =
up to 50 percent less than what most Pennsylvania customers paid their mono=
polies for generation in 1996. If they were paying only competitive prices,=
 instead of competitive prices plus stranded costs - primarily for nuclear =
plants - every Pennsylvania customer would have a huge rate cut.

And the award goes to.
Congratulations to PJM and its staff for operating the PJM market reliably =
and competitively in the most difficult, challenging circumstances it has f=
aced so far. Their service to the public is unfortunately not widely recogn=
ized and is taken for granted. Thanks as well to the plant operators who ha=
ve never operated their plants better and to those fortunate consumers who =
had the ability to participate in demand response programs and reduced thei=
r usage for compensation.=20

Public safety, economic competitiveness, consumer savings, and environmenta=
l protection demand that all consumers, not a fortunate few, have the chanc=
e to save real money by reducing energy usage through demand response techn=
ologies.=20
