	On Sept 21, SoCalGas filed its BCAP.  They propose a new firm
receipt point trading program based on the open season proposed in the
comprehesive settlement.  The also propose a return to embedded cost rates,
and an elimination of any transmission load risk for the utility.  We should
discuss whether Enron wishes to participate in this case, which will clearly
be a new vehicle for putting gas strategy issues before the commission.  Let
me know if you need a copy of the application.   Mike Day
