The purpose of this filing is to submit the Schedule G-SUR rate change effective August 1.  Gas volumes procured by customers from third-party entities and transported by PG&E may be subject to a gas franchise fee surcharge under Schedule G-SUR--Customer-Procured Gas Franchise Fee Surcharge.  The franchise fee surcharge is calculated based on the core WACOG for the previous month, exclusive of storage costs, and franchise fees and uncollectibles, multiplied by the franchise fee factor adopted in PG&E's most recent General Rate Case.
