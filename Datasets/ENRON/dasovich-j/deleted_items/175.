> NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - A privately owned company that operates and maintains
> the street lights in Long beach, Calif. plans to make a bid for Edison
> International, according to a report published Friday.
> City Light & Power could announce its intentions to bid for Edison, parent
> of cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison as early as Monday,
Dow
> Jones reported, citing City Light & Power executives.
> Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barney, which are advising the company,
have
> valued Edison at $5.6 billion, or $17.18 a share, the report said.
> City Light plans to bid for the entire company but could sell of some of
the
> assets later, Dow said.
> Edison's Southern California Edison unit has been brought to the brink of
> bankruptcy because it has more than $3 billion in unpaid debts. It's been
> unable to recover the costs of buying power on the spot wholesale market
> because state law prevents it from raising its retail rates.
> Brian Bennett, SoCalEd's vice president of external affairs said Friday
that
> "by policy, the company does not comment on takeover rumors."
> A call to a representative handling public relations for City Light &
Power
> wasn't immediately returned.
> Shares of Edison climbed 22 cents to $14.40 in recent action.
