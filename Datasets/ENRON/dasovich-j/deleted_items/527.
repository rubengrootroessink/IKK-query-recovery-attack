EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09Multiple MOU Plans Debated
?=09California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget=20
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on=
 Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last=
 night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in It=
aly and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to=
 return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to =
pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they t=
ake the bill up on Thursday.=20
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the Calif=
ornia House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep the=
 published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  =
Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison =
issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on Th=
ursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary ses=
sion and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days (al=
l others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of passing=
 a comprehensive "bail-out" plan and even threatened to call an emergency s=
ession to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on Friday, there =
is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this request.     =
=20
?=09Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,=
  82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in ad=
dition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the=
 deal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raise=
d objections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) =
for So Cal were the bill left unamended.
?=09The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains =
the only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an "in=
formational" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the =
Assembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the Com=
mittee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman =
from Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and=
 simple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said =
has conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio whi=
ch will add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long=
 term contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful app=
ear slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his=
 own bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that a=
t least Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance.=20

?=09The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. P=
olanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention =
from Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a =
committee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. T=
he Senate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both sch=
eduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the meetin=
gs are informational because neither committee has possession of the bill. =
 These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a form=
al vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the deta=
ils of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in sessio=
n tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given Burto=
n's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there is n=
o guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 78XX.=
 Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either or b=
oth bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment by=
 Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to=
 keep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is =
behind them.
