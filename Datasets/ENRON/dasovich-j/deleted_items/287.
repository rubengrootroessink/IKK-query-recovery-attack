Jeff,

D.J. will be in meetings all day in Southern Calif. If he calls in today, I
will ask him about Hertzberg.

FYI.  Been trying to get a hold of Hertzberg.  Paged him and called his
office, but they said that he's out of the country and can't be reached.
You got any tips for how to reach him?  You know if his pager works
outside US?

Best,
Jeff
