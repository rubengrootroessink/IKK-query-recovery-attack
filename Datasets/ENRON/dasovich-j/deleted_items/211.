Evening Students,

We're in the process of planning a new event for the fall semester:  A 
Corporate Sponsors Reception.

This event will be hosted by the Evening MBA Program.  All evening students 
will be invited and given two invitations to invite your manager and/or 
your Human Resources/Benefits manager.  The goal is to thank those people 
who are helping to further your education, either by sponsoring your 
tuition or just by providing the time and other resources that make working 
full-time and studying part-time possible.

We have invited Dean Laura Tyson to be the keynote speaker.  It is our goal 
to have other Haas Faculty and Staff there as well.

The date will be Tuesday, October 2, 2001.

I need your opinion on the location, however.  Would you prefer to have the 
event in downtown San Francisco (close to public transit and more central 
to most places of employment) -- or would you prefer to invite your 
managers to visit the Haas School and see where you spend your 
time?  Please weigh in on the choice of venue.  Thank you.

If you have any additional ideas or questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you very much for your time,

Meg
