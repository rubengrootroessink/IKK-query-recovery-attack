Need an interesting project for independent study or for a course project? Consider looking into the Environmental Enterprise Corp. They match MBA student teams with environmental entrepreneurs in Latin America. They have posted available projects on www.ecofinance.net/eec. <http://www.ecofinance.net/eec.html>html <http://www.ecofinance.net/eec.html>. Typical assignments are business plan development or marketing strategies. Travel to the client/country is not required, but not discouraged either (if you have the time and money.)

This information is sent to you without Haas endorsement/approval. If you pursue this you will need to find a Haas faculty member who will accept this project as fulfillment for the requirements for their course(s). This is being sent to you only to make you aware of a potential source of projects that might fit your needs.
