Subject: Draft of DAC letter to Angelides


DAC,

I've attached my first draft of the Angelides letter and am looking forward
to your feedback at your earliest convenience.  I will do my best to
incorporate in as many of your suggestions as possible and hope to have a
revised version sent out to everyone tomorrow morning in advance of our noon
conference call.  

You will also be receiving, under separate email cover, the conference
call-in # for our noon call tomorrow, the draft PUC proposals introduced by
Jeff Dasovich at our meeting today and a brief recap of today's actions.
