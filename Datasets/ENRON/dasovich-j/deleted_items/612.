 Market jitters        [IMAGE]        Emerging markets were jittery. Argent=
ina's government bonds fell sharply as investors fretted about a default. T=
he Brazilian real hit intra-day lows against the dollar in response. Turkey=
's lira fell after the country failed to persuade the IMF to release its la=
test tranche of funds. The Polish zloty and Hungarian forint also weakened.=
 Singapore slipped into recession and its dollar hit an 11-year low against=
 America's.  See article: Gloom over the River Plate  E+  One cause of emer=
ging economies' ills has been the strength of the dollar, which this week h=
it a 16-year high in real trade-weighted terms. The dollar's rise came desp=
ite continued signs of weakness in the American economy. Unemployment in Ju=
ne rose to 4.5%.  See article: The greenback's charm    The German Institut=

ic growth in 2001: a sorry 1%.  See article: No great harm, no good either =
   A meeting of G7 finance ministers concluded on a cheerful note. They sta=
ted hopefully that the world economy, particularly America's, would improve=
 soon.  AT&T's plans to break up into four separate units began with the sp=
in-off of its wireless arm. However, the company's low share price prompted=
 Comcast, an American cable rival, to offer $44.5 billion for AT&T Broadban=
d, which was to have been spun off later this year. The bid boosted AT&T's =
shares; but the company said it would not sell.  See article: Loop dreams  =

 two weeks before he was to have become chief executive of Marconi ,after a=
 profit warning by the beleaguered British telecoms-equipment company. Lord=
 Simpson, the present chief executive, had been expected to become non-exec=
utive chairman but will remain in place for now. Big shareholders also want=
 him to go soon.  See article: Deputy heads will roll    The European Commi=
ssion raided mobile-phone companies in Britain and Germany as part of an in=
vestigation into price-fixing on international charges in both countries.  =
 Compaq Computer, the world's second-biggest PC maker, gave a warning that =
profits in its latest quarter would be down sharply. America's economic slo=
wdown has intensified competition, and troubles have spread to Europe. A re=
port from Merrill Lynch suggested further gloom; companies are spending les=
s on IT and delaying upgrades.  Microsoft is to allow PC makers more freedo=
m to change the Windows desktop. The software giant's move follows an appea=
ls court ruling criticising its Windows monopoly; it may thereby hope to im=
prove its negotiating position in settlement talks over the government's an=
titrust suit.  Baltimore Technologies, once one of the most admired Interne=
t companies, shed its chief executive, Fran Rooney. The Irish Internet-secu=
rity company, once worth ?5.1 billion ($8 billion), suffered a mini-collaps=
e of its ever dwindling share price that took its value to as low as ?120m.=
  Webvan, an American online grocer once valued at $8.7 billion, said that =
it would close with the loss of 2,000 jobs. The company had slowed its loss=
es by abandoning extravagant expansion plans, but could not do enough to of=
fset a rapid decline in orders.        [IMAGE]        Real Madrid paid a re=
cord euro77m ($66m) for Zinedine Zidane, a French international. The Spanis=
h football club financed the deal and paid off debts by selling its trainin=

British government blocked an ?18 billion ($25 billion) bid by Lloyds TSB f=

tory investigation for its handling of initial public offerings, ousted its=
 chief executive, Allen Wheat. He will be replaced by John Mack, former pre=

Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, made a poor showing on its own stockmarket d=
ebut. Its shares, traded on all three exchanges, fell by 8.5% on the first =
day despite being priced at the low end of the range.   Merrill Lynch, Amer=
