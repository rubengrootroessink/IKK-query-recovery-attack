You asked, you received.  I've given a bunch of written material to Alan fo=
r his review as well.  He apparently has also been charged with developing =
a budget of sorts.  You may want to put the turd in his pocket as it seems =
he is a bit low on work. =20

Sorry.  Here are the budget documents from 2001, 2000, 1999.  Be thankful I=
 didn't send you the budget from 1998.  I'd start with the most recent 2001=
 budgets, then work backwards. =20
