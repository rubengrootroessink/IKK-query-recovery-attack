Confusion stamps postal ecommerce

Managers charged with expanding the U.S. Postal Service's 
ecommerce activities aren't delivering, a new congressional 
study says.

A report by the General Accounting Office faults the USPS for 
"difficulty defining, identifying and classifying its 
Internet-related initiatives." Financial information about the 
efforts is also not "complete, accurate and consistent." The 
Postal Service has been studying how to implement electronic 
bill paying, online confirmation of deliveries and postal 
product sales. However, the GAO found "fragmentation, 
inconsistency and poor performance." The deputy postmaster 
general responded saying he would take action to address the 
problems, the GAO said.

Yahoo media chief to leave

The vice president of Yahoo's media and leisure division will 
leave the company in February. David Graves, who lives in 
Massachusetts, said he had tired of the travel to headquarters 
in Sunnyvale, Calif. Graves' departure occurs as Yahoo 
reorganizes its business divisions and cuts back on activities, 
including multimedia production. Yahoo said it plans to look for 
a successor for Graves.

 Yahoo jobs deal worries CareerBuilder

The online job listing service owned by Knight Ridder Inc. and 
the Tribune Co. is wondering what happens now that Yahoo has a 
deal to acquire HotJobs.com. CareerBuilder has a contract with 
Yahoo, making it the sole provider of job ads on Yahoo Careers, 
according to the Washington Post. "It's an exclusive contract 
and we expect them to honor (it)," said spokesman Barry 
Lawrence. Analysts suggested Yahoo is likely to try to buy its 
way out of the deal. "I am sure anything is negotiable for a 
price," Jeff Fieler, a consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns 
& Co., told the Post.

Eshopping season posts 36% rise

Ecommerce during the holiday season was worth a record $6.6 
billion, according to comparison-shopping Web site Bizrate.com. 
The total is 31% greater than Bizrate forecast, and is 36% 
greater than last year's online sales. "BizRate.com expects the 
momentum to continue into the New Year as consumers take 
advantage of the post-holiday clearance sales," the company 
added. The average online shopper's spending also increase, from 
$112.13 last year to $126.77 this year.
