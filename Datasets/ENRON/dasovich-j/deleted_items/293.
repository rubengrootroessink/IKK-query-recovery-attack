Hey gang--
I couldn't convince Rob to join us... boo hoo. Jeff Walker and I are
confirmed. We will be sharing a room but since many of the rooms/suites
are so large anyone else is more than welcome to join us. I will be
organizing the room today and will probably book a large one should one
of you want to join us. Here are the ones I am considering. Let me know
what you think.  The web site to view the rooms is

Hello all,
 
I made a reservation at Cleone Gardens Inn, just across the street from
the ranch.  I reserved a room for Pat, Cal and myself, but was unsure
what other reservations to make for the rest of the group because some
of you are still tentative and I'm not sure who is bringing SOs/dates.  
 
The inn has one room called the Blue Iris room with two double beds that
might work for Jeff W. and Jeff D. if going up single; most of their
other rooms have a queen or king bed (the Meadow View king room sounded
nice for a couple if we have any going up).  Both of those are still
available for the weekend we are planning to be there.  I think there
may be some cottages available also for multiple people, but I'm not
sure what the configurations of those are.  A full breakfast can be
ordered from some of the rooms for $14.00 extra.  They serve breakfast
at 8:00 a.m.  Pat, Cal and I have a suite with a small kitchen, so we
may also be able to host some minimal meals/snacks/drinks.  
 
The phone number of Cleone Gardens is 1-800-400-2189.  Their website,
which has pictures and descriptions of their rooms, is
cleonegardensinn.com.  If the Cleone Gardens Inn does not have the room
configuration you want, Lari's website (horse-vacations.com) has links
to numerous other hotels and B&Bs.
 
Tally ho!
 
Amy

Hi All: 

Madeleine was kind about me not keeping up with personal emails .... 


I am putting the Mendocino dates on my calendar. I would like to ride
both days. I would also like to stay where everyone will be happiest ;) 
Howard's Creek is great, but I agree with Pat, that we just won't have
the time to enjoy the place (or breakfast). 

BTW - Are any non-riders coming?? 

Jeff.
