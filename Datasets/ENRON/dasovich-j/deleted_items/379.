Market manipulator. Poster child for California's energy woes. Member of th=
e Texas cabal shaking down West Coast consumers. As the Golden State's ener=
gy debacle picked up speed this spring, El Paso Corp. suddenly found itself=
 cast in the role of Public Enemy No. 1. State and federal regulators are i=
nvestigating charges that El Paso used its control of a key pipeline to sha=
rply boost the price of natural gas flowing into the state. El Paso says it=
 certainly didn't manipulate the market and blames higher prices on Califor=
nia's unique energy problems. Still, investors have reacted to the possibil=
ity of millions of dollars in fines--and now quickly falling natural gas pr=
ices--by knocking the company's stock down 33% this year.=20
All the headlines about legal troubles, however, are obscuring how well har=
d-charging Chief Executive William A. Wise, 56, has positioned El Paso in t=
he rapidly mutating energy business. Ironically, El Paso was left holding t=
he excess California pipeline capacity only because a big customer had deci=
ded in 1995 to dump it. That blow nearly sank El Paso and sent Wise off on =
a diversification strategy that has taken the company from a sleepy little =
regional outfit to one of the biggest players in the energy bonanza. Housto=
n-based El Paso grew from $2.9 billion in revenues in 1995 to $21.9 billion=
 in 2000, and will pass $50 billion this year. Its earnings of $652 million=
 last year reversed a $255 million loss the year before.
In the process, El Paso has become North America's largest pipeline company=
 and the nation's fourth-largest energy outfit, with a hand in everything f=
rom natural gas exploration and production, to wholesale power and gas trad=
ing, to power generation. It is also pushing to become a major player in th=
e growing market for liquefied natural gas. On July 25, El Paso reported a =
40% increase in second-quarter income, to $413 million, on sales of $13.4 b=
illion. The stock price, however, remains in the doldrums, hovering around =
$48 a share. Falling prices have hurt much of the sector: Rival Enron Corp.=
 is off 48% this year while Dynegy Inc. is down 23%.=20
Even if the company is forced to cough up a big fine--and no one is specula=
ting how big that fine could be--many analysts and investors doubt that wil=
l crimp Wise's diversification push. ``El Paso is the biggest and best-posi=
tioned [company] to take advantage of the nation's natural gas supply crunc=
h,'' says Donald Coxe, chairman of Harris Investment Management Inc. in Chi=
cago, which owns El Paso shares.=20
Wise really had no choice but to branch out. In the mid-'90s, Pacific Gas &=
 Electric Corp. and other utilities were paying millions of dollars for cap=
acity they couldn't use because overbuilding had led to a huge pipeline glu=
t. With the blessing of friendly state regulators, PG&E and others gave up =
their pipeline rights, with PG&E returning 1.14 billion cubic feet a day of=
 capacity to El Paso. In one stroke, that erased $125 million of El Paso's =
annual revenue. FRUGALITY AND LUCK. Wise worked quickly to put El Paso back=
 on a firm footing. He slashed $100 million in costs, in part by laying off=
 more than a third of El Paso's employees, freezing executives' pay, and ta=
king no salary himself for three years. He also negotiated a $60 million se=
ttlement with PG&E and the other utilities for dumping the capacity. By las=
t year, the situation had shifted 180 degrees. As demand jumped and Califor=
nia faced skyrocketing energy costs, that same pipeline space had become a =
precious commodity. And El Paso was in the driver's seat as the state's lar=
gest gas supplier. ``That's what's so ironic now. The capacity that everybo=
dy's complaining about in California was basically the capacity that PG&E g=
ave back,'' says H. Brent Austin, El Paso's chief financial officer.=20
More important, Wise, who declined to be interviewed, set out on an aggress=
ive new strategy to diversify away from California--which had delivered 75%=
 of El Paso's revenues before 1996. Wise had spent his entire career at El =
Paso, joining in 1970 out of the University of Colorado School of Law and t=
aking over the CEO's post in 1990. His shopping spree began in 1996 when he=
 scooped up Tenneco Inc.'s pipeline business. The $4 billion deal tripled E=
l Paso's size and gave it the only coast-to-coast natural gas pipeline. In =
all, Wise has snapped up some $35 billion worth of acquisitions in five yea=
rs, including his biggest, the $24 billion purchase in January of Coastal C=
orp. That substantially boosted El Paso's exploration and production operat=
ions, expanded its capacity to some 60,000 miles of pipeline nationwide, an=
d added oil refining to the company's mix. Along the way, El Paso also has =
bought interests in some 44 natural gas-fired power plants across the count=
ry. BALANCE OF POWER. Today, such nonregulated businesses as natural gas ma=
rketing and trading operations, exploration and production, and the power p=
lants account for more than 60% of El Paso's earnings before interest and t=
axes, vs. 8% in 1996. Analysts say the new El Paso's ``wellhead-to-wire'' o=
perations give it a big advantage over Enron, Dynegy, and other competitors=
 at a time when the power industry is rapidly changing and clean-burning na=
tural gas is growing in popularity. Meanwhile, its wide-reaching stable of =
assets means it doesn't have to rely on high natural gas prices, which have=
 dropped roughly 70% nationwide since the beginning of the year.=20
But it's that very mutifaceted structure that may have landed El Paso in ho=
t water in California. State regulators allege that the company's pipeline =
unit, El Paso Natural Gas, rigged a pipeline-capacity auction last year in =
favor of its energy-marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy Group. Reg=
ulators charge that the two wholly owned units passed secret information be=
tween them that helped the merchant group's bid. Federal hearings on this c=
harge are to begin on Aug. 2. Ralph Eads III, the merchant group's presiden=
t, counters that ``the pipeline [unit] didn't have any say-so over whose bi=
d it took, it just said whose bid was the highest. Our bid was the highest.=
 There are [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] rules that govern the beh=
avior between our pipeline and our marketing affiliate. And we are very scr=
upulous in observing those rules.''=20
In their second allegation, authorities claim that the company withheld pip=
eline capacity into California to jack up prices illegally; a judge's rulin=
g is expected in October. Regulators note that spot prices for natural gas =
in Southern California spiked to more than double national spot rates. ``A =
big reason for the increase in consumers' electricity bills is because El P=
aso manipulated prices at the California border,'' alleges Harvey Y. Morris=
, the state utilities commission attorney arguing the case before FERC.=20
Eads denies El Paso withheld capacity. Instead, the company blames the runu=
p in natural gas prices in Southern California on an unusually hot summer l=
ast year and a cold winter this year, low reserves, rising electricity dema=
nd, and a now-inadequate pipeline system into the state. In any case, Eads =
says, El Paso didn't fully benefit from rising prices because the merchant =
group shipped 95% of its gas under fixed-price contracts as a hedge against=
 a possible price drop. ``As prices went up, we lost money,'' says Eads. ``=
If we were smart enough to manipulate the market, we would have been smart =
enough not to have hedged.''=20
Maybe so. Either way, given the company's smart transformation over the pas=
t five years, El Paso seems well-prepared to ride out whatever twists Calif=
ornia has in store for it.

We are committed to India. We are not in any discussion right now on sellin=
g the plant... -- Kenneth Lay, Chairman, Enron, after the companys annual m=
eeting in Houston on May 2, 2001.=20
BARELY a couple of months after pledging the company`s commitment towards I=
ndia when Kenneth Lay last week expressed Enrons desire to get out of the t=
roubled Dabhol Power Company.
But it evoked hardly any reaction in Maharashtra or among industry watchers=
 as Enron International had already announced its corporate strategy of wan=
ting to pull out of developing countries and Lays statement that it wants t=
o leave the Konkan coast was seen as a yet another move by the company to b=
ully the government.=20
So a combative union power minister Suresh Prabhu retorted that ``Enron is =
not the only US company operating in India.=20
There are at least six other US companies currently operating in the power =
sector in India. Although AES has recently expressed reservations about ope=
rations in Orissa it wants to invest in other states.=20
Enron watchers are of the view that it is difficult for MSEB and the US ene=
rgy major to get rid of each other. Enron has 20-year contracts for 2.1m to=
nnes a year of LNG for use in its power plant, with Oman LNG and Abu Dhabi =
Gas Liquefaction Company, and Lay admitted that Enron might prefer to seek =
other buyers.=20
And its been getting increasingly difficult for the company to launch into =
yet another round of tiring renegotiations with the state government, an ex=
ercise it has done twice in the past.=20
However, the most crucial question is: Where are the buyers? The Maharashtr=
a government has tried to pose the entire controversy as an issue which can=
 be solved only if the centre steps in either by bailing it out or by allow=
ing a central power utility like NTPC to buy it.=20
If Enron prefers to pack up, the state has already steered clear of its res=
ponsibility of finding a new buyer.=20
The states energy minister Padmasinh Patils view that Enrons departure ``wi=
ll be Gods biggest blessing for us, underlines the states intransigent stan=
ce.=20
However, Madhav Godbole, the man who is heading the Enron renegotiation pan=
el, when asked to comment, was realistic in judging the situation. Realisin=
g Enrons game plan Mr Godbole indicated that ``the next meeting (of the ren=
egotiating committee) will not be necessary now.=20
He knew that if Enron were really serious about its withdrawal plan it woul=
d stay away from the next meeting. And if it really did so, the job of the =
committee becomes much easier.=20
Vinay Bansal, chairman MSEB, who single handedly brought the US energy majo=
r to its knees, was cautious in his reaction.=20
``Since we have rescinded the PPA with Enron, we have no locus standi on th=
is issue, he said. However, is MSEB interested in buying out Enrons state i=
n the project? And does MSEB have the required financial muscle to buy out =
Enrons equity. ``Its too early to react, said Bansal.=20
The Godbole committee will be meeting soon internally to decide the future =
course of action, Godbole said. Vinay Mohan Lal, the states energy secretar=
y hinted that considering the Enrons desire, the state might submit an inte=
rim report.=20
What it means is that if the company sticks to its stand on the issue, the =
committee may release its report unilaterally, obviously blaming the compan=
y for the failure of the talks.=20
Godbole said the committee, which has been set up to renegotiate the PPA si=
gned between the US energy major and MSEB would have to review the entire s=
ituation after DPC made a public announcement about its desire to exit and =
sell the plant to the union government or the lenders.=20
Enron had said that the best approach to resolve the protracted dispute bet=
ween DPC and MSEB was to sell its entire stake in the project to the centre=
 or the lenders and that any sale would need to be on terms of providing co=
mplete recovery of capital costs and related expenditures.=20
The Centre has asked FIs led by the IDBI to work out a package in this rega=
rd. The package is to be submitted to a committee chaired by the finance se=
cretary Ajit Kumar.=20
However, the centre has ruled out any possibility at this stage of a buyout=
 by a central utility. In fact Prabhu said, ``We are not going to allow a c=
ompany like NTPC or PTC to buy out such equity. The state government and En=
ron have to try and resolve their issue.=20
According to Patil, power ministers of four states have evinced interest in=
 purchasing power generated from DPC, provided the tariff per unit was belo=
w Rs 2.50.=20
Madhya Pradesh was willing to buy 100 mw, Karnataka 300 mw, Delhi 150 mw an=
d Haryana 100 mw. The state was not in a position to absorb power from phas=
e II of the project and there was an urgent need for the centre to interven=
e in the project.
