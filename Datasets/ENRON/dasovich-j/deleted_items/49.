Email Notification of Library Holds and Recalls Is Now Available

The UCB Library has implemented an email notification feature into the 
circulation system. This permits students and faculty to be notified quickly 
by email when a book is overdue or when a recalled book has become available. 
Log on to the Patron Update webpage at
(http://sunsite2.berkeley.edu/patronupdate)
to see if your email address is correct, then click the "yes" button to 
activate this feature.

This is a service that a group of Haas operations research students studied
and
make recommendations about several years ago.
