Lycos redesign caters to advertisers

Terra Lycos  reorganized its Web properties Monday to offer 
users a "magazine" format and advertisers greater precision in 
reaching consumers.

Several of the Lycos properties' home pages, including 
Angelfire.com, Familyzone.lycos.com and Holidays.lycos.com, have 
been reorganized to highlight news and information, rather than 
listing resources and columns of links.

"The new sites let advertisers target highly desirable life 
stages groups by putting their messages in front of users who 
are drawn to 'magazine cover' formats that aggregate the hottest 
news, tips and other content drawn from sites across the network 
as well as content partners," said Stephen Killeen, president of 
Terra Lycos U.S. "We are trying to deliver (the) audience and 
put it in meaningful buckets for advertisers," added Rich 
Gotham, vice president for sales, Reuters reported.

Killeen also said Lycos has seen strength in Internet 
advertising sales, but could not be sure it was a result of 
renewed business confidence or holiday seasonality. He told 
Reuters the company will have more to say about advertising 
sales when the company reports quarterly results later this 
week.

AOL gets its way with Burger King

Diageo Plc's Burger King and AOL Time Warner  announced a 
multi-year marketing agreement. The companies said it is 
designed to build customer loyalty and increase sales at the 
fast food company's 8,300 stores in the U.S. One strategy will 
be to give Burger King customers codes that will allow them to 
access special sites through America Online www.burgerking.com, 
where sports and music promotions will be offered. Further, AOL 
is developing a "BK Backstage" custom site that will give users 
music and video content, free music downloads and chats with 
recording artists. Financial terms of the agreement were not 
disclosed.

United Way taps Web for help

United Way organizations across the country are hoping the 
Internet will deliver an infusion of funds at a time when 
contributions have fallen off. The United Way is launching One 
Day's Pay, an Internet-based solicitation asking people to 
contribute all or a potion of a day's pay to local charities. 
"The dramatic downturn in the economy ... has had a major 
negative effect upon local giving, at a time when people are 
looking for more help, not less," said Mark Germano, vice 
president of the United Way in Chicago. Another local United Way 
unit president said the drive is not meant to replace the units' 
annual fund raising. "Participate in that and give more 
generously than ever," said Maria Chavez of the Orange County, 
Calif., chapter.

provider of career content for Microsoft's  MSN at 
http://www.careers.msn.com/. Monster.com said it lists 1 million 
job opportunities from 100,000 employers.
