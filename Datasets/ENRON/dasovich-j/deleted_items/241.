We got the first draft of Ben Zycher's abstract on the politics and economics of the CA energy problems.  (The paper is scheduled to be released in late Sept.) I had pushed for an abstract to be released in August in time to help forstall bad things on direct access.  Here is the draft abstract which is exceeding turgid.

I highlighted some key direct access statements. It has some good things to say about DA mixed in with all the econobabble.

I have pressed upon the Pacific Research Institute the need to get some media hype on this -- starting no later than Monday.  Gary Ackerman (650) 324-3250 is taking the lead in working with PRI.  I suggested a press release attaching the abstract.  I asked Gary to work with Jeff and Karen in my absence.
