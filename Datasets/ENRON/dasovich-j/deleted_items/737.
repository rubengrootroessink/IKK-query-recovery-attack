Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science doesn't always equate with good investment
opportunity. Generations of investors have been burned
and rewarded for taking risks on the potential of early-
stage therapies.  The drug discovery process is a complex
combination of tests and hurdles for young companies.
Where are the signposts for investors?  James Reddoch of
Banc of America Securities will moderate a special
roundtable dedicated to drug research and discovery at
this year's Healthcare Outlook Conference.  The experience
of the panelists reflects the complex considerations of
modern research and development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by
Michael Grey of Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta
Partners, Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell
Harmison, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services.

* Digital Island Veterans Launch Proficient Networks
By Michelle Tsai <mailto:tsai@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=IHJPOPJNII> 	
SAN FRANCISCO -- Proficient Networks, a provider of network management appliances that enable companies to route network traffic based on their access policies, has launched and expects to ship its first product by the end of the year, CEO Allan Leiwand told VentureWire.

The firm, which has been in stealth mode since its formation in February 2001, secured $6 million in Series A funding from Canaan Partners and El Dorado Ventures in May, Mr. Leiwand said. Proficient has used new funds for product development and shipment, and expects its staff to grow from 20 to 80 or 100 in about a year. Proficient will also seek $10 million to $20 million in Series B next year.

Deepak Kamra, general partner at Canaan Partners, and Charles Beeler, general partner at El Dorado Ventures, serve as directors on the board along with Mr. Leiwand and CTO Bruce Pinsky. The company is looking to add outside directors to the board.

Proficient is developing an appliance that will enable companies to manage routing policy according to business objectives. Targeted customers include Fortune 1000 financial services and high tech companies. 

Mr. Kamra said Canaan Partners invested in the firm because the market for network management tools continues to grow despite the economic downturn, as corporate networks and multi-home networks grow increasingly complex. Proficient Networks uses an appliance model, unlike its competitors, which employ service provider models that have proven to be capital-intensive, Mr. Kamra said. 

Canaan Partners, which invested $2.75 million in the Series A, will reinvest in the company's next round of funding. Proficient will begin fund-raising, targeting $10 million to $20 million in Series B funding in the first half of 2002.

Messrs. Leiwand and Pinsky co-founded Proficient along with Madeline Chan and Robert Bays. This team of executives all worked at Digital Island, which went public in 1999 and was acquired by Cable & Wireless earlier this year, and Telegis Networks, a well-funded startup that went out of business earlier this year as the bottom fell out of the Web-hosting market. 

Prior to Proficient Networks, Mr. Leiwand served as chief technology officer for Telegis Networks and Digital Island, and as manager of consulting engineering at Cisco. 

Mr. Pinsky was vice president of development and network infrastructure for Telegis Networks, chief network strategist and chief information officer at Digital Island, and senior internetwork support technologist for Cisco. 

Ms. Chan, Proficient's vice president of strategy and marketing, was vice president of strategy and business development at Telegis Networks and director of strategy and business planning at Digital Island. Mr. Bays, chief scientist, was a senior network engineer at Telegis Networks and at Digital Island.

* Netegrity to Acquire DataChannel in $54 Million Deal
By Jeffrey Sanders <mailto:sanders@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=LHNKONJNII> 	
WALTHAM, MASS. -- Netegrity, a publicly traded provider of applications for securely managing e-business relationships, said it signed an agreement to acquire Bellevue, Wash.-based DataChannel, a privately held provider of enterprise portal technology in a deal worth about $54 million. 

Netegrity will pay with $15 million in cash and 2.5 million shares of stock worth just under $40 million. DataChannel's Bellevue office will remain open, but Netegrity expects to reduce staff at DataChannel in the future. DataChannel's current headcount is approximately 120. 

At least two executives from DataChannel will stay during the transition period: Lucie?J.?Fjeldstad, president and CEO, and Jim?Beach, chief financial officer and senior vice president. 

A DataChannel spokesperson said the company recently closed a round of funding, but would not disclose further details. The spokesperson also said that the deal includes Netegrity becoming the sole reseller of DataChannel products until the deal is finalized. At that time, Netegrity will rebrand existing DataChannel products as its own.

DataChannel was backed by AT&T, Deloitte Consulting, Bain Capital, Cisco Systems, Deutsche Bank, IBM, U.S. Venture Partners, Weiss, VanW agoner, and XMLFund.

* Telcordia Spinout Telelogue Raising $10 Million Series B
By Jeffrey Sanders <mailto:sanders@venturewire.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=NOLOKHINII> 	
ISELIN, N.J. -- Telelogue, a spinout from Telcordia Technologies that offers software applications to enable telephone users to search databases and directories, has begun raising its Series B round, according to chief operating officer Robert Burke.

The round, which began 30 days ago, aims to raise $10 million by mid-December, said Mr. Burke. Past lead investor Pequot Capital has committed to the round, though it will not return as the lead. The proceeds of the round will be used for working capital, including developing a sales and marketing team.

Telelogue has raised $3.7 million to date. Its Series A closed in October 2000, giving the company a post-money valuation of $9.2 million. Mr. Burke said he expects the Series B to be an up round. The only other previous investor was iPoint Ventures, a firm Mr. Burke founded and recently closed.

iPoint was founded to work in conjunction with Pequot-led spinouts of Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Telcordia Technologies. iPoint's only investment was $100,000 in Telelogue, though it also worked with Network Design Tools, another Telcordia spinout backed by Pequot. iPoint never announced any deals with HP.

Mr. Burke said he decided close iPoint and dedicate his time to Telelogue because of the possibilities to build the company. At present, Telelogue employs 20.

Mr. Burke, who joined Telelogue as vice president of development and general counsel, was recently promoted to be the company's first COO; he still oversees the responsibilities of his past positions. 

Telelogue's five member board of directors will be restructured as a result of the Series B round, Mr. Burke said, adding that Pequot's two seats will be reduced to one to accommodate a new investor. Richard DeMillo, chief technical officer of HP, also sits on the board.

RESEARCH TRIANGLE, N.C. -- Kyma Technologies, which develops and supplies nitride substrates for use in optoelectronics, communications, and microelectronics industries, has raised $2.6 million in its Series A, according to president and CEO Ed Pupa.

Mr. Pupa said the round was led by a consortium of past individual investors. Other contributors included new investor Precision Ventures and return investor RM Management. All past investors returned for the round. The company will use the money for product development. 

The CEO would not reveal the company's valuation, but did say it increased significantly since its last round, pushing the post-money valuation past $10 million. Rick Strickland, general partner at Precision, has become the sixth member of the board as a result of the financing. 

Mr. Pupa said the company is not generating product revenue yet, adding that he expects the company to release its first product mid-year 2002 and to start generating revenue by summer 2002. Kyma, which employs 14, had previously raised $550,000. The company might seek Series B funds next summer. 

Kyma was founded in 1998 as a spinoff from North Carolina State's Department of Materials Science and Engineering.

* Drug Discovery Firm AmberGen Looks For First VC
By Taran Provost <mailto:provost@technologicp.com>	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=INMLIMINII> 	
BOSTON -- AmberGen, a drug discovery company that has been operating since 1994, said it is raising a Series A round of venture capital funding to develop its technology further.

According to AmberGen COO Norman Priebatsch, the company hopes to raise between $4 million and $6 million in the round. The funds will be used to develop what it calls an integrated high-throughput system for drug screening, which incorporates engineered cell-free expressed proteins. 

Mr. Priebatsch said the company is in talks with VC firms but has yet to receive a term sheet. He said AmberGen is now operating with about $2 million in funds from the National Institutes of Health and the Dept. of Defense. The two organizations previously provided the company with $7 million in Small Business Innovation grants. 

Using its system, the company says individual proteins coded for by each gene can be expressed, detected, purified, and analyzed with considerable savings in time and money. The company says its technology can be used for screening new drug candidates against proteins for potential interactions, finding new drug candidates by screening target protein against other proteins, and for other purposes. 

AmberGen is generating revenue through collaborations and by providing pharmaceutical companies with custom-made proteins for drug screening purposes. It is burning through about $750,000 per year, Mr. Priebatsch said. It was founded in 1994 and has eleven employees.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Flywheel Communications, a provider of document management software, has shut down, a company spokesperson said.

The staff of approximately 30 has been laid off and the company is in discussions with investors to salvage the company, the spokesperson said. The company launched in February and raised about $10 million in venture capital from Goldman Sachs, Hildebrandt International, VantagePoint Venture Partners, and individual investors.

Flywheel targeted legal and medical customers for its software, but it became hard to sell high-end tools to companies when companies were cutting back on costs, the spokesperson said.

Former Netscape Communications general counsel Roberta Katz, former SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, and former general counsel for APCO Associates Jim Jones founded the company earlier this year.

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Most of the original management team has left RLX Technologies, a supplier of Web servers founded earlier this year by ex-Compaq computer executives. Earlier this week VentureWire reported that Michael Swavely, formerly president and chief operating officer, had left the company last week, and that Gary Stimac, chairman and CEO, will step down from the CEO position. Company spokesperson Patrick Kimball confirmed that there have been additional executive departures. 

Among those leaving were chief financial officer, J Tempesta; vice president of development, Keith McAuliffe; vice president of systems engineering, Ronnie Ward; and vice president of business development, Bob Jackson. The company said it will seek replacements.

A spokesperson said that the executives chose to leave the firm as RLX underwent restructuring. In August, the company laid off 17% of its staff, or 20 employees, citing a slow market for IT products. 

RLX Technologies has raised $59 million in financing from ComVentures, IBM, Ignition, Soros Private Equity Partners, and Sternhill Partners.

Mr. Rubin, 42, joins the company from E-Sync, where he was CEO. He was introduced to IntellectExchange through technology executive search firm the Onstott Group, based in Wellesley, Mass. He has also been named to the company's three-member board.

The CEO said that the company is raising its final piece of seed funding for $1.5 million. He expects to close the round by the end of the year. The company has raised $2.5 million from individual investors to date. The money will be used for sales and marketing and product development. The company could go after its Series A as early as the second quarter of 2002, he said. 

Mr. Rubin said the company is in the early stages of talking to two different companies about acquiring them. Both companies approached IntellectExchange, he said, adding, that if the deals were to be done, they would be in the form of cash and stock.
