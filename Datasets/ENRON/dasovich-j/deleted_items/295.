Subject: Urgent: Revised Letter to Angelides et al


DAC members,

You should find that the attached letter incorporates the changes that we
agreed to on today's conference call.  Please notify me immediately if any
of the content is a problem for you.  Please note that I have listed ALL
members of the DAC as signatories to the letter.  The final thing I need
from you is emailed approval from each of your orgs to send the document
with your group listed on it.
If you do not want your organization listed on this letter, or if I have
inadvertently left yours off, please let me know ASAP.  Edelman plans to
disseminate the letter by COB tomorrow.  Thanks for your prompt attention to
this.
