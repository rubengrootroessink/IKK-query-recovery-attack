The Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee will take up the
folling items next week pending approval of the Rules Committee:

Tuesday, August 21 - 1:30 p.m.

Informational Hearing: "A Review of DWR's Electricity Rate Agreement"

Wednesday, August 22 - 1:30 p.m.

AB 1233 (Pescetti) This bill would prohibit assessment of local transmission
rates on natural gas if (a) it is delivered to an end-use customer, (b) it
is delivered through a transmission system owned by another entity  that is
not interconnected with a local utility transmission system, and (c) it is
blended with gas supplies produced from an in-state source for the purposes
of achieving a usable thermal rate.  The bill would require the commission
to administer this provision in a manner that prohibits any cost shift to
core customers resulting from the rate exemption required under the bill.

ABX2 14 (Canciamilla) This bill exempts certain natural gas producers,
suppliers and transporters from the definition of a public utility as
described in Public Utilities Code Sections 216, 222 and 228.  Specifically,
this bill; (1) provides that a public utility does not include a gas
producer, supplier or transporter if the gas produced is of insufficient
quality or heating value to make it acceptable for introduction into the gas
line, plant or system of a gas corporation and if the natural gas is not
provided for sale to more than five end users, 2)provides that a "gas
corporation" does not include a producer, supplier or transporter as defined
in item #1 above, 3)provides that a "pipeline corporation" does not include
a producer, supplier or transporter as defined in item #1 above (4)
establishes that entities covered by the exemption from public utility
status as gas suppliers, producers or transporters are subject to
jurisdiction of the CPUC with regard to safety, service quality, and
consumer protection, and
5)requires these exempt entities to apply the public goods charge to end use
customers, as applicable.

ABX2 30 (Dutra) This bill would amend CPUC act to authorize a public entity
to assume from a public utility the work of relocating utilities that
relates to a project of the public entity if the public utility defaults on
executing utility relocation work under a relocation agreement with the
public entity in connection with a transit or transportation capital
improvement project, and would authorize the public entity to issue
contracts with another qualified entity to conduct the utility relocation
work. The bill would require a public utility to reimburse the public entity
for the utility's share of the costs of the relocation work in accordance
with the relocation agreement with the public entity.
