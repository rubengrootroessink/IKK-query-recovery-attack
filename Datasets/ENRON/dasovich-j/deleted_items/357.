Energy Committee Members & Liaison Representatives:

When we began our endeavor on energy more than a year ago we presented to
our Board of Directors a commitment to reduce our energy consumption by 10%,
an expression of our dedication to the Silicon Valley during its energy
crisis.  Furthermore, the SVMG and a number of individual member companies
also signed on to the Energy Conservation Declaration of Action, increasing
our commitment to conserve.

In an attempt to assess our efforts on energy conservation, and to present
them to Carl Guardino and our Board of Directors, we are asking that you
provide to the SVMG a very brief (one paragraph) quantitative summary of
your company's energy efficiency results over the past year.  This is your
opportunity to be recognized for all the hard work you have done to help
California survive its energy crisis.

We are interested in the following information:
-Adjusted for weather differences, how much less energy did your
organization use this year vs. last year
-What measures did you take to achieve this reduction (be specific)
-Tell us of any unique or cutting edge approaches or technologies you have
used
-What are the greatest obstacles and frustrations you have encountered
during this process

We are hoping to receive at least 20 responses from our 190 member
companies.  Many of you are already aware of how well you have done and are
ready to share your success stories with us.  We look forward to hearing
them.  Please send your summaries to lgoldseth@svmg.org by close of business
on Friday, August 10.

Thank you & Best regards,
Justin Bradley
