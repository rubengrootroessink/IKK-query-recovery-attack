	VentureWire Alert <http://alert.venturewire.com> 	 For Jeffrey Dasovich, Enron 	


VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Even as investments slow, top VC firms are still out raising more capital. VentureWire has learned that RRE Ventures, co-founded by James D. Robinson III, the former chairman and CEO of American Express, plans to close $200 million to $250 million for its latest fund by the end of the year. The firm also added Rich McGinn, former Lucent CEO, as an adviser. And Applied Materials remains undaunted by the recent difficulties of corporate investment units. The semiconductor firm plans to set up a venture capital fund to invest in new chip technologies.

Eleven companies did manage to raise nearly $125 million to close last week. Napster, which recently cut 15% of its staff, got a reported $25 million in additional financing from its prime benefactor, Bertelsmann. Also topping the list were mobile firm, Flarion Technologies, which pulled in $45 million and digital image sensor maker, Pixim, which got $16.5 million. 

With the tough times investment banks are facing, it's no surprise that LabMorgan, a technology investment unit of JPMorgan Chase, is adjusting to the chilly investment climate. JPMorgan installed a new chief, while cutting staff and tightening its investment criteria.

Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science doesn't always equate with good investment
opportunity. Generations of investors have been burned
and rewarded for taking risks on the potential of early-
stage therapies.  The drug discovery process is a complex
combination of tests and hurdles for young companies.
Where are the signposts for investors?  James Reddoch of
Banc of America Securities will moderate a special
roundtable dedicated to drug research and discovery at
this year's Healthcare Outlook Conference.  The experience
of the panelists reflects the complex considerations of
modern research and development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by
Michael Grey of Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta
Partners, Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell
Harmison, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services.
