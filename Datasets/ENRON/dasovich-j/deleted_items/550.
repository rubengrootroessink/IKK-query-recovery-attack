did i mention that rental fees to use the truck are $67/day?

that aside, our net account is now:

Nancy owes Jeff for Abalone ($67/entree)      =    $149,756.39
Jeff owes Nancy for parking fees ($67/day)    =            $189.00
Nancy owes Jeff                          $149,567.39


Also, thanks a million for the delicious dinner, the very competitive game
of spades, letting me do my laundry, and compelling conversation about
watery/non-watery tomatoes.

Best,
Jeff

You back at work???
