How to Get Ready Today to Get Bought Tomorrow

Mergers and acquisitions will pick up again, perhaps
before IPOs do, and few know more about preparing for
such an exit strategy than Ammar Hanafi, Matt L'Heureux,
Steve Smith, and Les Vadasz. Currently advising HP on
its $21 billion takeover of Compaq, Matt heads Goldman's
worldwide technology M&A. Steve built Broadview's
Silicon Valley business. Les, head of Intel Capital,
and Ammar, his counterpart at Cisco, run two of the
world's most extensive corporate development and
acquisition programs. You'd be hard-pressed to find four
more qualified to tell you how to find the right
corporate partner and make the relationship work. For
straight talk from the voices of authority, register

Saving Costs via Optics

With capital scarce and bandwidth aplenty, optical
components manufacturers face tough market conditions.
Now, systems companies are focusing on reducing costs
and helping carrier do more with the capacity they

trend. At Optical Portfolio, you'll hear from startups
such as Symmorphix, Telephotonics and Proximion Fiber
Optics, which are using integration, tunability, and
real-time network monitoring to create more intelligent
and efficient optical networks.

A funny thing happened on the way to the market

The resources necessary to conduct clinical trials
require an enormous investment and small road bumps
in the drug approval process can kill a promising drug.
For many start-ups, one strike means you're out.  New
technologies and business models, however, promise to
dramatically change trial management.  This year's
Healthcare Outlook will look at the impact of clinical
trials on emerging companies as well as the investment
opportunities available in companies that look to change
the status quo. Healthcare Outlook's Private Equity
Platform has dedicated a special track that will feature
management presentations by early-stage companies looking
to improve the clinical trial process.  In addition, the
meeting will feature an industry roundtable, From the
Pipeline Through Clinical Trials, moderated by Sam
Collela, Managing Director of Versant Ventures.

Discovery, Development and Delivery.
