Market Lessons from 2000
=20
School's still out for summer, but just as the new and improved  Federal En=
ergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a watershed RTO decision last  wee=
k which could lead to substantial expansion of PJM into the Northeast, PJM'=
s  State of the Market Report 2000 contains some interesting information an=
d  lessons for us.=20
After the California experience demonized spot electricity  markets, it wou=
ld surprise many that PJM's 2000 spot energy market was a  bargain. Spot pr=
ices in 2000 were below $30.00 per megawatt-hour (MWh), or three  cents per=
 kilowatt-hour (kWh), 70.88 percent of the hours in the year. The  single h=
ighest hourly price was $810 per MWh or 81 cents per kWh, but prices  reach=
ed or exceeded $200 per MWh during only 13 hours in the entire year  (downl=
oad charts on our website by typing www.pennfuture.org/items/hourlypricecha=
rts_71601.pdf  in your browser). By contrast, California experienced spot  =
prices that often exceeded $200 per MWh for most of the last 12 months.
Authored by the PJM Market Monitoring Unit - but likely reviewed  and edite=
d by top PJM management - the Report delivered to FERC concludes that  all =
of the markets operated by PJM were "reasonably competitive." It cautions, =
 however, that,
"there are potential threats to competition in the energy,  capacity and re=
gulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases  may requi=
re action in order to maintain competition. Market participants do  possess=
 some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in PJM  mar=
kets."=20
In order to maintain and improve the functioning of the PJM  markets, the R=
eport recommends:

Retention of the $1000/MWh bid cap in the PJM energy market  and investigat=
ion of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise  market power.
Retention of the $100/mw bid cap in the PJM regulation market. =20
Evaluation of additional actions to increase demand-side  responsiveness to=
 price in both energy and capacity markets.
Modification of incentives in the capacity market to require  all Load Serv=
ing Entities (LSEs) to meet their obligations to serve load on a  longer-te=
rm basis, and require all capacity resources to be offered on a  comparable=
 longer-term basis.

The Report uses several analytical methods to reach these  recommendations =
and conclusions, including looking at the net revenue for  generation from =
all sources, the increase in bid amount over marginal cost,  market concent=
ration (as measured using the HHI index), and lastly an analysis  of the re=
sulting prices.
=20
See Spot go to market
Perhaps the Report's most intriguing  information on price trends concerns =
the spot energy market, where average  prices declined by 9.81 percent from=
 1999 levels. Driven by lower peak prices in  the most expensive 100 hours =
of the year, the average locational marginal price  (LMP) in 2000 was $30.7=
2 per MWh (3.072 cents per kWh), falling from the 1999  average of $34.06 p=
er MWh (3.406 cents per kWh). This average price decline in  the spot marke=
t was more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs  were sha=
rply higher in 2000. Indeed, the average fuel-adjusted LMP in 2000  decline=
d to $24.78 per MWh, or 27.25 percent from the 1999 price of $34.06 per  MW=
h.=20
And when one compares 2000 spot market prices to competitive  future prices=
 for the year 2000 and to 1996 regulated rates for generation, it  becomes =
clear that spot market prices in 2000 were significantly lower than 2000  f=
uture contracts. Even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate  com=
parison, they were also much lower than 1996 regulated residential generati=
on  rates for all hours charged by Pennsylvania's six major electric utilit=
ies,  which ranged from about $51 dollars to $85 dollars per MWh, or 5.1 to=
 8.5 cents  per kWh.=20
The lesson
Spot market prices, which received so much bad  publicity as a result of th=
e California fiasco, can be a bargain and customers  who are able to manage=
 their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot  prices can reap ma=
jor savings by purchasing electricity from the spot  market.
In fact, spot market prices in 2000 were below most of  Pennsylvania's shop=
ping credits or "prices to compare." That's saying something,  since the sh=
opping credits in turn are as much as 4.0 cents per kWh less than  the 1996=
 regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly  util=
ities.=20
But?
Since spot market prices in 2000 were well below both  the 1996 generation =
rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits,  why were ener=
gy suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices  below the =
shopping credits?=20
ICAP pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher  priced future=
 or forward market contracts supply most of the answer.=20
The spot market gives a good indication of what the forward  markets should=
 be under typical circumstances. As the data below indicate, the  average s=
pot market price for all market locations in 2000 was $30.72/MWh,  almost 1=
0 percent less than during 1999, and more than 27 percent lower upon  adjus=
ting for higher year 2000 fuel prices.=20

  Standard Deviation =09  91.49 =09  22.04 =09  -75.91% =09

=20
While the dramatically lower standard deviation in 2000 indicates  that pri=
ces were much less volatile than in 1999, there remained a substantial  gap=
 between average and median prices, indicating that extreme prices during a=
  small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average pri=
ces. =20
Grading on a curve
The PJM 2000 price duration curves,  measuring the percent of time prices w=
ere at or below a particular level, tell  an interesting story. As one woul=
d expect with higher fuel prices, especially  for natural gas, the general =
trend was for prices to be slightly higher during  periods where natural ga=
s was the marginal fuel. For approximately 99 percent of  all hours, 2000 e=
nergy prices were more expensive than in 1999. Yet, with  relatively low pe=
ak demand, the price for the most expensive 1 percent of demand  during 200=
0 was considerably lower in 2000 than in 1999, accounting for the  entire 9=
.81 percent average reduction in 2000 prices from 1999. If not  for the red=
uced prices for the most expensive 1 percent of demand, overall  prices for=
 2000 likely would have risen approximately 18 percent over 1999, due  larg=
ely to higher fuel costs.=20
For these reasons, the Report recommendation to "evaluate"  additional acti=
ons to increase demand-side responsiveness is SEVERELY  understated. PJM an=
d all consumers have an essential interest in implementing  demand-side res=
ponse programs to the maximum economic level, with dramatic  implications f=
or saving individual consumers money, improving system  reliability, keepin=
g market prices lower for everyone, and improving market  competitiveness.=
=20
Can everyone say I-C-A-P?
So with the lower wholesale  energy prices and plenty of supply, why did th=
e retail market sputter?=20
Installed capacity (ICAP) price increases are a partial  explanation. In ad=
dition to energy, the controversial charge for ICAP is the  other significa=
nt cost born by electricity consumers within PJM. ICAP represents  a call o=
ption on physical generation resources by PJM during system emergencies.  A=
ll LSEs are required to purchase an amount of installed capacity equivalent=
 to  their customer's peak load contribution plus an adequate reserve margi=
n,  currently 19 percent. But although it exists for reliability purposes, =
PJM  curtailed the export of energy outside PJM from PJM-committed installe=
d capacity  on only one day during 2000.=20
Logically, the price for installed capacity, like the price of  energy, mig=
ht have been expected to decrease during 2000. Yet that didn't occur.  As e=
nergy prices decreased within PJM, they remained high or continued to  incr=
ease in surrounding control areas. Higher prices in the surrounding markets=
  led some generation owners to de-list their generation committed to PJM i=
n order  to sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curta=
iled by PJM.  The result was an increase in ICAP prices from an average of =
$52.86 in 1999 to  $60.55 in 2000. The increase was concentrated over the s=
ummer with prices in the  daily markets rising to $177 or more for most of =
June, July and August. The  increase in ICAP prices raised the cost of supp=
lying many retail customers by  about 1 cent per kWh. The Market Monitoring=
 Unit concluded that the price spikes  over the summer months were a direct=
 result of the opportunity cost associated  with the prices in neighboring =
control areas.
But the Report's finding that the ICAP market was "reasonably  competitive"=
 seems inconsistent with PJM's conclusion last year that the 2000  ICAP mar=
ket performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul. This  inconsistenc=
y raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the  2000 Re=
port or giving the 2000 ICAP market the PJM seal of approval.=20
PJM has invested substantial time and resources since last summer  in an ex=
tensive stakeholder process to revise its ICAP rules, especially  concernin=
g the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over which  ICAP i=
s purchased. But since the "reformed" ICAP market began operating only  rec=
ently on July 1, 2001, it's too soon to know whether it is functioning well=
  or competitively. We remain skeptical that the PJM prescription cures the=
  disease, or is merely life support for a dying program.
=20
See Spot offer lower prices
Apart from the ICAP market, the  differing prices in forward and spot marke=
ts provide substantial explanations  for why electricity suppliers have fou=
nd it easy to beat the 1996 regulated  generation rate for most utilities b=
ut difficult or even impossible to beat the  lower shopping credits. (Shopp=
ing credit =3D 1996 regulated generation rate -  stranded generation cost).=
 Prior to the 2000 summer season, prices in the  forward markets, before an=
yone knew how mild the weather was going to be,  substantially reflected th=
e high-priced experience of 1999. Because of the high  prices in 1999, ener=
gy that was purchased through forward markets - about 82  percent of all en=
ergy - was considerably more expensive than the spot prices  turned out to =
be. Since customers often prefer to lock in a price in advance,  competitiv=
e suppliers generally didn't want to provide fixed prices below the  retail=
 shopping credits. If suppliers had relied on the spot market, they could  =
have offered lower prices. Also, customers who can reduce or shift demand m=
ay  well benefit from purchasing more power from the spot market.
=20
Recent developments
Both in the East and West coast markets  this week, electricity in daily tr=
ading has been near its low for the 52-week  period. Several developments a=
re pushing down the price of wholesale  electricity. Mild weather, falling =
gas prices, new generation coming online,  increasing demand response and c=
onservation as well as a FERC which understands  that competition must exis=
t prior to price deregulation, are all pushing prices  lower. Moreover, for=
ward market prices for 2002 within PJM are beginning to fall  and are under=
 downward price pressure.=20
The new downward trend in forward markets partially results from  moderate =
prices this summer, even during high demand periods, with prices  generally=
 staying under $150 MWh/$0.15 kWh. A good example of this was July 10,  a r=
elatively hot day with significant demand, which saw prices reach $150 per =
 MWh for one hour but average $62.78 per MWh for all on-peak hours.=20
What's driving forward prices lower?

More efficient generation being installed (below 8000 btu/kWh  as opposed t=
o 11000 btu/kWh).
More ICAP in the market (new capacity estimated at over 4000  MW with load =
growth at only 1.5 percent or 1000 MW).
More demand-responsive load in the form of 300 additional MW  of Active Loa=
d Management.
The addition of PJM West slated for 2002, with lower prices  generally.=20
Lower natural gas prices - falling from $4.0561 /mmBtu in July  2000 to $3.=
29/mmBtu as of July 12, 2001.

This good news, which suggests that retail customers in late 2001  or 2002 =
may again see retail competitive offers below the Pennsylvania shopping  cr=
edits, must be weighed against the troubled ICAP market. ICAP remains an  a=
nachronism. ICAP prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain =
one  of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers. The forward =
prices for  ICAP alone have remained above 10 percent of the typical shoppi=
ng credit.=20
Yet even in the world of ICAP there is hope. ICAP prices may be  beginning =
to soften in the face of a substantial amount of new generation that  is co=
ming online and increased demand response from customers. PJM has  institut=
ed both an emergency and an economic demand-response program, through  whic=
h more customers can respond to prices and reduce the price that all  custo=
mers pay for electricity.=20
Tomorrow's homework
The State of the Market Report contains  plenty of data which confirms that=
 PJM is the country's best-run independent  system operator and best (thoug=
h still flawed) wholesale market. Prices in the  spot energy market were we=
ll below 1996 regulated generation rates, even with  appropriate adjustment=
s. But none of this warrants complacency. Only when PJM  becomes the first =
market to give consumers the tools they need to change their  demand for el=
ectricity, will the wholesale and retail markets within PJM be  FULLY, as o=
pposed to "reasonably," competitive.
