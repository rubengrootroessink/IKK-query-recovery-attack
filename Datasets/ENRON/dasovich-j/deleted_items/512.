Rumor is that the CPUC hearings will begin next week on the URG matters for PG&E and SCE.  Our bankruptcy team needs to be kept in the loop on these matters on a daily basis (as much as possible) given the impact of this decision on the process.

Can people attend a conference call on Monday pm or Tuesday am to discuss the key objectives for this case (from bankruptcy perspectives) and coverage (do we need to get outside counsel to sit in the hearings)?

I'll ask Linda Noske to coordinate the phone call.

Thanks,

Jim
