           Internet Daily for Thursday, September 20, 2001
             by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com

-----------------------------------------------------------------
InfiniteJustice.com site launched

An upstate New York man posted InfiniteJustice.com Thursday, 
adopting the Defense Department's code name for its operation 
against terrorists.

The Web site of Todd Bernhard, a former project manager for Sun 
Microsystems, includes a pre-disaster photo of the skyline of 
southern Manhattan and comments endorsing "previously forbidden 
(airline) mega-mergers, requiring bulletproof doors between 
airline pilots and their passengers, and baggage checks at train 
stations." In an email to CBS.MarketWatch.com, the 
thirtysomething Bernhard refused to be interviewed saying, "I'm 
not really looking for publicity."

Bernhard registered his domain Wednesday. So was 
OperationInfiniteJustice.com, but apparently by another person. 
Bernhard said he had no firm plans for the site. "I've put up a 
kind of memorial page w/links and thoughts," he wrote. The site 
includes links to the Red Cross, charitable organizations and a 
multimedia program about the Towers' disaster.

Microsoft offers Passport to all

Microsoft  said Thursday it would open Passport, its Internet 
authentication service, to other companies.

Passport is a service that allows Web users to load personal 
information into a database so that the data can be used by 
other Web sites for registration, purchases and other purposes.

"The challenge of providing universal single sign-in is larger 
than any one company," said Bob Muglia, group vice president of 
NET Services at Microsoft.

Passport will use a free network authentication technology 
developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology known as 
Kerberos. This could permit AOL Time Warner  and Yahoo  to 
establish similar services that would have access to compatible 
databases of information maintained by Microsoft. A Microsoft 
executive told Reuters this is "an invitation to AOL to 
interoperate."

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Attacks dominate search requests

Web-based inquiries relating to the Sept. 11 attacks have 
continued to soar, according to a spokesman for the search 
service at AltaVista. Sex usually ranks in the top 10, but has 
slipped to 17th place since the disaster, a Reuters report said. 
Google has seen the same pattern, reporting news topics such as 
CNN, FBI and American Red Cross have become more popular. 
Related searches can be found at Lycos and Google.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Travelocity expands to Europe

Travelocity.com Inc.  and Otto, a direct marketing firm, teamed 
up to form Travelocity Europe to sell travel products and 
services in Europe. Travelocity.com will draw from its European 
businesses while Otto will make use of its German travel company 
Travel Overland, reportedly one of the top five travel 
consolidators in Europe and a leading German online travel 
company.
