How far is Mr Robert Laurie (PUC California) from our thoughts (particularly, about deregulation and unbundling)? 
He will present the "regulators' views" in a Seminar in Argentina and will be the only international speaker in that panel.
I'd like to know if we need to fight to balance the panel.
Thanks
Guillermo
