Have you guys talked about this at all?  I think it would be really fun and
not expensive (given the frequent flier miles).  Let me know...

Dear Cameron,
I'm so sorry for answering only today but i received a virus from an e-mail
and only from yestarday i can work with my computer! I don't know if are
still interested but we have available two double rooms with a.c. & t.v. for
the period that you request. Rate is $ 60.00 (plus 16% sales taxes), per
room/per night, and include airport transfers.
About the sand fleas, the situation is like the other place in the tropical
area. I always suggest to my Customers to put on the skin oil for the beach
and repellent spray for the night, but is not a big problem.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards
Adriana Astorina

We would like two double rooms (there are two couples). Thanks.

Also if you could tell me a little about the sand fleas, I would appreciate
it.

Thank you,

Cameron
