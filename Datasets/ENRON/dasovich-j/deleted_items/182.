A television ad running these days in India shows a mother lapsing into a d=
aydream: Her young daughter is in a beauty contest dressed as Snow White, d=
ancing on a stage. Her flowing gown is an immaculate white. The garments of=
 other contestants, who dance in the background, are a tad gray. Snow White=
, no surprise, wins the blue ribbon. The mother awakes to the laughter of h=
er adoring family--and glances proudly at her Whirlpool White Magic washing=
 machine.=20
The TV spot is the product of 14 months of research by Whirlpool Corp. into=
 the psyche of the Indian consumer. Among other things, the Benton Harbor (=
Mich.) company learned Indian homemakers prize hygiene and purity, which th=
ey associate with white. The trouble is, white garments often get discolore=
d after frequent machine washing in local water. Besides appealing to this =
love of purity in its ads, Whirlpool custom-designed machines that are espe=
cially good with white fabrics.
Whirlpool hasn't stopped there. It uses generous incentives to get thousand=
s of Indian retailers to stock its goods. To reach every cranny of the vast=
 nation, it uses local contractors conversant in India's 18 languages to co=
llect payments in cash and deliver appliances by truck, bicycles, even oxca=
rt. Since 1996, Whirlpool's sales in India have leapt 80%--and should hit $=
200 million this year. Whirlpool now is the leading brand in India's fast-g=
rowing market for fully automatic washing machines.=20
Whirlpool's success story stands out in a time when Corporate America doesn=
't talk much about emerging markets. Things were different a decade ago. Th=
at's when Western economies had stalled, so expanding operations into the f=
ast-growing, heavily populated lands of Asia, Latin America, and the old So=
viet bloc was a top priority. The approach to globalization then was brutal=
ly simple: get in fast, strike megadeals with top officials, and watch the =
profits roll in. Multinationals figured local consumers would snap up their=
 products at a premium. Thus AT&T promised some 20 ventures in China, from =
state-of-the-art telecom factories to research labs. Enron Corp. negotiated=
 giant power plants and pipeline projects in India, Indonesia, and Bolivia.=
 General Motors Corp. envisioned an Asiawide network of car plants, led by =
its $1.2 billion facility in Shanghai. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Many of these=
 bets fizzled or disappointed. Enron's $4 billion Indian power plant is a d=
ebacle. Other multinationals saw that local competitors can catch up fast--=
and beat them in price and marketing. Tumbling trade barriers are making lo=
cal production less essential. Meanwhile, a globalization backlash has forc=
ed companies to view their activities in poor nations in a different light.=
 Exxon Mobil, Cargill, Freeport-McMoRan, and Royal Dutch/Shell became targe=
ts of local uprisings over oil, mining, and other projects in Indonesia, In=
dia, and Nigeria. McDonald's, KFC, and Philip Morris have endured withering=
 criticism at home and abroad for aggressively pushing inappropriate produc=
ts and ignoring local sensibilities.=20
The financial crises that ravaged nations like Mexico, Thailand, Russia, Br=
azil, and Turkey didn't help. Suddenly, ``emerging markets'' connoted exces=
sive risk. Indeed, compared to the booming U.S. of the late '90s and a unif=
ying Western Europe, emerging markets looked irrelevant to many execs. Afte=
r explosive growth in the early 1990s, foreign direct investment by U.S. co=
mpanies in East Asia, excluding Japan, plunged by 74% to $1.33 billion from=
 1997 to 2000, estimates the U.S. Commerce Dept. The drops have been nearly=
 as dramatic in Latin America and Eastern Europe.=20
But as Whirlpool and other savvy U.S. companies such as Kodak, Citigroup, a=
nd Hewlett-Packard are proving, investing time and energy to understand soc=
ieties in developing nations can pay rich returns. Rather than swinging for=
 the fences with megaprojects or costly takeovers, the smarter approach is =
to methodically build a presence from the ground up. Some of the best inves=
tments are the most economical--small corner kiosks instead of full-blown s=
tores or bank branches, say, or a tie-up with a savvy local player who owns=
 a factory. Says Bain & Co. global strategist Chris Zook: ``Companies are t=
rying to figure out how to build on their strengths, as opposed to throwing=
 a bunch of Hail Mary passes in the hope they connect.''=20
Above all, smart globalization requires extensive homework. Companies are s=
tarting to work closely with bureaucrats, entrepreneurs, and social groups =
at the grass roots. Not only is it easier to head off a local political bac=
klash by cooperating with local players early; multinationals are also find=
ing they can save enormous resources--and develop products local consumers =
really need.=20
Whirlpool has learned many of these lessons. Eight years after launching it=
s global blitz in 1989, it took a $294 million writedown to shed two of the=
 four appliance plants it built in China. ``What we absolutely missed was h=
ow fast these markets would become saturated,'' concedes CEO David R. Whitw=
am. ``We could build plants around the world, but where you fail is in the =
marketplace.''=20
Now, Whitwam believes Whirlpool is on track. Besides its sophisticated mark=
eting and inroads with local distributors, the company reorganized its glob=
al factory network. For all appliances, it devises basic models that use ab=
out 70% of the same parts. Then it modifies its machines for local tastes. =
Whirlpool has an incentive to get it right: Through 2009, it expects demand=
 for big appliances in the U.S. to remain flat, while it projects demand ov=
erseas will grow 17%, to 293 million units.=20
Similar dynamics are pushing other companies to renew their global focus. D=
eveloping nations are still likely to grow much faster than the industrial =
West for at least a decade (chart, page 136). What's more, most multination=
als today target mainly the richest 10% of the global population. They've y=
et to reach the 4 billion who earn the equivalent of $1,500 or less annuall=
y. Few can afford a PC, car, or mortgage now. But many experts argue they w=
ill be the greatest source of future global growth. That's why Hewlett-Pack=
ard Co. has launched a drive to help stimulate computer use in villages fro=
m Central America to Africa (page 137). The HP program also is politically =
shrewd: It promotes the beneficial aspect of globalization to the neediest.=
=20
Citibank's new campaign to broaden its traditional base of rich clients exe=
mplifies the new approach to emerging markets. In Bangalore, India, it laun=
ched a program called Suvidha--Hindi for ``ease.'' It persuaded midsized co=
mpanies to set up retail bank accounts for their entire staffs, from janito=
rs to top managers. To open accounts, customers need just $22. They get a c=
ard they can use to get cash, take out loans, pay bills at local ATMs, and =
buy groceries. In three years, Citi has gained 200,000 retail clients, doub=
ling its base in India, for about $10 million.=20
In corporate banking, Citi is targeting companies with revenues of $50 mill=
ion or less. India's trucking business has been one priority. By opening of=
fices in 23 cities offering credit, savings, and checking accounts, Citi no=
w finances 10,000 truckers--most with fewer than 30 vehicles. It also is ge=
aring up in Poland, Brazil, and the Philippines. Since 1997, small-business=
 clients in emerging markets have risen sixfold, to 8.7 million. ``The lowe=
r segments of these markets is where the growth is,'' says Citibank CEO Vic=
tor J. Menezes. Such markets earned Citigroup $2.7 billion in net profits l=
ast year.=20
Other U.S. companies are finding they can get ahead working with small entr=
epreneurs eager for new ways to make money. That's one reason emerging mark=
ets are a bright spot for Eastman Kodak Co. While Kodak has struggled in th=
e U.S., in Asia, sales were up 9% last year. Much of this is because of Kod=
ak Express photo supply and development shops, often owned by entrepreneurs=
 such as Qiu Xing, 28. The Shanghai native, who says he had ``always been a=
 photography buff,'' invested $48,000 to open his shop in January. In a dea=
l with a Chinese bank, Kodak lets Qiu use his developing equipment as loan =
collateral even though he hasn't fully paid for it. Kodak also supplies mon=
thly staff training. Qiu takes in $5,000 a month and makes a 25% profit.=20
Kodak has 6,000 Expresses across China and expects 10,000 by yearend. Its m=
arket share in China has doubled since 1995, to 60%. ``We moved so fast, ou=
r competitors didn't have time to act,'' boasts John Tseng, a Kodak general=
 manager for Asia.=20
In these turbulent times, when political and currency crises rock governmen=
ts from Jakarta to Buenos Aires, it's hard to tell when emerging markets wi=
ll be the predictable lands of opportunity CEOs once foresaw. But that was =
always an illusion--and it's time Corporate America figures out what really=
 works. ``The next round of global expansion is as much about imagination a=
s about resources,'' says University of Michigan management guru C.K. Praha=
lad: ``Putting a billion dollars down does not involve imagination.'' With =
the mistakes of the '90s behind them, the winners will approach the world i=

Economy
Group of Utilities In West Says Rates Now Are Too Low
By Robert Gavin and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A coalition of Western utilities -- including some that pushed successfully=
 for price caps on wholesale electricity earlier this year -- now is compla=
ining that prices have fallen too low.=20
At least three utilities are requesting retail rate increases to cover powe=
r costs from earlier in the year, in part, because low wholesale prices mea=
n they are no longer able to completely offset those costs with power-sale =
revenue. Prices have been falling for months, and dropped even further afte=
r June 19 when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed regionwide =
wholesale price limits.
Early this week, 14 Western utilities asked FERC to reconsider its order, c=
omplaining now that a "one-size-fits-all" approach may help California, but=
 hurt utilities in neighboring states.=20
Under the FERC order, Western power generators may charge no more than $92 =
per megawatt hour, currently, for power sold into the California market and=
 slightly less outside the Golden State, unless they can prove their genera=
ting costs are higher. Traders, including utilities that bought too much po=
wer, are held to the capped level no matter what their costs. But the caps =
are somewhat moot since energy currently is trading at far less on the open=
 market.=20
Power prices in February, according to Platt's Energy Trader, a daily publi=
cation of McGraw-Hill Cos., for two important Northwest pricing points rang=
ed between $220 and $400 per megawatt hour. By yesterday, midday electricit=
y for delivery at the same points was selling for $33 per megawatt hour.=20
Portland General Electric bought power last winter for late-summer deliveri=
es at $200 to $250 per megawatt hour, says Robin Tompkins, assistant genera=
l counsel. "Now we're having a hard time unwinding those positions."=20
Portland General, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston, is asking for a record =
30% increase in residential rates, which would take the price to roughly ei=
ght cents per kilowatt hour from about six cents, and a 45% to 60% increase=
 in commercial rates. That is because the Portland, Ore., utility only is a=
ble to supply half the power its customers need from its own power plants. =
For the rest, it must go to the open market and make purchases.=20
When it resells power it doesn't need, it now is forced to do so at a loss,=
 says Ms. Tompkins. That isn't at all what it expected during the time of y=
ear when prices typically reach their zenith. It puts further pressure on r=
ates, she adds.=20
The drop in prices back to the 1999 level is prompting rate increase reques=
ts from other utilities. In May, for example, Avista Corp., Spokane, Wash.,=
 agreed to defer rate increases needed to recover more than $100 million in=
 unanticipated power-purchase costs. The idea was the utility, with 313,000=
 customers in Idaho and Washington, would recover those costs over the next=
 two years by selling excess power once drought-stricken hydroelectric gene=
rating conditions improved and its new 270-megawatt natural-gas-fired plant=
 came on line next year.=20
But Avista now is seeking a 36.9% rate increase in Washington and 15% incre=
ase in Idaho because the utility no longer believes wholesale prices will b=
e high enough to pay off earlier power-purchase costs. This week, Puget Sou=
nd Energy, a unit of Puget Energy Inc., Bellevue, Wash., asked Washington r=
egulators to grant an 18% residential rate increase to recover some $84 mil=
lion in power costs, saying falling power-sale revenues mean ratepayers hav=
e to pick up a bigger share of costs.=20
Washington Public Counsel Simon Ffitch, who represents ratepayers in utilit=
y cases, says the rate increases "appear to be an effort to shift the risks=
 of power-cost fluctuations to ratepayers from stockholders."

AFRICA & THE AMERICAS: Enron issues veiled sanction threat to India=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and KHOZEM MERCHANT

Energy giant Enron has issued a veiled threat to India that it could face n=
ew US sanctions unless the company and its partners get back the full Dolla=
rs 1bn (Pounds 600m) in costs incurred building a power plant there.=20
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, s=
aid: "There are US laws that could prevent the US government from providing=
 any aid or assistance to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate=
 property of US companies."=20
The warning comes at a sensitive time as the Bush administration is trying =
to improve its long-strained relations with India. Two weeks ago Richard Ar=
mitage, US deputy secretary of state, predicted an early lifting of the san=
ctions imposed in the aftermath of India's nuclear tests in May 1988.=20
Enron launched arbitration proceedings earlier this year after its Dollars =
2.9bn Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the =
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to=
 pay bills that now total about Dollars 45m. It said Enron's tariffs - four=
 times greater than those levied by domestic power producers - were too exp=
ensive. But Enron says the basis for calculating the tariffs was in the con=
tract and asked the Indian government to buy its stake earlier this month.=
=20
Mr Lay's demand for full-cost compensation is regarded as optimistic by som=
e bankers in Bombay. One executive at a foreign bank said a more attainable=
 solution would be one "that allows Enron to get out at 70 cents to the dol=
lar", suggesting a significant writedown by Enron.=20
Mr Lay said in the interview: "If they try to squeeze us down to something =
less than cost then it basically becomes an expropriation by the Indian gov=
ernment, and that would send an incredibly damaging signal to the internati=
onal capital markets and investment community as to making any future inves=
tments in India."=20
His threat is likely to irritate the Indian government, which is eager to r=
each a face-saving compromise amid a strong domestic anti-Enron lobby, with=
out disturbing warming bilateral ties with Washington.=20
Mr Lay is known to have warm relations with the Bush administration, which =
has its roots in the company's home base of Texas.=20
Mr Lay said the Indian government had indicated it wanted to solve this pro=
blem quickly and amicably. Both sides are working with an international rec=
onciliation team. But Mr Lay said the alternative of continuing with arbitr=
ation remained. "We have very, very tight contracts, and we'll enforce thos=
e contracts," he said. Interview, Page 22=20

NATIONAL NEWS: US power trader may buy Hatfield mine=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By MATTHEW JONES

Enron, the US power trader, has emerged as the leading contender to buy Hat=
field colliery near Doncaster, which went into liquidation earlier this mon=
th with the loss of 220 jobs.=20
The news follows the government's decision late on Wednesday to grant a fou=
r-week stay of execution to the mine by pledging Pounds 200,000 to keep it =
open on a care and maintenance basis.=20
The 80-year-old pit, which appeared in scenes from the film Brassed Off, wa=
s the last producing mine in north Doncaster, once the hub of the English c=
oal industry.=20
It had been negotiating a contract to supply coal to Drax power station, ow=
ned by AES of the US, but went into liquidation on August 13 after failing =
to secure loans needed to expand production. Enron has been talking to Hatf=
ield Coal Company, the mine's private operator, since before it collapsed. =
An observer close to the negotiations said Enron was continuing to show int=
erest and had resumed coal supply talks with AES.=20
UK Coal, Britain's largest deep mine operator, is paying Pounds 1m a year t=
o keep the adjacent Thorne colliery mothballed. The group has said it may d=
evelop the site as a replacement for Selby colliery, which is due to close =
by the end of the decade, but it is under pressure to cut costs and has rul=
ed out a purchase of Hatfield.=20
The mine had been due to be capped and abandoned on Tuesday. But Brian Wils=
on, energy minister, agreed on Wednesday to provide Pounds 50,000 a week fo=
r the next four weeks to keep the mine shafts ventilated and drained. The d=
ecision is thought to be the first time public money has been used to delay=
 the closure of a privately owned mine since state coal assets were sold of=
f in 1994.=20
Industry experts believe Hatfield has reserves of 15m-23m tonnes of coal bu=
t would need investment of about Pounds 45m to access them. Ian Roxburgh, c=
hief executive of the Coal Authority, which has assumed ownership of the un=
derground workings, said: "Once maintenance of mine shafts ceases they woul=
d quickly fill up with water and gas, making the costs of re-starting produ=
ction prohibitive."=20
The official receiver disclaimed its lease for the mine on Wednesday but re=
tained ownership of the surface site and responsibility for disposal of the=
 company's assets. Sanctions threat, Page 6=20

NTERVIEW KENNETH LAY, ENRON CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE:=20
Financial Times; Aug 24, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY

When Kenneth Lay, chair-man and chief executive of Enron, returned to the t=
op job at the US energy group, he was touched to receive a standing ovation=
 from the 1,400 staff at his first meeting with employees.=20
The level of support for Mr Lay's second stint in the top job has encourage=
d him, and he vows to leave the company "substantially bigger and more prof=
itable" when he resigns as CEO in 2005.=20
During his first 15-year stint at the top, Mr Lay transformed Enron from a =
regional natural gas pipeline company into a leading electricity, natural g=
as and communications company.=20
Market capitalisation rose during his tenure from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 70=
bn. The company reported revenue of Dollars 101bn in 2000.=20
Mr Lay's replacement, Jeffrey Skilling, lasted just six months in the job u=
ntil he resigned last week for "personal reasons".=20
Mr Lay said in an interview with the Financial Times that he believed Enron=
 stood a good chance of continuing to grow 20 per cent a year, enabling it =
to double its net income about every three and a half years.=20
He plans to appoint one or two top executives, fairly quickly, to the Offic=
e of the Chairman to help guide that growth. The appointee(s) will be on th=
e shortlist of those who eventually will be considered for CEO.=20
Mr Lay is considering Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation=
 Services; Mark Frevert, chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services; Greg=
 Whalley, president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services=
; David Delainey, chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services; and John Sherr=
iff, president and CEO of Enron Europe.=20
"There is no big rush on this CEO appointment," Mr Lay says. "The board has=
 made it very clear that we are going to take our time. I have extended my =
contract through 2005. I'll stay that long if needed. I'll stay longer if n=
eeded." And he will continue to review the ranks for the best replacement d=
uring that period.=20
In the meantime, Mr Lay will have to grapple with controversies in its Indi=
an, California and broadband operations.=20
Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity boar=
d over a power project, India's biggest foreign investment. It is among sev=
eral energy traders facing questions in California over accusations of a ma=
nipulation of power prices - charges it denies.=20
The group has also been hit hard from poorly performing broadband operation=
s. But perhaps even more pressing is the stock price, which has fallen more=
 than 55 per cent since the start of the year.=20
Mr Lay said he would do the best he could to stop the free-fall, spending a=
s much time as possible meeting portfolio managers and analysts to make sur=
e people understand the growth potential of the company.=20
Enron's main profit centre is its North American operations, where its ener=
gy wholesale business is key. But he notes the company is transferring its =
business model to other countries in Europe and eventually to Japan, as wel=
l as to industrial markets, including coal, steel and pulp and paper.=20
Because of the company's rapid growth, many analysts say they remain confus=
ed about facets of the new "Enron model" - something Mr Lay is eager to rec=
tify.=20
"The business model is basically a matter of physical volumes delivered," M=
r Lay says. "Physical volumes of natural gas, electricity, coal, metals, wh=
atever, but physical volumes delivered . . . We're doing the very same thin=
g that the physically integrated company is doing, but we're doing it, in m=
any cases, with other people's assets."=20
Those assets include everything from pipelines to power plants to transmiss=
ion lines to coal freighters. Enron owns some and leases or rents others.=
=20
"The customer wants to buy so much natural gas or electricity, and we deliv=
er it," Mr Lay says. "And we deliver it at the lowest possible price and in=
 the most reliable way possible. That is how we are competitive."=20

Enron's Lay Raises Possibility of Sanctions on India (Update1)

Enron's Lay Raises Possibility of Sanctions on India (Update1)

     (Adds analyst's, negotiator's comments in eighth, 12th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chief Executive
Kenneth Lay said the Indian government could be subject to U.S.
sanctions unless the top energy trader and its partners recover $1
billion they invested in an Indian utility, the Financial Times
reported.

     Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol Power Co., which runs the $3
billion power plant, India's biggest foreign investment. It is
owed $64 million by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its
sole customer, in unpaid bills for 8 months. The board in May
stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive.

     ``Ken didn't make any kind of threat,'' Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said, adding that Lay was responding to a question about
what might motivate the Indian government to help break the
deadlock.

     Palmer said the company hasn't been in contact with the Bush
administration regarding any form of U.S. sanctions against India.
Spokesmen for both the White House and the State Department said
they knew of no request from Enron for such action to be taken.
Lay was a major donor to the Bush campaign.

     Enron began looking to sell its stake in the project after
the negotiation panel failed to get other buyers for its power.
Eight Indian states said they would buy electricity but at less
than half the price charged by Dabhol. Enron said it has invested
$875 million in the project and is ready to sell to the government
its stake at cost.

     ``There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government
from providing any aid or assistance or other things to India
going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of U.S.
companies,'' Lay said in the Financial Times.

                          Nuclear Weapons

     Enron spokesman John Ambler said that while Lay stopped short
of saying that India has expropriated Enron property, the company
would consider it expropriation if it was denied recovery of its
costs after asset values were diluted by government action.

     ``First, Enron's assets haven't been expropriated yet. And
expropriation is not even allowed under the Indian law,'' said
R.K. Pachauri, director at Tata Energy Research Institute. ``The
power purchase agreement has provisions to solve any dispute. You
can't toss that (the contract) aside.''

     Pachauri was on a five-member panel that suggested ways to
reduce Dabhol's power tariff. He quit after the committee was
asked by the Maharashtra state government to renegotiate the
project as well.

     The Clinton administration imposed sanctions against India
and Pakistan in May 1998, after the two traditional enemies tested
nuclear weapons within days of each other.

     The sanctions were partially lifted in late 1999. The
Washington Post quoted Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage
saying earlier this month that the Bush administration and
Congress were planning to begin work in September to accelerate
lifting the sanctions. No final decision has been announced.

     ``The dispute (between Enron and Maharashtra) is a commercial
one and has nothing to do with the economic sanctions'' on India,
said Madhav Godbole, who headed a committee set up to resolve the
payment dispute. ``The parties are governed by the power purchase
agreement'' that provides for arbitration as a way to solve the
dispute.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 30 cents to $36.96. They
have fallen 56 percent so far this year.



Enron Plans To Buy UK Hatfield Colliery - FT

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is interested in buying Hatfield, a =
U.K. colliery near Doncaster in north Yorkshire, and is in talks with AES C=
orp. (AES) to supply coal to that company's 3,870-megawatt Drax plant, the =
Financial Times reported Friday.=20
Enron declined to comment on the report.
Industry experts estimate that reserves at Hatfield, totaling 15-23 million=
 metric tons, will cost GBP45 million to exploit.=20
Hatfield is an 80-year-old mine that was due to be closed Tuesday, but was =
rescued by government funds to be maintained for a restart. Before going in=
to liquidation on Aug. 13, its operators were negotiating a contract to sup=
ply coal to Drax.=20
U.K. Coal, the largest operator of deep mines in Britain, may develop a mot=
hballed colliery at Thorne, but pressure to cut costs has ruled out a purch=
ase of Hatfield.=20
Coal has enjoyed a renaissance in the U.K. power industry this year as the =
price of gas, the fuel with which it competes most directly, has stayed stu=
bbornly high.=20
In addition, many of the larger coal-fired plants subdivide into units that=
 offer more flexibility than corresponding gas-fired plant. These are conse=
quently able to dominate the higher-value end of the power market under the=
 New Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March.=20
Officials at AES did however confirm contact with Enron over Hatfield.=20
"We have a strong relationship with Enron and they have, in a preliminary d=
iscussion, expressed interest in long term deals to supply coal, if they bu=
y Hatfield," said John Levons, Commercial and Fuel Business Leader at Drax.=
=20
"We can contract with domestic producers because the plant is fully fitted =
with desulphurization equipment, so the higher content of sulphur doesn't a=
ffect us as much," he added.=20
Since AES purchased the plant one year ago, around 90% of Drax's coal comes=
 from domestic sources, and all new contracts are with domestic producers.=
=20
Drax is a modern station that could be operational for 30 to 40 years.=20

Tony Duplisse is pointing at perhaps the ugliest light fixture ever to illu=
minate a palm tree.=20
"There's no light coming out, and it's just not very pleasant to look at, s=
aid Duplisse, standing near the swimming pool at Toscana, an apartment comp=
lex in Irvine where rents run $1,200 to $1,800 a month.
Duplisse has a list of 2,000 light bulbs, fixtures and signs on the 566-uni=
t property that will be replaced or tossed in the trash.=20
"Look at this," he said, pointing to an innocuous exit sign, lighted red at=
 high noon. "We've got 350 signs like this, and this is just one property.=
=20
It's unbelievable.=20
Conservation by consumers and businesses is one of the primary reasons Cali=
fornia has breezed through the summer with no rolling blackouts.=20
That's why companies like Chicago-based Equity Residential Properties Trust=
 , whose chairman is billionaire Sam Zell, created a funky new job -- "util=
ity czar" -- putting one man in charge of trimming millions of dollars from=
 the company's power bills.=20
"I didn't set out to be the utility czar," said Duplisse, an Oklahoma nativ=
e and former semipro rugby player. "When my boss sent out the e-mail naming=
 me utility czar, I knew I was in for an endless barrage of ribbing."=20
Duplisse got tapped for the job this year after he saved the real estate in=
vestment trust a tidy sum on water bills at 75 properties in Arizona.=20
Other large apartment owners in Orange County, including ArchStone Communit=
ies and Western National Group, both of Irvine, are taking similar steps to=
 cut costs.=20
When politicians and big energy users touted the 1996 deregulation law, the=
y said it would lower energy costs. But that hasn't happened in California.=
 Instead, deregulation has pushed prices higher and been a boon for a burge=
oning industry known as energy services.=20
The same generators and marketers that sell or swap power with California -=
- Enron Corp., Duke Energy and Dynegy Inc. -- have created separate busines=
s units to sell products and advice to corporations, hotels, apartment comp=
lexes and retail chains that want to lower energy costs.=20
"This is just the beginning of the industry," said Craig Goodman, president=
 of the National Energy Marketers Association, a trade group that lobbies f=
or full deregulation of the energy and natural-gas markets. "There are stro=
ng margins and savings in cutting energy costs, both for the energy markete=
rs and for companies."=20
Duplisse, who previously worked for Walden Residential Properties in Dallas=
, believes the energy crisis, which is sweeping the country along with hot =
weather, forces conservation. "If you combined lighting, gas and water savi=
ngs over the last few years, we'd be saving hundreds of thousands of dollar=
s," he said.=20
During a one-day stop in California recently, Duplisse toured nearly 14 pro=
perties owned by Equity Residential, driving from Burbank to Valencia to Ba=
kersfield, then back to Los Angeles and Orange County. The company owns sev=
en Orange County properties, including Merrimac Woods in Costa Mesa, Regenc=
y Palms in Huntington Beach and Villa Solana Apartments in Mission Viejo.=
=20
With 78 properties in Southern California, Equity Residential also is cashi=
ng in on rebates paid by taxpayers for installing energy-efficient lights.=
=20
As utility czar, Duplisse takes bids from contractors who do the work of re=
placing lights and changing fixtures. For example, by replacing just one ha=
logen light in a swimming pool -- which are energy gluttons -- with a metal=
 halide, a high-powered fuel source, the company saves $30 a year.=20
The new light also lasts longer and typically generates more light.=20
Duplisse's team of five managers-turned-energy experts track the number of =
lights at each property, the wattage levels, and the savings achieved by re=
placing them.=20
Multiply those savings by thousands of lights, and the money saved will pro=
bably make the risk-averse shareholders of Equity Residential sit up and ta=
ke notice.=20
"In terms of the scope of energy, there's nothing bigger," Duplisse said, e=
xplaining how replacing light bulbs at Toscana will cut $87,000 from the pr=
operty's yearly electricity bill.=20
After California, the energy team will move on to the Pacific Northwest in =
an effort to get ahead of an expected natural-gas crisis there this winter.=
=20
The team expects to canvass the company's 983 properties in 36 states over =
several years.=20
What does he think of the deregulation? Duplisse shakes his head.=20
"I'm real apolitical. I can't make heads or tails of it," he said. Then he =
held up a copy of USA Today, with a blaring headline: "Energy Crisis? What =
Energy Crisis?"=20
"We're smart enough to know better," he said.

LOS ANGELES -- Privately owned City Light & Power Inc., a company that oper=
ates and maintains the street lights in Long Beach, Calif., is considering =
making a bid for Edison International, parent company of the state's second=
 largest utility, City Light & Power executives said overnight Thursday.
Denver-based City Light & Power could announce its intentions as soon as Mo=
nday. Chief Executive William F. Simmons flew to Sacramento Thursday to beg=
in lobbying California lawmakers, the executives said.=20
City Light & Power is being advised by Bear Stearns and Salomon Smith Barne=
y, which have valued Edison International (EIX) at $5.6 billion, or $17.18 =
a share, executives said.=20
City Light expects to bid for the entire company -- which includes insolven=

ergy -- although it could sell off some assets later. City Light & Power is=
 investigating whether it could raise financing for the transaction, which =
would have to be done in cash.=20
Edison had a market cap of $4.62 billion, or $14.18 a share, at Thursday's =
close.=20
In 1999, City Light & Power teamed up with Enron Corp. (ENE) to support a p=
lan by City Manager Henry Taboada for Long Beach to buy Edison's distributi=
on system. The city ultimately decided instead to negotiate a better deal w=
ith Edison.=20
In the mid-1990s, City Light won a $60 million contract to operate and main=
tain the city of Long Beach's street lights for 25 years. Long Beach is Sou=
thern California Edison's largest service area, with 175,000 customers gene=
rating roughly $250 million a year for the utility in 1999.=20
Enron made an aborted effort to compete for retail customers in California =
in the late 1990s. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company wasn't in=

RWE May Make Bid for Azurix, Gelsenwasser, Paper Says (Correct)
2001-08-24 01:59 (New York)


     (Corrects spelling of Azurix in first paragraph.)

     Essen, Germany, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- RWE AG, the German
utility that bought Thames Water Plc for $9.8 billion last year,
may bid for Enron Corp.'s Azurix Corp. water unit, Handelsblatt
said, citing unidentified people close to the company.

     Buying the U.S. company would add about 1.5 billion deutsche
marks ($700 million) in annual sales, the newspaper said. Azurix
also owns Wessex Water of the U.K., which RWE would probably have
to sell for antitrust reasons, the paper said, citing analysts.

     RWE has said it's exploring acquisition possibilities in
Europe and overseas to expand outside its home market. Still, RWE
may also be interested in acquiring Gelsenwasser AG, a German
water company majority-owned by E.ON AG, Handelsblatt reported.

     Chief Executive Dietmar Kuhnt, whose Thames Water purchase
last year was the No. 2 cross-border European utilities takeover,
wants to take the company beyond the German power market, where
growth is limited and increasing competition hurt earnings.



Enron May Buy U.K. Coal Mine From Liquidator, FT Reports
2001-08-24 01:34 (New York)


     London, Aug. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. of the U.S., the
top energy trader, may buy Hatfield colliery, near Doncaster,
northern England, which went into liquidation on Aug. 13, the
Financial Times reported, citing an unidentified person close to
the situation.

     The mine was due to be capped and abandoned on Tuesday, but
on Wednesday the U.K. government agreed to provide a 200,000-
pound ($290,000) grant to keep the shafts ventilated and drained
for four weeks, the newspaper said.

     Hatfield Coal Co., the private company that owned the mine,
went into liquidation after failing to obtain loans needed to
increase output, the FT said. It had been negotiating a contract
to supply coal to the nearby Drax power station, owned by AES
Corp. of the U.S.

     Enron was talking to Hatfield before it collapsed and is
still interested, the paper said. It's restarted talks with AES.
U.K. Coal Plc, Britain's biggest coal-mining company, has ruled
out buying Hatfield, the FT said.

     Britain's power industry burned 18 percent more coal in the
first five months of this year, after a 14 percent rise in 2000,
according to David Price, who edits the magazine Coal U.K.


Enron's Portland General Seeks Power Rate Increase, WSJ Says
2001-08-23 23:54 (New York)


     New York, Aug. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Portland
General is among utilities requesting that retail electricity
rates be increased as wholesale power prices drop in the western
U.S., the Wall Street Journal reported.

     Enron joins Puget Energy Inc. and Avista Corp. in asking that
prices be increased to cover the cost of supplying electricity
earlier this year, when wholesale prices soared. Lower wholesale
prices means they can't recoup those costs by selling excess
electricity they now have, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     Portland General bought power last winter for delivery in
late summer at $200 to $250 a megawatt hour, the paper reported,
citing Robin Tompkins, a lawyer for the company. Portland General
is asking for a record 30 percent increase in residential rates
and an increase of as much as 60 percent for businesses, the Wall
Street Journal reported.

     Avista is seeking a 36.9 percent increase for rates in
Washington and 14.7 percent for power in Idaho. Puget Energy's
Puget Sound Energy has asked proposed a plan to Washington state
regulators that would raise customers' bill and allow it to
recover $84 million for power bought this year.

mes that said Enron has threatened India with new U.S. sanctions unless the=
 company and its partners get back the full $1 billion in costs they incurr=
ed in building the plant.=20
"There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing =
any aid or assistance or other things to India going forward if, in fact, t=
hey expropriate property of U.S. companies," Enron Chairman and Chief Execu=
tive Officer Ken Lay told the newspaper in an interview.=20
Enron said earlier this month that it would be willing to sell its majority=
 stake in Dabhol Power Co. for $1 billion, which it said represented the co=
sts that it and partners General Electric Co. and Bechtel Group Inc. had in=
curred.=20
"If they try to squeeze us down to something less than cost then it basical=
ly becomes an expropriation by the Indian government," Lay told the Financi=
al Times.=20
Another Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said the company had not made any typ=
e of request for help in the dispute from the U.S. government, nor filed a =
formal complaint.=20
"We may have briefed somebody but we have not asked for any help...Nothing =
has been expropriated," he said.=20
Palmer said Lay has not discussed the Dabhol dispute with President George =
W. Bush. Lay has supported Bush since his days as Texas governor and has ma=
intained close ties with him since he has been in the White House.=20
Palmer said the comments attributed to Lay in the Financial Times were accu=
rate but were made only after Lay explained at length that he believed Indi=
an authorities had every reason to resolve the dispute to the satisfaction =
of both sides.=20
Dabhol Power Co., in India's Maharashtra state, has been locked in a long a=
nd bitter dispute with its sole customer, a state-owned utility, over high =
tariffs and payment defaults.=20
In a visit to India last month Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian=
 affairs Christina Rocca said efforts were under way to scrap economic sanc=
tions Washington imposed on India in 1998 in protest at India's nuclear tes=
ts, but she took a swipe at the country's investment climate.=20
She took India to task for protectionist trade policies, its investment cli=
mate and its failure to provide an effective system for the protection of i=
ntellectual property.=20
She said the problems clouding India's investment climate could be summed u=
p with a five-letter word, "Enron". It would be difficult for international=
 investors to view India favorably until the Dabhol dispute was resolved, s=
he said.

Energy Glut Fears Put Power Firms' Finances In Focus

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As energy industry insiders continue to fret that po=
wer generators may be building too many plants, bankers and other advisers =
have begun telling power companies to take a hard look at how they manage t=
heir cash.=20
"Overcapacity" is the latest concern to befall the power industry, leading =
Barron's to suggest in a recent cover story that the country might be heade=
d for an electricity glut.
Bankers working with major wholesale power companies are telling them to be=
tter manage their assets. In particular, the bankers are taking a hard look=
 at how power companies plan to sell the power a new plant will generate. T=
hey're also looking at how cash is allocated to back-up credit exposure in =
the event a trading partner defaults or the market turns, as well as at how=
 the companies fund projects at other business units.=20
"As the giddiness of the 'build it and they will come' mentality fades, the=
 ability to finance new power plants gets a little tougher," said Gerald Ke=
enan, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who specialized in energy company=
 strategies.=20
Banks are getting stingier with extending credit in light of the growing nu=
mber of loan defaults, Keenan added, particularly in the telecommunications=
 sector.=20
So far, the more cautious environment isn't affecting largest power trading=
 companies, but smaller energy trading companies may be having a harder tim=
e allocating capital among their businesses, advisers said.=20
Some of the larger firms involved in power trading include Enron Corp. (ENE=
), American Electric Power Co. (AEP), Reliant Resources Inc. (RRI), PG&E Co=
rp. (PCG) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK). Smaller names with less than 1% mark=
et share include Sempra Energy (SRE), FPL Group Inc. (FPL), DTE Energy Co. =
(DTE) and Avista Corp. (AVA).=20
"The internal competition for capital, which fuels the company's need for e=
xternal capital, has been heightened by the significant amount of capital r=
equired for active energy trading businesses," said Nick Lewis, head of CIB=
C World Markets' power technology and growth investment banking business.=
=20
And though rating agencies may not do formal research on some of the smalle=
r power trading firms, they follow them enough to know the risks to these c=
ompanies. John Kennedy, associate director of utilities, energy and project=
 finance ratings at Standard & Poor's said smaller trading firms often lack=
 the geographic diversity and asset bases that are associated with high cre=
dit quality.=20
Cash Concerns And Transmission Woes, Too=20

The news is even more dire for online energy exchanges such as Houston Stre=
et Exchange and RedMeteor.com because venture capital has dried up for thes=
e firms, and the companies are not yet profitable, said Michael Walker a se=
nior manager at CapGemini Ernst & Young's energy trading practice.=20
According to industry consultants, surprisingly large amounts of capital ar=
e required to build power trading businesses.=20
"The problem is the (power) market is not particularly liquid or transparen=
t," said Phil Giudice, a vice president at Mercer Management Consulting. He=
 said energy trading companies, particularly the smaller ones, must always =
be careful about what market positions they are taking because the losses c=
an tally quickly if the market turns.=20
Additional risk also arises from bottlenecks that occur when transmission l=
ines make it impossible to move power from one region to another. Those bot=
tlenecks also make it more difficult to assess the supply needs of a region=
.=20
"Increasingly, analysts and bankers are looking at companies in the generat=
ion and trading business who are more sophisticated in their ability to man=
age and optimize risk, and are viewing generation assets as financial optio=
ns," said David Johnson, a partner at Andersen's risk consulting practice i=
n Houston.=20
Johnson said he expects the sophisticated traders will be the ones who will=
 be successful in obtaining credit even as funding conditions become more s=
trict.=20
