STOCKWATCH Enron higher after Merrill Lynch's cautious upgrade to 'buy'

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were higher in morning trade after Me=
rrill Lynch issued a cautiously optimistic note upgrading the stock to 'buy=
' from 'accumulate' following Enron's sale of certain US and Indian assets,=
 dealers said. At 11.35 am, Enron gained 36 cents, or 1.08 pct, to 33.81 us=
d.=20
The Dow Jones Utility Average (DUX) declined 4.26 points to 316.05.=20
On the broader indices, DJIA lost 16.26 points to 9,051.68, the S&P=20
500 fell 3.50 to 1,058.90, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 23.21
points lower to 1,583.53.=20

In a note issued early this morning, Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey sa=
id, the agreement to sell Portland General and its India oil and gas intere=
st, has positioned the company to focus on its more profitable core busines=
ses, while substantially reducing its debt load by the end of 2002.
The sale of Portland General is expected to add 1.88 bln usd of cash to the=
 company coffers at the close of the transaction fourth-quarter of 2002. Th=
e deal will also bring 1.1 bln usd of debt relief.=20
Meanwhile, the sale of Indian oil and gas assets should bring in 388 mln us=
d.=20
Eassey expects more asset sales by the company in the near future.=20
The divestiture of the troubled Dabhol power facility in India along with s=
maller international gas assets could provide the company with additional l=
iquidity, he said.=20
"Enron could ultimately (in the next 3 years) raise another 1.8 bln usd or =
so from Dabhol and other non-core international assets."=20
The Dabhol plant is 65 pct owned by Enron, making it the biggest investment=
 in India by a non-Indian company.=20
The company's partner, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), owns 15 =
pct. MSEB owes Enron 48 mln usd for past power bills, but claims the power =
is too expensive and says it cannot absorb it all. The plant has lied idle =
since.=20
Many questions, however, remain unanswered, said Eassey, noting that despit=
e the upgrade he is remaining cautious.=20
"While Enron has a menu of assets to draw upon to raise capital, reduce deb=
t and improve its earnings prospects in the process, the primary question c=
entres on timing," he said.=20
"Will the asset sales line up with an expected balance sheet clean up (with=
 prospective gains offsetting losses)?=20
"Can Enron sell its interest in Dabhol anytime soon, given the current war =
environment?=20
"What impact will the weakening economies of South America such as Brazil a=
nd Argentina, not too mention the negative economic sentiment here in the U=
S, have on Enron's and other internationally diverse companies' earnings ou=
tlook?"=20
These issues, along with the earnings drag from about 967 mln usd invested =
in its broadband unit and the viability of its 3.5 bln usd of goodwill, wil=
l likely continue to weigh on the stock near-term, explained Eassey.=20
Reflecting the above uncertainties, Eassey said he is "cautiously lightenin=
g" his 3-year growth outlook from the 20 pct range to 16-17 pct a year. Ear=
nings per share estimates for 2001 stand at 2.10 usd, while the 2003 foreca=
st is 2.45 usd.=20
Accordingly, Eassey's 'long-term' price objective now stands at 44 usd, or =
31 pct above its current price with an upgrade on the shares to buy from ac=
cumulate.=20

Power providers cry foul over fees / State is accused of improper billing

Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California's energy mark=
et are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager=
 is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gra=
y Davis' administration.=20
The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legall=
y required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping s=
tate power buyers spread out the cost of high- priced electricity contracts=
.
Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mys=
terious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney-Jo=
nes of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such =
industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant.=20
The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resourc=
es was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an av=
erage of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour.=20
"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Wate=
r Resources is giving them," Smutney-Jones said.=20
An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing =
a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could=
 order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been =
improperly charged.=20
The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid m=
anagement agency.=20
State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared Cal=
ifornia could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the =
state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot mar=
ket suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought.=20
Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said t=
he grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing pr=
actices to "bury" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the a=
ccounts of other generators.=20
"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control=
 the governing board of the ISO," Ackerman said.=20
The governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusatio=
ns "absolutely false" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentim=
ent in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs.=20
"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in=
 Washington than they will in Sacramento," Maviglio said. "It shouldn't be =
a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement=
."=20
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said gene=
rators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisi=
s.=20
"I don't feel sorry for them one bit," Hidalgo said. "They had one heck of =
a year."=20
Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a respon=
se to the accusations.=20
Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mec=
hanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs.=20
The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operat=
ing costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said=
.=20
Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for res=
ale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more exp=
ensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate st=
and-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, t=
he ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra =
cost.=20
The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In=
 January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was ch=
aired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with indust=
ry. Davis appointed his own five-member board.=20
In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become "=
a political arm of the governor." The commission is trying to get Californi=
a to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization.=20
Davis has warned Washington to "keep its hands off" the ISO.

Enron Corp. Raised to Long-Term `Buy' at Merrill
2001-10-09 06:00 (New York)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 9 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)

Donato J. Eassey at Merrill Lynch.  The near-term rating was maintained

Northwest to Buy Portland General
CBS MarketWatch.com
10/8/2001 7:44:00 PM=20
PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 08, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- Northwest Natural Ga=
s Co. is buying another Oregon utility from Enron Corp. for $1.8 billion, c=
ombining the state's largest natural gas and electric utilities in a merger=
 that may save ratepayers money but could also bring some job losses.
Richard G. "Dick" Reiten, chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural, said Monda=
y the gas company is buying Portland General Electric Co. after the Houston=
-based energy giant gave up on its expansion into the Pacific Northwest.
"We're extremely pleased that the acquisition will return PGE to local owne=
rship," Reiten said at a news conference.
Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said he was co=
ncerned the combination could encourage Northwest Natural to bypass state r=
egulators by using its business clout to lobby the Legislature and governor=
's office when rate increases are needed.
"If that's going to happen, and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legisl=
ature and the governor's office, then I don't think that's going to be in t=
he interest of PGE customers," Jenks said.
Northwest Natural was founded in 1859, the year Oregon became a state, usin=
g gas extracted from coal to light downtown street lamps.
PGE was founded in 1889 with a hydroelectric generator at Willamette Falls =
that anchored the nation's first long-distance electric transmission line w=
hen it was connected to the city, 14 miles to the north. The plant still op=
erates, generating 16 megawatts of electricity.
Reiten said the Northwest Natural board of directors has rejected buyout of=
fers itself in recent years in hopes that an opportunity like the PGE deal =
would come along.
"It was a conscious choice to remain independent and build assets rather th=
an sell out of state," Reiten said. "That patience has paid off."
He said the deal will create a $5 billion utility that can cut costs by com=
bining repair crews, equipment, service centers and billing in their overla=
pping service area.
Portland General has about 733,000 customers in northwestern Oregon and Nor=
thwest Natural has about 530,000 customers in roughly the same area, includ=
ing some in southwestern Washington state. Their headquarters are just a fe=
w blocks apart on the same downtown street.
Federal and state regulatory approval, along with shareholder approval, is =
expected to take about a year.
Some job cuts were expected, but Reiten said he hoped most would come throu=
gh attrition and retirement, rather than layoffs.
He said regulators have looked favorably on recent mergers of gas and elect=
ric utilities because they generally have saved money for ratepayers. Combi=
ned utilities already serve about two thirds of the nation, he added.
Enron purchased PGE in 1997 for about $3.2 billion, including assumption of=
 debt, hoping to tap into energy trading along the entire West Coast, from =
California to Washington state. But the Texas company found the pace of der=
egulation in Oregon too slow at a time when the California energy crisis wa=
s unfolding.
Enron has a history of buying and selling smaller companies as it searches =
for the best position in the constantly shifting energy market, said Mike H=
eim, an A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst who follows the Texas company.
"It's really more a strategic move," Heim said.
Enron will receive $1.55 billion cash and $350 million in securities for PG=
E.
Enron stock closed at $33.45 on Monday, up $1.72 per share. Northwest Natur=
al was at $22.99, down 42 cents a share.
