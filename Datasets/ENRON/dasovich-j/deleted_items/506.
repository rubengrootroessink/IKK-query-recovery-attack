Here is the DWR revenue requirement, which is good news for creditors.  It is significantly less on an annual basis, $2.66 B per annum vesus $4.2 B to $4.4B per annum shown before.  This difference can largely be explained by the fall-off in spot curves which explains $1.3 B per annum of the decrease.  All eyes will be on the utility's generation rate cases at CPUC on their retained gen, QF and billaterals.
