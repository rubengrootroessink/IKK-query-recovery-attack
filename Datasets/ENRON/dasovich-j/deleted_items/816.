A funny thing happened on the way to the market

The resources necessary to conduct clinical trials
require an enormous investment and small road bumps
in the drug approval process can kill a promising drug.
For many start-ups, one strike means you're out.  New
technologies and business models, however, promise to
dramatically change trial management.  This year's
Healthcare Outlook will look at the impact of clinical
trials on emerging companies as well as the investment
opportunities available in companies that look to change
the status quo. Healthcare Outlook's Private Equity
Platform has dedicated a special track that will feature
management presentations by early-stage companies looking
to improve the clinical trial process.  In addition, the
meeting will feature an industry roundtable, From the
