Technology is still the future. Be there.

Never before have startups been hit so hard.  Although
the longer term outlook remains bright, companies that
don't make the right moves now won't be around to enjoy
it. So VentureWire is calling together some of the
industry's most experienced executives, investors, and
experts for a one-day summit conference on private-
company leadership in these uncertain times. You'll get
practical advice from CEOs, COOs, and CFOs who've
managed venture-backed companies in crisis, as well as
straight talk from leading venture capitalists,
investment bankers, attorneys, and specialists in HR and
PR. Technology is cyclical, we all know that; think of
this as preparation for the coming upturn.

MARTINSRIED, GERMANY -- U3 Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company focused on the creation of novel therapeutic products that target key components of cellular signal transduction systems, said it raised EUR 5 million ($4.5 million) in its Series A.

* Mobile Enterprise Application Firm ViaFone Eyes Acquistions	top   mail <http://venturewire.com/o_mailer.asp?sid=LNQHPJMLII> 	
BRISBANE, CALIF. -- Fresh off its first acquisition, ViaFone, a provider of mobile enterprise software, said it is in active talks to make more, CEO Russell McMeekin told VentureWire.

ViaFone is interested in both technology assets and entire companies that have ran out of cash and have customers that fit ViaFone's profile. The company is also looking for management teams humbled by the current capital environment. "And that's a tough one to find because a lot of companies are out of cash but they're in denial so they think they're worth a lot of money," said Mr. McMeekin. "We are well-positioned to make acquisitions when they make sense, our board is supportive of them when they make sense," he said. 

Last month the company acquired IdeaCon Software, a provider of XML-based technology for the development and deployment of handheld applications.

ViaFone's applications bridge field sales and service employees, and critical business systems, information, and processes. The company today announced the launch of its latest product, OneBridge 3.0, and a partnership with B2B e-commerce integrator Endymion under which the two companies will jointly deliver mobile application services to global 2000 companies. 

ViaFone employs 60 people, including five in a Paris office. The company has plans to expand even more internationally, with Germany next. "We have been interviewing a general manager to lead Germany, we have been approached by German companies to form a joint venture," said Mr. McMeekin. ViaFone is also in talks with companies in Japan and Singapore about possible equity joint ventures. 

The company also announced today that Amir Hartman, managing director and co-founder of Manstay Partners, a technology consulting firm, as the eighth member of its board of directors. 

ViaFone has raised $33 million from investors including Angel Investors LP, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Partech International, Redpoint Ventures, and RRE Ventures. Mr. McMeekin said the company has no plans to seek more funding next year and expects to reach cash-flow positive by mid-2003.

* eMotion Acquires Defunct AudioBasket.com in Stock Deal

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- eMotion, a provider of digital media management software and services, said it has acquired AudioBasket, a provider of customized audio news and information that shut down two weeks ago, in a stock deal. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The fewer than 10 remaining employees at AudioBasket will join eMotion's staff of 90. None of AudioBasket's four founders will join eMotion, according to eMotion CEO Bob Griggin, who will continue in his role after the acquisition. eMotion will close its Redwood City, Calif. office and consolidate those employees in AudioBasket's San Francisco office. eMotion also has offices in Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York, London, and Los Angeles, Calif.

Mr. Griffin said AudioBasket's streaming media technology will be integrated into eMotion's product line, though the AudioBasket brand will not continue. eMotion did not assume any debts; AudioBasket had an undisclosed amount of cash at the time of acquisition.

AudioBasket shut down in early October because of the downturn in Internet advertising. The company had raised $26 million from Chartwell Capital Investors, Dotcom Ventures, Rock Creek Partners, Panasonic Ventures, Time Warner, Timucan Asset Management, and T-Venture.

eMotion is backed by $40 million from Adelson Investors, Chartwell Capital Investors II, Constellation Ventures, EMC, Enron, GE Capital, Kodak, National Geographic, Psilos, Saudi International Bank, Sun Microsystems, Veritas Software, and Wasserstein-Perrella, and Young & Rubicam.

Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science does not always equate with a good
investment opportunity. Generations of investors have
been burned and rewarded for taking risks on the
potential of early-stage therapies.  The drug discovery
process is a complex combination of tests and hurdles
for young companies.  Where are the signposts for
investors?  James Reddoch of Banc America Securities
will moderate a special roundtable dedicated to drug
research and discovery at January's Healthcare Outlook
Conference.  The experience of the panelists reflects
the complex considerations of modern research and
development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by Michael Grey of
Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta Partners,
Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell Harmison,
