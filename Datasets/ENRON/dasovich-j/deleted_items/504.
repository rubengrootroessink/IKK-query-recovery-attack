Whereas some of you have not yet committed to funding the PRI study by
Dr. Ben Zycher,  five of you have.  Those who have not confirmed
participation, please do so ASAP.  Per the request of Enron, and agreed
to by PRI, a preliminary abstract of the study will go out in early
August to members of the California Legislature.  This is to not only
wet their appetites, but also to provide some timely information in a
positive way while the Legislature remains in session.  The abstract
will be distributed by PRI.
