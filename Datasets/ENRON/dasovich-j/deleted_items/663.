Here are the agendas for the full Energy Committee meeting, as well as the
Load Management Subcommittee meeting.  The Load Management Subcommittee will
be meeting in the same place as the full EC, from 1:30 to 3:00pm.  The Full
EC will meet immediately following.  We look forward to seeing you all
there.
