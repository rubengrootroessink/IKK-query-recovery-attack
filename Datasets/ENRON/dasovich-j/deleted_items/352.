Yep - I heard the same thing -- no new language out as far as I know but if I get my hands on something I will send it your way.

Thanks,
Delaney

FYI.  This is what IEP's lobbyist is saying.  Jive with what you're hearing?  Any language floating around?  Any idea of which issues there is/isn't agreement on?

Best,
Jeff

Despite the legislative break, on Thursday a working meeting convened to
discuss the Edison MOU and to find common ground for potential legislation
in the Assembly. Rick Simpson on behalf of Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly
Members Keeley, Dutra, Goldberg, Wright, Steinberg (by phone) as well as
staff from other offices participated. A representative from the State
Treasurer's office was also present.  We have touched base with a variety of
sources and believe that no issues were finally resolved during the
discussion; however there seems to have been general agreement on some
issues and staff has been asked to draft language attempting to memorialize
those agreement points in time for the group to consider the language at its
next meeting early next week.
