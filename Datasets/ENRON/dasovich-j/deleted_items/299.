Jeff - Can you answer Jess's question?  I wondered the same thing myself.  =
It doesn't make much sense to raise the rates in order to make payments to =
the customers.

Well, this is interesting.  Are they talking about the same period during w=
hich gas costs were supposed to have been so unreasonably, and allegedly il=
legally, high due to the actions of those greedy Texas energy firms?

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index=20
published : August 10, 2001
SoCalGas Posts $223 Million in Gas-Cost Savings=20
California regulators may be scratching their heads about what to do with g=
as purchasing incentives for the state's major utilities following Southern=
 California Gas Co.'s filing that claims its purchases over a 12-month peri=
od ending last June were $223 million below market prices.=20
It was the "largest amount of savings on gas costs during any one-year peri=
od in our 134-year history" of SoCalGas, which is owned by San Diego-based =
Sempra Energy, according to Anne Smith, a vice president quoted in a report=
 to the company's employees.=20
Under a regulator-approved "gas cost incentive mechanism (GCIM) that has be=
en in place in recent years, the utility can apply a formula allowing it to=
 share the savings between customers and shareholders." It's an incentive t=
o the utility "to take reasonable risks to keep gas costs low, while ensuri=
ng a reliable supply," SoCalGas's director of gas acquisition, Jim Harrigan=
, told employees in the recent report.=20
With this relatively embarrassing "windfall" for shareholders, the utility =
recommended to the California Public Utilities Commission in June two optio=
ns for spreading the wealth:=20
1.=09Give shareholders a relatively modest $30.8 million and make the utili=
ty's proposed adjustments to the GCIM program in future years. The modifica=
tions were agreed to many months ago in a settlement among SoCalGas; the CP=
UC; the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA); and the statewide utility cons=
umer group TURN (The Utility Reform Network); or=20
2.=09Award $106 million to the utility's shareholders, which is what SoCalG=
as says is the shareholders' share under the current GCIM formula.=20
Both options carry proposed rate increases to implement them. The first wou=
ld necessitate a 44 cents/month increase for a 12-month period, while the s=
econd alternative would require a $1.52/month hike for one year.=20
