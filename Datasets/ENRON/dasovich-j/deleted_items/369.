Which one of the documents below should we use as the starting point for Rick's other request (that we identify the positions we think are critical for legislators)?  

I think we should get the document to Rick early next week.

Rick:

In preparation for Monday's meeting with Mayor Brown, attached are the following:

A backgrounder, providing an overview of recent events in California's ongoing energy crisis.
A condensed version of the presenation that you and others in Government Affairs have been using to convey Enron's view of California's crisis.
A "California Solutions" word document and presentation that Ken Lay used when he was in California a few months ago.
The letter that we sent to Senator Dunn in response to his committee's treatment of Enron as part of the investigation in California's wholesale markets.
Message points that PR's been using to respond to the Dunn contempt charges.
The draft of the letter that we intend to send to all California State Senators urging them to vote no on Dunn's contempt recommendation.

Hope this helps.  If there's anything else you need, don't hesitate.  I'll be giving the presentation today from 5:30-7:00 PM EDT.  If you need me, try my cell phone 415.505.6633, or pager 888.916.7184. 

Best,
Jeff
