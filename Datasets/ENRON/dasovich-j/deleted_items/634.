 Political  Philosophies: Explained in Simple "Two-Cow" Terms
with an Update for the  state of California

Socialism: You have two cows. You keep one, but  must
give the other to your neighbor.

Communism: You have two cows.  The government takes
both and provides you with milk.

Fascism: You  have two cows. The government takes
both and sells you the  milk.

Bureaucracy: You have two cows. The government
takes them,  shoots one, milks the other, pays you
for the milk, and then pours it down  the drain.

Dictatorship: You have two cows. The government
takes both,  then shoots you.

Capitalism: You have two cows. You sell one and buy
a  bull.

Democracy: You have two cows. The government taxes
you to the  point that you must sell them both to
support a man in a foreign country who  has only one
cow, which was a gift from your own  government.

Corporation: You have two cows. You lay one off,
force the  other to produce the milk of four cows, then
act surprised when it drops  dead.

California: You have two cows. The state tells you how
to milk  your cows, when to milk your cows, how much to
milk your cows and the most  that you can charge for the
milk. You go broke and sell the cows. The state  calls you
greedy and blames you for the current milk shortage.
