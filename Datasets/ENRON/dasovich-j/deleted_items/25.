Hello everyone,

I guess you all have been wondering what is wrong and why I have been out of the office.  No Mr. Wong it's not Anthrax!

I have been ill for a while but not as bad as I am currently doing............I have had diabetes for the past six years and a heart that likes to act up every once in a while. These two sometimes don't mix well and currently my situation has gotten a little worse.  On Sunday I got really ill and my face and arm on the right side were really numb, which are signs of an early stroke.  It is not the first time that it has happened and I am taking medication to control my current situation.  I am also waiting on results from the doctor on my kidneys diagnosis.  
People with diabetes have extra reason to be mindful of heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes carries an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, and complications related to poor circulation. 
I just want to make you all aware of what is going on with me and to let you know that I am taking my medication and will try to do a better job in taking care of myself.

Hopefully we can all get back to work as usual.

Thanks,

Cristina
