I have a child care issue that day -- but I'll try to work it out so I
can be there.

The Latino caucus would like to have dinner with us in Sacramento on
September 4. The total number of caucus attendees will be dictated by
how
many of us can make it.  They will do the coordination.  Any takers?
The
African American caucus has contacted us as well and they are trying to
determine a date and time for either a dinner or a lunch.  They will do
the
coordination.
