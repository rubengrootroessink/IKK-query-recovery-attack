Internet Daily 
for Wednesday, January 2, 2002
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Women are majority of eshoppers

An estimated 29 million Internet users bought gifts online 
during the holiday shopping season, and 58% of them were women, 
according to a nationwide study by the Pew Internet & American 
Life Project.

"It's a vote of confidence for the online environment," said Lee 
Rainie, the project's director. "It means women think of the 
Internet in a much more serious way." Last year, online shoppers 
were even split between men and women. For women, a major 
attraction of online shopping is its time-saving efficiency, 
Rainie said.

AOL Time Warner's AOL found a  trend among its shoppers. 
"Overall, females accounted for 64% of all shopping, 
underscoring the extent to which AOL's shopping audience is 
paralleling offline retailing and making online buying a habit," 
the company said in a release. AOL added its members spent $33 
billion online during 2001, an increase of 67% from the prior 
year's levels.

Online job sites frustrate

There's a whole lot of lookin' going on, but not much hiring. 
That's the complaint of many users of online job sites, such as 
Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, according to The Wall Street 
Journal, which cites the experience of a 37-year-old Indiana 
woman as a representative example. Grace Dubois spends five 
hours a day searching through job boards. She has applied for 
nearly 400 positions in the health-care industry; seven have 
resulted in job interviews.

Her experience is supported by research, the newspaper reported. 
Outplacement consultants Drake Beam Morin said Internet job 
resources account for only 6% of management-level job hiring. 
CareerXroads, a consulting company that publishes an annual 
guide to job boards, found corporate Web sites are the most 
effective resources for job seekers.

The biggest complaint from users of CareerJournal, the job site 
operated by the Journal, is there are not enough listings. There 
are about 23,000 jobs posted, down from 35,000 a year ago. Any 
failure to follow up with applicants is the fault of employers, 
not employment sites, Dimitri Boylan, president of Hotjobs.com 
-- soon to be acquired by Yahoo -- told The Journal.

AOL blocks Harvard acceptance emails

America Online cannot explain why it blocked delivery of about 
100 emails to applicants from Harvard University's admissions 
office. Harvard said it used email to notify almost 6,000 
students who applied for early admission, the Associated Press 
reported. While between 75 and 100 messages were bounced back to 
Harvard, most of the applicants telephoned the admissions office 
to get their answer.
