Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised Proposed
Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron have
indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the
Court of Appeals.

I look forward to your comments.

Mike Day
