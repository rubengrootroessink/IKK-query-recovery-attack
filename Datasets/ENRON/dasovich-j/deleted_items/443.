AOL offers bounty on subscribers

AOL Time Warner is reportedly offering computer makers $35 for
each of their customers who sign up for the America Online
service.

AOL is working to have manufacturers build into their PC systems
not only on-screen icons for signups, but also pop-up notices
and other messages, according to the Washington Post. "AOL's
actions are unprecedented and completely anti-consumer,"
Microsoft spokesman Vivek Varma told the Post. "AOL is paying
[computer makers] to eliminate consumer choice, forcing people
to select the most expensive service in the industry."

AOL's goal is greater visibility for its online and instant
messaging services and Netscape browser. "This is a forthright
step into being able to market to consumers in ways that,
because of Microsoft's monopoly, AOL has not been able to market
previously," AOL Vice President John Buckley told the Post.

Domains on sale

WebMagic is cutting prices for 300 domain names it owns. They
include News.org and Vacation.net. Founder Greg McLemore said
the sale is being conducted for both business and humanitarian
reasons. "This presents the best opportunity for entrepreneurs
to acquire key Internet real estate since the beginning of the
great Internet land rush," he said. He registered many of the
names, thinking they could be used to start businesses. "Selling
them now makes it easier for us to focus our energies on our
core projects," which include several gaming sites, he said.
Prices for the domains range from $5,000 for adjustments.com to
$100,000 for trials.com.

Reality confronts labels' download plans

Brutal honesty was front and center as teenagers gave their
views about the future of online music at an industry
conference. "I don't download anymore," a 17-year-old Long
Island, N.Y., rock fan said. "I've already got 'em all." His
favorite download site used to be Napster, but he's moved on to
peer-to-peer services such as Bearshare Limewire, Newsbytes said
in its report on the panel at Jupiter Media Metrix's Plug.In
meeting. "I don't think the current pay system for Internet
stuff with a credit card is going to work because not very many
people our age have them," the fan added.

Hispanics are enthusiastic Net users

Half of Hispanic adults use the Internet and e-mail, according
to a survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project. The
online Hispanic population grew 25% over a period of 12 months,
as young people, women and those from modest income households
flocked online, said the project's director, Lee Rainie. Some
78% of Hispanics say they go online three to five times a week
and 61% log on daily.
