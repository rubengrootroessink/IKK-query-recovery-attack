Internet Daily 
for Friday, October 26, 2001

Google searches for subscriptions

Search technology company Google Inc. is reportedly weighing 
offering searches for a fee.

Subscription options could include "vertical market" searches, 
which could have an appeal to academic researchers and 
consumers, CNET reported. Medical information or technology are 
two areas reportedly being studied. A Google source said plans 
are still at the discussion stage, and no immediate offering is 
planned. "Their big problem right now is that 70%  of their 
revenues come from advertising," Danny Sullivan, editor of 
SearchEngineWatch.com told CNET. "You tend to get nervous when 
you're largely dependent on one thing," he added.

Cox cuts local Web sites

Cox Communications Inc.'s Cox Enterprises is pulling the plug on 
city site portals Miami and Los Angeles. Layoffs at the 
company's Web division, Cox Interactive, will include about 70 
employees, according to Newsbytes. The unit will continue to 
operate about 20 other local sites. The downturn in advertising, 
following the terrorist attacks six weeks ago, prompted Cox to 
reorganize, the company's director of communications explained.

Clear Channel, MTV regroup on Web radio

Clear Channel Communications  is expected to cut dozens of 
employees over the next two months as it closes the company's 
West Coast-based Internet division, the Los Angeles Times 
reported. Online operations will be shifted to operating 
divisions within the company; the radio and concert units will 
handle their own online efforts.

And Viacom's  Internet division has pulled its online radio 
stations from the Sonicnet.com Web site. MTV Radio streams are 
still available on its own Web sites. No layoffs are expected. 
Sonicnet continues to operate, however it is no longer offering 
radio, including personal playlists created by users. "Strategic 
decisions have led us to indefinitely deactivate all personal 
music stations on Sonicnet.com," a message on the site said.
