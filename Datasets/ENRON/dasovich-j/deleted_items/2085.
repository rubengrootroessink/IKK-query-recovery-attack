Dan:

I have made only a few minor changes.  Additionally:
*	Should we briefly define nominal rationale in a footnote?
*	Could number 7 be condensed?  It seems a bit drawn out  at four
pages.
*	Under C.1. I believe the DASR Cut-Off Date refers to Connect DASRs
only.  Everything the UDCs have submitted to date states they will continue
to accept all other types of DASR requests including Disconnects and
Updates, therefore I deleted the first example on our second objection.
This also appears to bring our third objection in to question as well.  
*	Should we mention that the UDCs did not clarify their definition of
DASR?  I am certain that they intended to say Connect DASRs, not all DASRs.
(I have confirmed this with SDG&E and PG&E and am waiting on a response from
SCE.)
*	You mention you are waiting for something from Jeff Dasovich on the
final item.  Have you received anything?  All I have seen is an outline type
document sent around on the 21st, is there something additional?  I have
some questions concerning how we would send a DASR to the PUC.  Perhaps I
have missed something.  If you, or someone in AReM, could explain I would
appreciate it.

Thank you,
