This is an excellent letter.  When it goes final, I'd like to use it here in DC.  We have some inquiries on what this snit is all about.

Attached is the final draft of the letter to the members of the Senate urging them to reject the Dunn committee's recommendation on contempt and fines.  Richard Sanders, Mark Haedicke and the other lawyers have reviewed and provided comments.

Here is the current game plan.

?	The letter will be individually addressed to each member of the Senate.  Scott Govenar will provide the names and addresses of the Senators.
?	Steve Kean will make any final changes and sign.
?	Scott, Hedy and Bev will deliver to the offices of each of the Senators as soon as possible.
?	Karen and Mark will disseminate to the press as soon as possible.

If there are comments/suggestions on the game plan, please let us know.  Thanks to all for the effort.

Best,
Jeff
