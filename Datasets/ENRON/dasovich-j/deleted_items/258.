Jeff --
I hope Jim Steffes already discussed this conference with you and I'm not spoiling the surprise!!  I'm helping Laurie Malone pull presentation material for the conference. Lynette Barnes is pulling together general electric and gas regulatory information for all of the states except California and said you would be the source for California update info. Do you have a standard pitch that you use or have other ideas about the content of the presentation?

Thanks,
Shirleen

I spoke with Jim Steffes this week and he recommended that we substitute Jeff Dasovich for the speaker at the law conference.  Jeff is more attuned to the regulatory environment in the west and is only a short flight to the conference.  I support this recommendation, so unless there is a major problem, I will hand off to Jeff.
