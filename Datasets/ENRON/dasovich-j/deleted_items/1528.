NetLibrary's unhappy ending

Net Library Inc., founded to share university library resources 
and costs, filed for bankruptcy. The Online Computer Library 
Center has made an offer to buy the 4-year-old Dublin, Ohio, 
company's assets including 40,000 digitized versions of books 
for $10 million. "Ebooks complement our growing ejournal 
collection and provide exciting new synergies for our 
cataloging, resource sharing, reference and digital preservation 
services," said OCLC President Jay Jordan.

President gets Net tax ban bill

Legislation exempting the Internet from state and local taxes is 
awaiting a signature from President Bush for it to become law. 
The U.S. Senate OK'd the bill yesterday. It protects the Web 
from levies until November 1, 2003. One study suggests states 
lose $13.3 billion in uncollected sales taxes on Web commerce.

GM to park ebusiness inside

General Motors will move its ebusiness division under the 
company's corporate wing, according to The Wall Street Journal. 
Mark Hogan, head of the 100-person eGM unit, said "We're on a 
migration path to weave it into the organization." Hogan expects 
to find another position within GM, he said. GM is still 
interested in exploiting the Web, but "people are doing a lot 
less arm-waving about it" with the end of the Internet bubble.

AOL.com redesigned

AOL Time Warner's AOL.com Web site has been reworked to make its 
member services, including Instant Messenger and email, more 
easily accessible on the Net. The page is substantially less 
complicated or busy than its previous form, offering links to 
categories of information, but not highlighting numerous content 
items.
