JD-- Do you know what the AB or SB number for the below legislation is?  I was hoping to print out a copy of the latest version off the internet.

Thx,

Wu

Subject:	CA Legislation Update

Following is a summary of Jeff Dasovich's latest update on the regulatory front:

There is legislation working its way through the CA assembly that, among other things, would have the following effects:
Suspend Direct Access from 9/1/01 through 12/31/02; new DA rules in effect starting 1/1/03
Customers who switch to DA between 8/23/01 and 9/1/01 would be responsible for paying their pro rata share of DWR's out of the money forward contracts (mechanism and details unclear).  Express purpose for this provision is to prevent a "rush" to DA
DA customers may also have to pay for their share of the utilities' 2000 undercollections and surcharges for power they consumed that DWR purchased between 1/17/01 and the date they switch to DA

Legislation like this could pass next week.  We don't think this changes the way we are currently contracting in CA, but you should be aware this is out there if your are working on a CA contract.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  MDS
