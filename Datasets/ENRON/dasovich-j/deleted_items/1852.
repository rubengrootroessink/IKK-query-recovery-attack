Dear STudents,

Some of you have sent me emails this week and your messages and email
addresses were chopped off or incomplete. So if I haven't responded to
your emails yet, please re-send them, making sure that you send an address
to which I can reply to you.

Thanks,

Monica Singh
Evening MBA Librarian
