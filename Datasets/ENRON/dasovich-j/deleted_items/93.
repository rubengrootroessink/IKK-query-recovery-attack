Greetings!
With the last re-org, I am back in the California market.  I was in the NJ market for the summer....a summer hiatus, if you will...now, I am assigned to the West which includes both TX and CA.  fun, fun!

I need to get back on your distribution lists for interesting insights into the CA Govt and Regulatory systems.

However, in an effort to reduce the amount of duplication (instead of me turning around and sending it to you again as well as the Originators), please let me know if you can add the following to your lists:

Jennifer Rudolph
Mark Reese
Lamar Frazier
Ed Hamb
Kevin Keeney
Maria Martinez
Ian McAbeer
Michele Sorensen
George Waidelich
John McMullan
Juan Samudio
Sean Dookie
Sue Ewing
Derek Kelly
Ron Mentan
Cheryl Morgan-Dorsey
Aida O'Neal

All are either Origination or Structuring people.
Again, please let me know.
