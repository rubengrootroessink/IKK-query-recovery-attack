This is probably not a good thing for marketing affiliates in general!! =20

We can't figure out what El Paso's strategy is here, but surely they have o=
ne.  Either that, or they were afraid to put their guys back on the stand o=
n the affiliate abuse issue.

Subject:=09CPUC v. El Paso

The California affiliate abuse case of El Paso ended today when El Paso ref=
used to bring CEO William Wise, and Chairman of the pipeline, John Somerhal=
der to testify before the ALJ.  The Judge had warned El Paso on Friday that=
 it must defend itself against the accusations set forth by the CPUC.  Inst=
ead, El Paso made a motion for summary judgement to the Judge.  After a ver=
y short recess, the Judge came back and denied the motion finding that the =
CPUC had made its prima facia case and El Paso had failed to provide the fu=
ll record to defend itself.  Much of the evidence in the case was reviewed =
by the Judge in camera and put into the record in a redacted format.   The =
Judge's Initial Decision is due October 9, 2001.  The Judge made further co=
mments that this was clearly a case of a pipeline and merchant affiliate de=
aling both sides of a deal.  The Judge indicated that information about all=
 aspects of the pipeline and merchant businesses was sent to Wise in memora=
nda with minute detail with cc:s to Somerhalder.
