The wedding shower for Alice and Jeff is moving to Nora's house (2931-A
Fillmore Street) on Sepember 8th at 5:00. This way hopefully you all
that have previous plans can stop by for a quick congrats drink.
    It will be potluck (for those of you who are staying to eat) bring
an appetizer, salad or side dish and beverage of your choice. And Nora
and I will provide the main course and cake.
    For the people that want to contribute to the gift ($20?) send me
back a response and I will tally up what we have to spend and pick out
something appropriate.

kari :)
