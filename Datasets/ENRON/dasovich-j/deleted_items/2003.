Green, but it didn't seem to matter.

Hope to hear back from you later today.

We saw Del McCourey last night - so much fun.  We are going to a bluegrass
jam with Esquire Dan tonight.

I'll get back to you today.  Houston is dealing with some pretty big
issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.  How's
the weather in the big apple?  You vote for Green or Bloomberg?

Do you have any more info about the meeting on the 13th.  It looks like
mid morning would be a good time (if the meeting is still going to
happen).  I obviously understand if you have bigger issues to deal with,
but I have to arrange plane flights for myself and Marc if necessary.

I hope things are going well.
