Further info:

The Bay Islands are located about 40 miles north of the coast of Honduras in
the western Caribbean Sea. The largest of the Bay Islands, Roatan measures
approximately 29 miles long and 2 miles wide. A mountainous ridge runs along
the center of the island creating scenic hiking through tropical trees,
pockets of rainforest, vines and flowers to dramatic vistas overlooking the
ocean and reef. Along the coast are diverse ecosystems from intricate
mangroves and dramatic iron shore coastline to beautiful sandy beaches and
inlets. And of course, just a short distance from shore is the barrier reef
that has made Roatan famous for spectacular diving.

The average temperature in Roatan is a balmy 80 F. The trade winds provide a
constant gentle breeze. 

The Islanders speak both English and Spanish and welcome the tourist trade.
The island has a modern airport, phones, faxes, paved road, and electricity;
however, Roatan is still laid-back! Everyone operates on "island time" which
allows for conversation, a second cup of hot Honduran coffee and a chance to
enjoy the peaceful surroundings. There are no shopping malls or fancy
nightclubs. This is the place for quiet mornings on the dock with a
fresh-picked mango; hammock time with the sunset and a tropical drink; fun
nights at the local disco; and of course, diving and snorkeling!

Thank you for your prompt reply. I have taken the time to listen to all of
your concerns and have responded below appropriately.

Question 1: my "need" would more appropriately be characterized as a
"desire" (something that, according to my buddhism class yesterday, would be
beneficial to give up if I want to achieve true happiness). The desire,
however, is related to the possibility of spending a fair amount of time in
diving locations during my honeymoon. Due to the limited amount of vacation
time I am alotted from my employer, I am going to find it necessary to
forego all vacation opportunities for the next 10 months (other than this
week between Christmas and New Years) and hence find it necessary to use the
specified time to obtain the coveted certification. No, I am not interested
in getting certified in Monterey Bay.

Question 2: As far as I know the weather is quite pleasant year round. I
know the place we intend to go is on an island off the eastern coast of
Honduras. I hope to provide you with a more deailed answer after consulting
reliable travel guides and weather almanacs.

Question 3: The diving is supposed to be quite "killer" (as you put it). I
have a direct recommendation from my travel obsessed friend, jessica, who
just got certified there a couple months ago and has provided me with both
information and endorsements. Yes, Belizeis supposed to be very good also,
but the island we would be going to is practcally in Belize. Please refer to
a map of Honduras (which shall be provided at a later date).

I apprecieate your questions and coments and await your reply.

Sincerely,

Cameron

Interesting.

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really
need to get certified for diving."

Question 2: How hot is it down there?

Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to
dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz)
where the diving is supposed to be killer?

I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and
new
years this year.  I really need to get certified for diving and the
diving
there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all
PADI).  PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with
me.
So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing.  Then,
if
you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying
down
there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I
think
Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So,
you
might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
What do you think?
