NetRadio signal fades

NetRadio Corp.  said late Wednesday it shut down operations and 
terminated almost all its employees. Last December, the 
Minneapolis company said it employed 50 people.

One of the Internet's original Webcasters, NetRadio.com streamed 
more than 100 channels of music. Chief executive Cary Deacon 
said an expected acquisition by the Advisory Board Inc., 
announced Aug. 30, failed because the New York group could not 
find financing. That prompted the decision to halt operations. 
"Current operating performance (is) unable to support the future 
working capital needs of the business," he said in a statement. 
"A small management group and the board of directors will 
continue to pursue strategic alternatives," he added. The 
Advisory Board intended to buy the 60% of NetRadio owned by 
Navarre Corporation  and ValueVision International Inc..

MSNBC pursues syndication revenue

MSNBC.com said its major news articles will be translated into 
eight languages and offered for redistribution to online and 
offline publishers internationally. The translation service will 
be provided by ILanguage of Redmond, Wash. "It is a logical next 
step for us to extend our reach to readers around the world," 
said Merrill Brown, editor-in-chief of the Web site, jointly 
owned by Microsoft  and General Electric's  NBC. The stories 
will be translated into German, French, Spanish, Japanese, 
Chinese, Italian, Portuguese and Korean. Yesterday, MSNBC 
launched an Arabic language site.

EarthLink acquires email machine maker

EarthLink  said it will exchange $5 million worth of its stock 
to buy Cidco Inc., a maker of email access devices. "Cidco has 
proven that there is a truly viable market for devices that 
offer quick, easy access to e-mail and personalized content 
within the home, without using a computer," said Lance 
Weatherby, EarthLink's executive vice president . The deal will 
add 120,000 Cidco service subscribers to EarthLink's customer 
base. Morgan Hill, Calif.-based Cidco's users pay $9.95 a month 
for email access. The manufacturer's devices are sold through 
major retail chains including Best Buy  and Target.

from labels which include Madacy, Navarre, OWIE, Razor & Tie, 
Roadrunner and Rounder.
