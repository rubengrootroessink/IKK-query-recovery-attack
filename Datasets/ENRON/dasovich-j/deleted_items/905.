VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	It was fairly quiet on the VC front Wednesday as ten companies reported raising approximately $59 million.
The big winner was GeneFormatics, a structural proteomics company, that raised $22 million in third-round funding
led by Perseus-Soros, which also led the company's $15 million Series B round last October. Meanwhile, education software company Carnegie Learning pulled in a $14 million second round co-led by previous investors Collier Investments and Draper Triangle Ventures. The company also announced that Robert Longo resigned as president and CEO to join Emerald Partners, a consulting firm, and that it has laid off approximately 30% of its staff.

In more promising news for the life sciences sector, JPMorgan Partners and PPD, a provider of discovery and development services and products for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, teamed up to form a new company called Apothogen, which will acquire, develop, and commercialize pharmaceutical products.

Webvan was also in the news again as WhyRunOut.com, an online provider of neighborhood retail and delivery services in Southern California, said it has acquired the rights to the West Coast customers of the defunct online grocery service that filed for bankruptcy last July for an undisclosed amount of cash. Undaunted by Webvan's much publicized demise, Dan Frahm, president of WhyRunOut, expects to expand to most or all of the West Coast markets for which it now has customer lists by sometime next year. The company is not hunting for new funding, but it may fundraise as it expands to the new markets. Why not? - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

Technology is still the future. Be there.

Never before have startups been hit so hard.  Although
the longer term outlook remains bright, companies that
don't make the right moves now won't be around to enjoy
it. So VentureWire is calling together some of the
industry's most experienced executives, investors, and
experts for a one-day summit conference on private-
company leadership in these uncertain times. You'll get
practical advice from CEOs, COOs, and CFOs who've
managed venture-backed companies in crisis, as well as
straight talk from leading venture capitalists,
investment bankers, attorneys, and specialists in HR and
PR. Technology is cyclical, we all know that; think of
this as preparation for the coming upturn.
