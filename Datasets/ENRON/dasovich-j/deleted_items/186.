Dear Incoming Evening MBA Students,

You all have access to most of the library's databases and electronic
journals remotely after you have configured your browser to communicate
with the library's proxy server. 

The one database for which you don't need a proxy intermediary is
"Onesource" - you will find Onesource to be one of the most useful
databases while you are at Haas. Onesource seamlessly integrates
information from a lot of excellent international business publications and
just like its name suggests, it is a one-stop source for much of your
business research. 

You will need a password and username to access Onesource. The initial
password and username will be:

yourhasslogin.ucb

so, if you are philemon@haas.berkeley.edu, you will login to Onesource using 

philemon.ucb

for both your username and your password. 


Onesource is accessible at, believe-it-or-not, http://www.onesource.com and
you can access this database from any browser anywhere anytime with your
password. After you have logged in for the first time, please change your
username and password to one you will easily remember. 

You can change your password when you are at the initial search screen by
clicking on the Account Maintenance link and the rest should be self
explanatory.  If you forget the password you set for yourself, you will
have to contact Onesource directly yourselves to be issued another one. 

(If you can't get in using the initial password that has been set for you,
please email me. There are a few of you and I don't know who you are yet,
who have been issued passwords that are different from your haas logins. I
will have a list of passwords that are something other than haas logins by
Monday, the 27th. I won't be able to do anything before then if  you can't
get in.)

Most of the rest of the library's electronic products require the proxy
setup on your end. If you haven't done this yet, instructions for this
deceptively simple procedure are at http://proxy.lib.berkeley.edu - you
will also find information on username and password, troubleshooting your
setup, known problems, at this site. 


Email me with questions. I'll respond on Monday, the 27th. 

Monica Singh
