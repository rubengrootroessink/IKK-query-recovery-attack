I mislabled the starting time-period as 2000, instead of 2001.   The rest of the figures are correct.  Jeff and I spoke about a comparison with the prior DWR forecast from April 27th, which is added.  Note that the definition of  non-contracted now is really those volumes which are either true spot or contracts less than 90 days in duration.   In other words, heavily exposed to price risk.   A revised file is attached above.

To answer Jeff's question from yesterday, and with the new DWR info, the attached spreadsheet indicates the non contracted (floating) position of DWR.
