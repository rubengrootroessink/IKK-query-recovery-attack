Mansion Tour 
Fifty volunters, working over 8,000 hours, transform the Dunsmuir Mansion
into a breathtaking late 19th century Holiday masterpiece.  Visitors start
their self-guided tour in the grand foyer where their eyes are drawn to the
magnificent 2-story Christmas tree reaching toward the Mansion's exquisite
Tiffany-style
stained glass dome.  As the tour progresses, pleasant surprises abound ...
elegant trees and garlands, antique furnishings, exquisite packages and
festive decorations.
