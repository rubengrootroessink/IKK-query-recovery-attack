JOINING THE HAAS NETWORK: NEW MBA, UNDERGRADUATE, AND PH.D. STUDENTS ARRIVE AT HAAS 

The Haas School is bubbling with activity this week as the new school year begins and incoming classes of students in four degree programs settle into their new routines. In keeping with tradition, the Undergraduate, Evening MBA, MBA, and Ph.D. programs have worked hard to admit select groups of students. 


"I am thrilled with the outstanding students we have admitted for this fall's entering class," says Pete Johnson, acting co-director of admissions for the full-time MBA program. "They are a talented and diverse group of people who bring a wealth of experiences with them to Haas."


The full-time MBA class of 2003 includes 238 students, selected from an applicant pool of 3,259.  Thirty-five percent of the new first-years are international students, representing 31 different countries.  Seventy-four percent are bilingual and 62% are trilingual.  


On average, the members of the new MBA class have 5 years of professional work experience, and they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Haas community.  The class includes a producer from Fox Sports and NBC TV, a freelance director of plays and musicals, a design engineer from Porsche, and a former writer for "Let's Go" travel books.  On the extracurricular side, the class includes members of the Peruvian National Rowing Team; the Kyoto University Ballroom Dancing Team; the 1994 National Taekwondo Champion; a four-time state cycling champion; and the winner of a 1999 New York Film Festival producer award for best drama. 


The new Evening MBA students distinguish themselves by their strong educational backgrounds. The Evening MBA class of 116 students represents 13 countries and the students have, on average, 7.1 years of post-university work experience. Thirty-five percent of the students hold Masters degrees and 9% have Ph.D.s. Thirty-three percent of the class is bilingual and 25% is trilingual. 


"This was a particularly competitive applicant pool, with a 60% increase in applications from last year," says Diane Dimeff, executive director of the Evening MBA Program. "We broke our previous record for applications by 30%, so we are especially excited about this group of new students and the depth and breadth of experience they bring to the classroom."


The Evening MBA class includes a former submarine officer; the chief of Otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat specialist) at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco; a California water resources manager; an associate treasury program manager for the state of California; a researcher who helped establish a clinical program to provide experimental medicine for a viral liver disease; a competitive swimmer; a student who helped pay his way through school by fighting forest fires for two summers; and a student who interned in a high-pressure French restaurant in Paris.


As one of the most popular undergraduate majors on campus, the Haas Undergraduate program always attracts the cream of the crop of continuing Cal and incoming transfer students. This year, off the 1,150 applicants to the Undergraduate Program, 214 have enrolled. Seventy-nine of the students transferred to UC Berkeley. For the UC Berkeley admits, the average GPA was 3.59. 


In the Ph.D. program 467 people applied to the program, but only 39 were admitted. Sixteen new Ph.D. students were enrolled, bringing the total for the program to 80. The average GMAT for the students is 730 and the average GPA is 3.82. There are 11 men and six women in the class. Ten of the students are international, hailing from eight different countries. "We have students from Asia, Europe, South America, New Zealand, and the US," says Jan Price Greenough, associate director of the Ph.D. Program. "They have compiled an impressive scholastic and professional record.  We are very excited about their potential and promise and look forward to a very good class."

CHANCELLOR BERDAHL APPOINTS BEN HERMALIN INTERIM DEAN 

When Dean Laura Tyson announced that she would resign on December 31, 2001, Chancellor Robert Berdahl immediately announced that he would appoint Ben Hermalin as interim dean while the university runs a national search for a new dean of the Haas School. 
  
Associate Dean Ben Hermalin has been an integral part of Dean Tyson's administration at Haas since he was appointed associate dean in 1999.  "Ben has worked closely with me and the rest of the Dean's Office on all of our initiatives, from the Pilot Program to the new degree programs, " says Tyson. "He has won the loyalty and support of both faculty and staff through his unique combination of boundless energy, fairness, attention to detail, intelligence, and good humor.  He is committed to the well-being of the Haas School and has been an effective advocate for its interests on the campus."


Hermalin, 39, is the Willis H. Booth Professor of Banking and Finance and has been with the Haas School since 1988. He has a joint appointment with the Department of Economics and is a co-founder and director of the private online academic publishing company Bepress.


As associate dean Hermalin overseas all faculty recruitment and retention as well as merit raises and promotions for the Haas faculty. Working with Dean Tyson, Hermalin has helped to get permission from the campus administration to recruit more faculty members in a given year than is normally allowed and to meet competitive offers to current faculty. "Dean Tyson has built a good team, a strong organization, and an excellent staff. I hope to provide continuity and continue the school's initiatives," says Hermalin of his future role as interim dean.


"Haas is very fortunate to have someone of Ben's stature, experience, and dedication willing to serve as interim dean," says Michael Katz, the Edward J. and Mollie Arnold Professor of Business Administration. "His ability to be equally comfortable in a three-piece suit and a Hawaiian shirt makes him ideally suited to face the diverse challenges of leading the school." 
  
His recent research has focused on telecom pricing with Katz. This fall he will teach a Ph.D. course in the economics department called, "Mechanism Design and Agency Theory." 
Hermalin holds a BA in Economics from Princeton and a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is also on the Editorial Board for the American Economic Review and is co-editor of the Berkeley Electronic Journals in Economic Analysis & Policy. 


"Ben is an excellent squash player," says Dwight Jaffee, professor of banking and finance.  "My hope is that his deanly duties will slow him down so that I can win more often." 


Tyson and Hermalin will work together throughout the fall with Andy Shogan, Jay Stowsky, and the school's professional staff to make the 2001-2002 academic year a successful one for the Haas School.

 ALL OF THE 2001 YEAH GRADUATES PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION 

In another sign of continuing success for the Young Entrepreneurs At Haas (YEAH) program all ten of the 2001 graduating high school seniors from the Young Entrepreneurs Program are continuing their education. 


"Our YEP students have taken to heart the principles and real-life lessons of entrepreneurship and finance, and followed their interest toward higher education," says Oscar Wolters-Duran, director of YEAH. "It's a real testimony to the quality of our Haas MBA mentors and the YEAH staff that so many of these youth, who often come from severely under-served schools, continue on to college. We are very pleased with the success of our students."


The success of the Young Entrepreneurs Program and its sister program Business, Economics, Technology Achievement (BETA), is due in large part to the commitment and diligence of MBA and undergraduate students who work with the YEAH participants. Both YEP and BETA are primarily aimed at building strong academic habits and encouraging students to continue on to college by providing a clear link between entrepreneurial success and academic skills, achievement, and advancement.


The 84 students in the 2001 YEP class hail from over 20 schools across the Oakland, Berkeley, and West Contra Costa school districts. YEP, which was founded in 1989, teaches basic business skills to 9th and 10th graders, and is supported by more than forty Haas MBA volunteer mentors/business coaches.  YEAH is also creating an alumni network to support students through their last years of high school and the college admissions process.


The BETA program, which began as a pilot program in 2000 serving five school sites/programs, will serve ten sites/programs in 2001 - 2002 and reach over 200 students. In BETA, the undergraduates encourage middle- and high-school students to research and plan for future careers, act as role models for aspirants to higher education, and help students see the relevance of their math coursework through business projects involving sales tax, tracking stock prices, and using area/perimeter to identify possible business sites. 


Undergraduate students who would like to work (and get paid) for the BETA program should contact Tanya Fraley at 510-643-4622.  MBA students who would like to volunteer for the YEP Program should contact Ajuah Helton at 510-643-8906.  For more information on all of YEAH's programs, visit www.haas.berkeley.edu/yeah/ <http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/yeah/>.
