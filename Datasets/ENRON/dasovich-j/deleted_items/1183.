Dear Colleagues:

Enlightened Energy Solutions (EES) is working with the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group to make the upcoming August 24th Energy Conference a
productive and interactive event.  At the conference, EES will present The
Enlightened Energy Approach: Energy Reliability at the Lowest Unit Cost, an
integrated, comprehensive methodology to assess and maximize supply- and
demand-side efficiencies and leverage energy prices.

In advance of the conference, we would like to give you an opportunity to
help direct our discussions to better meet your needs. In the attached
document you can identify how critical energy reliability and price are to
your company. When you return this document, EES will work with you in
breakout session 8B (Creating an Energy Plan for Silicon Valley) to tailor a
technical, economic, and structural game plan to your company's business
requirements. All information will be kept strictly confidential.

Please open the attachment and complete the very brief questionnaire.
Please send completed document to Paul Sidorenko at psidorenko@att.net

Thank you!
