The "rate agreement" between the California PUC and DWR is a monumental decision that will affect California ratepayers and the economy for decades.
Virtually every stakeholder has complained about DWR's refusal to provide the information necessary to assess the validity of DWR's assessment of what it's "rate requirement" is.
Absent a "rate agreement" that provides for public scrutiny at the Public Utilities Commission, there will be no public scrutiny of DWR's revenue requirement and no accountability applied to DWR's actions.
The stakes are simply too high--$43 billion of contracts--to let that happen.
There is ample time for 1) California to issue the bonds AND 2) the Commission to engage in the deliberation necessary to ensure that a) DWR provides the information necessary to assess its TRUE revenue requirement, b) DWR's actions are subject to public scrutiny now and going forward.
In short, this is one time when Loretta Lynch has it it right.  Give her a helping hand.
