Internet Daily 
for Thursday, December 27, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com


Worst of dot-bombing is over

The rate at which Internet-related companies are shutting down 
or declaring bankruptcy is slowing, and the worst is over, 
according to Tim Miller, founder of Webmergers.com.

During 2001, he said, 537 Net companies collapsed, more than 
twice the number that met that fate in 2000. "Shutdowns followed 
on the heels of the stock-market downturn as venture investors, 
watching their exit opportunities dissolve, abruptly shut their 
doors on cash-hungry startups," Miller said. He said that the 
slowdown is not due to the fact there are so few dot-coms left. 
Webmergers.com estimates between 7,000 and 10,000 Internet 
companies received some sort of funding. "At most, then, 10% 
have shut down," he said. "It may be safer to say that the 
Darwinian process has left many fewer weak Internet companies."

FCC clears Internet for flight

Boeing said it has received approval to offer broadband Internet 
and video service aboard airliners. The service, Connexion by 
Boeing, will make available high-speed Internet and intranet 
access, television and email over the United States. "This 
license signals a new era for in-flight [entertainment]," said 
Scott Carson, president of Connexion. "Air travelers will have 
access comparable to the speeds and quality of service they 
expect on the ground." Boeing said the service is available now 
aboard some executive aircraft and that Lufthansa may install a 
prototype on one plane within a year.

'Harry Potter,' 'Shrek' fuel Amazon.com sales

Amazon.com reported that it processed orders for 37.9 million

million items were ordered through its international Web sites

"Harry Potter" books and related products were sold, while 
150,000 copies of the "Shrek" video and DVD were sold. Amazon 
said 99% of orders were shipped on time to meet holiday 
deadlines.
