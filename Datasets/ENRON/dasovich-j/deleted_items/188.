Hi Jeff,

We're trying to get final numbers for the Mendocino trip in September. The
current plan is an all day ride on Sat.(Sept 22) and a four-hour ride on
Sunday (Sept 23).  Madeleine, Lu (from GGPS) and Jeff Walker are confirmed,
as are myself and my husband.  Pat S. is probably going; Nora M. is
tentative and Madeleine has lined up another woman from Golden Gate Park who
may also go.

SHould be a good group, so let us know if you can make it.

Amy
