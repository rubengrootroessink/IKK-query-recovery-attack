Below is the call in number for the conference call at 2:00 PDT (4 CDT) to discuss the QF restructuring proposal.  I am also attaching the latest draft of the SCE presentation.  Angela Cadena should have also forwarded to each of you a detailed summary of the buy out model and key asset summaries.  Let me know if you didn't receive it.

Thanks,
Mike
