Dear Members of the Haas Community,

This is a reminder that you are all invited to hear me deliver my final 
State of the School Address on Wednesday, November 28th. The address will 
be given at 12:45 p.m. and again at 7:45 p.m., both in the Arthur Andersen 
Auditorium. This is a good opportunity to talk about some of the key 
achievements and milestones over the past year, and also to look ahead as 
the school moves into a period of leadership transition. Your questions and 
comments will be welcomed after the address.

I hope to see you on Wednesday.

Sincerely,

Laura
