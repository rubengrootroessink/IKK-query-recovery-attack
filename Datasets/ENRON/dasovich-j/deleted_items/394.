FYI.  I was supposed to have a call with Elizabeth today in advance of our submitting the budget to Rick.  Don't know what happened--but since I missed my scheduled call with yesterday, I can't complain.  

Take a look.  Let me know if there are any changes.  

Sue:   THANKS for pulling this together for us!!

Tried each of your numbers and pager this morning.  No luck.  

Here's the budget for the Western States.     
Re:  headcount.   	Current headcount:  6  (3 San Francisco; 3 Portland)
			Proposed headcount: 8  (3 San Francisco; 5 Portland--1 offer already extended)

We are still working on a proposed RCR budget.
