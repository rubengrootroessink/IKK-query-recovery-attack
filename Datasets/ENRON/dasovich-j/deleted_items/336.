           Internet Daily for Tuesday, August 7, 2001

Peapod expands on East Coast

Peapod Inc. said it is expanding its delivery area to include 
more areas of the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland in 
the wake of the shutdown of HomeRuns.com. Peapod reportedly has 
seen its orders increase 30% since the rival firm went out of 
business. "Now, without a competitor there, it may be 
cost-effective to expand," Peapod Senior Vice President Mike 
Brennan told the Washington Post. The firm relies on partner 
Giant Food Inc. for in-store advertising. Giant is owned by 
international food chain Royal Ahold.

HUD, VA foreclosures go to EBay

EBay Inc. said it acquired HomesDirect.com, a Web site offering 
foreclosures at an auction online. The real estate site 
currently auctions all Housing and Urban Development foreclosure 
properties and a majority of Veterans Administration properties, 
the companies said. Indicating real estate will be an important 
growth strategy for eBay, COO Brian Swette said, "(This) is an 
exciting demonstration of our commitment to providing eBay users 
with the best possible marketplace for the buying and selling of 
homes, land, vacation properties and commercial real estate." 
Financial terms of the agreement were not released.

Yahoo goes back to school online

Yahoo unveiled a new area on its Web site offering teachers a 
way to create "virtual classrooms" online. Instructors can post 
class rosters, calendars and details of courses, and communicate 
with students through private classroom message boards and 
e-mail. Yahoo also announced new agreements with three providers 
of educational reference materials, Bartleby.com, 
Britannica.com, and Houghton Mifflin Co.

Comedy site licenses Universal catalog

Vivendi's Universal Music Group and Laugh.com Inc. signed a 
non-exclusive licensing agreement to provide "substantially all" 
of UMG's sound recordings for Webcasting through a 
soon-to-be-released subscription monthly service. Featured 
performers will include Richard Pryor, Dennis Leary, the Jerky 
Boys and Redd Foxx. A message on the Laugh.com site offers few 
details. "We're not really sure of the particulars ourselves, 
but we are so excited by the idea we had to share it with you. 
Whatever it is," the note says.
