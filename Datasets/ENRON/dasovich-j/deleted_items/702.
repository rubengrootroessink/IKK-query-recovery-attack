4th Place:  AXE $101

This does not include the food donations, but there is so little that it would not make a difference. The barrels are looking extremely empty!  Please don't subject me to the embarrasment of giving empty barrels back to the Alameda Food Bank...  
There is one week left.  The competition ends this Friday, Nov. 2nd!  Everyone at Haas is encouraged to participate - including faculty and staff.

Key Stats:
Last year Haas finished 10th out of 18 by collecting 545 lbs of food and $3,507... that's only about 1 lb of food and $7 per student  (Oski and Blue each collected around $1,000).  We can at least do that this year.  The winning school (Michigan) on a per student basis collected about 25 lbs of food and $14 per student last year.

Cohort Coordinators:
BLUE - Meagan Schauffer, Julie Clugage
AXE - Clarke Miller, Grace Lee
GOLD - Geeta Chawla
OSKI - Diane Lee, Louisa Leung

Thanks to everyone for participating and supporting Haas!
Steve
