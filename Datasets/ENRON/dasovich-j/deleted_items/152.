Sue and Jeff:

Jim has asked me to more closely track CA legislation.  Together with Scott, we have put together the attached matrix of important legislation.  

If you all agree, I can be responsible for keeping this information as current (tracking via the Internet and also adding information sent by you both and by Scott) and will circulate it on Tuesday and Thursday mornings (in advance of our CA calls on those days).    

Notes:
*Ideally, I think we should prioritize the legislation or at least have the "hot" bills highlighted.  Any thoughts?
*I will keep updated copies of these bills in binders in the CA meeting room.

Please send me your feedback and suggestions as to how to make this the most useful and efficient.  I would like to circulate it by Thursday morning.

Thanks, 

Jennifer
