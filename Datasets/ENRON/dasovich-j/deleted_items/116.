Excellent.  Enron needs to pay for dinner in addition to the contribution and that would have to be done directly by one of you.  Houston folks are of course invited too.  I will need to get a head count by Thursday if possible.

My understanding is that we'll all try to attend.

Subject: Black Caucus


The African American caucus would like to have dinner with us in

Sacramento

on September 6 from 7:00 to 8:30. The total number of caucus attendees

will

be dictated by how many of us can make it.  They will do the

coordination.

Any takers?
