SEARCH COMMITTEE FOR NEW DEAN ANNOUNCED; DEAN TYSON TO STEP DOWN IN DECEMBER 2001 

Vice Provost Jan de Vries has announced the members of the search committee for the new dean at the Haas School. A memorandum was distributed to the Haas community via e-mail on Friday afternoon. 


The memorandum included an incorrect date for Dean Tyson's departure from Haas. She will resign her position as dean at the end of December 2001 as she had planned. Ben Hermalin, associate dean for academic affairs, will be interim dean from January 1, 2002 until a new dean is in place. 


The committee responsible for conducting a search and making recommendations for the next dean of the Haas School has been named. The members are:


Barbara Horst Broque, assistant dean for planning, Haas School of Business 
Barry Eichengreen, professor , Department of Economics 
Hans Grande, MBA 02, MBA student and president of the Haas School MBA Association 
Robert D. Haas, BA 64, chairman, Levi Strauss & Co. 
Herma Hill Kay, professor, Boalt Hall School of Law 
David J. Vogel, the George Quist Professor of Business Ethics, Haas School 
James A. Wilcox, the Kruttschnitt Family Professor of Financial Institutions, Haas School 
Janet L. Yellen, the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration, Haas School


Professor Mark Lemley of the Boalt Hall School of Law will serve as chair of the committee. Another alumni member of the search committee is likely to be announced soon, according to officials. 


The committee will consult with the school community for both suggestions and views on candidates.  De Vries, who is vice provost for academic affairs and faculty welfare, formed the committee after consultation with various campus constituencies.

HAAS SCHOOL EVACUATION: PREPARING FOR NEXT TIME 

The Haas School was evacuated and the school was closed for classes and business last Wednesday afternoon after receiving a report of an unknown substance on several items of mail in an office in the faculty building. Both UC Police and a hazardous materials team were called in to conduct field tests and secure the scene. Officials reported that the substance was not hazardous. The event gave school officials a chance to witness the Haas emergency plan in action. 


"Overall the emergency plan was very effective, but there are some issues to be addressed," said Jay Stowsky, associate dean for school affairs and initiatives. "We need to make sure that all of the faculty, staff, and students know what to do in case of an emergency."


The Haas School administration has an official emergency plan. All faculty and staff are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the procedures outlined in building emergency plan. The full emergency plan can be downloaded at <http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/haas/emrginf2.html>. Haas Facilities Manager Edward Madera is working on a one-page emergency preparedness fact sheet for faculty, staff, and students to have on hand for reference. 


In the meantime, it is important to remember a few simple rules for evacuating the building: 

+ Stay calm, do not rush, and do not panic. 
+ Safely stop your work. 
+ Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so. (Take prescription medications, your home and car keys, and your wallet with you if at all possible; it may be hours before you are allowed back in the building.) 
+  If safe, close your office door and window, but do not lock them. 
+  Use the nearest safe stairs and proceed to the nearest exit. Do not use the elevator. 
+  Proceed to the designated Emergency Assembly Area (EAA): 
              +From the faculty building, evacuate to Gayley Plaza located directly in front of the Haas School. 
              +From the student services building, evacuate to the Boalt Hall parking lot. 
              +From Cheit Hall, evacuate west of Cheit Hall between Minor Hall (the optometry building) and the Women's Faculty Club. 
+  Wait for any instructions from emergency responders. 
+  Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by the emergency responders. 
+  If you are told to leave the area and later on want information on the status of the Haas School, visit the Haas web page at <http://haas.berkeley.edu/>.



For the latest instructions campus-wide emergency preparedness visit the UC Berkeley Office of Emergency Preparedness site at <http://public-safety.berkeley.edu/oepweb/>. This site also has information on mail handling procedures.

HAAS STUDENT TUTOR AT SKYLINE HIGH SCHOOL 

Lending a hand to high school students, even in a small way, can make a world of difference. The Haas School's outreach program Young Entrepreneurs at Haas (YEP) has done just this for years, and now the MBA students are adding to this outreach by tutoring at Skyline High School in Oakland. 


Every Monday (the class-free day of the week), Haas MBA students travel to Skyline High School to tutor students in math, English, and career planning as part of the MBA Education Club. The tutoring takes place during the Skyline lunch hours.  


The tutoring program started last year after J.P. Tennant, MBA 01 and former emergency relief teacher at Skyline, organized a small group of students to give some of their time to help Oakland students with academics.  This year the MBA Education Club has continued the tutoring program at Skyline and needs more volunteers. 


"If we get more support from Haas students we will expand the program to Berkeley High this year," said Doug Buzbee, MBA 02, the tutoring program coordinator. "Without greater involvement from students though, we may have difficulty sustaining the current program at Skyline, let alone expanding into Berkeley."


Skyline High School students, teachers, and administrators alike appreciate the tutoring provided by Haas MBA students.  Jim Delbridge, a 10th grade math teacher, provides his classroom during lunch hours so that students can get help from Haas volunteers.  The level of help needed is basic - reading, algebra, analytical geometry, and some calculus - but Skyline students benefit and genuinely appreciate the help.  


"Tutoring at Skyline is obviously rewarding unto itself," says MBA student Jon Metzler. "But as a Haas student, it's also a way to keep connected with the local community, which I think lends perspective to what we do at Haas."


If students are interested in becoming a Haas tutor, please contact Doug Buzbee at buzbee@haas.berkeley.edu.


In addition to the Education Club's tutoring initiative at Skyline, eight Young Entrepreneur Program mentors meet twice a month here at Haas with fifteen Skyline students. These Skyline students are part of the 84 students involved in the Haas-based Young Entrepreneurs Program this year. The 2001 YEP class members hail from over 20 schools across the Oakland, Berkeley, and West Contra Costa school districts. YEP, which was founded in 1989, teaches basic business skills to 9th and 10th graders and is supported by more than forty Haas MBA volunteer mentors/business coaches.

GANESH IYER NAMED 2002-2003 SCHWABACHER FELLOW 

Ganesh Iyer, assistant professor in the marketing group, was selected as the Schwabacher Fellow for 2002-03. The fellowship is the highest honor that the Haas School bestows upon assistant professors. In addition to the honor, the fellowship offers a small cash prize, a research budget, and a reduction in teaching load. During his fellowship year, Iyer will continue his research in the areas of customer information markets, consumer identification and targeting, and Internet institutions and their market impact. 
  
"Ganesh was chosen by the Haas faculty executive committee because of the excellence of his research, the strength of his teaching, and his overall contributions to the school," said Ben Hermalin, associate dean for academic affairs. In addition, his paper, "Markets for Product Modification Information," won the John D.C. Little Award for the best paper published in marketing science in 2000.


The Schwabacher Fellowship has traditionally been awarded to an assistant professor or pair of assistant professors to acknowledge their accomplishments in teaching and research. A committee made up of the academic group chairs and the assistant professors' representatives chooses the recipients.

DAN SULLIVAN AND PAT RIEGG RECOGNIZED WITH CHANCELLOR'S OUTSTANDING STAFF AWARD 

Two staff members who play important roles in the lives of Haas School MBA and undergraduate business students received one of the highest honors presented to staff, the Chancellor's Outstanding Staff Award. Dan Sullivan, director of student services in the MBA program, and Pat Riegg, career counselor for undergraduate business students in the Cal Career Center, were honored at a ceremony with the chancellor and vice chancellors on October 16, 2001.


"Dan truly cares about students and it shows in every thing that he does," said Dave Downes, director of the MBA program.  "He will spend hours helping a student with a difficult problem, even though it means he will need to stay in the office long after 5:00 p.m. in order to get his own work finished.  He inspires his staff to do the same and he is an excellent coach and mentor for them."


Riegg, who works out of the central campus career center, is the primary point of contact for Haas undergraduates in need of career services.  "As a result of her 'can do' attitude, over the years, she earned the admiration and respect of students and employers," said Tom Devlin, director of the UC Berkeley Career Center. "Essentially, she is the heart and soul of career services for the undergraduates at the Haas School. Pat is a strong advocate and practitioner of good customer service and it shows in the high esteem her customers -- students and employers -- have of her."


Each year the Chancellor's Outstanding Staff Award (COSA) is given to staff members who have made exceptional contributions toward the university's mission of excellence in teaching, research, and public service. Nominations are accepted from staff, faculty, and students.
