PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.
