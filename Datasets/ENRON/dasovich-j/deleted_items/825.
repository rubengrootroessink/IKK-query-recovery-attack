It's time for the Halloween Ball this Saturday!  If you are thinking of participating one full-time social activity this semester, this is it!!  Last year,  the Halloween Ball was a big success, I anticipate this year will be a blast as well.  So, go get your new costume and get ready to mingle with the full-time students this Saturday.  Please see below for details.  Make your check out to "C4C" and drop it off in Jennifer Sang's mailbox in the student lounge.
