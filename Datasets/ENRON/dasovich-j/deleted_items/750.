Honoring the Sacrifice


By Michael Toms

=20

"We must guard against the military industrial complex"

                                                --Dwight D. Eisenhower

                                                   1960 Farewell Address

=20

This morning I pulled up ABC News on-line, that's Australian Broadcasting, =
not American Broadcasting, and the lead story was titled, "Afghans Tell of =
Attack Horror."  The story was based on the reporting of approximately twen=
ty foreign journalists who arrived in Afghanistan for the first time since =
the American-led air strikes began on Oct. 7th.  These journalists saw civi=
lian casualties and talked with civilians whose villages had been bombed wi=
th estimates of the death toll ranging from 180 to 230 in one village.  One=
 Afghan farmer was quoted as saying, "I lost my four daughters, my son and =
my wife in this attack."  Of course, the Taliban want to appeal to internat=
ional public opinion by allowing previously forbidden foreign journalists i=
nto Afghanistan.  However, this does not diminish the fact that American bo=
mbing is killing innocent civilians. =20

On September 11, 2001 nearly 6000 human beings sacrificed their lives.  The=
se individuals were from more than eighty countries.  This tragedy is not j=
ust an American event; it is a world event.  Sacrifice is a noble word.  It=
 means to "make sacred."  The deaths of more innocent civilians do not hono=
r the sacrifice that these people have made.  Do not misunderstand me, I su=
pport justice being meted out to the criminals who perpetrated this horrifi=
c event.  The bombing of Afghanistan is not justice.  It is vengeance roote=
d in anger.  As Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us before, v=
iolence begets violence; it is never the answer.  When Timothy McVeigh was =
found guilty in an American court of law of blowing up the Oklahoma City Fe=
deral Office Building, he was eventually executed for his crime.  We didn't=
 execute his family, or his friends, or his community.  That was justice wi=
thin the American system.  This "war on terrorism" is not justice.  Despite=
 our government's attempts to propagandize this war with the assistance of =
the major mass media, we are killing innocent civilians.  How are they diff=
erent from the innocents killed in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon?=
  At the same time more than six million Afghan civilians are starving and =
the situation is being exacerbated, because they can't get UN relief becaus=
e of the bombing. =20

I am an American patriot.  I love this country.  I love this planet.  As su=
ch, I have a responsibility as a citizen living in a democracy to speak out=
 and question the decisions that are being made on my behalf by this govern=
ment using my tax dollars.  The American Revolution arose from dissent and =
the desire to escape the tyranny of King George and the British Empire at t=
hat time.  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill =
of Rights, are all about the sovereign voice of the people in a democracy. =
 The Constitution begins with,  "We the People of the United States . . ." =
 The people are the sovereign voice in America.  The government works for u=
s, not the other way around.  We have a right to question and challenge the=
 decisions of our government leaders.  Indeed it is our responsibility to d=
o so.  With freedom comes responsibility.  I encourage you to speak out and=
 express your voice, however you can; in community, meet with your friends,=
 neighbors, colleagues, write letters to elected officials, call them on th=
e telephone, contact the media and tell them to report the full story of wh=
at is happening in Afghanistan.  These are perilous times.  The tragic even=
ts of 9/11/01 have given us an opportunity to recover our bearings, to revi=
sit the founding principles of this nation, which were inspired by the Nati=
ve peoples of this land.  The Iroquois Confederacy and its democratic princ=
iples inspired Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and others. =
 This is a time to recover those principles and create a world that works f=
or all.  As President Lincoln so eloquently expressed at the dedication of =
the Gettysburg national cemetery, ". . . That we here highly resolve that t=
hese dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall ha=
ve a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people=
, for the people, shall not perish from this earth."=20
