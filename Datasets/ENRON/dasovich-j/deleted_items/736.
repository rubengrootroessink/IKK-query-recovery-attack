VENTURE 
MARKET 
SUMMARY 

	Proficient Networks emerged from stealth mode led by a team of executives looking to regain the winning touch. Proficient's four founders worked together at Digital Island and then moved to Telegis Networks, which got hit hard by the collapsing Web-hosting market and went out of business earlier this year. At Proficient, the team has built a network management appliance that enables companies to route network traffic based on their access policies. The company secured $6 million in Series A funding from Canaan Partners and El Dorado Ventures in May and is looking to raise $10 million to $20 million in Series B next year. 

Three mergers also topped the news as Netegrity bought DataChannel in a $54 million deal. Online newspaper classifieds firms, PowerAdz and AdOne, also linked up as did Intelliseek and PlanetFeedback.com. 

As the week grinds to a close, 12 companies reported raising $48 million. Proving that beauty to investors is skin deep, Switch Biotech, a developer of medications for dermatological conditions, scratched out EUR 18 million ($16 million) in its third round. And VentureWire has learned that Kyma Technologies, which develops nitride substrates for use in optoelectronics, communications, and microelectronics industries, raised $2.6 million in its Series A, led by a consortium of past individual investors. - By John Fuller <mailto:fuller@technologicp.com>

How to Get Ready Today to Get Bought Tomorrow

Mergers and acquisitions will pick up again, perhaps
before IPOs do, and few know more about preparing for
such an exit strategy than Matt L'Heureux,
Steve Smith, and Les Vadasz. Currently advising HP on
its $21 billion takeover of Compaq, Matt heads Goldman's
worldwide technology M&A. Steve built Broadview's
Silicon Valley business. Les, head of Intel Capital,
runs one of the world's most extensive corporate
development and acquisition programs. You'd be hard-
pressed to find professionals better qualified to tell
you how to find the right corporate partner and make
the relationship work. For straight talk from the voices
of authority, register today.

Unlocking the Promise of Good Science:
The Investor's Perspective

Good science doesn't always equate with good investment
opportunity. Generations of investors have been burned
and rewarded for taking risks on the potential of early-
stage therapies.  The drug discovery process is a complex
combination of tests and hurdles for young companies.
Where are the signposts for investors?  James Reddoch of
Banc of America Securities will moderate a special
roundtable dedicated to drug research and discovery at
this year's Healthcare Outlook Conference.  The experience
of the panelists reflects the complex considerations of
modern research and development.  Mr. Reddoch is joined by
Michael Grey of Structural Genomix, Daniel Janney of Alta
Partners, Gary Zweiger of Agilent Technologies and Lowell
Harmison, Former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health,
Department of Health and Human Services.
