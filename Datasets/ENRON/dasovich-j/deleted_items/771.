$12 billion came from IEP, the rest from your slides -- Are your numbers defendable

Nice presentation.  Look out Horowitz!!  My suggestions are attached.  Two other things:

1) If you're not fully prepared to defend the numbers on the "blunders" slide, I'd reconsider using it. There may be press there, and they may press you on them.
2) In place of the Jefferson quote ("freedom fighter" may be viewed as somewhat over the top--though I'm in complete agreement--), you might try the J.S. Mills quote "When in doubt, always trust markets."

Finally, in these sensitive times, the term "hostage" may not be viewed as 100% sensitive.

Best,
Jeff
