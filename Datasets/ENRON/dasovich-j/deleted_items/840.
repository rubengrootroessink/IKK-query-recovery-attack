Hi Jeff, 
Among other things, Community Relations is here to help the business units drive their business!  Please forward any related materials to my attention, either via email or to the Enron building (1400 Smith St, eb1632b, Houston, TX  77002). A list of support categories would be helpful!

Thanks, 
Misha

Hi Hilda: 
I got an "out of office" reply from Elyse that mentions that you're the contact in her absense.  Please see the note below.

Best, 
Jeff

Hi Elyse: 
I work in government affairs in San Francisco.  Dave Parquet (VP, Western Origination) has been approached by a California state legislator to participate in a golf tournament, the proceeds of which will go to a children's charity (Dave, correct me if I got it wrong).  The legislator is someone who has been and will likely continue to be supportive of Dave's on-going commercial activities and Dave would like to participate.  I've been informed that this could fall under the sorts of activities that community affairs has resources for.  Is that right?  Thanks for the help.

Best, 
Jeff
