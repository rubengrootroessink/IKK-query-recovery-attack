The information was released yesterday.  The total revenue requirement is down reflecting lower power costs. Presumably, current rates (including the $40/MWh increase since 1/1/01) are now sufficient to cover power costs and some amount for past undercollections. 

Not sure what it assumes regarding agreement-in-principal contracts (i.e., whether they are in or out).
