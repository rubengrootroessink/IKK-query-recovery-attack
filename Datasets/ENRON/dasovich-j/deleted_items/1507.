Results:
1st Place - Prentice (Congratulations; first time in first place this
season)
2nd Place - Sheas (In the money, three out of the last four weeks)
3rd Place - Mickey (The only player to pick Cincinnati--but 13 points?)
4th Place - WAM (Cleveland Rules)

We had the second-lowest weekly total, 1521 points.   And even though you
would think that when you get to the next-to-last game of the season
everyone should have gotten better at picking winners,  it only goes to show
that the old cliche holds true--on any given day any team can beat any other
team in the NFL.  I think this was an exciting week with lots of close
games--ending on practically the last play of  the game-- and upsets.  What
will your strategy be, this last weekend of games?

1st and 2nd will be hard to unseat - but 3rd and 4th are open for lots of
players.

Big move by the Sheas, from 10th to 6th place for the season.

PLEASE MARK YOUR CALENDAR: The Chili Bowl will be January 27 - more details
to follow.




Remember that the 3rd part of our pool is the separate pool for the
playoffs - AND YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY A PART OF IT - NO MORE MONEY NEEDS TO
BE SENT IN.  Below are the rules for that pool.   Please call with any
questions.

PLAYOFF POOL

Everyone is automatically entered in the Playoff Pool - there is NO EXTRA
FEE REQUIRED.  However, it is a separate contest from the Weekly Pool.  The
rules will be similar to the Weekly Pool, but the whole playoff series will
be treated as one week.  You will decide how many points to give each
potential game winner, and since there are eleven games you have from 1-11
points available for the entire playoffs - but you cannot use the same
number more than once.  Each week you turn in your picks for the teams
playing that particular week.  That means you have only one number left for
the Super Bowl.  Please note in the schedule of Payouts below that there is
a payout of $50.00 for last place.  This could make it interesting for
someone who hasn't done too well and helps to keep them in the Pool.
However, if you do not turn in picks for a week, you will be disqualified
from competing further in the PLAYOFF POOL.


Playoff Pool--1st Place			$130.00
Playoff Pool--2nd Place			$ 90.00
Playoff Pool--3rd Place			$ 70.00
Playoff Pool--Last Place			$ 50.00	$ 340.00
