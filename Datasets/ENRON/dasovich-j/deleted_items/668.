State discloses spot power  buys

By Andrew  LaMar
TIMES STAFF WRITER  


SACRAMENTO -- They range from small power  sales of $922,000 by the East Bay Municipal Utility District to more than $1  billion of power sold by Atlanta-based Mirant power company.  

All told, California paid $7.7  billion in spot purchases of electricity from 69 agencies across the United  States during the first five months of 2001, according to a report delivered to  lawmakers Monday.  

The data also shows that the state paid a hefty average of $263 per  megawatt-hour for the power. But what's most striking is the long list of  agencies, both private and public, that sold power to California.  

Agencies like the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, $331 million;  the California Independent System Operator, $3.9 million; Public Service Company  of New Mexico, $126 million; and PG&E Energy Trading Company, $24 million.  

Receiving the most money was Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold $1.2 billion of  electricity to the state January through May. The second-largest seller was  Powerex, a subsidiary of Canada's BC Hydro, which earned $1 billion.  

The total cost per day ranged from as little as $20 million to more than $100  million on three separate days in May, when hot weather and tight supplies  boosted spot market prices.  

In addition, the report reveals that the state's energy consultants  significantly underestimated the amount of energy the state would need to buy in  April and May. Navigant Consulting, Inc., forecast the state would have to buy  12.1 million megawatt-hours for the two months but the state ended up purchasing  15.1 million megawatt-hours.
