Hi Jeff -- The West gas desk (Janie Tholt and Mike Grisby) have asked to receive more information about what is going on in the California gas side (for example, updates on the intrastate infrastructure issues, etc.).  Do you mind sending them some periodic updates and ccing our gas group (Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell, Melinda Pharms, Jim Steffes, and me)?  Thanks!  Christi
