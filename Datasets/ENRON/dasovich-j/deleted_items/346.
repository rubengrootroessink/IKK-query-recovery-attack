Also, Sue mentioned you were going to email the proposal so that we could
sent it out to the group in advance and make copies if necessary for
tomorrow's meeting.  Will you be sending us a document?

Greetings Tracy:

It's becoming increasing clear that the PUC is more than likely--unless
persuaded otherwise--to suspend DA under AB1X now that the Legislature
has failed to pass a comprehensive bill.

We have a proposal on how the CPUC can keep Direct Access in place while
satisfying the concerns of the Treasurer, etc.  We'd like to:

1) present it to the group tomorrow.
2) try to get the group's support for the proposal.
3) if we get support, submit the proposal to the PUC (as a group) by
Friday.

Can we get 15-30 minutes on tomorrow's agenda to discuss?  Thanks very
much.

Best,
Jeff
