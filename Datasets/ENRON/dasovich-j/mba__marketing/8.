Hi Jeff:

Thanks for the invite to join your group. I have tomorrow off and will read
the case. I will be in my office on Saturday morning and will fax my notes
to your office. I apologize that I can't make it to Enron, but if you don't
mind shooting me a fax of your notes on the case, I'd be happy to see what
aspects you focused on, so that my paper isn't so myopic.
My fax number is (707) 963 - 4526.
Tel (800) 942 -0809 ext. 22
So, what's your fax number? I'll send you a fax on Saturday AM. L
