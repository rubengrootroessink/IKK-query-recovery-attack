Attached is the budget and my "blurbs" and Sue's

CA Maintenance/Retainers: 
Legal only includes 3 months worth of retainers, after which time we will 
reconvene with the law firms and assess the fees. A $3,000/MO retainer is for 
Arden and Hadder for the review and limited protest on Advice Letters. A 
$3,500 fee is for Goodin, MacBride et al. to provided general legal advice 
regarding the CPUC and California law and to provide legal counsel to the 
legislative government affairs team as well as routine bill analyses.

Proposed Case Budget:
"RCR remaining" includes the estimated RCR amounts that will be remaining at 
the end of 1999. Expenses are deducted from the original approved RCRs 
starting from the approval month of the RCR.
"RCR request" is the difference we need to meet our 2000 budget.
