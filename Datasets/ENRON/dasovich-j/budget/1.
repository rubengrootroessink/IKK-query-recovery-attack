Attached is our budget for Y2K and the explanatory memorandum.  Call me 
tomorrow morning with any comments, etc.  




NOTE:

Bruno:  please make sure that everyone in the San Francisco office gets a 
hard copy or e-copy of the attachments to this e-mail and this e-mail.

Marcie:  please make sure that Tom receives an e-copy of hard copy of this 
e-mail and attachments.

Tom:  I estimated Carl's costs for two months at the beginning of 2000.  I 
assumed $2,000/day and 20 days.

Sandi:  (1) I have not proposed an increase in our political donations budget 
over the $200,000 in 1999.  I proportionately reduced our suggested donations 
in the budget memo to reflect the $25,000 reduction from that proposed in 
your write up.  (2) I have not proposed any separate funding for Mike Day in 
January.  My review of his retainer proposal includes bill analysis.  We 
should use the retainer for that purpose.  (3)  I've maintained the 
Governmental Advocates, Inc. numbers at $10,000/month, but would like to see 
if they can drop their request to $9,000/month by tomorrow's call (3:00 
pacific time).  (4)  I've increased Bev Hansen to $6,000/month.

Sue and Jeff:  The blurbs did not make complete sense on the distribution 
competition OII.  Check my text.  Sue, please be prepared to bail me out if I 
flubbed the description.
