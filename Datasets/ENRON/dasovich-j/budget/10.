Folks--
 Attached are my objectives and the budget that I submitted to Rick.  Also 
included is Richard Tabors estimate of how much he thought would be spent in 
each of the regions based on work he has done for us the last two years.  The 
regional costs were not included in my origional submission to Rick.  Call if 
you have questions.
