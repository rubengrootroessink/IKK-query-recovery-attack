=09=09 Subject: EBS Update



EBS has realized many significant accomplishments in this first half of 200=
0.=20
We continue to make excellent progress in building out the EIN, as well as=
=20
delivering on our two primary commercial opportunities, Bandwidth=20
Intermediation and Broadband Content Services.  In addition, EBS continues =
to=20
represent a significant portion of Enron=01,s overall market value.  We are=
 very=20
excited about maintaining and growing our momentum.  We want to take this=
=20
opportunity to share with you an update on our progress to date and to=20
discuss EBS=01, plans for the remainder of this year.=20

Development of the Enron Intelligent Network

To date we have 14,601 route miles of fiber owned and contracted in the U.S=
. =20
Of this fiber, 4,051 miles are currently lit and operational and we expect =
to=20
have 9,095 miles lit by the end of this year.  In addition, we have deploye=
d=20
54 PoP=01,s and installed two pooling points within our U.S. network.

EBS also completed the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications, a leading=
=20
provider of on-demand switched bandwidth services.  The newly named Enron=
=20
Broadband Switching Systems (EBSS) division provides us with significantly=
=20
enhanced =01&intelligence=018 for the network, greatly enhancing our bandwi=
dth=20
trading and broadband content delivery capabilities.  EBSS software will be=
=20
incorporated into the EBS fiber optic platform to increase the speed and=20
efficiency of our own network as well as switching capability between=20
networks.

Content Services

The EBS Content Services business consists of our content delivery services=
=20
and distribution network.  During the first half of 2000 we signed landmark=
=20
long-term agreements with several key content providers including Blockbust=
er=20
Inc., which will be publicly announced shortly, to provide video on demand=
=20
(VOD) services for Blockbuster=01,s large full-length movie base, and Bridg=
e=20
Information Systems to deliver financial content and real time business new=
s=20
to enterprises. =20

We have also established an effort focused on delivering broadband solution=
s=20
to the rapidly evolving Applications Service Providers (ASP) sector.  Our=
=20
agreement with i2, a leader in supply chain management software, allows us =
to=20
sell network services as well as jointly pursue service offerings to the=20
rapidly growing online exchange community.

We also extended the EIN reach to approximately 20 million desktops through=
=20
new broadband distribution agreements with Bell South, US West, and SW Bell=
=20
to support the distribution of rich media content.  Additionally, we have=
=20
reached an agreement with Bell Nexxia to expand the EIN into Canada, which=
=20
provides the basis for future distribution deals.=20
=20
Bandwidth Intermediation  =20

Our intermediation business includes the development of highly structured=
=20
bandwidth solutions for our customers as well as the EBS effort to develop=
=20
and trade bandwidth directly with the market.  Both efforts have been=20
extremely successful this year.   =20

In addition, we began offering bandwidth trades on EnronOnline in April.  T=
o=20
date, we have completed 25 total trades, with several trades being executed=
=20
through EnronOnline. We have recently surpassed our 2000 goal of 5,000 DS-3=
=20
months, to be settled by year-end, in just the first six months of the year=
.=20
Additionally, we have signed long-term, wholesale origination deals for the=
=20
network with Frontier, Datacom, Orconet and Neon.

Remaining Year 2000 Goals and Objectives

While we have had an outstanding first half of the year, we must focus on=
=20
accomplishing some formidable financial and non-financial goals in the=20
remaining six months. To achieve our 2000 goals, we feel we must accomplish=
=20
the following:

1.  Complete the fiber build of the network, specifically Houston to New=20
Orleans.
2.  Increase the number of operational pooling points domestically to 13, a=
nd=20
bring online our London pooling point.=20
3.  Ensure the highest QoS and reliability to our content and Broadband=20
Distribution Partners (BDP) customers through a stable and robust streaming=
=20
platform.
4.  Develop an integrated and consistent service offering to our Enterprise=
=20
and ASP customer base.
5.  Establish sufficient liquidity and transparency in our traded bandwidth=
=20
and storage products to manage risk throughout the organization and enable=
=20
risk    =20
     management to be profitable on a stand-alone basis.
6.  Ensure that we have the resources, accountability and focus on the=20
service delivery side of the organization to enable us to be successful in=
=20
executing on our=20
     strategy. =20

It is with these goals in mind that we make following modifications to the=
=20
organization.  An organization chart for both EBS global and EBS Europe is=
=20
attached which details all departmental reporting relationships.  Some of t=
he=20
more significant changes are discussed below:

Commercial Coverage

We remain convinced that we must focus our efforts on customers rather than=
=20
products in order to be successful in capitalizing on opportunities in the=
=20
rapidly evolving broadband marketplace.  Further, while our service offerin=
gs=20
can still be broadly defined as intermediation and/or content services, our=
=20
marketing approach toward enterprise customers must differ substantially fr=
om=20
that of our media and entertainment content customers. =20

We also are more likely to offer bundled solutions combining both streaming=
=20
and/or bandwidth products to the enterprise segment, while our streaming=20
platform is forefront in the minds of our media and content customers.  In=
=20
addition, there is significant potential for integrated transactions among=
=20
the Enterprise, Technology Partners, and ASP/ISV customer segments.  To=20
capture the tremendous opportunities these customer bases provide, we have=
=20
segmented our customer coverage functions into three groups:=20

Content and Distribution Services will be led by David Cox and will focus i=
ts=20
efforts intensely on aggregating high bandwidth content and ensuring high=
=20
quality delivery through its Broadband Distribution Partner (BDP) customer=
=20
base.  Stewart Seeligson will join David Cox to provide day-to-day manageme=
nt=20
of our efforts in this area.  David will continue to focus on large=20
commercial opportunities and provide commercial direction over the deployme=
nt=20
of our streaming platform.  Stewart will focus on driving the commercial=20
activities of the group.  April Hodgson and Steve Luginbill will report to=
=20
Stewart.  In addition, due to the scale of efforts required to make the=20
Blockbuster agreement a success, we have formed a Video on Demand (VOD) tea=
m=20
consisting of cross-functional expertise.  This team is led by Frank Bay, w=
ho=20
also reports to David Cox. =20

Enterprise/ASP will be led jointly by Jim Crowder and Rex Shelby, and will=
=20
focus on providing bundled solutions to this rapidly evolving business=20
marketplace.  In addition, this group will continue to be responsible for o=
ur=20
key strategic relationships.   =20

The Wholesale Group, led by Ted Seitz, will continue to focus its coverage=
=20
efforts on the traditional telecom sectors of carriers, ISP=01,s, CLEC=01,s=
, RBOC=01,
s, global carriers and transcontinental capacity providers located in the=
=20
U.S. and Canada.

EBS Europe

Unlike many of Enron=01,s traditional businesses, the communications busine=
ss is=20
truly global in nature.  Therefore, it is essential that we extend ourselve=
s=20
internationally in areas where we can leverage our existing network and ski=
ll=20
sets.  We feel that the European region now presents significant=20
opportunities to EBS, and we are pleased to announce that Steve Elliott,=20
former head of Network Development, will be moving to London as President o=
f=20
EBS Europe to head up this effort.  Joining Steve in London will be Kevin=
=20
Kohnstamm as VP of Network and Business Implementation. =20

Steve=01,s former responsibilities will be shared by: Ted Seitz, who will=
=20
oversee the development of the network domestically from a commercial=20
perspective, as well as manage our Canadian initiatives; Jon Thomsen who wi=
ll=20
consolidate our Latin American activities in Mexico and South America.  We=
=20
will also be consolidating all of our Asian activities into one group, whos=
e=20
leadership we will announce shortly.  In addition, we are pleased to announ=
ce=20
that Raj Thapar has now joined us from Enron India.  Raj will manage all of=
=20
EBS=01, activities in India, where he will work closely with the Enron Indi=
a=20
team headed by Sanjay Bhatnagar.  Raj will report to Steve Elliott.

David Leatherwood and the Network Construction group will now report to Joh=
n=20
Griebling in John=01,s capacity as head of Network Engineering and Operatio=
ns.

Product Engineering

The rapidly evolving nature of the broadband streaming services business,=
=20
coupled with the robust capabilities of the EIN, provide EBS with almost=20
unlimited potential streaming application opportunities.  At the same time,=
=20
we must deliver on the capabilities of established products.  To balance th=
e=20
need for execution with the need to develop new products, we have segmented=
=20
the former Product Development group into two efforts: =20

Diane Hetzel will lead the newly named Product Engineering group, which is=
=20
charged with application development and deployment on our network of all=
=20
current EBS product offerings.  Diane will report to the Office of the=20
Chairman.  Also, Global Information Systems, managed by Laura Beneville, wi=
ll=20
now report to Diane.

John Bloomer will head the New Products and Technology group, which will=20
identify emerging product and technology opportunities with the goal of=20
eventual commercialization and integration into our product offering.  John=
=20
will report to Scott Yeager=01,s Strategic Development group.

Risk Management Systems

In order to succeed in developing a broad-based product offering that can=
=20
scale effectively, EBS must put in place an integrated state-of-the-art=20
transaction-processing platform.  This requires effective coordination of a=
ll=20
risk system development activities. =20

John Echols joins EBS as head of the new Risk Systems Development and Servi=
ce=20
Delivery group.  John brings a wealth of experience in transaction systems=
=20
development from Enron North America and Enron Energy Services.  To ensure=
=20
that we are developing appropriate risk reporting and customer service=20
capabilities to this effort, Barry Pearce and Penny Crane, who head these=
=20
respective functions, will report to John.  In addition, David Reece will=
=20
join John as Project Manager for all risk management systems=01, software=
=20
development.

Broadband Operating System (BOS)

The successful implementation of an Application Programming Interface (API)=
=20
for broadband applications remains a key component of EBS=01,s overall=20
strategy.  The ability of applications to have access to bandwidth capacity=
=20
on-demand is integral to the success of our network and the broadband=20
marketplace in general.  Larry Ciscon will continue in his role as Chief=20
Architect for the Broadband Operating System (BOS).  Everett Plante will=20
assume the role of Program Manager for BOS to provide the necessary linkage=
s=20
to the network architecture efforts of the EIN.

Structuring

A core competency of Enron has been its ability to identify, segment,=20
appropriately price and manage risks rigorously in emerging commodity=20
markets, while continuing to be flexible enough to rank by Fortune as the=
=20
most innovative company in America.  Across the company, an effective=20
structuring group with the proper representation of financial, technical an=
d=20
other assorted disciplines has been a key part of this success.  Towards th=
is=20
end, we have established the Structuring and Transaction Development group=
=20
under Brad Richter and Steve Barth. =20

We also have merged the Sales Engineering group, led by Merat Bagha into th=
e=20
structuring group to ensure the proper technical input for all potential=20
transactions.  It is essential that we support this group in its efforts by=
=20
allowing structuring to review all transactions emanating from the customer=
=20
coverage groups to ensure proper pricing, accountability, and documentation=
=20
of all related risks.  The efforts of this group are critical in establishi=
ng=20
the framework to allow our business to scale exponentially to meet the=20
accelerating demands of the broadband marketplace.

Trading and Risk Management

Jim Fallon, formerly Managing Director of Power Trading and Risk Management=
=20
for Enron North America, has joined EBS as head of Global Risk Management. =
=20
Jim and his team is charged with replicating the successful trading platfor=
m=20
he built in North America into a bandwidth trading platform for EBS.  Paul=
=20
Racicot, VP of Bandwidth Trading, will head the North America trading desk,=
=20
and Marcello Romano, Director of Bandwidth Trading, will head this function=
=20
in Europe, while reporting jointly to both Jim and Steve Elliott. .  As=20
previously announced, VP John Scoblick will head real estate risk, and IRU=
=20
Management, led by Andy Unverzagt, will also report to Jim.

Warpspeed Acquisition=20

We highlighted above the significance of the Warpspeed acquisition.  Terry=
=20
Stavropoulos, VP, Mike Golden, EBSS-CTO, and Andy Rundquist, architect, lea=
d=20
Enron Broadband Switching Systems, formerly Warpspeed.  We welcome the EBSS=
=20
team of 55 employees to the EBS team. =20

Staff Functions

Kelly Kimberly, formerly Senior VP of Marketing, Communication and PR for=
=20
Enron=01,s international companies, now leads that function for EBS as well=
 as=20
overseeing the Market Interface and Intelligence group, headed by VP Tony=
=20
Mends.  It is critical that our external message be consistent to ensure we=
=20
are communicating EBS=01, strategy effectively.  Toward this end, the marke=
ting=20
representatives, formerly in the verticals, will now report directly to Kel=
ly.

As was recently announced, Marla Barnard is now leading the HR function for=
=20
EBS.  We recognize that intellectual capital is our most important resource=
. =20
Marla will focus on keeping EBS competitive by developing strategies to=20
ensure that EBS is able to attract, develop and retain the best talent in t=
he=20
industry.

We are in a rapidly changing and dynamic industry. While our strategy and=

overall objectives will remain unchanged, we must continue to be flexible o=

respond to the changing needs of our customers and to new opportunities in=
=20
the marketplace.  This requires timely modifications to our organization.  =
