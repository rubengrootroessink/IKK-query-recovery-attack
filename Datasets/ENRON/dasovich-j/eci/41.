Tracy,

I'm doing just swell thank you.  I'm attaching the most recent list that I 
have..........of course, this is always to be viewed as a living document 
since things change so quickly in terms of personnel here.  Don't know that 
they need every single name on the attached list, so feel free to cut and 
paste as needed.  thks,

Hey KC

What's up?  How are you today?  Kris, can u help me out with this bio 
question -- do we have them in a database?  Or do you have the readily 
available version?  If so, would you mind terribly forwarding to me and/or 
Jeff Dasovich at the address below --  I know that we have the hard copy 
available and where to get that, but I don't know where the e version is.  
 thanks KC

Tracy: 

 My apologies, but I don't seem to have the final, electronic version of the 
bios of EBS management that we included in the California filing (Scott did 
the last version to ensure accuracy--the filed version reads "As of March 1, 
2000.")  Ms Nord needs an electronic copy.  Might you have one that you could 
pass along to her (and to me)?  As always, many thanks.  

Jeff
