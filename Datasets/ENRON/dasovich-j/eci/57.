Hi Jeff
I apologize for the late reply! I have been swamped with a few things these
past two weeks and your note got lost in the shuffle. But, I finally figured
out how to retrieve messages that I flag for follow up. I will probably not
be the right person for you to connect with here at Quokka but let's meet
and I can learn more about what you are doing and we'll go from there.
Please feel free to give a call at your convenience to set something up - I
am fairly open next week if that works for you.

Take care and I apologize again for the late reply.

M.

Greetings Mark:

We met previously, but most recently at the West Point Inn.  (As a tangible
point of reference, Prentice Sellers and I go out.)   Anywho, I mentioned
our
broadband/video streaming services and think you folks would find that be
our
service offerings can add a lot of value to what Quokka's delivering to the
market.  Would very much like to get together with you and/or others who
might
be responsible for that side of the business.  Let me know if you think it
would
be useful to meet and when a good time might be.  In the meantime, you can
check
out our broadband business at enron.com.

Best,
Jeff
