Jeff:

Attached is a revised version of the proposed NDA, together with a redline
showing changes from the Enron version.  The main reasons for changes were
to (1) limit data to the Enron telecom entity, and (2) assure compliance
with ISO's  MCI agreement.

Let me know if there are any remaining issues.
