Hi Jeff,

Just a follow up to our call this morning.  If you get your guy on the phone, 
try and get the following information:

1) Route map, including both end points of the network
2) Amount of capacity they may want to lay off, (they are currently using 
some of the system, how much do they want to offer?)
3) Any contract details, (how long, terms, penalties, restrictive clauses 
like "cannot resell")

Once we get some details on the table lets get a call together with them and 
see if there is a deal here.  I will be out of the office from the 3rd 
through the 9th attending a trade show, so if we cannot get this together by 
tomorrow, lets do it next Thursday afternoon.

Thanks
