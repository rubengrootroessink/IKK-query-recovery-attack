Here is the NDA.  You need to select the Read Only option in order to open 
and print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an 
original executed NDA.  After the other party executes it, you will need to 
get an EBS attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on 
our behalf.  Please make sure I get an executed original back.  Thanks
