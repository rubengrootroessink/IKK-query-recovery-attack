Sue, this is an issue that is becoming more important as ECI becomes more
involved in local provisioning services.=20


=01;I also believe that the DSL provider
that brought the complaint is a company that we may begin partnering on som=

delivery with. =01;Essentially this ruling is very good and will speed=20

DSL deployment. =01;I don't think you will see ECI teaming with anyone to p=

DSL in Minnesota just yet, but we will be doing just that in LA, San Jose, =
New
York, Chicago, and DC very soon.

Our response: =01;this is good, keep it up PUC, and Enron supports expandin=

should expend any resources at this time.

I hope that helps.

Scott--give me some guidance on how important or relevent this issue is for
us so that I can get a better understanding of what I should/should not
being spending time on.

The Minnesota PUC ruled yesterday the US West must open/share it's lines
with competitors offering digital subscriber line (DSL) high speed interent
access. =01;Apparently the order is the first for a state, but I understand
that the FCC passed a similiar rule in the last month or so. =01;The
Commission also ruled that USWest could charge an additional $6.00 for this
access to their lines (in addition to the current rate of $18 that the
customer pays) and that the DSL provider had the right to pass that charge
on to the customer. =01;The COmmission took a "soft" position on the $6.00,
saying that they would review the amount of the charge over the next six
months before making a final ruling on that specific issue. =01;I believe t=
hat
this ruling came about due to an initial complaint by =01;a provider from
Colorado.

I did not follow this case at all other than occassionally reading
something about it. The major reason I did not was that I saw it as a
"retail" access issue and I see our video streaming and bandwidth
businesses as "wholesale" access/opportunity issues. =01;Certainly we alway=
s
want to see open access and we want to see competitive parity, but I didn't
see that our involvment and/or tracking of this proceeding was of great
value. =01;Am I correct?
