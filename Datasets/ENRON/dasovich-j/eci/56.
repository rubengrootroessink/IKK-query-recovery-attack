Hi Jennifer:

This is regarding the conference call we had last week with Jeff 
Dasovich/Donna Clayson/Todd Henne and Scott Bolton.  I wanted to know if we 
can get those AFTS projected numbers for the CA income statement.  Donna 
Clayson needs them to put down on the income statement she is working on.  
Can you give me an idea of when they will be ready (or just let Donna know) 

Thanks!
