Jeff --

thanks for the call today.  I agree with your perspective on CLEC status / 
implications for EBS.

What we need to think about doing (as we discussed on the phone) is to come 
up with a regulatory risk assessment of becoming a CLEC in CA --

id key risks
assess value at risk (quantitative and qualitative)
develop mitigation plans (incld working to end the need to be a CLEC), and 
assign people to manage the plans.

Happy to help as much as possible.  We should try and have this and then 
discuss with broader EBS WG.

Thanks.

JDS

you mean you've looked through the contract and still couldn't find them?  

p.s. "jeffrina" is a very "21st century" name for little baby girls.  just 
read about it in vogue magazine.
