Jeff, I am attaching electronic copies of two documents you requested
yesterday -- a list of the documents required for a CPCN filing and the
verification needed for the application (as I mentioned, the
verification does not have to be notarized).  I have also faxed an
example of a bank letter of credit (we redacted the client name) and a
copy of the order instituting a rulemaking on CEQA that we discussed.
Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks.  Anita.
