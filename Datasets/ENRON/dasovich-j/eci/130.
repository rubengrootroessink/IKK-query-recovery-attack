SUNDANCE ONLINE FILM FESTIVAL
Enron Broadband Services will be sponsoring the first ever Sundance Online 
Film Festival (SOFF), an exciting new addition to the popular Sundance Film 
Festival in Park City Utah, January 18-28, 2001. The online festival will 
feature dynamic works such as animation, documentary and interactive pieces 
specifically designed for the Web. The Sundance Institute, a nonprofit 
organization, is recognized for promoting innovative, independent film 
projects and is promoting the Web as the next exciting new venue for 
presenting these creative ideas.  To read more about Enron's participation in 
the Sundance Online Film Festival, click here.




UPDATES ON PRC & BONUS
The Enron Year-End Performance Review Committees (PRC) concluded on January 
9.  Employees should expect review meetings with supervisors in the coming 
weeks.  If necessary, employees can take the initiative to schedule the 
review with their manager.  Verbal notification of bonuses and compensation 
increases should begin on January 26, and bonus checks will be distributed on 
February 5.



EBS EMPLOYEE JOINS BUSH ADMINISTRATION
Quincy Hicks, manager in EBS Public Relations, has recently left the 45th 
floor of the Enron Building for the East Wing of the White House.  Quincy has 
been named the future First Lady's director of scheduling.  Prior to joining 
EBS, Quincy had worked as chief of staff for First Lady Barbara Bush 
following her White House years.  First Lady Elect Laura Bush is reportedly 
filling her White House staff with veterans from her mother-in-law's 
administration.

HOLIDAY HELPERS 
EBS once again displayed its giving spirit.  During the month of December, 
Kevin Hannon led a group of EBS volunteers to SEARCH, an organization that 
responds to the needs of the homeless by providing them with job training, 
housing, education, and medical support.  EBS volunteers wrapped and 
presented holiday gifts to SEARCH clients.  The gifts, donated by EBS, 
included jackets and other cold weather clothing.  

To celebrate the season in Portland, the EBS office housed the Giving Tree.  
The tree was decorated with tags bearing children's holiday wishes.  EBS 
employees were able to select a tag and fulfill a child's wish.  The tree was 
picked clean, and more than 125 gifts were sent to children at the Morrison 
Center, a family services organization that focuses on breaking the cycle of 
abuse.  

EBS employees make a difference in their communities everyday in different 
ways, including volunteering and donations to their favorite charities.  
Enron has made it even easier for our employees to make a difference through 
the Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Programs (VIP).  Click here to

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES





Surgient Networks Secures $57 Million in Second-Round Funding
Cisco Systems and Enron Broadband Services top the list of investors 

Surgient Networks, an innovative company with a new architecture for content 
delivery network applications, has received $57 million in second-round 
funding as it moves ahead with its product development and planned deployment 
in mid-2001.




Trade Route
As bandwidth prices plummet, some telecom players are betting on electronic 
trading platforms to bring efficiency to the market.

For Kevin Hannon, chief operating officer of Enron Broadband Services, 
falling bandwidth prices are welcome news.  With bandwidth becoming a 
perishable commodity and prices in a free fall, the only hope for telecom 
carriers is a trading platform where bandwidth can be bought and sold for 
future delivery.  That way, they can hedge against price fluctuations and 
quickly unload surplus bandwidth.  Enron is building such a platform.





The Longest Last Mile

...Processing power of PCs and set-top boxes in homes is increasing.  And 
companies like Enron Broadband Services, Akamai Technologies, and Inktomi are 
installing servers and routers all over the country to minimize the length of 
fiber a movie must travel to get to the living room -- the so-called last 
mile...




HOLIDAY TIME
  Enron offices will be closed January 15th in observation of Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Day.
