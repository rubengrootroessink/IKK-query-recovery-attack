Thanks, Sue...I'll run this by our lawyers (the ones who dealt with the application for rehearing and prepared D.01-10-036) on Monday, but it may take a while for them to think this thru...

Steve, 

As you can see, I'm not making much progress.  We're trying to reach 
Fielder now.

Hi Sue, 

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be 
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that 
DA 
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is 
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the 
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 
deadline.

Matt, 

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this. 
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned 
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of 
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote: 

Section F, p. 19: 

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether 
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access 
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to 
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20 
contract." 

p.20: 

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states 
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process 
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or 
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities 
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are 
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service." 

p.21 

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it 
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent 
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they 
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before 
September 20, 2001." 

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language 
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on 
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is 
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or 
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which 
you will not accept those DASRs. 

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position? 

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting 
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs 
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list 
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and 
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure 
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do 
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060. 
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann, 

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no 
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D 
01-10-036. 
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified 
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails 
supplied 
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is 
in 
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date. 
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on 
rehearing 
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as 
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01. 

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for 
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise. 

Thanks.

Diann, 

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the 
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a 
certified 
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on 
10/5/01 
@ 3:58pm (attached below) as your certified list.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001 

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision 
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct 
access 
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC 
order 
states: 

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or 
verification 
of any new arrangements for direct access 
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or 
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering 
             Paragraph No. 4). 

             and, 

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access 
service 
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed 
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001." 
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7). 

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern 
California 
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have 
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20, 
2001, 
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject 
to 
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce 
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following 
information must be included for each customer on this list for your 
DASR 
to be eligible for future processing: 

Please include the following information for each customer on this list: 

     ?    Customer Name 
     ?    Service Account Number 
     ?    Service Address 
     ?    Contract Date 

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at 
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than 
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001 

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or 
verified 
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit 
the 
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30 
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect" 
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list, 
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs 
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept 
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering 
options) for existing Direct Access customers. 

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.
