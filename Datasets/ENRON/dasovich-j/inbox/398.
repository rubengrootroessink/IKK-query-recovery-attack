Jeff:

Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our con=
sideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.  I just wanted=
 to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t=
hings further with Norm.  After drilling down even further, it just seemed =
like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based =
upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n=
ature of Norm's historical client base.  It also would not have been fair t=
o Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=
 had planned to pursue at the Firm.  I can't tell you how much I appreciate=
 your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit=
uation.  I really felt bad bothering you with this, but I knew you would ha=
ve the best insights into the likely direction of the regulatory proceeding=
s in CA and I wanted to make sure that I was being fair in evaluating Norm'=
s situation and in a position to make a decision based on all of the releva=
nt facts.  I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use =
those words together!) that I do not want you to think or feel that you "ni=
xed" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=
  In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s=
ense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b=
een pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start=
er since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid=
e from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.  It is on=
e thing to receive a waiver to represent another company in a negotiated co=
mmercial transaction in which Enron is relying on another law firm, but I c=
ould not see us pressing a regulatory agenda directly adverse to Enron's in=
terests in a proceeding in which Enron was a major participant and which we=
 knew going into the proceedings at the start that our representation would=
 be adverse to Enron.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be=
en adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=
 "eye to eye" with Enron on all of the issues.  These generally have been s=
ituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh=
ere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i=
ncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro=
ceedings.  Nonetheless, I am trying to do whatever I can to try to eliminat=
e or reduce the number of those situations on a going forward basis, althou=
gh I know I will not be able to eliminate all of them in light of the size =
of our Firm and the diverse nature of its client base.

Jeff, I will follow up with you personally, but I just wanted to drop you a=
 quick note to thank you for the time and thought you devoted to this.   I'=
m sure we will be speaking soon on some CA regulatory matter or the other.

John
