Hi Jeff,

Of course I agree with this. That it's not a time for politics, whether partisan or otherwise. But eventually we have to address issues beyond grieving, helping, and bringing the lunatics to justice. Why is this happening? I do not agree with what Clinton said this morning in Australia, which was " because we are a great nation, that makes us a target."

I've left it up to Timmi to tell me where I'm going tonight. Cameron said she wanted to be at Napa. I'll go anywhere the four of you are gathered. I look forward to being with you all again.

Rory

  And I think partisan politics is about the very last thing that the families of the victims are thinking about at this time. 

  Best,
  Jeff

  We'll see you tonite for the bluegrass filming?
