We need to get CRA or CMTA to sign on -- because they were in the earlier Preferred Policy decision plus they filed for rehearing in this case as well. This can be circulated.  I'll send it to the Metals people.

Sue,
 
Attached is a draft of the Petition which can be circulated.
 
I recommend that an Alliance member join the Alliance as a Petitioner to eliminate any issue about standing.  I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
 
The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
 
I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.
 
I look forward to your comments.  EWD
