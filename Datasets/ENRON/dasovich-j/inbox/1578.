For those of you interested in Entrepreneurship or Biotech/Healthcare,
they're doing some cool stuff at UCSF. 

There's an e-mail list, plus several speaker/networking events. Sam
Collela of Versant Vertures spoke at their first event two weeks ago.
Our very own Peter Fiske will speak at an event on Dec 5th.

The organizers specifically asked that Evening MBA students were invited
to participate (our fame precedes us). Great opportunity to meet up with
clinicians/scientists with new ideas who need help with commercialization.

See below for details.

Hello ,

We have an exciting new program here at UCSF called the UCSF Innovation Accelerator
(UCSF-IA), whose mission is to engage and educate the UCSF community in
entrepreneurial ventures.  This year UCSF-IA is hosting a number of
activities including:
an Entrepreneur's Discussion Group, three workshops: Opportunity
Recognition in Life
Sciences, Writing a Winning Executive Summary, and Intellectual Property
in Life
Sciences (two will be mixers with the Biotech Club of Berkeley's Haas
School of
Business), and an Executive Summary Competition with an Awards Ceremony.

These activities aim to provide a forum for UCSF
students/postdocs/clinicians/scientists to
learn about the biotech business and writing business plans, to
encourage interest in
entrepreneurship, and to network with Bay Area scientists and business
professionals and MBAs.

We encourage you to sign-up on our listserv: ucsf-ia to receive
up-to-date information and
e-mail announcements about these and related activities hosted
throughout the year by
UCSF-IA.
