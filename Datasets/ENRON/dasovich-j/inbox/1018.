The attached list details the California De-DASR status (by customer) as of this afternoon.  This list was prepared using the prior guidance of "...all customers pre-June/August with the exception of PacTel, IBM and UC/CSU".

Please note that there are two tabs to the spreadsheet.  fyi -- You need to scroll to the bottom of the EESO List to see those customers that are not "qued".

We are prepared to launch the De-DASR's but want to confirm via this message that everyone agrees with each individual customer status.

Please give me a call if you need additional information -- or have any edits or changes.

Thanks,

Evan
