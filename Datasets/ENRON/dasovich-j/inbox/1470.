Sue is right, of course.  But....

Her argument turns in part on her assumption that going into the deal back in 1996, the utilities were agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices.  Like most parties back then, they never contemplated a world where energy prices would exceed their capped average rate of $65 (+/-).  In other words, they assumed they would recoup most, if not all, of their stranded costs.  They may have even assumed (certainly they seem to be arguing for it now) that they DESERVED to recoup their stranded costs, and that AB 1890 was designed to guarantee it.

I do not know all of the details of the history, but y'all have spoken of a ruling (PUC? Court?) to address the specific issue of negative CTC, zero minimum bill, etc.  Obviously, this ruling was in our favor, which lends a lot of credibility to Sue's argument.  But the fact that the original dereg plan was so vague as to require a ruling on this issue ex post opens the door to a counterargument by the utilities, namely that at the time of AB 1890's passage, they were not explicitly agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices -- they were instead forced to do so by later interpretations of the law.  If they had known then....

Please note that I do remember what side I am on. :)  I am not saying that this counterargument is correct.  Indeed, the negative CTC ruling is de facto evidence that they are wrong, even if they didn't know it going into the deal.  I only present all of this b/c I think it is the only halfway sensible argument they can make in the face of Sue's impeccable logic, and I think we ought to at least have given it some thought in case they try to bring it up.
