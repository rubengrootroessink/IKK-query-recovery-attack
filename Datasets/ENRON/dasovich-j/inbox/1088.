Jeff at this point, we are NOT selling the power contracts in California, and I would like to eliminate the concept of saying we are sleeving it. We, as you know, are simply looking to maintain our ESP status and find a wholesale supplier of power, who will provide us with "full" or as close to Full Requirements" power as possible and replace the role that had been peformed by EPMI. With regard to the Gas portfolio, we are in discussions with Oxy about buying the SoCal, SDGE and PGE non-core clients. Don't know if we will get there, but we are goingto try. In the mean time we are doing everything we can to continue to perform under our gas contracts, and have been able to buy and deliver gas. Please call me to discuss any regulatory issues on the potential sale of the gas contracts.
 
Thanks,
Jeremy

On yesterday's call we discussed the pros and cons of assignment versus keeping the customers.  My understanding is that, on the gas side, things are moving along with Oxy on an assignment of our CA gas customers.  Just wanted to make sure that everyone's aware of which route is being taken for the respective books.
 
Best,
Jeff
