We have received a few inquires about Halloween Costumes at 101 California.
Traditionally, there are very few people who dress up while working in this
building.  While costumes will not be banned, we are certainly not
encouraging our tenants to wear them.  We are asking that you share a few
common sense guidelines with your staff.

   Face masks are strongly discouraged, but employees will be granted
   access if they are willing to remove the mask when entering the
   building.  We also ask for masks not to be worn in public corridors,
   especially on multi-tenant floors.
   As always, visitors will be required to present photo ID - Costumes may
   need to be removed to some degree so that our security staff can verify
   the photo.
   Weapon-like props are prohibited.
   Bulky costumes are strongly discouraged.  If worn, search of these
   costumes is at the discretion of our security personnel.
   Trick or Treating by outside groups is prohibited.
   Please avoid the use of cosmetics or props that can be mistaken for a
   dangerous item.
   Use good judgement.  If there is the slightest possiblity that someone
   could mistake your costume or any props as a security risk, please don't
   bring it.

Thank you in advance for sharing this information with your staff.   Please
feel free to call if you have any questions.

Jeanette
