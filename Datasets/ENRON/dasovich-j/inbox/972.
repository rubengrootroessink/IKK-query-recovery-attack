Comrades:

Who wants to get together for a weekend in June at
some resort for one last hurrah before we all fade
into the sunset of each other's lives?  Chaminade, Sea
Ranch--something like that.

Let me know. If there's sufficient interest, we'll get
Cathy Langridge to be the Prep Committee.  (Just
kidding, Cathy.  Could someone please hand her a
tissue?) 

Just think:  another chance to get into serious
trouble as a group.
