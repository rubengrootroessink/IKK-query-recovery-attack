You may have heard, it may be a surprise
We're making a move, and we're hoping it's wise...

It was hard to decide to go or to stay
But MyFamily.com has lured us away.

It is a pretty cool gig as far as dot-com's go
The only catch is that it's based in Provo

No, not Provo Spain, as some might guess
The Provo in Utah where they drink much less

The land of mountains and rivers and BYU
And of course the Olympics of 2002!

So please come and see us whenever you can
We'll have plenty of bedrooms and a whole lot of land!

We'll snowboard and ski, we'll hike and we'll bike
See you in Utah!
TJ, Theo, Lisa and Mike.
