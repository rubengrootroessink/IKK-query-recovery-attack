Dan: 
EPUC will be filing a response on Friday, supporting the  CMTA/CLECA/CIU and AReM/WPTF applications for rehearing. Christine Jun from  our office will be heading this effort. Could you please email to her a final  of your application, which we apparently have not yet received?  Thank  you.  
Evie
