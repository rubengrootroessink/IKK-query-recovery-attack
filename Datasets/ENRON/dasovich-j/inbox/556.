Subject: FERC ALJ Initial Decision on El Paso affiliate abuse




The ALJ issued his initial decision on the CPUC complaint case today.  As was widely expected, he found that El Paso and its merchant affiliate, El Paso Merchant, were guilty of affiliate abuse.  However, he did not find clear evidence that they were exercising market power.

The ID is attached.
