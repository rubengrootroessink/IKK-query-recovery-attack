Energy Committee Members and Respected Colleagues:
Joe Desmond, President of Infotility and SVMG Energy Committee Co-chair,

on accordingly.  If you have any questions about this survey, please contact
Joe by e-mail (address below).  Thank you.
**************************************************


Dateline 2001:  California experiences a power gridlock of unprecedented
proportions, complete with Stage Alerts and rolling outages.  Production
lines fall silent.  Inventory remains unmoved.  Elevators take people
hostage.  Then businesses are told that summer will be even worse.  Not even
close.  Summer arrives, temperatures moderate, and the state can?t possibly
sell back all the power that?s suddenly at its fingertips...

If current events in energy are making your head spin, you are not alone.

As a business energy user, we'd like to know your opinions by getting your
answers to this survey.

Thank you in advance for your survey participation and feedback.
