FYI


> I just saw SoCalGas' AL 3065 filed on September 25.  It's a 15-year
> storage contract with William's for 4000 MDth of inventory, 100 MDth of
> w/d and 50 MDth of injection - it's by far the largest and longest term
> storage contract I've seen them sign - and they are keeping the terms
> confidential- also unusual for a LT storage contract.  Figured you might
> be interested.
