Subject:=09Teams for Upcoming FERC Proceedings


As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and =
papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to ad=
dress over the next few months.  These issues are extremely important to En=
ron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these iss=
ues for many years.  There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it=
 is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond. =20

In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to=
 respond to these FERC initiatives.  The Washington advocacy group will als=
o work closely with all of these teams.  If someone is interested in a part=
icular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call th=
e Project Lead to have your name added to the team.  All assistance is welc=
ome.  As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for resp=
onding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams nee=
d to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.

On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC i=
nitiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.  A "Project Lea=
d" has been named for each initiative.  The Project Lead will be responsibl=
e for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in t=
he proceeding.  The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the nex=
t couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.  Th=
e team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues sho=
uld be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and pr=
oducing draft comments.  Once draft comments are prepared, the comments wil=
l be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial =
people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues=
. =20

There is a column of "Inside Counsel" and "Outside Services."  In some area=
s, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.  =
Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to=
 draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).  Please=
 remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR proce=
ss must still be followed.  If applicable, Project Leads should submit the =
necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lea=
d named for each proceeding:

RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will =
be the Project Leads in this proceeding.  The RTO meetings will be held in =
Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron =
make a presentation on one of the panels.  Comments will be submitted to FE=
RC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.  This team will also b=
e responsible for these comments.

Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.  Comments a=
re due in approximately 45 days.  Several issues are raised in this proceed=
ing, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's =
marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.  This is=
 a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commissio=
n to adopt this bold proposal.

ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.  Chairman Wood has=
 indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requireme=
nts, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the=
 market.  Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we p=
lan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.  We will submit exp=
ert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be th=
e Project Lead.  Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the Calif=
ornia ISO.  Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended t=
o cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proc=
eeding and have input into the audit process where possible.  Furthermore, =
a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the curr=
ent price cap mitigation measures.  The Commission implemented these caps i=
n an effort to limit price spikes in California.  California's summer peaki=
ng season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will b=
e starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could disc=
ourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be =
needed this winter.  This team will be responsible for both of these procee=
dings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is =
the Project Lead.  FERC staff is studying two significant transmission cons=
traints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  =
-- and plans to have the study completed later this year.  The Commission p=
lans to forward the study to DOE.  The Commission stated that this is a hig=
h priority for it.  In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated tha=
t it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to id=
entify energy infrastructure issues.  The team will also oversee the progre=
ss in these proceedings.
Revised Public Utility Filing Requirements:  Susan Lindberg is the Project =
Lead.  The Commission has issued a NOPR proposing to require market partici=
pants to provide more information than is currently required, including at =
least seven additional data points per transaction.  This will have a signi=
ficant administrative burden on Enron and could require the disclosure of c=
ommercially sensitive information.  Comments are due on October 5.
California Refund Proceeding:  Ray Alvarez is the Project Lead.  The Commis=
sion has ordered power sellers to pay refunds for sales made to the Califor=
nia ISO from October 2, 2000 through June 20, 2001, and has established a h=
earing proceeding to resolve issues of material fact. =20
Pacific Northwest Refund Proceeding:  Bob Frank is the Project Lead.  The J=
udge in this proceeding issued an initial decision recently finding that re=
funds are not warranted in the Pacific Northwest.  Briefs will be filed in =
response to the decision, and the Commission will review the Judge's order.=
 =20
Midwest/Alliance RTO Proceeding:  Mike Roan is the Project Lead.  Various f=
ilings are pending before the Commission regarding establishment of two RTO=
s in the Midwest - the Alliance RTO and the Midwest RTO.  Enron is advocati=
ng, consistent with the Commission's recent pronouncements, one single RTO =
in the Midwest.  The Commission is expected to act on these filings shortly=
.  Proceedings may be ordered.
Northeast RTO Proceeding:  Sarah Novosel is the Project Lead.  Mediation to=
 create a single Northeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pend=
ing before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before Oct=
ober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
Southeast RTO Proceeding:  Christi Nicolay is the Project Lead.  Mediation =
to create a single Southeast RTO has concluded and the Judge's report is pe=
nding before the Commission.  A Commission order is expected on or before O=
ctober 31.  Additional proceedings may be ordered.
