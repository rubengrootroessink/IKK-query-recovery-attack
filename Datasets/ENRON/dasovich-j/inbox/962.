Critz,

Per your request, the Enron credit requirements for your CTA Groups 10004
and 10039 are summarized below.  The credit requirement increases on January
1st based on a recent CPUC Decision which increased the cost of gas for
credit calculations from $1.6826/Dth to $3.50/Dth.  The CTA credit
requirements are defined in PG&E Gas Rule 23.  Acceptable Security Deposits
as defined in Rule 23 include Cash Deposit, Letter of Credit (issued from a
major financial institution acceptable to PG&E) or a Surety Bond.  PG&E's
Credit Department is reviewing Enron's credit situation, an official demand
for Enron to reestablish credit is expected to be issued from our Credit
Department later today.
