Hi Cynthia:

I'm not sure if I'm going about this correctly, but Joseph's out today,
so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I need to rent a car tomorrow Tuesday,
Oct. 30 (pick up at 7:30 AM and return it on Wed. Oct. 31 at 7:30 AM
(want to rent from the Hertz outlet on Mason Street in SF, which is
where I always rent).  Is this something that you folks generally
arrange, or do I just do it?  Is there a corporate account # I'll need
if I do it?  Really appreciate your help.

Best,
Jeff
