PROMOTION OF THE MONTH:

Your Palm(tm) Handheld Rocks!

The client meeting is in ten minutes. You can't get a cab
to save your life. Better put on your walking shoes.

You fire up your new Palm m105 handheld, adjust your
headphones and tap "Play."  Two tunes into your personal
play list, you're in the client's lobby singing the praises
of Palm's Tunes-to-Go Bundle.

This Palm Store promotion truly rocks.  Just $299 gets you
the m105 handheld and the Port?son mp3 player from Shinei,
including Liquid Player Plus software. That's $49 off the
regular price! But hurry and order, as this special bundle
disappears October 1st.  Create your own play lists,
"skins" and more.  A quick trip to the Palm Music Connection
yields your favorite tunes, many for as little as $.99.
