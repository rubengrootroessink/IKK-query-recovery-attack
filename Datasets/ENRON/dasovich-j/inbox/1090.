Feedback below on metering issues raised by the UDCs.  The list is a high
level representation of some of the issues resulting from the 6/01
re-Dasring process, some of which have since been resolved.  For
clarification, I have added notes (in blue) from a review of the issues
with Beth Apollo and Dionn Williams.

Please call me at 713.822.3753 if you need additional input.

Current metering issues provided by Dionne Williams:

Meters installed without phone lines per Enron's direction (thus unable to
read) --  focus was on getting meters installed, will quantify by 1/1/02
(est. ~200 at this time)
Posting data on account numbers that maybe different than what the UDC
displays (causing MADENs) -- has been resolved
Inability to respond to MADENs in a timely manner -- MADEN is a
notification of a problem, will quantify by 1/1/02 (est. increase from 3 to
~100) , have increased staff to address workload increase.
Meter Installations taking priority over meter maintenance (per Enron's
direction initially.  This was changed first of November, thus Mario
dedicated one of his installers for maintenance. However, he is still
unable to respond to the maintenance calls in a timely manner)

Recap of Teressa Carroll-Childer's discussion with Jeff Dasovich at noon
yesterday:

Jeff was getting response back from the UDCs re metering issues
He was going to contact Dionne Williams directly to obtain feedback in
order to respond (Dionne has not heard from him)
Jeff was going to follow up with the UDCs yesterday

Let me know if we can do anything else to assist at this time.
