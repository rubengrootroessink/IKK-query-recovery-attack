Thank you for the addresses.

The Petition currently assumes that a foreign energy service provider will =
be the Petitioner.  Because of the political rhetoric, it would help if the=
re was also a California energy service provider.

You indicated yesterday that there may also be some customers willing to ac=
t as Petitioners.  Since that would improve the posture of the case, please=
 use your best efforts to locate such a party.  In anticipation of such a d=
evelopment, we shall prepare an alternate Petition so it is available if th=
ere is a customer Petitioner.

Following yesterday's conversation, we examined the availability of going i=
nto the federal court system, rather than the California court system, foll=
owing action by the Commission.  There is access to federal courts because =
the case will involve federal constitutional rights.  But going directly to=
 federal court has its pitfalls.  First, the 11th amendment prevents naming=
 the State (and presumably its subdivisions) as defendants.  This limitatio=
n can be circumvented by naming individuals as the defendants (such as the =
Attorney General who is the chief law enforcement officer) using Ex Parte Y=
oung, 209 U.S. 123.  Second, the federal court will have wide discretion to=
 abstain (this is known as a Pullman Abstention) from hearing the case in o=
rder to allow the California courts to decide the California constitutional=
 issues.  Third, the federal courts may conclude this is really a dispute o=
ver rate making and require that state remedies be exhausted (28 USC 1342).=
  There may be other pitfalls.
=20
In our estimation, the federal courts would seek to abstain because the cas=
e involves such important California legal and policy issues that the Legis=
lature decided it was necessary to confer original and priority jurisdictio=
n in the California Supreme Court.  This presents a tactical dilemma becaus=
e of the risk of alienating the Supreme Court by first going to District Co=
urt which then decides to abstain.  Also, it could create timing problems b=
ecause relief must be sought from the Supreme Court no later than 30 days a=
fter a rehearing application is denied by the Commission.  The District Cou=
rt would probably take more than 30 days to decide whether to abstain, thus=
 opening a new argument of timeliness when the state action is initiated.
=20
This suggests the possibility of filing simultaneously in both courts.  Suc=
h a strategy should use separate claimants and separate attorneys to avoid =
the claim of forum shopping.  Even if the cases involved different claimant=
s and different attorneys, such a strategy would probably have little likel=
ihood of success because it would make it even easier for the federal court=
 to abstain since there would already be an existing state court proceeding=
.  By way of example, I was involved in a proceeding in the 9th Circuit con=
cerned with Indian gaming which was deferred because of the proceeding that=
 was in the California Supreme Court involving the constitutionality of Pro=
position 5 and then Proposition 1A.  Because the California Supreme Court u=
pheld Proposition 1A, the 9th Circuit never acted.  Since the instant case =
implicates state law and policy, the likelihood of abstention, even if two =
separate cases are brought, is very high .
=20
The foregoing analysis assumes that the Commission seeks to retroactively s=
uspend existing contracts.  We have not yet considered whether the pending =
bill, if enacted by the Legislature, would change the analysis.

We shall keep you advised.  EWD
