 Jeff - I've been down at the CCPUC networking....will be back in the office
Wednesday afternoon. I'll call you then.  Yes, as to your question on the
phone,if you hold capacity,you can continue to do so under the same terms
and conditions (without any increase escalator) for 2 years following the
end of the current accord.  If a shipper wishes to release his capacity, he
can do so without penalty.

Greetings:
Could I get an electronic copy of your request to the CPUC to extend Gas
Accord until 2005?  You think they'll approve?  When are comments due?
We want to support you.

Best,
Jeff
