The Haas Consulting Club invites all MBA students to the MBA Firm Night, 
September 20, 2001

Date/Time/Location:
The Consulting Club Firm Night will be held September 20, 2001 from 6:30-9pm 
at the Marine?s Memorial Club and Hotel in San Francisco (directions below).  
Drinks and hors-d?oeuvres will be provided.

Purpose:
This event is a great opportunity for all MBA students, both Consulting Club 
members and non-members, to network with professionals from firms in the 
consulting industry.  Students can also use this occasion to discover the 
hiring potential and outlook for firms recruiting at Haas.

The Consulting Club will also present attending firms with a resume book that 
includes the resumes of second-year Club members.  This book will be 
delivered prior to the event so that firms can review potential interview 
candidates beforehand.

Who:
All students are welcome, and attendance for Consulting Club members is 
free.  The fee for non-members is $15.  Non-members can become annual members 
for only $20, which will include admittance into the firm night, inclusion in 
the resume book, and other membership benefits.  A payment to the Haas 
Consulting Club should be delivered to Ken Coblin by Tuesday, September 11th, 
in order to be included in the resume book.

What:
Students are encouraged to bring hard copies of their resumes and business 
cards.  Business attire is appropriate.

Directions:
The Marine?s Memorial Club and Hotel is located at 609 Sutter Street, in 
downtown San Francisco.

BART ? This is the MOST recommended mode of transportation.  
Take BART toward San Francisco (after 7pm, take a Fremont-bound train from 
Berkeley to MacArthur Station and transfer to a San Francisco train).  Exit 
at Powell Street.  Walk (or catch a Cable Car) four blocks up Powell Street 
(past Union Square) to Sutter Street.  Turn left and walk 1 block.  The 
Marine?s Memorial is on the Southeast corner of Sutter and Mason Streets.

Driving ? This is the LEAST recommended option to get to the Marine?s 
Memorial.  
	Take the Bay Bridge toward San Francisco.  Take the Fremont Street 
exit (first one on the right).  Fremont Street becomes Front Street.  Remain 
on Front Street across Market.  Turn left onto Pine Street and go seven major 
blocks.  Turn left onto Powell Street for two blocks.  Turn right on Sutter 
Street.  One block later, on the left, will be the Marine?s Memorial.

Parking:
There are several parking garages in the vicinity.  Street parking is often 
scarce.  

Dental Parking Garage, 520 Mason St. 
Sutter/Stockton Garage, 330 Sutter St.
Downtown Center Garage, Mason & O?Farrell Sts.
Butterick Garage, 840 Sutter St.

Questions should be directed to Devan Cross (cross@haas.berkeley.edu) or

We look forward to seeing you at the Firm Night!!
