> Attached below is a copy of PG&E's comments, filed today, supporting
> Commissioner Bilas's recent proposed decision, which recommends approval
> of SoCalGas's long-pending Comprehensive Settlement Agreement.
> 
> Commissioner Bilas's proposed decision contains a very favorable
> assessment of Gas Accord's performance, and recommends adoption of the
> Comprehensive Settlement on the ground that it will achieve the same basic
> structure for SoCalGas.
> 
> Accordingly, PG&E in its comments has recommended that the full CPUC adopt
> the proposed decision.
> 
> The PG&E comments also point out that some issues remain to be resolved
> with respect to allocation of receipt point rights on the SoCalGas system
> at Wheeler Ridge.  Today's filing asks the CPUC to require SoCalGas to
> clarify its procedures in an advice letter, and it also reserves PG&E's
> right to contest any proposal by SoCalGas that PG&E believes to be unfair
> to Canadian/PG&E shippers.
