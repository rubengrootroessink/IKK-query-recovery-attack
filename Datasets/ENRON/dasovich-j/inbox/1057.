Just a reminder when drafting any documents that refer to EES's load:  there are over 17,000 meters associated with this load and any estimates of projected load are based upon incomplete data and a fair amount of guess work.  Tim Coffing has significantly improved this process; however, it is my understanding that we do not have, even at this time, a 100% accurate picture of historic usage, much less precise forecasts.  Therefore, I strongly suggest liberal use of the word approximate when referring to Enron's California load. 

Thanks,

Steve
