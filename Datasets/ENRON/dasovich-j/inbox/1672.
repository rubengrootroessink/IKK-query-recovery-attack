Hi Evening MBA students,

This is a reminder to all 2nd-year students that your first round of 
bidding is now through noon on Friday, November 16.

To check on availability as of last night, after the 3rd years bid, just 
click on "bidding enrollment summary", or
http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/Registrar/info/prereg/pre-regstatus.rtf
You must be logged in to see the link or view the file.

Some courses did not show up on the attachment I sent to you last night 
because no students had enrolled in them yet.  They are available (E233, 
E239, E278.1, E278.3, E296.2).

If you have any questions please give us a call at 510-642-1406.

Josh & TJ
