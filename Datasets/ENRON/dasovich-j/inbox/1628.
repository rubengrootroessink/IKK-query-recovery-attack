This was filed on 11/09/01. Enron is not a named party -- just as part of the retail alliance.  AReM sent out a press release today, which is also attached.  AReM and others, including some of Enron's customers, appealed to the Supreme Court to seek reinstatement of direct access becuase of legal errors made by the CPUC.  Commonwealth, another ESP, also filed an appeal on broader issues.  I will keep you apprised of progress.
