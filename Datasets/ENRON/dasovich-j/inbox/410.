USA: Enron opens steel products depot in Chicago.

HOUSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Monday it had opened a depot to store specific types of hot and cold rolled steel coils for "just-in-time" delivery to customers in the Chicago area, creating a spot market for steel in that city. 
The Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant said it will be able to supply customers from its depot within 48 hours, enabling it to reduce the amount of inventory they store themselves and cut the length of time they hold on to inventory.
"By creating commodities out of similar commercial-grade products, Enron provides valuable pricing benchmarks for base products, against which premiums can be set for any enhanced products and risk management services," Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets said in a statement. 
In addition to its core natural gas and electricity operations, Enron is also active in markets such as pulp and paper, metals, and telecommunications bandwidth. 
Enron began offering financial steel swaps in November 2000 and today provides a range of physical products and risk management services to buyers and sellers of steel products through its steel desk and its EnronOnline trading platform.

LONDON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Enron and EWZ, municipal utility for the Swiss city of Zurich, said on Monday they had set up a power trading joint venture which would start operating at the end of October. 
The joint venture, which has already been approved by the city council of Zurich, will be jointly managed by both companies and focus on trading in the wholesale markets in Switzerland and neighbouring countries.
"The JV combines EWZ's long-established extensive knowledge of the Swiss market and Enron's trading and risk management expertise," said Conrad Ammann, managing director of EWZ, in a statement. 
Swiss market is not open to competition but electricity companies trade with each other and with counterparts in other countries.

NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Shares of electricity and natural gas marketer and trader Enron Corp. on Monday rose 4 percent after India's largest private utility said it was in preliminary talks to buy Enron's share of the troubled Dabhol Power power plant in India. 
Enron's shares gained $1.21 to $28.44 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Tata Power, India's largest private utility, said it was in early talks to buy Enron's 65 percent share of the $2.9 billion Dabhol Power unit. 
Dabhol has faced problems ever since it was forced to shut its 740-megawatt plant on India's west coast in June after its sole customer, a local state utility, stopped buying power. It also defaulted in earlier payments.

Greece's Development Ministry Grants New Electricity Licenses
2001-10-01 11:42 (New York)


     Athens, Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Greece granted 10 licenses to
foreign companies to provide and produce electricity, as the country
deregulates its energy market.

     Cinergy Corp., an Ohio-based electricity and gas utility, Enron
Corp.'s U.K. unit, Enel SpA, Italy's largest power company, and the
Swiss Atel Group, were each awarded permits to operate electricity
transmission units totaling 1,100 megawatts, the Development Ministry
said in a statement.

     Michaniki, Aegek, Aluminium of Greece, Cinergy & Energa
Consortium, as well as the Kavala CCGT Power Plant Consortium, each
were awarded permits for electricity production plants totaling 954
megawatts.

     Greece, which opened up the market to competition in February,
has said that it will allow private companies to provide no more than
30 percent of the country's total energy production, while Public
Power Corp., the former electricity monopoly, will produce the rest.
