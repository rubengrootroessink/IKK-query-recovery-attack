Dear SVMG Member -

Last Friday at 1pm, we sent out an e-mail to you announcing a second
opportunity to participate in our Negotiating Skills Workshop, scheduled for
April 17, 2002.

By the close of business last Friday, the April 17 Workshop is also sold
out!  That is the bad news.  The GOOD NEWS is that the instructor - Joe
Crowley - and our host, Compaq (thanks Shawna Holmes!) have graciously
agreed to offer a second day - April 18 - for an additional class.

As you know, we first offered this Workshop a few weeks ago, to a sold out
group, and it was overwhelmingly popular.

Therefore, we are pleased to announce a third opportunity to participate in
the NEGOTIATING SKILLS WORKSHOP.  Once again, it is open to the first 20
RSVP's that we receive.

Details for this additional class are as follows:

DATE: April 18, 2002
TIME: 8am until 5pm
PLACE: Compaq Computer
COST: $250 covers the instruction, workbook, continental breakfast and light
lunch.

To sign up for the April 18 date, please respond to this e-mail as soon as
possible.  And thanks again for your interest.

Best wishes,

Carl
