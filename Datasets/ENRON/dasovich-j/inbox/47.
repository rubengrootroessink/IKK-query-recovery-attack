Daylight For Gray Davis=20


By David S. Broder

Wednesday, September 5, 2001; Page A19=20


SACRAMENTO -- The lights are dimmed in the office of California Gov. Gray D=
avis, but his prospects of winning reelection next year and becoming a 2004=
 Democratic presidential possibility are looking a lot brighter than they w=
ere just a few months ago.

The office air-conditioning is imperceptible, despite the outside temperatu=
re of 105 degrees, as Davis practices the energy conservation he has been p=
reaching. But overall, the summer has been mild, electric power usage is do=
wn 12 percent from last year and there hasn't been a blackout anywhere in t=
he state since May 8.

Republicans, who had set up a Web site to record the expected energy crisis=
, concede that Davis has dodged a disaster. Always cautious, the governor s=
ays, "So far, so good, but you never talk about a possible no-hitter in the=
 middle of the game."

In fact, Davis is not home free. He is pushing a financial bailout bill to =
avert bankruptcy for Southern California Edison, a bill opposed by both fre=
e-market Republicans and liberal Democrats in the legislature. Sale of bond=
s to replace the billions the state spent buying power last winter and spri=
ng has been held up by litigation from already bankrupt Pacific Gas and Ele=
ctric, leaving a potential hole in the current-year budget and ensuring tha=
t the election-year fiscal situation likely will be grim. Drought condition=
s threaten a water shortage next year.

Private polls show clear vulnerabilities for Davis. Despite a drop in publi=
c fears of an energy crisis and some increasing optimism about the overall =
direction of the state, two August surveys I was shown found fewer than one=
-third of Californians favor reelecting Davis, while two-thirds say he shou=
ld definitely be replaced or they would consider an alternative. His job ap=
proval scores are as poor as those of President Bush, who lost California i=
n a landslide last November.

The polls show a notable Davis weakness among Democrats, and one veteran lo=
bbyist here told me that the governor was "just one blackout away from draw=
ing a serious primary opponent" -- one reason that Davis last week preempti=
vely staged a show of support from the Democratic mayors of seven big citie=
s.

But the potential vulnerability may never be tested. Davis has $30 million =
in the bank and is headed for a $50 million war chest. California has not d=
enied a sitting governor a second term since 1942, reelecting two Democrats=
 and four Republicans, most recently Pete Wilson, who was in much worse sha=
pe politically in 1993 than Davis is now.

And all three potential Republican gubernatorial candidates have liabilitie=
s. Wealthy businessman William Simon Jr., son of the former Treasury secret=
ary, has impressed Republican insiders as personable and smart. But he has =
never run for office before and is unknown to the voters, who have showed s=
kepticism about first-time millionaire candidates in both parties.

Secretary of State Bill Jones, the only Republican in statewide office, has=
 been Davis's most aggressive and effective critic, zeroing in on conflicts=
 of interest in the stock holdings of several Davis energy advisers and app=
ointees. But Jones left the Bush campaign early in the battle for the 2000 =
nomination to endorse Sen. John McCain, and the White House reportedly has =
told GOP contributors not to help him. Two McCain allies, Sens. Fred Thomps=
on and Chuck Hagel, are coming out to raise money for Jones next month, but=
 his treasury is anemic.

The White House favorite is former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, who w=
on two races in that heavily Democratic city. Riordan is 71 and, as Davis p=
oints out, has never run statewide or in a partisan contest. Conservatives =
question his liberal social policy positions, and Jones notes pointedly, "R=
iordan and his wife have contributed more than $1.5 million against Republi=
can candidates, including $80,000 to Gray Davis in past races."

With its growing population of minorities, California looks even to busines=
s lobbyists more and more like a solidly Democratic state, where Republican=
 victories will be the exception. GOP leaders in the legislature and the co=
ngressional delegation appeared last week to be ready to accept redistricti=
ng plans that would save their current seats but lock them into minority st=
atus for the next decade.

Bush, who was once seen by California GOP leaders as their salvation, now s=
eems to some of them to have turned his back on the state. He has visited o=
nly once since taking office, and one GOP official told me, "The only Cabin=
et member we ever see out here is [former Californian] Ann Veneman," the se=
cretary of agriculture.

It is a complete reversal of fortune for the home base of Earl Warren, Rich=
ard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and Gray Davis is the lucky beneficiary of thi=
s historic shift.

Energy conservation efforts leave California blackouts in the dark=20
State has reported no shutdowns since May=20
By JOHN WOOLFOLK=20
Knight Ridder News Service=20
Tuesday, September 4, 2001=20
San Jose, Calif. -- This was supposed to be California 's summer of darknes=
s, but as the summer draws to a close without any blackouts, the doomsayers=
 are proving to be wrong.=20
Just a few months ago, they talked about 20 hours of rolling blackouts. Or =
250 hours. Even 1,000 hours. But the blackouts stopped in early May.=20
Mild weather and surprisingly strong consumer conservation saved the day, w=
ith help from new power plants and market controls. Consider:=20
-- State officials had hoped to lower peak power demand by 2,300 megawatts =
-- about equal to a nuclear power plant -- with a $600 million effort to pr=
omote conservation and efficiency. Consumers saved as much as 5,500 megawat=
ts.=20
-- Average temperatures were above normal in June, but not as high as last =
year, and cooler than normal in July and August. More important, there have=
n't been the severe regional heat waves that strain the power grid.=20
-- Six new power plants have gone online so far this summer, totaling more =
than 1,600 megawatts. The three largest, accounting for 1,400 megawatts, ha=
d been in the works for years. The others were rushed into production under=
 a state effort to boost peak supplies.=20
-- Tougher federal regulations enacted in May and June prohibit California =
power plant owners from withholding power from the grid in emergencies and =
appear to be curtailing "megawatt laundering" schemes.=20
Which played the greatest role may be debated for years. But even if it was=
 mostly just good weather, Gov. Gray Davis is praising Californians.=20
Davis had initially urged consumers to cut back 8%, then upped it to 10% an=
d offered 20% rebates to those who conserved 20% over last year.=20
State officials expected 10% to qualify for the rebates, but about a third =
of customers are getting them, and consumers have cut peak demand as much a=
s 14%, according to the California Energy Commission.=20
Conservation a surprise=20
"We were lucky to have the combination of bringing more power plants online=
, extraordinary weather and the heroic efforts of Californians," said Davis=
 spokesman Roger Salazar. "A tremendous amount of the credit for not having=
 the blackouts is directly a result of the efforts of Californians to conse=
rve energy."=20
Energy-efficient products flew out of stores. The Home Depot reported that =
sales of portable generators doubled, low-watt fluorescent bulbs were up 15=
0% and window films -- used to lower air conditioning demand -- were up 25%=
, said spokeswoman Kathryn Gallagher.=20
Those who spent the summer working in dim, sweaty offices, air- drying thei=
r clothes and snapping up all things energy efficient say they didn't reall=
y buy the dire blackout forecasts.=20
"I really do think they exaggerated," said Agnes Grossinger of San Jose. Bu=
t she's not ashamed of her efforts to save power by not using anything elec=
tric until the evening. It's saved her $280 in electric bills, and she plan=
s to keep doing it.=20
Those who had predicted disaster say consumer conservation surprised them.=
=20
"The big thing was that we didn't use the electricity ," said Lon House, an=
 energy consultant for the state who had forecast 1,000 hours of blackouts,=
 based on meager conservation in San Diego last summer. "The energy conserv=
ation surprised everybody. I didn't think we could do it."=20
Some say weather a factor=20
Conservation advocates agree, saying that lowered consumption played a big =
role in easing the state's power demand.=20
"We didn't get lucky with the weather," said Ralph Cavanagh, energy special=
ist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "There's no question in our=
 opinion that the overwhelming factor in explaining the reduction in statew=
ide energy use is energy efficiency."=20
But energy market experts find that hard to believe.=20
"The weather has obviously been the biggest contributor to avoiding blackou=
ts," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Ener=
gy Institute in Berkeley.=20
For the governor's critics, the summer blackout no-show has been deflating.=
 They snapped up 15,000 "Blackouts 2001, Gray Out 2002!" bumper stickers an=
d launched a Web page screaming blackouts were "unavoidable."=20
But the blackout counter remains frozen at 6, the last on May 8. Critics sa=
y the governor got lucky but concede he did well in motivating conservation=
.

Sunny California never lost power So much for predicted blackouts

LOS ANGELES - Remember all those doomsday forecasts of blackouts rolling ac=
ross California day after day, hour after hour, all summer long? They turne=
d out a lot like the warnings of the much-vaunted Y2K problem: a lot of hot=
 air, a paper tiger, a complete no-show.=20
With summer almost gone, no part of California has experienced so much as o=
ne second of power outage, as expected, from the supply shortages that have=
 plagued the state since May 8.=20
Wind damage to power lines, yes. Short circuits, occasionally. But systemat=
ic blackouts, none.=20
That's in stark contrast to the forecasts of so-called experts.=20
The California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power gr=
id, said in April that Californians could expect at least 34 days of rollin=
g blackouts in the summer months if they used as much electricity as last y=
ear.=20
The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted 260 hours of summ=
er blackouts.=20
The reasons for the debunking of those seemingly overblown predictions of d=
isaster vary from conservation to mild weather and brand new power generati=
ng capacity.=20
Several power plants also returned to service after being closed much of la=
st winter and spring for repairs or "routine maintenance."=20
Both state and consumer groups maintain that many of those closures were de=
liberate attempts to drive up the price of power.=20
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, a Democrat with gubernatorial asp=
irations, is currently investigating the possibility that a criminal conspi=
racy produced the shutdowns.=20
Whether the massive winter and spring price boosts were criminal or merely =
driven by market forces, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has indic=
ated it may approve as much as $4 billion in rebates to California for over=
charges.=20
Democratic California Gov. Gray Davis says he will sue unless the rebate am=
ount is much, much higher.=20
Meanwhile, wholesale power prices are down more than two-thirds from winter=
, averaging $67.42 per megawatt-hour over the last month, compared with a r=
ange of $200 to $400 per megawatt-hour in February and March.=20
Most analysts, however, point to the weather and consumer conservation as k=
ey factors that helped avoid blackouts altogether.=20
In June, Californians consumed 12.4 percent less electricity than one year =
earlier.=20
The reduction in use was 5.2 percent for July, as the weather in some parts=
 of the state heated up a bit and many air conditioners started to run.=20
During peak hours, when shortages are most likely, usage was down 14.1 perc=
ent in June and 10.7 percent in July.=20
Consumers trimmed between 1,000 and 3,000 megawatts of usage during the dai=
ly peak hours from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. - enough to power between 1 million and=
 3 million homes.=20
"Without the conservation, there would have been a major problem," said Gre=
g Fishman, an official of the Independent System Operator.=20
And no one here is saying the danger of blackouts is completely gone.=20
"We're not out of the woods yet," said Mr. Davis as he cut a ribbon to open=
 a "peaker" power plant near Palm Springs two weeks ago.=20
"We face our toughest test in early September when temperatures should hit =
three digits on a regular basis in many places. But this much we do know: C=
alifornians everywhere - from the workers working day and night to build ne=
w plants to the families waiting to do laundry after 7 p.m. - all of them a=
re exceeding expectations and meeting this energy challenge."=20
Mother Nature has helped considerably, especially in June and July.=20
Cooler-than-expected temperatures in Oregon and Washington state made more =
power than expected available from the dams of the federal Bonneville Power=
 Administration along the Columbia River.=20
"Overall, it seems like most of the summer has been a little on the low-tem=
perature side," said Dan Atkin, a National Weather Service meteorologist st=
ationed in San Diego.=20
But no one in government or the power industry is ready to say the crisis i=
s over.=20
"We certainly aren't ready to stand down the bombers yet," said Stephanie D=
onovan, a spokeswoman for the San Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20
But, as Mr. Atkin noted, "We didn't get $3-a-gallon gasoline, either. Now y=
ou see how difficult forecasting is."=20

Public Power Utilities' Outlook Stable: Moody's

09/04/2001=20
Capital Markets Report=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20
New York, September 04, 2001 -- The credit outlook for public power electri=
c utilities remains, and will likely continue to be, stable even as the ele=
ctric industry restructuring evolves into greater market competition and de=
spite deregulation's failure in California , Moody's says in a soon-to-be r=
eleased report.=20
"Moody's believes most public power utilities have used the past several ye=
ars well to cut costs and to better position themselves to ensure that cust=
omers are satisfied and that the utility's financial condition remains soun=
d," says analyst Dan Aschenbach, author of the Special Comment, which conta=
ins ratings and outlooks for 72 utilities whose debt totals more than $73 b=
illion.=20
Armed with the advantage of local regulation and governance, public power u=
tilities--even those in California --have derived operational strength from=
 retaining ownership of electricity generation and maintaining long-term fi=
xed contracts and strong rate flexibility.=20
Challenges the utilities face include continued market volatility, new and =
more competitive technology, increasing industry consolidation, environment=
al compliance costs (re: nitrogen oxide regulations), and risks of major pl=

ility.=20
The most important challenge involves implementing "a resource strategy tha=
t is diverse and flexible enough to meet a more competitive and volatile en=
ergy market," says Aschenbach.=20
He adds that Moody's analysis of this challenge and of utility credit stabi=
lity during industry restructuring depends, as always, on strong management=
, competitive cost structure, and financial flexibility.=20
Overall, evaluation of public power utility credit risks and challenges, sa=
ys Aschenbach, should be viewed with the context of continued implementatio=
n of the National Energy Act of 1992 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion (FERC), which aims for more open and easier transmission access and m=
ore vibrant regional energy markets.=20
Despite deregulation's problems in California and increased state intervent=
ion in that market, the nation's wholesale market is already deregulated, t=
he analyst says, and the federal focus is on improving transmission grid ef=
ficiency.=20
Meanwhile, states have varying timetables for implementing deregulation, fr=
om which most public power utilities are exempt (to the ire of investor-own=
ed utilities). Moody's predicts that, as a result of deregulation's failure=
 in California , conflicts will increase between federal deregulation polic=
ies and states taking a cautious position of protecting local customers fro=
m disruptive and costly power outages.=20
Moody's believes deregulation's negative financial effects, as exemplified =
by municipal utilities in Columbus, Ohio, and Springfield, Illinois, in 199=
8, and more recently in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington, "will be repeated e=
lsewhere as the more competitive market evolves and some public power utili=
ties are caught in unpredictable marketplace conditions," says Aschenbach.=
=20
In addition, utilities may face significant competitive pressures--even wit=
hout federal legislation--from increased levels of investor-owned utility c=
onsolidation and market power in both electricity generation and transmissi=

And then there's the uncertainty regarding the competitiveness-affecting is=
sue of private-use restrictions on tax-exempt bonds municipal utilities use=
 to raise funds. These federal restrictions, whose relaxation investor-owne=
d utilities strongly oppose, limit the amount of bond proceeds that can ben=
efit private-end power users.=20
Finally, public power electric utilities face proposals in Congress seeking=
 their regulation by FERC. Says Aschenbach: "The loss of the flexibility in=

Idea of Edison Bankruptcy Gains Currency Utilities: With PG&E as an example=
, consumer and business groups are beginning to view reorganization as a pa=
latable option to a state rescue plan.

As state lawmakers enter what looks to be the final round of debate on a re=
scue plan for insolvent Southern California Edison Co., consumer advocates =
and even some business groups are asking whether the utility's 4.3 million =
customers might be better off if SCE filed for bankruptcy.=20
Support for a legislative deal for SCE, which is backed by Gov. Gray Davis =
and the utility, is difficult to gauge, in part because the April bankruptc=
y filing of California's largest utility--Pacific Gas & Electric Co.--has p=
roved less disruptive to customers than first thought.=20
Many lawmakers, analysts and others believe Bankruptcy Court might be a bet=
ter forum for SCE to settle its financial problems than the political arena=
.=20
If SCE and its nearly $4 billion in power debt land in Bankruptcy Court, th=
e logic goes, the company, its creditors and its lenders probably would hav=
e to make more concessions than would ratepayers to return the company to f=
iscal health.=20
That would be a far different formula than the rescue plan passed by a key =
Assembly committee last week. That plan would require the utility's largest=
 180,000 customers--primarily businesses--to pay for as much as $2.9 billio=
n in bonds to cover much of SCE's debt through higher rates. SCE would fina=
nce or negotiate away the remainder of its debt.=20
Edison International, the utility's Rosemead-based parent company, has spen=
t virtually the entire year fighting off bankruptcy, arguing that it could =
cost as much as $1 billion in legal and administrative fees and could lead =
to employee layoffs and higher rates for customers.=20
To emerge from bankruptcy, the company maintains, it might have to sell som=
e of its assets or curtail investment in its electrical grid.=20
The utility sank into insolvency after piling up billions of dollars in ene=
rgy-related debt under California's deregulation laws. It was forced to buy=
 power for more than what it could charge customers when prices spiked over=
 the last year.=20
The accumulation of similar debt pushed San Francisco-based PG&E to file fo=
r protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in April.=20
Southern California Edison has been following a different path, agreeing to=
 a rescue deal negotiated with Davis. The final version of that plan contin=
ues to be debated in the Assembly this week.=20
One reason for the tenuous nature of the deal's support is that PG&E's bank=
ruptcy thus far has had no disastrous effects. Another reason is that bankr=
uptcy experts say the tab will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars=
, not the $1 billion Edison projects for a major utility bankruptcy. And by=
 not approving an SCE rescue bill, politicians would be able to say that th=
ey did not vote in favor of raising electricity rates.=20
"Clearly it is in [ratepayers'] best interests for there to be a Southern C=
alifornia Edison bankruptcy," said Kenneth Klee, a bankruptcy expert at UCL=
A law school. "The advantage of bankruptcy is that creditors and Edison wou=
ld share in the pain too. That would give ratepayers some cushioning."=20
Even with bankruptcy, Klee said, ratepayers probably would have some exposu=
re. "There is no free lunch," he said.=20
Klee's views are shared by consumer advocates, who have mounted a spirited =
but so far unsuccessful lobbying campaign against a legislative rescue of E=
dison. They argue that a variety of Edison missteps and its acquiescence to=
 deregulation make it, rather than rate payers, responsible for huge debts.=
=20
"Ratepayers are unlikely to be any worse off in a bankruptcy than in an abs=
olute bailout of the utility," said Bob Finkelstein, an attorney with the U=
tility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group.=20
"But from what we have seen in the PG&E case, a bankruptcy would probably b=
e more fair for ratepayers," Finkelstein said. "So far, the judge has left =
rate matters with the Public Utilities Commission."=20
In June, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali denied a Pacific Gas & =
Electric challenge of state regulators' authority to set its electricity ra=
tes. He said he wanted to avoid "jurisdictional chaos" and added that "the =
public interest is better served by deference to the regulatory scheme and =
leaving the entire regulatory function to the regulator."=20
But Finkelstein acknowledged that there isn't enough of a track record with=
 utility bankruptcies to know for sure.=20
"This is all uncharted territory," he said.=20
Indeed, one factor that could make a bankruptcy filing the least attractive=
 option is an Edison lawsuit against the state that argues that regulatory =
law gives it the right to recover from customers what it paid for power und=
er federally approved rates. Edison has said it would drop the lawsuit if i=
t can work out a legislative settlement.=20
Barring that, the lawsuit could end up costing ratepayers more than they wo=
uld pay under a state rescue plan, said Allan Zaramberg, president of the C=
alifornia Chamber of Commerce, who supports the Assembly bill.=20
Legal experts are divided over whether Edison would win its case.=20
The version of the rescue bill that the Assembly Committee on Energy Costs =
and Availability approved Wednesday night would allow the utility to issue =
ratepayer-supported bonds to pay most of its debt, but says it must find ot=
her ways to deal with the nearly $1 billion it owes independent power produ=
cers.=20
"Bankruptcy is better than the political football game that is being played=
 now," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Assn., a=
 Menlo Park, Calif., trade group that represents many of the large power pr=
oducers and traders to which SCE is in debt and which would be barred from =
a share of the bond money under the current plan. "It brings order to an ot=
herwise chaotic process."=20
Bankruptcy also is where the utility is likely to wind up regardless of whe=
ther the Legislature passes the rescue plan, said Benjamin Zycher, of the S=
an Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute.=20
Lawmakers have left the big power producers out of the rescue bill because =
the state has accused the independent generators of price gouging. The prob=
lem, Zycher said, is that those companies still have claims. If they don't =
get their money, they could push SCE into involuntary bankruptcy by pressin=
g their claims in federal court.=20
The downside to such a tactic, Ackerman said, is that bankruptcy proceeding=
s take time and cost money. Moreover, he said, he understands that members =
of his trade group could end up collecting less than 100% of what they are =
owed by Edison.=20
Others say any advantages of a bankruptcy are outweighed by unique problems=
 that would arise from putting the state's second-largest electric utility =
through the process.=20
"I don't think it is clear-cut," said state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del =
Rey), who chairs the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee.=
 "I think it is better to avoid a bankruptcy, but it also wouldn't be the e=
nd of the world either."=20
Bowen sees a multitude of unknown outcomes as the biggest risks in a bankru=
ptcy. A judge who tries aggressively to protect creditors might attempt to =
impose rate increases. Such a move could be supported by the utility, which=
 would see its debt reduced through the rates customers pay, Bowen said.=20
A bankruptcy also could sever the interests of the utility from the state's=
 policy agenda, she said.=20
PG&E has become a wild card in the state's policymaking on energy, and many=
 lawmakers are fearful that Edison would be too if it took the bankruptcy r=
oute. Since filing for bankruptcy, PG&E has raised objections to rate makin=
g and revenue projections by state agencies, which could delay a $12.5-bill=
ion bond offering to cover the state government's power purchases on behalf=
 of the insolvent utilities.=20
Some lawmakers believe that, as the beneficiary of a state rescue, Edison w=
ould be more cooperative than the Northern California utility.=20
Though ratepayers might fare better in a bankruptcy in a narrow financial s=
ense, Zycher said, damage to the state's image would undermine any financia=
l gain.=20
"A world in which government can pass a misguided policy that imposes such =
costs on private companies and then leaves it all to Bankruptcy Court to se=
ttle out is dangerous to the investment environment in California," he said=
.=20
Thomas Walper, an attorney advising Southern California Edison on bankruptc=
y issues, said the utility wants to reach an "acceptable legislative soluti=
on" that allows it to become solvent so the company has more control over i=
ts future and so the state can exit the power business sooner.=20
Though a bankruptcy certainly raises all of these issues, many analysts out=
side SCE point to the case of PG&E. To date, they say, the actions of Bankr=
uptcy Judge Montali have not disrupted service or been pro-creditor at the =
expense of ratepayers.=20
"We have seen it work orderly in the PG&E case," Ackerman said.=20
But the state still is in the early stages of the process, Bowen said. The =
real test will come when a judge approves PG&E's still-undetermined plan fo=
r reorganization. Then questions about who is responsible for the huge ener=
gy debts run up by the utilities will be answered.=20

Now Davis Doing Too Much, Energy Critics Say

 =09By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer


SACRAMENTO -- Faulted early on for responding sluggishly to the energy cris=
is, Gov. Gray Davis has reversed course in dramatic fashion, wielding his e=
xecutive powers in a way critics now say edges toward imperiousness.

In recent months, Davis has used his constitutional authority to issue a sw=
eeping series of executive orders: He authorized the state to borrow $5 bil=
lion for energy purchases, weakened air pollution standards for power plant=
s and bypassed some of government's normal checks and balances.

Most recently, he signed an order allowing Pacific Gas & Electric to transf=
er a Kern County power plant to another company. The move, Davis said, woul=
d let the new owner retool and begin producing power by next summer. But it=
 also allowed the company to skip review by the Public Utilities Commission=
, and suspended a provision of state law.

"It's the imperial governor," said Barbara O'Connor, director of Cal State =
Sacramento's Institute for the Study of Politics and Media.

The Democratic governor has argued that initially he needed to step back an=
d study the evolving crisis. Then, once schooled in his options, he was abl=
e to take decisive action to keep the lights on.

"Extraordinary times demand extraordinary action," said Davis' press secret=
ary, Steve Maviglio.

The governor's aides point to polls showing that the public believes Davis =
is doing a better job than the Legislature of managing the crisis. Surveys =
also show him running ahead of the three potential Republican candidates fo=
r governor--Secretary of State Bill Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard=
 Riordan and businessman William Simon.

"My guess is most of the voters would rather have him act decisively and no=
t get caught up in the stalemate of Sacramento politics," said Bruce Cain, =
director of UC Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies. "They probably=
 figure we can all worry about the niceties of representative democracy lat=
er on."

The energy crisis certainly has presented Davis with his stiffest challenge=
. Unlike the earthquakes, insect infestations, fires, droughts and floods t=
hat have tested past governors, the power emergency has unfolded like no ot=
her.

Complex and persistent, it has defied simple solutions because of the innum=
erable players scattered across the worlds of government, business and fina=
nce, and its multiple layers of interconnected problems.

Some Say Davis Doing Too Much

Despite a January State of the State speech by Davis that highlighted the c=
risis and pledged more than $1 billion to attack it, legislators complained=
 into the spring that he wasn't doing enough. But now the governor is being=
 criticized for doing too much, in particular for his moves to slam through=
 executive orders of extraordinary scope and volume.

Since declaring a state of emergency in mid-January, Davis has issued more =
than two dozen such orders, terse decrees that allow a governor to bypass t=
he more time-consuming legislative process--and to avoid jousting with stat=
e lawmakers who may not be of a like mind.

This has only happened before in times of life-or-death crisis.

The peak for former Gov. Pete Wilson, himself no stranger to using gubernat=
orial fiat in a pinch, came when he issued 36 executive orders during 1994,=
 the year of the catastrophic Northridge earthquake, when the normal rules =
were suspended to get Southern California up and running. After the Loma Pr=
ieta earthquake in 1989, Gov. George Deukmejian also used his executive pow=
ers--albeit to a lesser extent--in bailing out the Bay Area.

During his first year in office, Davis signed about a dozen executive order=
s, mostly for narrowly focused issues, a world apart from the latest batch,=
 which have fashioned huge changes in the way California does its power bus=
iness.

"Executive orders have a role, but not as the policymaking process for our =
state," said Sal Russo, a Republican political consultant running Simon's c=
ampaign.

"It's godlike power," said Tom Hiltachk, a Republican attorney who acknowle=
dged that Davis is within his constitutional rights. "But it's supposed to =
be exercised only in extreme conditions. And extreme conditions don't last =
for six or seven months."

Davis' moves have hardly gone unnoticed.

Consumer advocates are howling over a Davis plan they say would essentially=
 hand control of electricity rates to the governor. Anti-tax crusaders say =
he has too eagerly embraced the notion that big government--in particular t=
he takeover of power-buying for California's beleaguered utilities--is the =
solution.

Orders' Repercussions Will Last Long Past Crisis

Federal energy regulators in Washington are scrutinizing the governor's hol=
d over the Independent System Operator, which shepherds the state's power g=
rid. The key issue: a move by Davis since late last year to load up the ISO=
 board with his own appointees.

More provocative than the volume of executive orders, however, have been th=
e consequences--which will last far beyond the current crisis.

As well as authorizing billions for power purchases, the governor greased t=
he skids for quicker construction of gas-fired power plants, an action that=
 frustrated backers of alternative sources such as wind and solar. He relax=
ed state environmental reviews and rushed certification for smaller "peaker=
" plants designed to meet the surge of demand on hot summer days.

Davis cleared existing plants to boost output by up to 50 megawatts without=
 the usual bureaucratic procedures. Open-meeting rules, traditional review =
periods and other statutory checks and balances were suspended in some inst=
ances to speed the push to get more megawatts on line.

Such actions allowed Davis to jump-start an otherwise tedious process, crun=
ching regulatory time down from years to, in some cases, weeks.

"Waiting periods, regulatory delays--all those things stood in the way of k=
eeping the lights on," said Maviglio, the governor's spokesman.

The biggest shift came at the state Department of Water Resources, a previo=
usly low-profile agency run by a Davis appointee. The department made its f=
irst power purchase in December--unbeknownst to lawmakers at the time--and =
in January began buying power for the state's financially hobbled private u=
tilities, too broke to do so on their own.

Now the Davis administration supports a proposal by the Department of Water=
 Resources to have the state PUC essentially rubber-stamp any rate increase=
s the department deems necessary, excluding consumers from the process. Sev=
eral of his other actions have also weakened PUC oversight.

Though the administration argues that it makes no sense to have one state a=
gency regulate another, consumer advocates fear the arrangement would allow=
 Water Resources to raise rates whenever needed without adequate public ove=
rsight.

"It seems the way he prefers to operate, free of public scrutiny," said Dou=
g Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's somethin=
g you'd expect only in some tin-pot dictatorship. It's monarchical, not dem=
ocratic."

Some at the state Energy Commission likewise feel they have seen their powe=
r undermined by the executive branch. Robert A. Laurie, appointed to the co=
mmission by Wilson, said the independence of his agency has eroded under Da=
vis.

"The reason we were made a commission in the first place, in 1975, was that=
 the Legislature wanted independent advice," Laurie said. "In my opinion, o=
ur advice is no longer independent but is thoroughly controlled by the exec=
utive branch."

Legislators Not Rushing to Help Share the Blame

Legislative leaders have not exactly rushed to the defense of Davis, who ev=
en on the best of occasions has an arm's-length attitude toward state lawma=
kers. The damned-if-he-does, damned-if-he-doesn't response Davis is receivi=
ng contrasts sharply with the treatment accorded previous governors during =
a crisis. Wilson, for instance, was lionized for his rapid executive moves =
after the Northridge quake, a groundswell of support that helped the Republ=
ican capture a second term in 1994.

Democrats, at least, say they understand that Davis is in a fix, and most a=
re at least tacitly standing behind his efforts.

"Obviously we would have been happy if more of these actions had been done =
jointly with the Legislature," said Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), Environme=
ntal Quality Committee chairman. "But hindsight is easy and I wouldn't crit=
icize him for what he did."

State Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, a San Francisco Democrat and lo=
ngtime Davis foil, believes the governor is "doing the best he can in a dif=
ficult situation. I would not have wanted the buck stopping at my desk."

That does not mean, however, that Democratic leaders are enthusiastically s=
upporting Davis.

Several were irked that the governor refused to share details of key energy=
 negotiations with top legislative brass, even in private.

His secrecy has extended beyond energy matters. Davis seemed to some around=
 the Capitol to be oddly distant during July's drawn-out budget negotiation=
s, breaking from tradition by convening only a single session of the so-cal=
led Big Five legislative leaders. Administration officials counter that the=
 governor was on the phone repeatedly with lawmakers to round up the needed=
 votes.

When the governor talked of ordering the Legislature to stay in Sacramento =
through its summer recess to address a bail-out plan for troubled Southern =
California Edison, irritated lawmakers ignored the threat and went home.

"People skills are not Gray's strong suit," said Cal State Sacramento's O'C=
onnor. "It's an omnipotent, 'I'm smarter than you' style."

If Davis' use of executive orders has riled some, concern remains in some q=
uarters about what he might yet do.

Lew Uhler, president of the Sacramento-based National Tax Limitation Commit=
tee, suggested that Davis needs to back away from wielding his executive po=
wers, particularly now that the state seems to be skirting a power meltdown=
.

"It's all part of his worldview: that we're all vassals of the state," Uhle=
r said.

Oddly enough, Davis also comes under criticism from those who believe he fa=
iled to wield his executive powers forcefully enough.

Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine economist, argued that the governor should have =
used eminent domain to seize power plants in an effort to bring prices into=
 line. Instead, Davis has deployed mostly verbal weaponry against power gen=
erators. Despite his rhetoric, generators negotiated what critics contend a=
re pricey long-term power deals from the administration.

Davis is trying to renegotiate the contracts. He has also asked federal ene=
rgy regulators to force generators to refund $8.9 billion for what he conte=
nds was gouging during the past year. But the prospects on those fronts are=
 mixed.

"Gray Davis used the considerable powers of the executive branch to make al=
l the wrong moves," Navarro said.

Lights Still On, but Glow Could Dim Later

Davis defenders believe the governor has turned the corner on the energy cr=
isis, at least in part because he took advantage of his emergency powers. H=
e has also been lucky: Mild weather has helped the state avoid summertime b=
lackouts. Media attention has begun drifting to other events.

"Believe me, we didn't want to be in this business of purchasing energy," s=
aid Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. "We only did it on an emergency basis to ke=
ep the lights on."

Yet Davis' use of executive powers to help defuse the energy crisis could h=
ave negative political repercussions if the circumstances escalate again, a=
ccording to UC Berkeley's Cain.

"Some of the things that do go sour," he said, "will be more easily pinned =
on him."=20

Eleventh Hour Chimes For California's Edison Rescue Deal=20
By Jason Leopold and Andrew Dowell=20
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20
(This article was originally published Friday.)=20
SACRAMENTO (Dow Jones)--Even a soap opera has to end sometime.=20
For Edison International  utility Southern California Edison, that time cou=
ld be Sept. 14, when the state Legislature adjourns for the year.=20
After more than seven months of haggling and missed deadlines, there is wid=
espread agreement that lawmakers have just two more weeks to craft a state-=
sponsored rescue for the utility. If legislation isn't enacted by that date=
, it never will be, key lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis said. And if that hap=
pens, Southern California Edison will likely join PG&E Corp utility Pacific=
 Gas & Electric in bankruptcy court.=20
"This deadline is real," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "Every day we=
 wait is one step closer to bankruptcy."=20
At issue is a rescue plan that could come up for a vote on the Assembly flo=
or as early as Tuesday. The plan has already been approved by the Assembly =
Committee on Energy Costs and Availability, and an earlier version was appr=
oved by the Senate.=20
The key details of the plan were first agreed to in principle in February a=
nd then formalized in a memorandum of understanding between Southern Califo=
rnia Edison and the state on April 9.=20
In essence, the state would help the utility raise funds to recover some of=
 the losses it sustained buying wholesale power at prices far higher than i=
t could collect from customers, taking in exchange a claim on the utility's=
 transmission assets.=20

As of July 31, the utility had $3.3 billion in unpaid and overdue obligatio=

The plan isn't necessarily a cure-all. As reported, ratings agencies have s=

"We would not foreclose on all of our options," Brian Bennett, Edison Inter=

To be sure, this isn't the first time Edison and others have said deadlines=

The notes are being issued to provide liquidity for the general fund. While=

This indicates that note repayment could be met if reimbursement is not rec=

Economic assumptions appear reasonable, with employment dropping from more =

Dan Walters: State's infrastructure crisis grows, but no one seems to have =
a plan


(Published Sept. 4, 2001)=20
If the true out-of-pocket costs of California's energy fiasco borne by rate=
payers, taxpayers, creditors and utility stockholders were to be totaled, t=
he number could easily surpass $100 billion. And by happenstance, that's ab=
out what experts say California needs to spend on critical infrastructure i=
mprovements, such as new and remodeled schools, waterworks and transportati=
on systems, over the next decade.=20
The money wasted on the energy crisis is gone; it remains only for politici=
ans, including those who created or exacerbated the debacle, to decide who =
gets stuck with the bill. But as they pick at the carcass of the energy cri=
sis, politicians also confront the harsh reality that the state's ever-grow=
ing population and rapidly changing economy are continuing to create pressu=
res for infrastructure investment. And it's clear that Gov. Gray Davis, leg=
islators and others charged with resolving California's infrastructure cris=
is don't have a plan to do it.=20
With just two weeks remaining in the 2001 legislative session, lawmakers ha=
ve barely started on fashioning bond issues to be placed before voters next=
 year. The Legislature's own budget office is renewing its perennial sugges=
tion that the governor and lawmakers devise a comprehensive, multiyear capi=
tal improvement program rather than do what they usually do: slap together =
a package of bond issues at the last moment with numbers plucked from thin =
air. But while politicians pay lip service to such a rational and businessl=
ike approach, they're not likely to do it.=20
A two-house conference committee was convened the other day to begin workin=
g on the single biggest piece of the bond package, one that would finance s=
orely needed elementary and high schools and colleges, not only new buildin=
gs but repairs and upgrades to old ones.=20
Funds from a $9.2 billion school bond approved by voters in 1998 have been =
spent, and a coalition of educators says $27 billion more is needed. The Le=
gislature's budget office says the state could issue up to $30 billion in a=
dditional general obligation bonds for all purposes, including schools, if =
the borrowings were spaced out to avoid overloading the bond market.=20
But how big a bond package should be placed before voters is just one quest=
ion to be answered in the next couple of weeks. Legislators must also decid=
e how the proceeds are to be divided among various educational levels, and =
they must resolve a very nasty squabble over allocation of K-12 money.=20
For years, California parceled out school bond money on a more-or-less firs=
t-come, first-served basis. Districts that put together local financing and=
 specific construction plans were given priority. But those first in line t=
ended to be affluent suburban districts, while big urban districts such as =
Los Angeles Unified dawdled. A lawsuit was filed last year to overturn the =
state allocation process, and the state agreed to change its method to one =
funneling more money to the urban schools. That, in turn, has created a pol=
itical backlash among legislators from rural and suburban districts whose p=
rojects have suddenly been pushed back.=20
Publicly, legislators on the conference committee say they're committed to =
helping every district build and maintain safe, uncrowded and attractive sc=
hools for every one of California's nearly 6 million K-12 students. But the=
y know that not every need can be satisfied, and by deciding how big a bond=
 issue is to be offered and settling on how the money is to be divvied, the=
y'll be engaging in a form of rationing.=20
In that sense, the school bond wrangle is a metaphor for California's large=
r infrastructure crisis. There won't be enough to meet every demand. Not ev=
ery car can be driven on the roadways simultaneously, not every student can=
 have a seat in a good classroom, and not everyone's thirst for water can b=
e satisfied.=20
The politics of rationing -- who gets what and at what cost -- will dominat=
e the Capitol for years to come, even if the r-word is never uttered public=
ly. And that $100 billion blown on the energy crisis would have come in ver=
y handy right about now.

State's Long term Power Contracts Could be too High all the way to 2010
By Ed Mendel  September 3, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- One of the unintended legaci=
es of the failed electricity deregulation plan, and the crisis it spawned, =
may force the state to pay above-market prices for power for the rest of th=
e decade.  The dozens of long-term power contracts signed by the state earl=
ier this year, as it desperately sought to reduce soaring prices, will be p=
robed by a committee after the Legislature adjourns later this month.  "I t=
hink it is important we discern whether there are opportunities for reshapi=
ng some of those contracts in the future," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-=
Boulder Creek, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee.  The plan=
 pursued by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis to tame soaring power pri=
ces on the spot market offered generators a deal: Lower prices now in excha=
nge for prices likely to be a little above market in the future.  When powe=
r prices fell in June, the administration declared that the plan had worked=
. The spot market, shrunk by the increasing amount of power obtained throug=
h contracts, is now said to tilt toward buyers rather than sellers.  But ir=
onically, as prices on the spot market fell, they also raised questions abo=
ut whether the contracts are too much of a good thing, both in price and qu=
antity.  The spot market has already fallen below contract prices at times =
this year.  In the initial administration forecast in April, the long-term =
contracts were expected to be below average non-contracted prices through 2=
010. Now lower spot-market prices have reversed the forecast.  An update in=
 July by the same administration consultants, Navigant Consulting/Montague =
DeRose, expects the average price of power on the spot market to be well be=
low the average contracted price from 2003 through 2010.  As for the volume=
 under contract, the forecast is that the amount of power that the state mu=
st buy on the spot market will shrink and nearly disappear in 2004, before =
beginning to grow again.  The state, with 55 contracts worth roughly $45 bi=
llion, has been forced to sell some surplus power at a loss. Experts say a =
surplus is not unusual when power buyers make large purchases.  The large v=
olume of power under contract also creates other problems. It limits the gr=
owth of power from clean, renewable sources -- wind, solar, and geothermal =
-- that are not prone to price spikes like natural gas.  Businesses that wa=
nt to shop around for cheaper power, which was the point of deregulation, m=
ay be forced to stay in the state system to prevent the contract payments f=
rom falling too heavily on residential consumers.  Still, Keeley faces an u=
phill battle as his committee looks at reopening the contracts. The governo=
r's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, defends the contracts as "insuran=
ce" against runaway spot-market prices.  And the two California generators,=
 Calpine and Sempra, who hold the biggest state contracts and say they inte=
nd to be good citizens, vigorously defend their contracts as being good dea=
ls for the state.  A Calpine senior vice president, Jim Macias, said its fo=
ur contracts to provide 2,500 megawatts over 10 years are at very competiti=
ve rates, an average of $60 per megawatt hour.  The president of Sempra Ene=
rgy Resources, Michael Niggli, said his firm has been buying power, sometim=
es at a loss, to meet its contract. When new plants come on line in 2003, h=
e said, Sempra's rates will vary with the price of natural gas and be among=
 the lowest. =09
