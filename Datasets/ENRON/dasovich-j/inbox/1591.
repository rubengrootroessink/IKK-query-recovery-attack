Subject: CPUC/Supreme Court Petition


Attached is the final draft of the Petition for your review and comment.
 
Please provide your comments no later than noon PST on November 8, 2001.
 
There are several changes, all of which are cosmetic.  In summary:
    1.  Douglass has been added as an attorney of record so it is not necessary to obtain substitutions.  Instead, we will file an association of counsel which does not have to be signed by the party.
    2.  The Rules of Court are unclear regarding page length.  Since one set of rules could limit the length to 30 pages, I decided to stay within that limit.  This was done by restructuring the pleading, reducing the lines to 1.5 rather than 2 spaces, and editing.  
    3.  There has been no sacrifice of substance.  In fact, I added the nine factual questions enumerated by Bilas to show why hearings were necessary.
 
Tomorrow we will complete the Exhibit Folio and Motion for the Supreme Court to judicially notice certain exhibits:  rhe January 17 Proclamation by Davis, Resolution No. 46 and the Preferred Policy Decision.  We will also insert the page references for the exhibits.
 
Everything will be delivered to the copy service at noon to make the required copies for filing and service and to bind the pleadings.  It is my intent to file the Petition, Exhibit Folio, and Motion on Friday morning, have the CPUC personally served and every other party served by mail on Friday.  EWD
