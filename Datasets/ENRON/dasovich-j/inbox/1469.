I don't agree Edison's premise -- that "direct access customers contributed=
 just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service=
 customers." We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to bu=
y power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.=
  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high =
wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for =
the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO=
LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I w=
ill explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments=
 of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co=
mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeo=
ffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH=
OLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or =
bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill=
ions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they ar=
e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in dire=
ct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requ=
ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al=
one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject=
 to any presumed "undercollection."

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do=
 a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the =
retail busness from T&D. So, they did a "top-down" calculation.  This meant=
 that there had to be a "credit" put on the bills of DA customers to accoun=
t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. S=
o, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingne=
ss to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled cu=
stomers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that t=
here was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be =
whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed thei=
r tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neithe=
r proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got no=
where, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our a=
rgument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA cust=
omers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilit=
ies avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is f=
undamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought w=
e had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accept=
ed by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminatin=
g the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT AB=
OVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to r=
eceive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from =
any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we sh=
ould be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an at=
torney)=20

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

Hi Jeff,

Please find below SCE's proposal to settle past Direct Access Credit issues
