At the September meeting, the Board of Directors requested a regular update
of progress toward adding needed electrical generation and
transmission/distribution infrastructure in order to provide for needed grid
stability, electric availability and power quality.  This report summarizes
the status of these goals and provides context for any future projects that
SVMG may bring to the Board for advocacy.
