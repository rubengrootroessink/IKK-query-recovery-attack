GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --=20
The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescu=
e Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an=
 emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the stru=
ggling utility.=20
As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish t=
he 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest school=
s won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seekin=
g citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.=20
But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern Californi=
a Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last wee=
k by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.=20
"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," sa=
id President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of resident=
ial people to help big business and bail out a corporation."=20
The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis fir=
st announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion fo=
r Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bon=
ds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.=20
Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electr=
ic Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankr=
uptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to=
 last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 bi=
llion in debts.=20
The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sli=
ding into bankruptcy.=20
"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the bu=
siness of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davi=
s in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Sena=
te has not gotten the job done."=20
The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student=
 to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four=
 years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.=
=20
The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic worki=
ng conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minu=
te rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer =
and toilets, lights and water in housing.=20
It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepher=
ders.=20
While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from t=
heir minds.=20
Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a proc=
ession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their fe=
eling about the attacks.=20
The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Comp=
ensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terro=
rist attacks.=20
The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.=20
"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," sa=
id Davis.=20
