You asked... we listened. Read on for information on 
eConfirms enhancements.

Dear eConfirms Client,

As part of our commitment to meet your needs, we have added 
several new features to Schwab eConfirms so it's easier than 
ever to organize your trade information.

Improved, Easy-to-Read Format with Highlighted Totals

*	eConfirms now consolidates your trading activity by 
	security. For example, all "XYZ Company" purchases 
	will be displayed together (see sample below).
*	A quick snapshot of your day's trading activity is 
	provided through the use of a "Totals" line when 
	there are multiple trades for the same security.
*	We've further streamlined your eConfirms by reducing 
	or eliminating, wherever possible, much of the 
	non-trade related information. 

Additional Features 

*	The last three digits of your account number have 
	been added to help you better identify your account(s) 
	(In order to protect your privacy, the preceding digits 
	of your account number are not displayed).
*	If your eConfirm spans more than one email (due to 
	email size limitations), we have numbered your emails 
	for easy record keeping.
*	As always, you can receive eConfirms bundled (multiple 
	securities per email) or unbundled (separate emails for 
	each security traded)*.

Available in a couple of weeks, improved Schwab eConfirms -- one 
more way we make it easier for you to be a smarter investor.

Here is a sample of our redesigned eConfirm.
