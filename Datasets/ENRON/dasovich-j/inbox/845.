I listened till my battery ran out.  What a mess.   I am sympathetic about being fair, what is a renewal, what is an option held by the purchaser which should not be tampered with.   It's a lot easier to go from regulated to unregulated, the converse is unmanageable.
 
Regards,
 
 
Michael

FYI.  In case you'd like to listen in on what the IOUs have to say about the current and future fate of the PX Credit.
 
Best,
