Guys,

At the Board meeting yesterday, WPTF agreed to consider being involved in the utility procurement case.  AReM is also reviewing its participation as is IEP.  IEP should play a major role -- they have serious concerns that the CPUC will attempt to reinstate integrated resource planning and the evil BRPU.  WPTF will have its attorney review the utility filings due on November 21, and prepare summary comments for WPTF as a starting point for detrrmining the WPTF position. The board agreed to hold a teleconference on November 28 to decide on its position.  With all these groups involved, I think Enron will be able to coordinate its issues through them and avoid being in the case separately.

Sue
