I don't see an issue with this.  I've cc'd Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara to check in with them (while I can see California's pulse on the monitor, they actually have their hand on California's throat)!!!

Mike & Paul,

I have been asked by a consultant to the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission to provide a notional number for a 400 MW power supply at NP-15 starting 01-01-02 for 5 years. I had Jeffrey Oh price this but I do not want to send a term sheet until I am sure your OK with this. The situation is that LAFCO has initiated a "30,000 ft. level feasibility study of a measure that is on the ballot to form a new muni in San Francisco and Brisbane.
