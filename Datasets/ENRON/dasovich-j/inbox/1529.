Thanks.  415.989.1263.  We drafted in support of CMTA's questions, but I
didn't want to stick my neck out and expose ourselves to discovery by Karl,
so our name isn't on it.

I'll fax it to you shortly.  Could you give me your fax number to make sure
that I have the right one?  It's a Barnett ruling.  And I'm sure you've seen
and have commented on the Karl Wood's questions?  The hearnig on the 7th is
wrapping up a whole bunch of very thorny issues, including Wood's questions.
I believe that Barnett and Wood will be presiding.  Oh joy...
 
Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff: 

1) I must have missed a beat...I heard the quarter's news, but assumed
things will work out. 
2) mpa@a-klaw.com 
3) Is this an oral presentation?  Hearing?  Of course I'll be there, but
where did I miss the notice?

Greetings Ms Kahl: 

Few things: 

1)      No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's 
current financial "challenges." 
2)      Could you forward Michael's email address to me? 
3)      Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC 
on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it       intends to recoup its "undercollection" 
under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all       DA customers, 
irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that 
Edison  accrued the "undercollection," would be "responsible" for 
paying.  Which means DA customers       would pay twice for power--once 
to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something      that 
your clients care about?  We care quite a bit. 

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of 
this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around 
based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are 
required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the 
iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force 
all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings 
are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all 
of this, and will you be there on the 7th? 

Inquiring minds want to know. 

Hope you're well.  Please don't travel over any bridges. 

Best, 
Jeff
