Dear CMTA Members:

From: Jack Stewart, President - California Manufacturers & Technology
Association

The California Manufacturers & Technology Association is hosting a major
foreign policy and international trade speech by President George Bush!
President Bush is making the stop as he travels to China on a two-day state
visit and the White House asked us just yesterday to host the event.

?	Sacramento Memorial Auditorium
?	11:00 am to noon
?	October 17th, 2001

?	Yes, that's next Wednesday!

As a valued CMTA member, a complimentary ticket has been reserved for you or
another employee of your company.

BUT YOU MUST RSVP WITH YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER to Geri Royer at
916-498-3330 or groyer@cmta.net by 4:00pm (PDT), October 12th, 2001.

Please take advantage of this opportunity that your CMTA membership affords
you.

If you would like to come in the night of October 16, we have held a block
of rooms at the Sacramento Hyatt Regency Hotel (916/443-1234) at a rate of
$140 night.  Just ask to reserve your room under the CMTA block.
Reservations must also be made by October 12 to guarantee this rate.

This is a great opportunity to support the President and send him off on his
first foreign trip since the terrorist attacks on September 11.

As you know, security will be tight so there cannot be any exceptions on the
October 12, 4:00pm (PDT) RSVP DEADLINE.

We hope to hear back from you quickly and look forward to seeing you in
Sacramento next Wednesday.
