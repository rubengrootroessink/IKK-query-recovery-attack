Announcement for E283-1: Real Estate Finance:

Dear all:

Let me introduce myself. I am your TA, Barbara Bukhvalova. During this semester you will not see much of me unless you come to my office hours. However, you will be able to read my comments on some of your graded work and will receive occasional messages from me through Izio.

I have TAed this corse before and unlike last semester I am very proud that I have conquered the skill of using finance calculators which is a very hard task for absent minded PhD students. I hold regular office hours which hopefully will fit most, but if for some reason you need alternative arrangements do not hesitate to ask me for an appointment or/and please do communicate with me via email about shorter questions you might have.

I am going to post a math primer momentarily. This document is for (very) optional perusal. It is targeting those of you who had a long break in studies before joining Haas and/or generally are not very friendly with math. The criterion of usefulness of that file is how well you follow the lecture on mortgage math (duration, convexity etc.). If you feel like you are lacking some basic intuition on where the formulas are coming from, you can have a glance at this short (barely 3-page) document. Otherwise you might not benefit from looking at it at all.

I am looking forward to the rest of the semester and wish you all good luck.

Barbara
