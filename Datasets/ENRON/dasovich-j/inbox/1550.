So far, there are only 2 companies (and some res customers)-- AB&I Foundry and Tricon Global Restaurants.  There were some others who signed on to our request for rehearing but they must have come through the DA COalition -- I haven't tried contacting them yet.

Great.  Can you give me the entire list (indicating who's who)?  I'm thinking that if I let the big customers know, perhaps that'll give them an incentive to sign on.

Tricon -- another Enron customer -- agreed to sign on to the SUpreme Court Appeal
