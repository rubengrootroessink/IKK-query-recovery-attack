Sounds good. Just let me know if you'd like to set up the call, or if you'd like me to do it.
 
Best,
Jeff

We must go after this. I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:

- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August

- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension

- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance
