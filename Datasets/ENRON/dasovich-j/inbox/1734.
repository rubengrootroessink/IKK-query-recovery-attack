Jim, Sue Mara said that Dan Douglas would be making the response to this  and asked me to review since she is on vacation.   Did Enron decide to file separate comments?

Attached is the most recent statement from the California Utilities that implements the DA Suspension (filed Friday). Comments are due Nov 28 (Wed) from parties.  

The Utilities continue push for a "hard" deadline of DA.  They also offer an option where Suppliers would be required to submit a Affidavit for incremental DASRs and potentially have the CPUC review the specific contract language.  Of course, in no event do they believe that any customer should be allowed to have DA service if the customer's name was not on our Oct 5 Customer List.

Jeff and I will be talking with Mike Smith (and anyone else who wants to participate) to work through our response to these comments.

Jim
