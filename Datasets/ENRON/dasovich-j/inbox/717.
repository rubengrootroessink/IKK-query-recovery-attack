Paul:

Got your voice mail regarding Anthony Pescetti running for a FERC seat.  Here are some quick thoughts.  Sue likely has some additional experiences and information to share.  Be happy to discuss further.

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.
	
Best,
Jeff
