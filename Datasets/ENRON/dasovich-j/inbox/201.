Greetings:

1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.

2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff
