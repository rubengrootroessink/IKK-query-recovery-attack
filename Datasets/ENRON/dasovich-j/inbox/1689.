Tom, Diann and Michael,

I gave Peter Ouberg a call but then I read the PG&E rep's answer again ..

I think Tom Heckman misinterpreted what Rod Lee said.  I agree with Rod Lee.  He did not say that Enron could not submit DASRs -- he said we had to have the account on the list and if we did then the DASR would be processed.  If we did not have the account on the list, there would have to be some verification that the contract was signed on or before 9/20/01.  Enron and the other ESPs previously agreed with this approach (although the utilities did not fully buy into it).  I believe Diann submitted the account information, as we had agreed, on Nov 1. I take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject DASRs for accounts not on the Nov 1 list until the contract is verified, but I believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with ESPs and utilities on Oct 2.

I think Mr. Heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities, but that's not how I read the reply from Mr. Lee.

So, I called Peter Ouberg back and said told him there didn't appear to be a problem after all, but that I would let him know if one cropped up.  IF you would like me to speak to Mr. Heckman, I would be happy to do so.

Sue, Diann,

It appears PG&E is telling our customers they cannot add accounts where
allowed by a contract as well.  What can we do to get PG&E to stop providing
misinformation to our customers?

Tom
