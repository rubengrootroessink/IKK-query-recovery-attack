Hi Evening MBA students,

The Evening MBA office will be closed for the holidays until Wednesday, 
January 2.

We mailed out grade letters this morning.  If you were registered in E278 
Deals or E295 Entrepreneurship, those grades will be available the first 
week in January and we'll send out updated grade letters at that time.

Happy New Year!

Eric, Jane, Josh, Julie, Meg, Natalie, Seung & TJ
