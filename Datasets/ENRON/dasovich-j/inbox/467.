Jeff--I am assuming this would be of interest to the gas guys....are you going to call Tycholiz on this?  Let me know if you don't have time and I'll give him a buzz

Thank you Robert for pointing that out.  I think there is/will be an opportunity--if we can ever get paid, and if we can ever comfortable from a credit standpoint--and my apologies for not having flagged that sooner.  Too many balls.........in the air.

Best,
Jeff

Article 2, Section 2.4 of the recent Settlement Agreement between SCE and CPUC states that SCE intends to apply to the CPUC for approval  to incur up to $250 million (recoverable in a tracking account) to acquire financial instruments intended to hedge fuel cost risks associated with its URG and QF contracts.  Any commercial opportunities there?
