All:  SDGE has already begun the  termination process for this customer.  The accounts will return to bundled service in January.  However, the customer has requested an excelerated termination for this month.  SDGE will not honor this request unless we give them permission.

I agree with Mike.  One question:  If we tell SDG&E no, and if SDG&E communicates this back to the customer, do we know if either SDG&E or the customer (or both) will raise a stink at the PUC?

Best,
Jeff

I think we should keep control of the process, not give SDG&E permission, and D-DASR when we are ready.  Otherwise, I'm afraid the floodgate may open.

Any competing thoughts?  Jeff?

Mike - Could you please provide Diann with the direction she needs.  Per the De-DASR list, Angela and I are in agreement that we do not plan to assume this agreement.

Lamar, Applied Micro Circuits, a SDGE customer with 4 accounts, has asked SDGE to return all their accounts to bundled service.  SDGE would like our approval before they do this.  

This customer is already on the De-DASR list; can I tell SDGE to go ahead and return the customer to bundled service?

Hi Lora,
 
Hope you are there.  Check out the attached note from Applied Micro  Circuits...what does deactivation status mean???  Did  Enron respond on Sony Gas yet?

We called Enron on 12/14; Tammi said that the  accounts were in "deactivation status".

Hi Tom,  

We tried to do this for you but they (Enron) says you need  to call 800-337-7827, and say something like we are terminating our direct  access, our utility, SDG&E says they can accommodate our return 12/20  but we need your concurrence, other wise our termination will be  1/22.

Your choice (of course) if you want to make the  call.
