I think I left my email open at home which means I
can't download it on Omnisky or Yahoo.  So you can
email me at this address if you need to.

Will you get stuff for breakfast at Rainbow?

Eggs
Butter
Bread for toast
Jarly or cheddar
Porties or other mushrooms
Green onions

Don't buy any yellow onions - I will bring some from
home.

I love you.
