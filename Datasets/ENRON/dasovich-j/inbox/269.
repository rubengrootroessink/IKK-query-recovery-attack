This article puts a different spin on Monday's meeting.  It appears that FE=
RC will consider investigating CAISO's purchasing practices and not just ge=
nerator-dispatch-compliance issues. Obviously they are related but the ques=
tion always is:  when will the FERC understand the connection.  (Kudo's to =
Steve Hall and Jeff D for alterting me to this.)

Attending the meeting for Enron will be Ray Alvarez, Dave Perrino, and myse=
lf.  Sue Mara will be available on a standby basis.  Attached are talking p=
oints I have prepared (comments are welcome) and the original invitation.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20

"Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure," Wolfman said in her letter. "The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures."=20

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20

"As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO," a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. "This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated."=20

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20

"The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment," the =
second letter says.=20

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

Generators Confused=20

p://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=3DDYN>), have bought app=
arently inexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later=
 that the price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegatio=
ns, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as "out-o=
f-market" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO=
 market participants see.=20

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20

"The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices," Wolfman said in the letter.=20
