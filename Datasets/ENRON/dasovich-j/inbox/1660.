Hi Jeff - Here's the deal, I've had a cold for a few days. I'm probably past the contagious stage but this is not an exact science. I'm up for teaching today but I figure it's fair to let people know in case they're concerned. I'll see you at 4:30 unless I hear from you in which case I'll understand. Hey, thanks for facilitating this little DAW discussion group. I think I understand the procedure now. I had to hunt around a little for the "reply to all" command(not on my tool bar), but I found it. Now I'm ready. I'm still learning about a lot of this stuff. Later - Avram
