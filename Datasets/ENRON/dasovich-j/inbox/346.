hey.
guess what.
some of you may remember that neiman marcus
commissioned me to design the cover of the xmas
catalog this year (the 75th anniversary of their xmas
catalog), along with my wonderful friend patrick long.

well i did the front-cover art.
and he did the back-cover art.
and.
so.
well.
it's out!
i like the cover well enough.
but i REALLY like the hideous xmas crap they put our
designs on....
you too can check out the crap at
http://www.neimanmarcus.com.
don't miss the sweaters on page 146.
i also think the "delightful cover art musical tree
topiary" on page 3 is a steal at $65.
i'm also keen on the xmas "cover art" snow globe for
$40; it plays white xmas...
and etc.
and etc.

xo
merry xmas
colleen
