Dear Haas Evening MBA Students,
As you know, the "Economic Outlook Forum 2001" will feature discussion 
about the
nation's new economic challenges with Interim Dean Ben Hermalin, myself, 
Janet Yellen, Hal Varian, Ken Rosen, Severin Borenstein, Rich Lyons, Jerry 
Engel, and Dwight Jaffee.

The Forum will take place next Friday afternoon, November 9, from 4pm to 
6pm. I realize that many of you will not be able to participate in the 
program at Haas on Friday afternoon. The
program will be available exclusively to Evening MBA students live over the 
Web. Log on at, 
http://haas.berkeley.edu/haas/video_room/nov9econ_outlook.htm. My fellow 
economists and I also have agreed to respond to your questions.  Send 
questions and comments to, econforu@haas.

Sincerely,
Laura D'Andrea Tyson
Dean
