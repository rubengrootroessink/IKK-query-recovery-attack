Should be $30 retail - plus tax.  I sent you an order form so you could see
all the different prices.

I would bet that we'll be there.  I'll bring my check book.  Is the 97
cab $32 retail?  If it is, it's worth it. 

With Barry doing what he did, getting to the playoffs was icing on the
cake.  But, man, that Friday night game was a heart-breaker.

We'll see you Sunday!

Kisses,
Jeff

No I was just glad she was so generous and I am hoping that that will
continue!

I will order the wine tomorrow if you really will be by on Sunday.  I
can
only have 2 cases delivered at a time.  So I'll get the Coastal first.
It
comes to $152.74 (less $80) = $72.74

The 97 cab will be $193.50
Total = $266.24


Great Niner game - sorry about your Giants - I was rooting for them!

I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.
Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to
the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on
Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it
another time.  And what about those 9-ers?

So did I!!  Thank you for the check - I appreciate it.  I was actually
kind
of hoping you wouldn't want it!  It is such great wine and I did not
expect
her to give me the 50% off or I would have bought more!  When would you
be
around to pick up your other wine?  I don't want to order it and have it
sitting in our clean garage!  Also the check you sent for golf was too
much
because you guys walked and did not take a cart.  You should have paid
$80 -
so you have an $80 credit toward wine.

Miss you guys

Thanks so much for the Storybook wine.  Extremely sweet of you, and we
really appreciate it.  I gave Eldon the check for it.  Man, did we get
CREAMED in the pool.  Sigh....

Best,
Jeff
