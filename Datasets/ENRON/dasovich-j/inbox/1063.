Jeff --

Rule 22 provides with respect to the situation in which the ESP and the UDC
are doing separate billing, that the UDC can require the ESP to establish
its creditworthiness in the same manner as required for ESP Consolidated
Billing, but only to the extent necessary to cover CPUC-approved charges
that the UDC bills the ESP directly.  In other words, if PG&E bills EES
directly for some service(s) that PG&E performs for EES, then PG&E can
require security (surety, cash, a guarantee) to the extent necessary to
cover that
charge(s).
