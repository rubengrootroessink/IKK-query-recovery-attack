Still will be used extensively for internal deals - auctions and M&A datarooms (for sale of EGA's $3-5 billion of international assets)

Thanks.  Is it safe to say, from you notes, that DealBench is "winding down?"

Best,

Zach Streight - he has both a business and technical background.  Other than Ross he is your best bet for someone historically familiar with DealBench that is still working for Enron Net Works.

I have passed your voicemail to Ross Mesquita (Manager, EnronOnline) who is now looking at Business opportunities for DealBench.  About 2 months ago, we decided to discontinue external commercial activities for DealBench and evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to monetizing the platform.
Feel free to follow up with Ross.
thanks,
Jeff
