Dear Students,

I forgot to include the all-important URL for Haas Computing's new Active
Terminal Service in my weekend email. It is http://tsweb.haas.berkeley.edu.
Again, it only works with Internet Explorer 5.0 or above AND Windows 2000.
You may be able to fudge with the Windows 2000 requirement - its worth
trying anyway. 

At the tsweb site, read the instructions about using terminal server. Then
pick the screen size you want from the drop-down menu and hit the Connect
button. At the login prompt, use your haas username and passwords. Yes, you
have to have set up a Haas Computing Center account first, which all of you
must have done by now or had done for you.

If you have any trouble with any of this including the username and
password information, contact the helpdesk@haas.berkeley.edu - this is the
helpdesk for Haas Computing, the people who are bringing you this service.

What does Terminal Server do?

It pretends that your remote PC is at Haas Computing Center. It fills your
PC screen with the Haas Computing Center's desktop and you can now use all
the software that is available to you when you are on the computers at Haas
Computing. Since Terminal Server allows you to pretend that you are
physically at Haas at UCB, you now have access to all the library databases
as well.

I imagine some of you are behind firewalls that may not allow you to use
Terminal Server. In that case try the proxy remote access (info at
http://proxy.lib.berkeley.edu) or get out from behind the firewall!
