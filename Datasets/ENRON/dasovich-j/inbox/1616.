In an effort to enhance the information available to you for the Spring 2002
Electives, the Evening MBAA and SAC is providing The Unofficial Guide to the
EvMBA Electives. The guide is a collection of course content information and
general feedback, mostly in the form of student opinions, which supplements
the course curriculum detail available via the Haas website. Attached is the
The Unoffical Guide and a link to the Spring 2002 Course website

 <<The Unofficial Guide - Spring 2002 Electives.doc>> 

The document is organized by class schedule.
