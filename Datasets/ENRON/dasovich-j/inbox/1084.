RE:  HAPPY HOLIDAYS

In the spirit of this holiday season, California Manufacturers &
Technology Association is pleased to congratulate IBM as the recipient
of the 2001 Excellence in Corporate Philanthropy Award.  IBM was honored
both for its level of corporate giving and for the number of community
service hours performed by IBM employees.  IBM has been a CMTA member
since 1947.

In a larger sense, CMTA salutes all manufacturers for their
extraordinary level of giving this year and in years past.  From Andrew
Carnegie to Louis Gerstner, manufacturers have been the heart and soul
of American philanthropy.  Think of what California manufacturers have
given us:  David Packard's generosity created the world renown Monterey
Bay Aquarium; J. Paul Getty and his foundation brought one of the
world's greatest art collections to Los Angeles; ARCO, now BP, provided
the initial funding for the state of the art ARCO Olympic Training
Center in San Diego; and earlier this month, Intel co-founder, Gordon
Moore announced a $281 million gift to Conservation International, the
largest gift ever given to a private conservation group.

California manufacturers have a rich history of community involvement
and the staff at CMTA takes great pride in representing their interests
in Sacramento.  We thank you for your ongoing support and look forward
to working with each of you for a successful 2002.
