Jeff, I noticed that you sent the Advice Letter to some others.  SCE contacted me yesterday.  See my comments to Sue.

Sue,   Matt Pagano called yesterday to make sure we would be submitting our list of accounts to be DASRed by October 20.   I reminded him of the deadline agreed to at the October 2 meeting, November 1.   Apparently, SCE does not recognize that decision and referred me to their letter to the CPUC.  He attached the letter to his e-mail below.

Do you know if the CPUC has given SCE permission to impose an earlier deadline than the other two UDC's??
