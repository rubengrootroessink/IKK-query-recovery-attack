HAAS MBA STUDENTS TAKE TOP HONORS AT MARKETING CASE COMPETITION
A team of five Haas MBA students won top honors this past weekend at the 
2001 Elite Eight Brand Case Challenge at the Carlson School of Management 
at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.  Team members Anita Akerkar, 
MBA 03; Dennis Cox, MBA 02; Aman Desouza, MBA 02; Nate Kraft, MBA 02; and 
Sherry Lin, MBA 03 competed against seven top business schools including 
UCLA's Anderson, Carlson, Fuqua, Kelley (Indiana), Kellogg, Michigan, and 
Wharton.

"It was a great experience," said Sherry Lin. "This really solidifies Haas' 
position as a top marketing program."

The teams received a marketing case on Yoplait's Go-Gurt and were given 36 
hours to prepare a structured analysis and recommendations.  Go-Gurt is a 
$135 million portable yogurt snack brand that targets kids ages 8 to 12. 
After a strong launch, the brand was experiencing a decline in growth and 
increased competition.  The Haas team's suggestion included both deepening 
the relationship with the current target customers and expanding to a new 
market -- teenagers. What made the Haas solution especially appealing was 
the use of focus groups. The team rented a car and traveled to a local mall 
to conduct focus groups with teenagers to find out what would encourage 
them to buy Go-Gurt.

Each team presented its recommendation to a panel of judges consisting of 
executives from sponsoring companies as well as marketing professors.

In addition to Haas, other winners of the challenge included Northwestern's 
Kellogg School of Business (second place) and Indiana's Kelley School 
(third place).  Winners received $10,000, $7,500, and $5,000 
respectively.  3M, Fallon Worldwide, General Mills, Kimberly-Clark, and 
Philip Morris sponsored the event.

  WIRELESS AT CAL: HAAS CONTINUES TO EXPAND WIRELESS COVERAGE
Wire-free connection has become reality at the Haas School. Wireless access 
services, such as e-mail and the web, are now available in and around 
select areas of the Haas School. The new service is part of UC Berkeley's 
pilot wireless LAN service, known as AirBears, which enables students to 
connect to the campus network if they have a laptop equipped with a 
wireless Ethernet card.

So far at Haas, AirBears wireless LAN coverage is available in: the Wells 
Fargo Room, the Haas courtyard, Jimmie Bean's Caf?, the Bank of America 
Forum, the MBA lounge, the undergraduate lounge, the MFE Collaboration lab, 
library group study rooms, the Bakar Computer Center, C230 sloped floor 
classroom, and F320 classroom. According to Mike Pivonka, the plan is to 
extend coverage to all Haas classrooms and major conference rooms before 
the start of spring semester.

Using the AirBears wireless LAN requires:
    + a laptop or other computer with 802.11b wireless ethernet card (WiFi 
certified).
    + a currently valid CalNetID and passphrase.
    + an SSL-enabled web browser (IE, Netscape etc.) on your computer.
    + an area with AirBears coverage.

AirBears is also available in the Cesar E. Chavez Student Center, the 
Bechtel Engineering Library study area, and the Doe Library study carrels 
(selected areas). It will soon be available in the Mario Savio Free Speech 
Movement Caf?; the Northgate Lecture Hall; and the Foothill Residence Halls 
(selected common areas). Please check http://www.net.berkeley.edu/wireless 
for updates on availability.

THE 24TH ANNUAL REAL ESTATE & ECONOMICS SYMPOSIUM: WHAT DOES THE FUTURE 
HOLD FOR REAL ESTATE?
Predicting the future of the economy and the real estate market in the US 
has always been difficult and has become even more so after the attacks on 
September 11. At Haas this daunting task will be taken on by the Fisher 
Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics (FCREUE) at its annual 
conference, which brings together leading experts from academia, business, 
and government to discuss and offer predictions on the economy and the real 
estate market.

The 24th annual Real Estate and Economics Symposium,  "Adjusting to the New 
Economic and Real Estate Realities," takes place November 19 from 8:00 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m. at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.  At this full-day 
program, experts will talk about various aspects of the risks in the real 
estate business and how real estate will adjust to the new economic 
environment.

"The demise of the new economy and ensuing economic recession in the US and 
Silicon Valley, the energy crisis, and the post-September 11th 
uncertainties, have created an unsettled and clearly changing sea-level for 
real estate and other asset markets," said Bob Edlestein, symposium 
co-chairman and real estate development professor.  "It appears in the 
short run that real estate is in troubled waters with its outcome depending 
upon how quickly we can stabilize the general economy.  It is likely that 
there's 'worse' ahead before things turn better in the real estate market; 
but, ten years from now, it is likely that our economy will be faring 
better and real estate will be a hot asset again."

An array of experts will speak about the changing social-political-economic 
environment and its impact on real estate.
    +Kenneth Rosen, the California State Professor of Real Estate and Urban 
Economics and chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban 
Economics, will give his annual real estate forecast.
    +Bob Parry, president of the Federal Reserve of San Francisco, will 
explain how the economy and policy are likely to fare in the near future.
    +Michael Nacht, dean of the Richard & Rhoda Goldman School of Public 
Policy and former assistant director for strategic and Eurasian affairs of 
the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, will provide a political 
backdrop about security issues and their likely effects upon the US economy.

The complete agenda and additional details can be found on the FCREUE 
website www.haas.berkeley.edu/realestate.

All Haas faculty are invited to attend the symposium free of charge. 
Complimentary attendance is also available for students who volunteer to 
help out during the Symposium.  Contact Zee Zeleski at 
zeleski@haas.berkeley.edu to register.

HAAS UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SHINE AT CASE COMPETITIONS
The undergraduate team representing Haas at the 2001 University of Texas 
International Business Challenge Case Competition in Austin, Texas, brought 
home both second place and the competition's Professional Excellence Award.

The International Business Challenge is an annual undergraduate business 
case competition held each fall at the University of Texas at Austin. Teams 
come from 20 leading undergraduate business schools from the US, Canada, 
South America, Asia, and Europe. The first place team was from the 
University of Hong Kong.

The teams were given a case depicting real-world problems confronted by 
Dell Computer Corporation and three days to prepare a solution. The teams 
presented their solution to the "client," a panel of distinguished judges 
from Dell, Solomon Smith Barney, and other members of the business 
community.  Four teams were selected to advance to the final round.

"The Haas Team approached this case as a real client case and spent time 
analyzing the current market and how Dell could achieve a higher revenue 
growth," says Annie Lai, director of admissions and operations in the 
Undergraduate Program.  "They not only presented a great recommendation, 
but also demonstrated their knowledge and understanding of global business 
issues."

The Haas team included Eurie Kim, BS 01; Parizad Olver, BS 01; Megan 
Schofield, BS 01; and Julie Wang, BS 02. The faculty/staff advisors to the 
team were George Cluff, Steve Etter, David Robinson, and Annie Lai. Haas is 
the first program ever to earn awards at four consecutive University of 
Texas International Business Challenge Case Competitions.  In addition, 
case competition teams from the Haas Undergraduate Program have won awards 
in 7 of the 9 international case competitions they have entered since fall 
1998.

Investment Banking Case Competition
Back at home, the Fourth Annual Investment Banking Case Competition 
presented by the Haas School of Business and Goldman Sachs & Co. took place 
on October 30, 2001. Each year this event showcases one of Goldman Sachs' 
recent high profile transactions. This year's case focused on the recent 
sale of Cobalt Networks to Sun Microsystems.  The winning team included 
Joseph Spector, BS 02; Annabelle Louie, BS December 01 (business 
administration and mass communications); Peter Lee, BS 02 (math); and Tina 
Tong, BS December 01, (business administration and economics).

Banking, Finance, and Real Estate, who will discuss the business 
implications for the insurance industry. Both Dean Tyson and Ben Hermalin, 
associate dean for academic affairs, will moderate discussions.

After the forum, streaming video of the event will be available on the Haas 
web site at http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/haas/video_room/.

HAAS DOES WELL IN OFF-BEAT RANKINGS
As business school rankings proliferate, they highlight different strengths 
of MBA programs. In October, Haas was ranked well in three rankings: Beyond 
Grey Pinstripes' survey on social and environmental stewardship, Computer 
World's Techno MBA survey, and America Economia magazine's survey on global 
MBA programs.

Beyond Grey Pinstripes
The Haas School was ranked among the top 15% of business schools in the 
Beyond Grey Pinstripes survey released on Oct. 31. The survey was conducted 
jointly by the World Resources Institute and The Aspen Institute for Social 
Innovation Through Business in an effort to determine how well business 
schools teach their MBA students how to manage the social and environmental 
impact of business.

The top five schools at the cutting edge of social impact management were 
those at Harvard, Loyola Marymount, Michigan - Ann Arbor, North Carolina, 
and York University (Canada). George Washington University, University of 
Jyvaeskylae (Finland), Michigan, North Carolina, and Yale were listed as 
the top five at the cutting edge of environmental impact management.

The Haas School was listed in the second tier of ten schools having 
significant activities in the areas of social and environmental impact 
management. The survey specifically mentioned Haas for its Social Venture 
Competition, its participation in the Corporate Environmental Management 
concentration (offered by nine UC campuses), and for having an endowed 
professorship in the area of sustainable enterprise or sustainable management.

The survey weighed student coursework (50%), institutional support (30%), 
and faculty research (20%) to determine its top 15% of graduate business 
schools teaching social and environmental responsibility. Of the 463 
schools that received the extensive questionnaire, 122 schools responded.

The Techno MBA
Computer World magazine listed the Haas School among the top 25 
technology-driven business schools in its 2001 Techno MBA survey published 
on Oct. 22. The purpose of the survey, according to the magazine, was to 
determine "which schools do the best job of combining good management 
techniques and technology innovation under the general heading of sound 
business practices."

In its two-part survey, Computer World asked recruiters to nominate the 
best techno-MBA programs nationally based on their recruiting experiences 
at these schools. Computer World then asked MBA programs to nominate what 
they considered to be the best technology-driven programs (other than their 
own) and to submit information on their own programs and students.

The University of California was represented in the top 25 with three 
campuses - Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine. Other top-ranked schools 
included Wharton, Indiana, Northwestern, Michigan, North Carolina, and UT 
Austin. Computer World did not assign individual rankings to these top 25 
schools.

According to Computer World, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Harvard, Duke, Stanford, 
and New York University were also nominated as top programs, but did not 
participate in the survey.

America Economia
The Latin American business journal America Economia ranked the Haas School 
#11 among global MBA programs offered in the US and Europe in its Sept. 13 
issue.

The top universities offering global MBAs were:
1. Harvard University
2. U. Pennsylvania (Wharton)
3. Stanford University
4. MIT (Sloan)
5. Northwestern (Kellogg)
6. INSEAD (tied)
6. London Business School (tied)
7. University of Chicago
8. Columbia University
9. UCLA (Anderson)
10. University of Texas-Austin
11. UC Berkeley (Haas)
12. Duke University (Fuqua)
13. New York University (Stern)
14. University of Michigan
15. University of Virginia (Darden)

The rankings issue of America Economia examined the competition US and 
European business schools pose to Latin American institutions. In addition 
to its global MBA ranking, it ranked Latin American business schools in a 
separate ranking.
