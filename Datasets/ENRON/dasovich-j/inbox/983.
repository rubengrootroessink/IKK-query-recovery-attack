At the September meeting, the Board of Directors requested a monthly update
of progress toward adding needed electrical generation and
transmission/distribution infrastructure in order to provide for needed grid
stability, electric availability and power quality.  This is the second

of the larger economic and political context for electrical supply and
demand in Silicon Valley.
