hey, prentice has a friend in town whom you may have met.  very cool,
very funny.  we'd bring her along if that's ok, and if you still want to
get together tonite, which we're totally up for. let me know.  and it
would be a good idea to get together since we should probably talk a bit
about Jay's place.  he's been inquiring about what we're thinking.

best,
jeff
