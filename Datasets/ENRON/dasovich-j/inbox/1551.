Sue,
 
Attached is the revised Petition which has been substantially completed.  
 
Please advise whether I can send it to Commonwealth's counsel so we can coordinate efforts.  If so, please provide the name of its attorney.
 
Each person or entity identified as a Petitioner needs to send me written consent to be named.  This can be done by Email.  If you provide the email addresses, I will send the draft and request confirmation that they consent to be named as petitioners.
 
It is my intent to file on Friday.  This will give me the weekend if last minute changes are required.  EWD
