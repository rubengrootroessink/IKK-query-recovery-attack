Yes.  Just signed the wire and its on its way up.  We probably missed the morning run, so it will go this afternoon.  They will definately have it today to get the cashiers check on Monday.

Jeff, 

If we have to pay tomorrow, please get me the wire instructions when you speak with Howard.  I don't show a $100,000 payment to them since 12/6/2001

I received a notice through Janet that if we don't pay $100k to California PUC by 12/26/01 our EEMC registration is suspended.  THIS MEANS THAT THE MONEY MUST BE THERE TOMORROW.  Suspension includes ceasing serving residential and small commercial (all accounts below 20kw) within 48 hours.

I think that we've already paid, but Jeff is checking.  

If not, Wade please arrange payment to 

Howard Shyrock 
Energy Division - 4th Floor 
CPUC 
505 Van Ness Avenue 
SF, CA 94102 

Thanks.
