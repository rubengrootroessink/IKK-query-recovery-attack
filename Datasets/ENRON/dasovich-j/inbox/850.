Dear Friend, 

Happy Holidays. At The Wine Enthusiast we're committed to offering you the
finest selection of wine cellars and unique wine accessories. We also love to
let you in on opportunities for new adventures in wine. 

Our friends at Robert Mondavi have graciously extended a special offer for
membership in their wine club, Robert Mondavi Ensemble. Ensemble provides access
to limited, pre-release and library vintages from this world-renowned winemaker
at special member prices. In addition, you'll enjoy member benefits at Robert
Mondavi Winery, including special pricing, VIP tours and invitations to
exclusive Ensemble events. 

As an Ensemble member, you will receive four Seasonal Shipments per year that
each include 2-5 bottles of wine. The special Ensemble price is $75 to $100 per
shipment after applying your 15% member discount (plus shipping and applicable
tax). Join Ensemble on or before December 31, 2001, and Robert Mondavi will
include two elegant wineglasses with your first shipment. 

You are invited to review the current and past shipments of Robert Mondavi
Ensemble to see the quality and variety of wines offered.
