Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in.  At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs:

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.  Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated.
