Internet Daily 
for Monday, October 29, 2001

Yahoo expands video programming

Yahoo  said its streaming-video service has added new 
programming, including cooking shows, a TV sitcom and highlights 
of a conference offering families and businesses help after the 
terrorist attacks last month.

The programs are free. Advertisers' messages are displayed as 
the programs are streamed. The announcement was made Monday at a 
conference sponsored by Webnoize, a market research firm 
specializing in digital entertainment technologies.

CW EDistribution LLC's contributions include episodes of the 
show "Townies" and clips from old TV commercials and celebrity 
interviews. "It is the ideal platform for people to see shows 
they might not otherwise be able to access," said CWD's Robert 
E. Raleigh. Yahoo's broadcast service is also offering free 
access to a conference hosted by Franklin Covey, in which author 
Steven Covey suggests ways people can cope with the effect of 
the events of Sept. 11.

More confidence seen in Internet

Online shoppers will be clicking and buying this holiday season 
because they find the Web more convenient and product selection 
more broad than bricks-and-mortar stores, not because they are 
afraid to shop in large public places, according to a special 
research report produced by VNU's ACNielsen and Yahoo. The 
latest Internet Confidence Index study showed a 9% rise from its 
level just before the terrorist attacks. More Internet users 
plan to shop online during Q4 (60% vs. 54%) than previously 
projected, the study determined. "On Sept. 11, the Internet 
played an essential role for millions of people," said Rob 
Solomon, general manager of Yahoo Shopping. "The [Internet 
Confidence Index] confirms consumers now recognize 
ecommerce-related activities ... are safe, secure and very 
convenient."

Web standard use for PC owners

Internet use is becoming routine for a large majority of U.S. 
households that have computers. Lisa Melsted, an analyst with 
the Boston research firm Yankee Group, said 76% of PC-equipped 
households use online and Internet services, 58% use their PCs 
for games and entertainment, and 30% access personal and 
household finance services. "These results indicate consumers 
are incorporating the online channel into their daily 
activities," she said. The Yankee Group's survey found the 93% 
of households with PCs have access to the Internet.
