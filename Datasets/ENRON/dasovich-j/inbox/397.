Attached is the draft applic/reh which incorporates Phil's additions.  I
have not yet added the CIU name etc to the pleading only because I
wanted to hear from Barbara if CLECA wants to join in.  Barbara - - - we
have not put a lot of effort into this simply because we didnt think it
was worth it.   This is intended to at least keep our options open for
the time being.  This is due on Mon so I have to send it out today. 
Because I have to leave early I would like to hear from you by 11:00 am
your time if CLECA wants to add its name.
