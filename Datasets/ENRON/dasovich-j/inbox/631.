Topic:          Beyond the Genome: What's Next in BioTech?
Speakers:       Brian Atwood, Managing Director, Versant Ventures;
                 Barry Bunin, CEO & Co-Founder, Libraria;
                 Gajus Worthington, President, CEO & Co-Founder, Fluidigm.
                 Moderated by Betsy O'Neill, Manager, Business Development, 
Tularik.

With the sequencing of the human genome virtually complete, the 
biotechnology industry is in a state of flux.  Two years ago genomics 
companies were all the rage, but now that genomic information is becoming a 
commodity, they are scrambling to create more attractive business 
models.  At the same time new companies have appeared with technologies for 
streamlined exploitation of this deluge of information, and numerous, more 
mature product-oriented biotechnology companies are at long last bringing 
new drugs to the market.  The panelists at our October Forum will discuss 
the impact that the genomic roller coaster ride has had on the sector and 
share their vision for the future of the industry.
