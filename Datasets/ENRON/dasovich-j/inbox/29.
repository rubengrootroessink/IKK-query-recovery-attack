Dear Students,

Pathfinder - catalog of all UCB libraries except Law Library

Melvyl - catalog of all-UC libraries, California Periodicals Database
(catalog of journals in all California University and some public and
special libraries), search, save and email records.
Access to some databases.  When emailing database articles, be sure to
click on "text" on the email screen, otherwise only the citation will be

Electronic Journals - access to journals in electronic format

Electronic Books - e-books including some business and economics titles

Electronic Reference Tools - Dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.

Electronic Databases - drop down menu with links to 20 or so business
databases. We looked at these this evening:

ABI/Inform - The best database for management articles and general business
topics going back to 1981. Scholarly and some popular and trade journals
are indexed and abstracted, and about 70% of the articles are available in
full text. Use the Power Search option. Lots of case studies - can limit
search to case studies only. Various other options. Mark in check boxes the
articles you want to email to yourself or if you want to format something
for printing. On the email screen, check the box for sending "text" so you
don't get sent only a citation.

Dow Jones Interactive - Newstand has current news from Wall STreet Journal
(USA, Asia and Europe versions), New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times
as well as the big business magazines like Business Week, Forbes,
Economist, etc.
Dow Jones Library has articles from thousands of business magazines and
newspapers (internationally), most of which are available for 10 or more
years. Majority of publications indexed are available in fulltext.

Onesource - password accessible from anywhere with a browser. Aggregate of
information from many high quality business databases. Great for company
and industry research as well as other business topics. Very
straightforward to use.

Econlit - great abstracts from core economics journals, plus some others
that are also quite good.

Reuters Business Insight - market research reports in energy, healthcare,
technology, consumer goods.


Remote access link - remotely access the library's databases through the
proxy server - instructions available at http://proxy.lib.berkeley.edu.

Or,

use the new Terminal Server at http://tsweb.haas.berkeley.edu

Enough said! Time to work.
