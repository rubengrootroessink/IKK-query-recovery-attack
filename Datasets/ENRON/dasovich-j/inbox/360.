At Rob's request, I added a final bullet and did some minor editing.  Pat and Sue, if at all possible, please send your comments to Rob and me around midday today, so Margaret can complete her briefing book this afternoon.  I've attached both Rob's and my writeups.

Thanks,

Jeff

Attached is my draft that I plan to send up to Ken tomorrow.

I would appreciate comments, particularly (Sue) on the RTO section which is about one page.  You can just use the edit function if you would like.

Thanks,

- Rob

P.S. I will be out until early tomorrow afternoon--contact Jeff Gray in my absence.
