Jeff - per Beth Apollo's message.   The bottom line is what CSC really
needs to be able to invoice Calif power customers is the 810 EDI files from
all 3 CA utitlities.  They have stopped sending 810s to us and are only
providing 867's.   If we can't get the 810s going then the information
provided in the attached spreadsheets needs to get to us in order to
invoice.   This info could come via spreadsheet, or line item within the
867.   The business impact to Enron is that we have not been able to
invoice for these customers since Dec 5 and this is a large revenue amount.

Please call me - my cell phone is 713.305.1659 if you have questions.
After 11:30 central today, I will be on vacation and my backup Maggie Brown
can be reached 713.822.3753.

Teresa
