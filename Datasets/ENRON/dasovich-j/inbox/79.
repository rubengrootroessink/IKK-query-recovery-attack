I'm on vacation myself right now, in Mpls, for my
Dad's 70th birthday.  I will have to get back to you
tomorrow, but she gave us the first four chapters of
Fabozzi to read, and then recommended a number of
problems from Chapters 2 and 3.  She has posted the
answers on Izio.  If I can get to a computer that, I
will try and download the material and send it to you.

Yes, the course is tight.  All fixed income stuff. 
Wallace has carefully prepared her material.  The
students are a bit of a mixed bag:  I'm not sure
everyone understands what they're in for, but you
should fit in nicely.
