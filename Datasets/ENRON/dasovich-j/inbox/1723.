Jennifer,
I thought I should ask Jeff Dasovich to attend for us.  Jeff, please be
on your good behavior!  He will try to be there if he can.  He used to
work for Kathleen at Enron, by the way.

Since I've gotten a couple questions about this today....just a
reminder,
AReM is holding an in person planning meeting on Monday November 19. We
plan
to start about 10 am (although a couple members won't be able to arrive
until 10:30). 

The meeting will be held at 345 California St, 32nd Floor. You can just
come
up to our floor (no additional security measures in the lobby),
reception
will have you sign in and tell you how to get to the conference room.
The
meeting is likely to run until mid-afternoon. 

We have not put together a formal agenda - but we plan to discuss AReM
strategy and focus for next year. If you will not be able to attend, but
would like to float concerns, positions etc - please go ahead and
circulate
them by Monday morning and I'll make sure they are discussed (ie get
copies
to anyone who couldn't access their email prior to the meeting). 

See you Monday
Jennifer
