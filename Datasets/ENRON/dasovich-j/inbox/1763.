  Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have=
 any choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer=
 up any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to att=
empt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due pro=
cess rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.

  Best,
  Jeff

    Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing th=
at ESPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commi=
ssion by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties =
who sign a "suitable" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as fo=
llow:
    1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct=
 access contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend d=
irect access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, =
shall submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agr=
eements along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A fail=
ure to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be c=
onsidered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contrac=
ts and agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the act=
ual contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's=
 Docket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.

    2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who ha=
ve executed direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed pro=
tective order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall=
 be submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20

    3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties sha=
ll work with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective o=
rder and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commiss=
ion staff by December 11, 2001.=20

    4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in res=
ponse to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted b=
y January 4, 2002.

    As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own =
names, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and =
WPTF are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course =
they wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight =
this Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering =
our options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very preli=
minary analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdicti=
on over either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also parti=
cularly outrageous because of the statements that, "A failure to submit thi=
s information for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waive=
r of the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreem=
ents" and "Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts an=
d agreements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agree=
ments are in effect."  The former is a likely denial of due process and the=
 latter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP compet=
itors and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-de=
pendent customers. =20

    Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this =
is time for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC,=
 SPURR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the =
Governor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be =
very much appreciated.
