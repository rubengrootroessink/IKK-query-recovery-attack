Jeff,

The SV Manufacturing Group intends to sign the "business coalition" letter 
making many of these points. The $8B is a number pulled out of thin air, 
right?

Have you given any thought to how we go about systematically restoring a 
de-regulated market....sans DWR and the State Power Authority....in 
California? 

Regards,

John
