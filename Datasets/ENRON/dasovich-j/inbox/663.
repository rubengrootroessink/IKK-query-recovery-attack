Here's a bit more info.  Don't be scared about the sand fleas.  It's true
they are there, but she said it was easy to avoid them.  Plus, the time of
year we are going is supposed to be better than when she was there.

Pura Vida is in West End which is about 25-30 minutes from the airport and @
20 minutes from Coxen Hole which is the main "city" on the island.
basically, there's a main road that runs around and transverses through the
center of the island.  Coxen Hole is the city (it consists of about 20
1-story buildings which are crammed next to each other alongside the main
dirt road) and it's where travelers go to get cash, and send email from the
Internet Cafe.  West End is where all the dive shops are and the cool
restaurants and bars.
West Bay is about 8 minutes away from West End by water taxi.  It's more
secluded, and hence more romantic, but there's not too much down there.  a
few hotels but that's about it.  so, even though West Bay's beach is better,
i'd still stay in West End because that's where all the action is and it's
much more convenient for diving.  also, you can always take a water taxi
over to West Bay. we did that several times, but i never laid out on the
beach because of the sand fleas.  instead, there's a hotel right on the
beach with a huge pool and we'd sit by the pool and order drinks/food, etc.

there is a party in Tahoe which i've committed to attending...it's being
thrown by one of the guys who did the IMAX Everest movie so should be a lot
of fun (plus a lot of gorgeous guys and not too many gals).  anyway, i might
not leave until saturday so there's a possibility i'll be here friday night.
and, no you don't have to go with me to get into Redwood Room. i can see if
i can put you plus 2 or 3 others on the guest list.  if you think you'll
really go friday night, let me know and i'll try to get you on the list.
as for peter's party, send me the invite if you still have it.  do you think
he's dating anyone.  if not, maybe you could play matchmaker??
;)

The party is Friday night at his house.  If you want to go I will find the
invite and send it on.  We are probably going to go for a little while at
least.
I wish you were in town this weekend so I could see the Redwood Room - don't
I have to go with you to get in?
My launch party is in Palo Alto - and its really just a bunch of engineers -
its actually a celebration for them.
I found the airport (RTB) and I am looking into flights.  Any chance you
want to go there between xmas and new years??
We are going to Santa Barbara next weekend to visit scottys grandfather.  I
think we  are leaving on Friday.  Why don't you go to tahoe next weekend -
what is so great about this weekend???

of course i remember Peter...i sat right next to him on purpose because he
is fucking HOT!  is he dating anyone?  i thought he was really cool.
when/where is his party?  i'm probably going to Tahoe on Friday night.  The
place i had my b-day is the Redwood Room at the Clift Hotel. You should
definitely check it out.  Are you in town next friday night? if so, i could
go with you.  where is your launch party? i will try to stop by after dinner
at Slanted Door.
Roatan is THE place to be in terms of diving in Honduras. There is an
airport there.
TACA airlines is the major carrier throughout Central and South America.
It's by far the most reliable and safe airline, so i'd stick with them.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
love, me

So, the place you want to be is Roatan.  I found an airport there I think.
I'll see what I can find.  Thanks for the other info.
I can't do poker night next Thursday because we have our company new product
version launch party.  Sounds fun, huh??  You are of course welcome to come
- ha!!
Then, in terms of weeknights, I am busy with my classes until I leave for NY
on the 1st of November (and staying until November 11th - any chance you are
going out there).  Are you around this weekend?  I would love to check out
that room where you had your birthday celebration.  I don't have many plans
this weekend...  There is a party by that guy we met at Stacey's party that
I have stayed in touch with.  Actually Scotty likes him also.  His name is
Peter McNally - do you remember him?

hi. depends on which airline you fly.  i flew United to San Salvador, El
Salvador then on Taca Airlines over to Roatan, one of the Bay Islands off
the coast of Honduras.
If you fly on Taca from San Francisco, i don't think you have to go through
San Salvador on the way home.  I would recommend flying Taca because United
is a pain in the ass because the flight from San Salvador leaves at 8:30am
but you can't take an early morning flight off Roatan so you have to leave
the afternoon before and spend the night in San Salvador (about 30 miles
from the airport).
You want to dive at Pura Vida. Ask for Mel, she's awesome.  You can stay at
Pura Vida Hotel (that's where steph stayed) which is literally 25 feet from
the dive shop.  www.puravidaresort.com if i was you, that's where i'd stay
as it's super convenient (adjacent to dive shop, boulangarie, and the
yummiest restaurants).  they also have a driver to take you to and from
airport which is quite a help.  your open water PADI course should be @
$150.  i don't think i'm going there next month as it's too hectic to try
and fly all the way there and back in 4 days.  i'd need at least 5 or 6.
i miss you.  when can we get together? are you up for a ladies' poker night
next thursday?

Where do you fly into for the place in Honduras?  What is the name of the
dive shop?  Who is the person there you like a lot?  Can you remember any of
the hotel names or housing outfits to rent from?  Are you still going next
month?
