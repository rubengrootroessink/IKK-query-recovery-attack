I did not know if all of you were copied on this email thus I wanted you
to be aware of the plans for Jeff's 40th. Please share this email with
those that might be left off of the list (copy Mike Mills so he can add
them to the distribution list mills@yahoo.com). 

Alexis & Rachel do you have an email for Clark? Could you share this
with him?
 
Rob, do you have Maria Magistro's email? Rob, Heather and David--do you
have Kelly's or Don's email? Can you copy them?
Thanks, 
Madeleine

PS Mike this is the best I can come up with for now of individuals who
may not have been on your original distribution list.

Hello Friends of Jeff Walker:

As you may know, Good Old Jeff will be turning 40 in
early December.  There are plans afoot to help him
celebrate in style, so we wanted to get a "save the
date" message out to everyone so you can incorporate
this into your busy holiday schedules.

We don't have all the details yet, but we're working
on an "event" and mid-to-late afternoon meal on
Sunday, December 9 in Napa Valley, California.  If
there is interest, we may also have an more informal
agenda and overnight stay scheduled for Saturday,
December 8.

Please email me back with the following information:
* Can you make December 9 in Napa? If so, tell us the
names of others you might be bringing.
* Would you be interested in arriving December 8?
* Can you offer assistance or recommendations for the
Napa area?

Also, please let us know if you had been planning
something for Jeff separately or if you'd like to help
us in our efforts.

Thanks in advance for your response.  If you'd like to
reach me by phone, my number is 650-465-9207.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

--Mike Mills
