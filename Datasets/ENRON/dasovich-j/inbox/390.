Given that Congress in 1935 stated that federal regulation extends "only to=

201(a) of Federal Power Act), and transmission of energy from generators to=
 retail customers in the same state was then "subject to regulation by stat=
es" (as it has been since 1935), may FERC preempt state jurisdiction over s=
uch intrastate retail transmissions of electric energy? Does FERC have juri=
sdiction under the Federal Power Act to regulate all transmission of electr=
ic energy in interstate commerce, including the interstate transmission of =
electric energy that is sold to retail customers at "bundled" prices? Did F=
ERC have jurisdiction under the Act to eliminate pervasive "undue discrimin=
ation" in the provision of interstate electric energy transmission services=
 by requiring transmission-owning utilities to provide interstate transmiss=
ion services on the same terms to all users, for all interstate transmissio=
ns, including transmissions bundled with retail sales? Did the appeals cour=
t err in ruling that FERC had discretion to interpret the Act as denying FE=
RC the necessary jurisdiction to remedy undue discrimination it had found i=
n the provision of interstate transmission?=20

UK: INTERVIEW-Italian power market long way from taking-off.

LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Electricity trading in Italy is still facing to=
o many difficulties for a liquid market to take off, said Fabio Leoncini, P=
resident of the Italian Energy Traders Association, AIGET.=20
"There are a few bilateral contracts traded occasionally, but the market is=
 still in a very premature phase," he told Reuters in an interview on Frida=
y.
One of the main problems, he said, was that demand for electricity in Italy=
 was far higher than supply, and production from independent generators ver=
y limited.=20
"Because of that, it is very hard to guarantee supplies and develop a liqui=
d market," said Leoncini.=20
Demand from consumers free to choose their supplier is estimated at 100 ter=
awatt hours (TWh) per year, but only a quarter of that comes from independe=
nt sources, most of the remainder being supplied by former monopoly ENEL.=
=20
"Out of these 25 TWh, 20 TWh are covered by electricity imports and the res=
t is generated by independent producers. So the proportion of power availab=
le is very small," he said.=20
In addition, construction of new generation capacity was being held up by l=
engthy administrative authorisation process.=20
New entrants currently present in the Italian market included U.S. trading =
firm Enron Corp, German utility E.ON, Spanish Endesa, U.S. utility TXU as w=
ell as newly formed Italian trading companies.=20
"Some of the well-known traders are doing about five transactions a month a=
nd the volume varies a lot, so it's difficult to get a clear idea of volume=
 traded," said Leoncini.=20
He added that all transactions were over-the-counter bilateral contracts fo=
r the supply of physical electricity.=20
LACK OF IMPORT CAPACITY LEADING TO HIGHER PRICES=20
Electricity imports themselves were difficult to secure because of restrict=
ed interconnection capacity at the northern border, the main import point i=
nto Italy.=20
"The only way to get electricity into Italy is to secure cross-border capac=
ity, so competition is intense leading to high prices," said Leoncini.=20
He added that high capacity prices added to already high baseload electrici=
ty prices in Italy.=20
"Last year, we've seen capacity prices as high as 15 euros per megawatt hou=
rs (MWh). As a result, Italian wholesale prices remain very high compared t=
o the rest of Europe," he said.=20
Italian baseload electricity prices themselves averaged 30 to 35 euros per =
megawatt hour (MWh), compared to prices between 20 and 25 euros/MWh in the =
German wholesale market.=20
CAPACITY SALE STILL AN ISSUE=20
The system to sell cross-border capacity has been a bone of contention in I=
taly, with the regulator opting last year for an auction system that was th=
en annulled by the Milan administrative court in favour of a pro-rata syste=
m.=20
More recently, both Italian and French grid operators who manage the interc=
onnections have agreed on a new auction system.=20
"As AIGET we prefer by far an auction system, which is more transparent, bu=
t such a system could still be contested in court," said Leoncini.=20
He added that it was equally important to gain access to other countries' g=
rid once cross-border capacity was secured.=20
"It's no longer an issue in France because the management of the grid is se=
parate from the ownership. But that's not the case in Switzerland and Slove=
nia where access can sometimes be a problem," he said.=20
Switzerland and Slovenia, which are outside the EU, are not subject to the =
electricity liberalisation directive requiring unbundling of transport and =
supply activities.=20
Cross-border capacity in northern Italy amounts to about 6,000 megawatts (M=
W), but grid operator GRTN recently said it had plans to increase it to 10,=
000 MW in the next few years.=20
POWER BOURSE TO BOOST MARKET LIQUIDITY=20
Leoncini also said that traders were hoping that the new Italian power bour=
se to be launched early next year, a year behind schedule, would boost liqu=
idity in the market.=20
"We would have preferred a compulsory pool system, but that won't be the ca=
se," he said, adding that the bourse would still bring transparency to the =
market.=20
The exchange will initially launch a physical day ahead contract as well as=
 a balancing and adjustment markets.
