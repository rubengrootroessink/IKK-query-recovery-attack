Hi Jeff,

Wallace wants us to do problems 5 and 8-11 from
Chapter 2 in Fabozzi.  She also posted all the answers
to the first four chapters' practice questions on
Izio.  If you are still not signed up for the class on
the system, feel free to use my name and password to
get access the class info.  Lecture notes and syllabus
are also available there.

See you Tuesday.
