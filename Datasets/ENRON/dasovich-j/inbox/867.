Hey Jeff - I'm still wondering if my last email made it through. Maybe you remember me saying I hit send and Outlook Express closed. The email got into my "sent items" but I don't see how it could have sent if the program closed so fast. Here is a copy, I don't want to just send it out and bug everyone if they already got it so I'll just bug you. Could you let me know if you already got this:

Hi everybody,
I happened on an addition to my search for info while doing a little research last night. There just might not be anything on this out there yet, but I was at Asus' website last night and it seems they have a new dual-processer motherboard out called a CUV266-DLS and I can't find anything about it anywhere. Maybe it's too new or too expensive for anyone to have bothered with up to this point but I'm snooping around so if you've heard anything...

thanks - Avram
P.S. I don't know if I remembered to tell any of you that the Kathy Kallick Band with yours truly is playing at Rancho Nicasio on Sunday. - A.
