Jeez, nice company.  Putting you up for 10 days at the Waldorf.  I love
that neighborhood.  Anywho, I'll check those dates and get back to you.

You aren't supposed to be hungry.  Dinner won't be served until 10pm.
Be
hungry at 10.

We leave for NY on the 1st and return on the 11th.  Staying at the
Waldorf
the entire time.

Three dates.  OK.  Wait.  How about two dates?  November 15th (any time)
or
November 22nd  (any time)??

I think the menus will be good also.  I think my mom has had their food
and
liked it too.

give me 3 dates (very soon) and promise that you won't cancel, change,
modify, reschedule, delay, postpone, or amend.  I'll find out which one
works.  

when you leaving for NYC?  the movie sounded VERY funny (from the
riotous laughter i heard).  and those menus really do look good--maybe
you could get by by giving your mom that piece of things (with your OK,
of course) and that would make her feel like she's got a chunk of the
event and it could leave you guys with the freedom to do all the other
stuff.  just a thought.

i'm very excited but not altogether hungry.

best,
Jeff

Have you heard anything back on potential dates to meet.  I am in NY
until
November 11th, so any date after that would be great!

Sorry you couldn't watch the movie last night - it was pretty funny.

Hope you are excited about the meat pie for dinner.  Won't that be a
treat???

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff
