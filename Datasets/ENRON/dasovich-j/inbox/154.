Call for Papers on the California Energy Crisis

The Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade
(http://www.wkap.nl/journalhome.htm/1566-1679) will be publishing a special
issue on the California Energy Crisis. We are seeking papers on any aspect
of the crisis, but particularly papers that seek to bring out the policy
lessons, or the implications for other countries engaged in electricity
restructuring.  The journal aims to bridge the gaps between theory and
empirical analysis, and between academic and policy-oriented economists in
the field of microeconomic policy.

Papers should be between 10 and 20 sides of double-spaced A4 paper.  Please
send an outline of one or two pages by September 30th to:

r.j.green@hull.ac.uk
blumstei@socrates.berkeley.edu
andre.sapir@cec.eu.int
Karl.Aiginger@wifo.ac.at

Carl Blumstein and Richard Green are editors for the special issue; Karl
Aiginger and Andre Sapir are the editors of the journal

Conditional acceptances will be based upon these outlines. Full papers will
be required by December 15, and final versions (after receiving referees'
comments) by February 28th, 2002.
