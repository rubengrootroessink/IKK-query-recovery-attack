Hi Jeff,

I have two tickets for you for Saturday night's
performance.  If that still works for you, I can leave
them at WILL CALL at the box office for you and
Prentice.  Perhaps a cup of coffee after the concert?

(If that night does not work for you, please let me
know as soon as you can so the seats won't go
begging.)

Cheers,

JT
