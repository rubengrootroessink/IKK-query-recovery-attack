As a last resort, we have reserved a room at the Sacramento Convention

will be held from 7:30 a.m. until 9 a.m., however it is recommended that
you claim your tickets as quickly as possible to ensure your seating.

We are also attaching a sheet of instructions, which you should read
carefully and retain for the day of the event.  Also there is a map of
downtown Sacramento with parking garages marked, if you should need it.

Thanks for your interest and we look forward to seeing you all at this
historic event.
