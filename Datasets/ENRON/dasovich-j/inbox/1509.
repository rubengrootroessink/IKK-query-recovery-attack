I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.  Some tidbits:

New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.  They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.  Good luck there.  Their meeting with SCE is 11/6.

New Energy -- New Energy returned all customers (but one) before May 2000. The one customer -- Krogers (grocery store chain) -- has been very active at the Legislature on this and will attend the SCE meeting. No meeting has been set up but one is expected next week. Has been more willing to talk about "cost shifting" but thinks SCE's proposal is ludicrous. I suggested it would be a bad idea to go down SCE's cost shifting road right now. Is outraged by SCE's proposal.

APSES --  Is outraged by SCE's proposal. Told SCE he wouldn't meet until SCE gives him the proposed payment amount and substantiation for it. He believes that SCE has no way to determne an accurate number.  He will also insist that SCE true-up the amount, once the ISO hits the utilities with the underscheduling penalty.  And finally, he will insist that SCE complete the PX Credit audit before he'll agree to a number.  APSES is the other party with a complaint filed at the Commission. His new contracts put his customers at risk for changes to the PX Credit mechanism, so his issue is primarily collecting the past amount due.

Strategic Energy -- Only does business in San Diego.

Commonwealth -- Minimal exposure.
