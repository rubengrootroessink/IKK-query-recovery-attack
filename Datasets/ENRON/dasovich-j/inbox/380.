INDIA: India's GAIL says study for gas pipeline on tck.

NEW DELHI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - State-run Gas Authority of India Ltd said on=
 Friday its technical-commercial feasibility study for a deep-sea gas pipel=
ine from Iran was proceeding on schedule despite fears of war in the region=
.=20
But the New Delhi-based firm said the overland option was not a priority no=
w because of heightened political uncertainty in neighbouring countries.
"We're going ahead with the deep-sea feasibility study and hope to see it c=
ompleted in a year's time, Proshanto Banerjee, Gas Authority's chairman and=
 managing director, said.=20
"But the onshore feasibility is not a priority right now because it would i=
nvolve Pakistan and Afghanistan which are disturbed politically at the mome=
nt," he told reporters.=20
GAIL is the agency mandated by the government to carry out the $10-million =
feasibility study for the proposed 2,500-km (1,550 mile) pipeline that coul=
d partly meet India's growing hunger for energy.=20
Analysts estimate India has a demand for 115 million cubic metres of gas a =
day against a supply of 65 million. The pipeline from Iran, which has the w=
orld's second-largest gas reserves, makes economic sense.=20
But the overground route from Iran to India for the project, estimated at $=
4.0 billion, would pass through Afghanistan and Pakistan - a country that h=
as fought three wars with India.=20
FEARS OF WAR HAVE RISEN=20
Prospects of a conflict in the region have risen since the devastating Sept=
ember 11 hijack attacks on the United States.=20
Washington accuses Afghanistan's ruling Taliban of sheltering Osama bin Lad=
en, its prime suspect for the attacks, and has asked him to be handed over =
or face possible military retribution.=20
On being asked whether GAIL would be interested in taking over energy giant=
 Enron's Corp Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in the western Indian st=
ate of Maharashtra, Banerjee said the "company would certainly look at the =
proposal".=20
Enron's Indian unit, the Dabhol Power Co, is involved in a bitter payments =
battle with the state's electricity board, and the U.S. firm wants to sell =
its 65 percent stake in the unit.=20
Dabhol's 740-MW first phase has been idle since May and its second 1,444-MW=
 phase is 97 percent complete but further construction has stopped because =
of the dispute. The first phase uses Naphtha as fuel and the second was to =
run on LNG.=20
But Banerjee added GAIL had not been approached by any institution or Enron=
 with a proposal and did not make any estimate of what the 5.0-million tonn=
e LNG facility would fetch.=20
GAIL's shares ended 0.50 percent lower at 50.50 rupees on Friday on the Bom=

Enron Unit Files Claim To Recover Argentine Investment

By Tim Loughran
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

BUENOS AIRES -(Dow Jones)- Azurix Corp., a unit of Houston, Texas-based Enr=
on Corp.(ENE), has decided to abandon its $440 million, 30-year concession =
to oper ate drinking- and wastewater services in the province of Buenos Air=
es and is try ing to recover all investments made there in the last 26 mont=
hs, a company spoke sman told Dow Jones Newswires.
In addition, Enron and Azurix will seek "some level of damages in addition =
to the money we've spent," said John Ambler, Enron's spokesman for its Lati=
n Am erican operations.=20
On Sept. 19, the company filed a claim with the International Centre for th=
e Settlement of Investment Disputes in Switzerland against the Republic of =
Argent ina to make sure "that all of our rights are protected," Ambler said=
.=20
In the meantime in Argentina, "we are continuing discussions with the appro=
 priate government authorities, which we hope will result in a negotiated r=
ecisio n of the concession contract without having to resort to arbitration=
," he said.=20
Azurix owns 90% of the Azurix Buenos Aires water company, which serves the =
l argest and most populous of Argentina's 23 provinces. The company's emplo=
yees ow n the rest.=20
Elsewhere in Argentina, Azurix owns 32.1% of Obras Sanitarias de Mendoza, a=
 water company in the province of the same name. France's Societe de Amenag=
ement Urbain et Rural, or Saur, owns another 32.1%, while company employees=
 own 10% an d the provincial government retains a 20% stake, according to E=
nron's 2000 annua l report.=20
"For the time being, (Azurix) remains active in Mendoza," said Ambler.=20
Earlier this year, reports circulated that Enron planned to sell all Azurix=
 assets in Argentina to its French partner.=20
At the time, Ambler said he could not comment on any possible sale of compa=
n y assets, but did tell Dow Jones Newswires that Enron is in the process o=
f selli ng Azurix assets worldwide.=20
When asked if Saur would be a candidate to take over the Buenos Aires water=
 concession, Ambler said that decision would be left to provincial official=
s afte r Azurix satisfied its claims against the province.=20
Buenos Aires Dispute

In Enron's 2000 annual report, officials said Azurix Buenos Aires lost $11.=
6 million on operating revenue of $89.5 million in the year ended Dec. 31, =
2000.=20
More recent earnings figures for Azurix Buenos Aires are not yet available,=
 Ambler said.=20
Azurix has complained for most of the last two years that provincial offici=
a ls had yet to fulfill their pre-purchase promises to complete important i=
nfrastr ucture projects or allow Azurix Buenos Aires to raise prices to the=
 levels set i n the concession negotiation.=20
In addition, Azurix claims that provincial officials failed to transfer imp=
o rtant assets to Azurix Buenos Aires or pay assorted pre-takeover costs, a=
s stipu lated in the concession agreement.=20
Provincial officials were not immediately available for comment on Azurix's=
 claim and plans to abandon the province. But in the past they have taken a=
n equa lly hard line against the water company, saying the company should l=
ose its conc ession for its alleged failure to modernize and expand the pro=
vince's network of water lines or improve service.=20
To accommodate Azurix's complaints and compensate the company for lost reve=
n ue, in February 2001 the company and provincial officials signed an agree=
ment th at would allow Azurix to raise prices and invest less than the $350=
 million it p romised to spend when it won the water utility, according to =
the company.=20
Unfortunately, those negotiations yielded little, according to Ambler.=20
"The fundamental flaws have yet to be resolved and that's why we are moving=
 ahead to work with officials in the province to revert the concession back=
 to t hem," he said.=20
Argentina has begun the fourth year of a recession that began in mid-1998 a=
n d should last until the second half of 2002 at the very least, according =
to econ omists.=20
Buenos Aires province, where about half Argentina's 37 million people live,=
 is so strapped for cash to pay its bills and loans on time that it has pri=
nted i ts own currency to pay public employees, retirees and government ven=
dors.=20
Several other provinces have followed suit, a trend critics say could in th=
e long run keep consumer prices artificially high and prolong a protracted =
slump in domestic spending, which accounts for 70% of Argentina's $260 bill=
ion gross d omestic product.=20

INDIA: India states may face blackout as Enron unit idles.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

Reuters English News Service=20
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.=20

BOMBAY, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Five Indian states, including two of the most p=
rosperous, face the prospect of a blackout even as U.S. energy giant Enron =
Corp's plant on the west coast lies idle, a senior government official warn=
ed on Friday.=20
"There is every chance of a total grid collapse in the western region, whic=
h means there will be no electricity anywhere - in hospitals, railway track=
s, offices," the official told Reuters.
India's western region, comprising the five states of Maharashtra, Goa, Guj=
arat, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh, consumes an average of around 25,000 =
MW of electricity per day, the most in the country.=20
Maharashtra and Gujarat are two of India's most prosperous states and Bomba=
y, the capital of Maharashtra, is the country's financial capital. Several =
key factories of multinational companies such as the BG Group Plc , Royal D=
utch Shell and Hindustan Lever Ltd are based there.=20
In January this year, the northern grid buckled, plunging most of northern =
India, including the capital New Delhi, into darkness for hours. The offici=
al fears a similar collapse could occur in the western region.=20
Patchy rains in some parts of the western region and maintenance shutdowns =
by thermal plants have affected supplies, the official told Reuters.=20
India's western region has a capacity of 30,548 MW a day of which about 3,0=
00 MW comes from hydro-electric power plants.=20
During peak hours the shortfall is about an average 4,500 MW, and about 2,5=
00 MW during off-peak hours, the official said.=20
"Rainfall this year has been low, particularly in Gujarat and Madhya Prades=
h," he said. "Availability is down as hydro reservoirs have not been able t=
o accumulate water."=20
About 6,000 MW of thermal capacity has also been hit as these plants are sh=
ut for annual maintenance. This has resulted in a generation of 19,000 MW, =
versus a demand of over 22,000 MW, the official said.=20
CRISIS SECTOR=20
"We are in crisis," he said. "Load-shedding to reduce demand has to be done=
 on an hourly basis." Load shedding is cutting off electricity for short pe=
riods in a day, to prevent excess demand from straining the grid.=20
A blackout, the official said, would disrupt industrial production and norm=
al services. It would also turn the spotlight on the country's beleaguered =
power sector, dominated by loss-making state utilities.=20
It could also hasten efforts to end a dispute between Dabhol Power Company =
and the Maharastra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over payment defaults and=
 high tariffs.=20
Enron's 740 MW plant, built by its Indian unit Dabhol Power Company, has be=
en lying idle after its sole buyer, a loss-making state utility, stopped bu=
ying power in June.=20
The official said Dabhol's power would be welcome now, but said they have n=
ot proposed to MSEB that it resume purchases from the plant.=20
Many Indian utilities have little money to invest in new capacity or to buy=
 power from private units, thereby choking private investment. South Korea'=
s Daewoo's Corp, Electricite de France and Cogentrix of the United States h=
ave already exited the country.=20
Demand is growing at the same time. Government estimates show India needs t=
o add around 100,000 MW per day by 2012, but with stagnant capacity, most g=
rids are under pressure during times of peak demand, the official said.

BANGALORE, Sept. 27. THE proposed Vijaynagar power project is headed for tr=

L&T is the shortlisted partner in the 500-MW project along with Karnataka P=

Sources said here that one of the major conditions of L&T for participation=
 in the joint venture is award of the engineering procurement and construct=

ncrease its equity stake in the project.=20
However, KPCL has rejected the conditions put forward by L&T. Instead KPCL =
has indicated that it would abide by the guidelines of the Electricity Regu=

y through the competitive bidding route. This was to ensure compliance with=
 the least cost principle of the ERC. Power producers, the sources said, we=
re expected to comply with these guidelines.=20
Accordingly, one of the alternatives put forward is that L&T should be give=
n the first right of refusal where competitive bidding process was adopted =
for selection of EPC contractors. The sources said, that this proposal was =
also not acceptable to KPCL. Instead, KPCL had suggested that L&T also part=
icipate in the competitive bidding process for the EPC contract. The source=
s said that giving the first right of refusal to L&T would not allow the Vi=
jaynagar project to obtain the benefits of the competitive bidding process,=
 they added. Since none of the proposals were acceptable to KPCL, L&T had s=
ought more time in finalising a decision to participate in the Vijaynagar p=
roject.=20
However, KPCL has already made it clear that it was prepared to implement t=
he project. "We are prepared to implement the project on our own," the sour=
ces said. But any project implementation would have to be done through the =
special purpose vehicle route. This is because the current balance sheet of=
 KPCL is unlikely to allow the company to leverage for the debt funds for t=
he new project.=20
KPCL had originally short listed Powergen International and Enron along wit=
h the L&T as the joint venture partners for the project.=20
But both Enron and Powergen had pulled out of the financial bids, leaving L=
&T as the lone bidder for the power project. The original proposal had envi=
saged a 25 per cent stake for the partner, with 26 per cent with the KPCL a=
nd the remaining equity funds to be raised through the participation of Fin=
ancial Institutions, banks, equipment suppliers and the public.=20
The project cost has already been revised upwards. The new cost per MW is e=
stimated at Rs 4.62 crore. This is in line with the estimates made for two =
of the 1000-MW stations - CLP- Tata, and Nagarjuna Power - proposed in the =
State. The original cost estimate was Rs 2,099 crore or Rs 4.1 crore per MW=
. The revised project cost is now about Rs 2,400 crore. This is to be funde=
d through a 70:30 debt equity ratio implying that the equity component woul=
d comprise about Rs 692 crore.=20
KPCL has also obtained a fuel linkage with Talcher. The coal requirement fo=
r the project is estimated to be in the region of 2.8 million tonnes per an=
num assuming a plant load factor of 80 per cent and a calorific value of 30=
00 kilo calories per kilogram. This coal is to be brought by sea to the new=
ly corporatised port of Ennore and evacuated by the Railways to Vijaynagar.

NEW DELHI, Sept. 27. SHIPPING Corporation of India (SCI) is faced with a Ho=

A meeting of SCI board slated for Friday will have to decide whether to go =
ahead with the project or call it quits. "Both are difficult choices to mak=
e", Government sources told Business Line.
With the lenders to the project led by ANZ Investment Bank declining to rel=
ease the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million out of a total =
loan commitment of $165 million, the project promoters will have to chip in=
 with the remaining project cost for taking possession of the vessel at the=
 scheduled delivery date of November 15.=20
If the promoters sink in the remaining project cost according to their equi=
ty holding, take delivery of the vessel and deploy it elsewhere, it is felt=
 that the viability of the project will not work out due to uncertainty ove=

The SCI-Mitsui-Atlantic Commercial Inc joint venture has signed a time char=
ter party agreement with DPC to charter out LNG Laxmi for a hire rate of $9=
8,600 per day for 10 years to bring gas from Oman for the plant.=20
With the DPC project in trouble, there is a view that the joint venture wil=
l not get $98,600 per day as charter hire even if the vessel is deployed el=
sewhere on spot basis.=20
"Forget about getting $98,600 per day. It is difficult to get $68,900 per d=

Government has invested about Rs 240 billion (US$5 billion) in the corporat=

Offshore lenders to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company today gave it t=
he go-ahead to serve an asset-transfer notice to the Maharashtra State Elec=
tricity Board. This marks the beginning of the last phase of the DPC imbrog=
lio which is expected to culminate in the serving of the final termination =
notice around mid-November.=20
The serving of the asset-transfer notice by DPC will be followed by the val=
uation of its assets. Technically, if MSEB does not contest the notice, it =
will be required to pay $1.86 billion worth of liabilities to the lenders -=
 Enron's investment in the project and the next 20 years' projected return =
on investment. The assets will, of course, be transferred to MSEB.
BA Asia, the facility agent of DPC, sought the permission of the lenders to=
 serve the transfer notice early this week. This was put to vote yesterday =
where the State Bank of India, which has a substantial foreign currency exp=
osure in the 2,184-mw project, opposed the move.=20
"The majority of the foreign lenders voted in favour of the transfer notice=
. The company may serve it over the next few days," said a source in the le=
nding community.=20
Enron holds a 65 per cent stake in DPC, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per=
 cent each and MSEB a 15 per cent stake.=20
"Armed with the lenders' consent, DPC will start the valuation process next=
 month after serving the asset-transfer notice. When the lenders consented =
to serving the preliminary termination notice (PTN) in May, they had refuse=
d to give the go-ahead for the asset-transfer notice," sources said.=20
DPC served PTN on May 19 under Section 17 of the power purchase agreement. =
It was "forced" to resort to this move as the state government and MSEB sho=
wed their unwillingness to "honour their offtake commitments for the entire=
 power station". On April 25, the DPC board authorised Enron India managing=
 director K Wade Cline to take a decision on serving PTN.

Global lenders to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company have warned the U=

consent and have demanded their inclusion in the subsequent discussions.=20
The global lenders, with a direct exposure of about $590 million in the 2,1=

The letter has been written by the steering committee of the global lenders=

The foreign lenders are miffed as the government, so far, had sidelined the=

"We have pointed out to the finance ministry that under the loan covenants,=
 any final solution, like selling the stake of Enron in DPC, will have to b=
e approved by us and have asked them to involve us in future discussions. W=
e have also sought a meeting with senior finance ministry officials to put =
across our point of view," sources in the lenders consortium added.=20
Recently, the Union government mandated the domestic financial institutions=
 to find a solution to the issue.=20
The institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India, had sugg=
ested major sacrifices on the part of Enron and its two US-based partners, =
General Electric and Bechtel, which together hold a 85 per cent stake in th=

The upstream major Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) today ruled out t=
aking over liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and regassification =
facilities of the Dabhol Power Company.=20
"We are not keen on taking over Enron's LNG facility," ONGC chairman and ma=
naging director Subir Raha told reporters here today. As of now, he said, t=
he corporation would like to stick to its core business. The corporation wo=
uld invest Rs 5,000 crore in oil and gas exploration to double its reserve =
base to 12 billion tonne oil equivalent by 2020, he said.
"We have finalised an elaborate plan for enhancing reserve base and product=
ion. We expect to increase oil production by 20 per cent in five to seven y=
ears," Raha said. During the current fiscal, ONGC is targeting 25 million t=
onne oil production.=20
ONGC has planned a two-pronged strategy to increase output from the existin=
g fields by putting the fields on improved oil recovery and enhanced oil re=
covery schemes. Nineteen schemes in 15 fields have been identified for the =
purpose. Of the 19 schemes, 13 projects have been approved which would yiel=
d an additional oil equivalent of more than 61 million tonne in 20 years, t=
he chairman said.=20
Outlining the company's financial performance, Raha said, ONGC made the hig=
hest-ever net profit of Rs 5,229 crore in 2000-01. The company has proposed=
 a dividend of Rs 1,728 crore, which is 110 per cent of equity and also the=
 highest ever dividend paid by any corporate.=20

rethinking the office Say goodbye to the Dilbert cubicle and hello to a new=

gn, stylish layouts and the thing most offices lack: fun. So long to the ol=

A year ago, New York's Museum of Modern Art commissioned Palo Alto, Calif.-=
based IDEO, one of the world's leading industrial design firms, to create a=
 workplace design for the future. IDEO responded with a metaphorical fantas=
y.=20
For an exhibit called Workspheres, the company invented two tools that woul=
d "send a visible personal message to the rest of the office." One was a ch=
air that changes colour; a small, built-in camera takes an image of the sit=
ter's back and reproduces it on the exterior back of the chair, using a liq=
uid-crystal display. The idea was to personalize the object, like draping a=
 jacket over your office chair to indicate possession.
The other "worktool" consisted of a miniature projector showing images of s=
kies. "If you want to change your space," says IDEO designer Craig Syverson=
, "you could dial up the sky of your choice."=20
You won't see either of these fantasies in today's head offices, but the sa=
me principles are at play among the most forward-thinking. IDEO's headquart=
ers, for instance, blur the distinction between home and the office-the ide=
a being that the more comfortable a staff member is in their space, the mor=
e productive.=20
To that end, say hello to Bailey, a friendly mutt who wags his tail and pus=
hes his nose through the wire fence that serves as the door to his enclosur=
e. Bailey's owner, Ana Chang, is an IDEO mechanical engineer, and she keeps=
 Bailey in a disused storage area just behind her workstation. Next door is=
 a black Labrador named Roxy, who belongs to another engineer. And then the=
re are Chang's pet turtles, who live in the aquarium just across the aisle.=
 The nice thing about turtles is that, even when they get excited, they don=
't make any noise.=20
None of this bothers IDEO's management, or their extensive client list, whi=
ch includes Ford, Cisco Systems, Apple and Pepsi. Nobody breaks a sweat whe=
n visitors arrive. After all, what the clients see is a work environment th=
at's at once bohemian and fully functional. In this way, the IDEO space wor=
ks as a perfect promotional tool for the company's services. And it's all b=
y design.=20
For the past 20 years, IDEO has developed office environments in which "any=
thing goes," according to general manager Tom Kelley. Rules are flexible, a=
s long as no one disturbs anyone else.=20
The company has 400 employees globally; in the Palo Alto area, eight separa=
te IDEO locations house about 200 people, with each space designed as the w=
orking equivalent of a neighbourhood. In other, conventional corporations, =
says Kelley, "space is entirely in the hands of the facility manager. Offic=
e space is viewed as a utility." At IDEO, "there's no sense of, 'Well, we'v=
e got to take to what the corporate people give us.'" None of the corporate=
 studios is the same. "We let people create and personalize the spaces they=
 wanted."=20
Given that freedom, one woman has hung dozens of strands of beads over the =
doorway to her workstation. Others suspend patio umbrellas from the ceiling=
 to reduce computer glare from the skylights. To save space, some employees=
 hoist their bicycles overhead on pulleys.=20
Kelley likes to tell the story of two neighbouring workers who wanted to co=
llaborate more closely, so they brought a sledgehammer to the office over a=
 weekend and reduced the drywall between them to rubble. No one said a word=
. "Thank God there was nothing electrical in that part of the wall," says K=
elley.=20
Of course, IDEO also has formal conference rooms, war rooms dedicated to pr=
oject teams in the throes of a deadline, casual public spaces for employees=
 to meet and talk, as well as "enclaves"-the company term for private rooms=
 geared to heads-down concentration.=20
Altogether, it creates what Kelley calls the "greenhouse effect," in which =
the workspace provides all of the basic infrastructure within a nurturing e=
nvironment. "It's about culture and morale but, ultimately, it's about comp=
etitiveness," he says.=20
Potential new employees are always given a tour. "Many of them say, 'This s=
eems like a place where I'd enjoy working.'" Which, of course, is the point=
. "Everybody accepts our offers," says Kelley, "and nobody leaves." He's ex=
aggerating, but IDEO has a churn rate of less than 4% a year.=20
So what looks like chaos isn't. Despite Kelley's claims that there are no r=
ules, IDEO's offices embody a new set of principles that are common to just=
 about every important new office design.=20
You may not find Bailey the dog at other companies, but certain ideas are b=
ecoming universal: a greater interest in the changing nature of work, a wil=
lingness to accommodate shifting demographics in the workforce, and a smoot=
her incorporation of new technologies into buildings. Companies are learnin=
g how to use office space as a competitive tool. The new offices being buil=
t today are, in fact, the offices of the future-designed to last for 10, 15=
, 20 years.=20
Certainly, one change that seems inevitable is that growth will outstrip ex=
pectations. Recent labour statistics show that the number of office workers=
 in North America has increased by 15% since 1981, from roughly 74 million =
to more than 85 million, and is projected to approach 100 million by 2010.=
=20
Offices have become the new factories, whose end products are fresh ideas. =
The old model-squeezing maximum productivity from the largest number of emp=
loyees in the smallest possible space-won't work any more. Across North Ame=
rica, companies that once left the layout and furniture of their offices to=
 lowly facilities managers are now sending their CEOs to meet with the head=
s of the leading office design firms-such as Herman Miller and Steelcase.=
=20
"The work environment is moving up the strategic food chain," says Michael =
Volkema, president and CEO of Holland, Mich.,-based Herman Miller Inc. "And=
 some senior executives are starting to expect their work environment to do=
 more than serve as a production tool."=20
Among Volkema's recent visitors are executive VPs of BMW of North America, =
the CEO of Enron (the Houston-based electricity company) and a delegation f=
rom the Seattle-based biopharmaceutical firm Immunex. "I tell them to think=
 about their space, first and foremost, as a communications tool," he expla=
ins. "Offices make a statement about how employees are expected to work tog=
ether, about the company's vision and aspirations. All of that can be embod=
ied in the physical environment."=20
Volkema also stresses the changing relationship between management and work=
ers. The goal of flattening management hierarchies and improving interactio=
n between staff and bosses isn't new; what's new is using workplace design =
to achieve it. As a result, hierarchical layouts are going out of style. Yo=
u know these well: Step out of an elevator at most Old Economy firms, and y=
ou will see a posh reception area, behind which is an open-style maze of dr=
ab cubicles. The senior management typically hog the corner offices with th=
eir luxurious square footage, doors and windows, and splendiferous views.=
=20
Come the revolution, those barriers won't exist. Just look at the desk of J=
im Mitchell, president of the suburban Toronto-based office designer and eq=
uipment-maker Steelcase Canada Ltd.-it's an open workstation no different f=
rom those of other employees. Mitchell works in the middle of an area that =
was previously a manufacturing floor. To reach his desk, he has to pass thr=
ough rows of employees, and they see him, seated near his CFO and various d=
ivisional vice-presidents, at the centre of an accessible executive hub.=20
"I don't look at my desk and see an 8'x10' area," says Mitchell. "I come in=
 here and say, 'I've got 70,000 square feet. I happen to share it with hund=
reds of people. And I use the space that way.=20
"If you followed me for a day, you'd find that what you call my office, I'd=
 call my process area. This is where I take calls and do computer work, rea=
d and correspond. If I want to write a report without interruption, I can g=
o to an enclosed environment."=20
Mitchell notes that most senior managers are so caught up in their day-to-d=
ay business that they don't give much thought to their workspace. "They loo=
k at it as cost, not as a strategic opportunity." But that's beginning to c=
hange.=20
"A CEO came to me and said, 'I need to change the culture of my company. He=
re's what I see happening today. Teams don't talk to each other, department=
s are remote from each other. It's just taking too long to get things done.=
'"=20
Mitchell's solution is to design spaces to support the process of work. Ste=
elcase uses its open-plan headquarters as a demonstration tool for clients-=
a model of how to reorganize an office.=20
And yes, people collaborate better in open environments. But not every open=
 concept works. The most notorious example is ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day's ma=
keover in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. Management at Chiat eliminated both=
 the private office and the individual cubicle, gave employees a locker for=
 their private belongings, and told them to wander through what looked like=
 a sci-fi movie set. They had to find a different place to sit every day. I=
n a 1994 interview, Jay Chiat said, "We're trying to structure things more =
like a university, rather than like an elementary school. Most businesses a=
re run like elementary schools-you go to work and you only leave your offic=
e to go to the bathroom."=20
All the same, the staff hated it and fled home to work. "It was a really in=
teresting space that was painful to work in," says Tom Kelley of IDEO. In p=
articular, it didn't give the workers a private place to think, and it fail=
ed to acknowledge one of the basic needs of human beings, which is to be te=
rritorial.=20
That lesson hasn't been lost on today's office designers, who recognize tha=
t people want private space-no matter how small. New forms of environments =
have been created, such as enclosed meeting areas or rooms for taking confi=
dential phone calls. But the greater emphasis is on shared spaces. A certai=
n amount of variety is crucial, says Kelley. "It's kind of like Club Med, w=
here the rooms are deliberately spare, practically bleak. That's because th=
e whole Club Med experience doesn't want you to stay in your room. They wan=
t you out at the pool. If you can't afford a lot of private spaces, you nee=
d some other places for the workers to go."=20
Making the most of small spaces has become a new art form for office equipm=
ent designers. Says Mark Harris, media relations director for Toronto-based=
 designer Teknion: "We had a client in Silicon Valley whose workstations we=
re so tiny that they couldn't spare the extra space for a visitor's chair. =
So we invented a new product." It's simply a low-profile file pedestal on w=
heels with a padded seat cushion, and it can be stored under any desk or wo=
rk surface.=20
Meanwhile, it's out with the old coffee klatch in the Xerox room. People ne=
ed better ways to interact, and management needs a place to rub shoulders w=
ith the hoi polloi. This has given way to "back yards" and "front yards"-th=
e common spaces between workstations-plus Zen gardens, on-site fitness cent=
res and rec rooms containing such 21st-century office cliches as video game=
s.=20
Of course, having toys on the premises appeals most to the younger demograp=
hic. Workers in their 20s and 30s are further catered to by new floor plans=
. "The kids at schools today sit around the teacher in circles," says Trish=
 Clarry, a workplace strategist at Steelcase Canada. "They don't sit in nea=
t rows of desks facing the teacher at the front of the room-which is how of=
fices used to be laid out. Gen-Y employees start working together collabora=
tively in teams at school, and they're bringing these new work habits and m=
indset into the workplace."=20
Likewise, workers are being given what Volkema calls "more user control." I=
nstead of the old, cell-like cubicle nested in a "six-pack" or egg-crate co=
nfiguration, the new offices change in shape and landscape. In the past, yo=
u had no choice: The only thing that moved was your chair. Now, you can shi=
ft the walls of your work area, arrange shelves, desktops, chairs, work sur=
faces and storage areas to suit needs and tastes.=20
In offices equipped with the latest wireless or wire-line networks, employe=
es can simply work wherever they please. One example is Steelcase's employe=
e cafeteria, called "The Hub"-a 7,000-square-foot, marche-style food court =
where people eat, socialize and have office-wide meetings. Some staff membe=
rs plug in their laptops, forward calls to their cellphones, and work in a =
sunny spot under a skylight.=20
One of the more radical designs in office furniture is Herman Miller's Reso=
lve system, introduced in 2000. Designer Ayse Birsel looked at honeycombs, =
bubbles and even molecules and found what she calls "nature's favourite ang=
le," which is 120 degrees. Unlike a traditional cubicle's right angles, the=
 divider walls of Resolve open out at 120 degrees, letting in light and air=
. The system consists of a range of components-desk space (which can be adj=
usted for height), filing boxes on wheels, erasable boards, shelving, and s=
o on. Birsel applied fabric screens and graceful canopies to hang over it a=
ll, defining the space and offering a measure of privacy.=20
TransCanada PipeLines' new headquarters in Calgary is the first major Canad=
ian user of Resolve-650 workstations dispersed throughout the corporate hea=
dquarters. The rest of the 5,000 staff now occupy private offices or refurb=
ished workstations, all within one million square feet of a just-completed =
$225-million, 36-storey TransCanada tower in Calgary.=20
When TransCanada merged with Nova Corp. a few years back, Nova had its own =
building (since sold), and TransCanada was split into five locations. "With=
 hindsight," says TransCanada executive vice-president Al Bellstedt, "I sup=
pose we could have squeezed everyone into the old Nova building." What chan=
ged those circumstances was a series of reorganizations, rationalizations, =
selloffs and layoffs.=20
A new building helped smooth the rough edges of the Nova merger. TransCanad=
a wanted to improve morale while fusing two distinct corporate cultures. No=
va had had a much softer public image. Says Al Bellstedt, "it was like G.I.=
 Joe merging with the Care Bears." The old TransCanada executive offices co=
ntained imposing dark-wood panelling; at Nova, they had contemporary art on=
 the walls. "But both were quite opulent," says Bellstedt.=20
Eventually, the new company chose an unusual design-an elongated rectangula=
r shape with more window exposure and a reduced central core. The layout al=
lowed management to reduce the number of enclosed offices. Employees were g=
iven a choice between one of a limited number of standard-sized enclosed of=
fices or a larger, open-concept desk with window views. In the end, 40% wou=
nd up with open-plan workstations.=20
And instead of the traditional top-floor executive department sitting on to=
p of the ant heap, TransCanada executives now occupy the third level, with =
the other employees housed on the floors above them. "It's an optics thing,=
 no more complicated than that," says Bellstedt. It's also an effective sym=
bol of change. TransCanada employees now occupy a space that "doesn't have =
the old company logos," says Bellstedt. "It doesn't look like the old space=
s in either layout or colour. It's fresh and clean. Everything works." Even=
 after a few months, "the effect on morale has been terrific."=20
Meanwhile in Toronto, IBM wanted a new building to consolidate workers from=
 three locations around the city, accommodating a total of 2,500 people. Th=
e older IBM buildings, some dating back to 1970, had proved barely adequate=
 for the company's needs-which included a 10 mbps desktop voice-and-data pi=
pe capable of streaming live video. Not only would it have been incredibly =
expensive to install this in the old facilities, "but it would have been hu=
gely disruptive," says Harold Quinton, director of real estate and site ope=
rations for IBM Canada.=20
And because so much of software development is a product of teamwork, it wa=
s important to bring departments together under one roof. Given the opportu=
nity to start from scratch, IBM began with detailed surveys asking employee=
s what they wanted in a new facility. At the same time, they commissioned T=
oronto interior design firm Marshall Cummings to research how to meet the c=
ompany's long-term needs.=20
The end result, in what will eventually be part of a new town centre in Mar=
kham, Ont., is a campus consisting of low-rise, four-storey buildings, arra=
nged in a four-pod pattern, all linked together by roads. There are three s=
paces between the buildings-called "links." "It's at those points," Quinton=
 says, "that we created different themed oases-a Muskoka-like library, a mi=
ni-South Sea island-to encourage interaction among co-workers."=20
Often, the most productive communication occurs, not in structured environm=
ents, but in informal ones. In the past, such spaces were accidental. As Qu=
inton notes, "they did exist, but in very small and localized areas, in wha=
tever space was left over from an office." Today, they're planned. As well,=
 IBM provided a gym and a day-care centre-a first for the company in Canada=
.=20
And not everything in the office is aggressively high-tech. The company dis=
covered that many of its most youthful employees have a paradoxically conse=
rvative streak. Accordingly, IBM installed a reading room that wouldn't be =
out of place in a 19th-century gentlemen's private club.=20
The new facility factored in a lot of disparate needs, retaining enclosed e=
nvironments because software developers need privacy as much as they need t=
o collaborate in the open.=20
As the project developed, says Quinton, "the need for the quiet space took =
greater importance, so we put more emphasis on acoustics-how to provide bot=
h acoustic privacy and visual privacy. People need to cocoon at times. So l=
ow-level dividers would not be satisfactory. We experimented with different=
 heights, with different structures of walls."=20
IBM hired designers at Teknion to develop a customized workstation. It has =
fairly high dividers, but also a 15" glazed glass panel along the top, to a=
llow natural light from the windows. It comes with a sliding door made with=
 a white-board surface on both sides-if you want people to stay away, write=
 a message on the door.=20
The biggest lesson that Quinton learned was "to be adaptable to the specifi=
c needs of every individual employee." Times have changed: "People are meas=
ured on their productivity, not their face time. The goal is to design a pl=
ace that allows them to be productive, that attracts the brightest and the =
best, and retains them."=20
It's remarkable, the way a new common wisdom develops. All at once, it seem=
s as if everybody in the office design business has started to think alike.=
 And this tendency will certainly have an enormous impact on the $13.3-bill=
ion (U.S.) North American office furniture industry.=20
President and CEO of Herman Miller since 1995, Michael Volkema is trim and =
fit at 45, and could easily pass for someone 10 years younger. Herman Mille=
r employs 10,000 people globally. It was Volkema's decision to move the fir=
m's executive offices to the "design yard" in Holland, Mich., which houses =
the company's creative and development arms. The yard is a rustic, farmlike=
 complex, complete with round, silo-like structures. Colonial windows look =
out over a pond, and there's a beekeeping area on the premises.=20
The leadership team, which had been dispersed across several locations in M=
ichigan, were brought here in early 2000. In the past, says Volkema, there =
had been dry periods in the creative life of the company, and he believes "=
that wouldn't have happened if our leaders were sitting right on top of the=
 development process." He also wanted to have a living demonstration "of ou=
r team space." Customers are suitably impressed.=20
Herman Miller was founded in 1923 by D.J. DePree. Formerly the Star Furnitu=
re Company, it was renamed after DePree's father-in-law, who became the chi=
ef shareholder in the new company. Herman Miller achieved international pro=
minence through its association with the husband-and-wife industrial design=
ers Charles and Ray Eames (the Eames lounge chair, etc.), who worked for th=
e company from 1946 to 1978.=20
For Volkema, the future success of the company depends upon a correct readi=
ng of how the workplace will evolve. "In a nutshell," he says, "we are goin=
g to see a new social dynamic."=20
Volkema recalls a session with management guru Peter Drucker a few years ag=
o. ("We just listened to him talk for three days," Volkema notes. "It was o=
ne of those times when you realize that God gave somebody else a lot more m=
arbles to play with than you.") Drucker reminded the company's executives t=
hat every developed country will hit a crisis-a competition for the best av=
ailable knowledge workers.=20
To successfully compete for talent, even in a softening economy, Volkema no=
tes that "more and more employers will have to satisfy the wants and needs =
of the people who show up for work, or they're not going to want to work fo=
r you.=20
"We'll have to create work environments that don't feel like production fac=
ilities. They'll have a radical, much more residential flavour. There will =
be much more ability to do all of the other things that you do in your pers=
onal life, which will complement your work life."=20
It will be "a village," he says, "where people will want to live and work. =
The work experience will be more like being a part of a community."=20
So say goodbye to the ranks of unhappy souls rattling the chains that bind =
them to their desks. So long to the idea of a business as a clerical factor=
y.=20
All you need is a little window space, and a very big sledgehammer.


PGNiG Board Ratify Norwegian Gas Deal

The Supervisory Board of the Polish Oil and Gas (PGNiG) has ratified the co=
ntract for the supply of Norwegian gas to Poland. The "take or pay" contrac=
t for the supply of 74bln cubic metres was signed on 3 September. Meanwhile=
 experts claim that in 2010 Poland will be over-supplied in gas, with 25bn =
cubic metres of supply and an estimated 18.4bn cubic metres demand. Enron P=
oland president Jacek Astramowicz said: "I do not know the terms of the Nor=
wegian or Danish contracts. They should, however, be flexible when it comes=
 to the minimum amount bought." The alternatives are either to boost domest=
ic consumption, which would entail huge investments running into billions o=
f dollars (eg. replacing coal powered power stations with gas powered ones)=
 or cutting down on domestic production. The latter is also a costly and da=
ngerous option, since domestically produced gas is cheaper and dangerous, s=
ince extracting below a certain level may cause irreparable damage to field=
