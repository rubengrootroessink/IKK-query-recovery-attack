This is confidential information, once we have enough entries we will 
produce a placement report that will reflect aggregate salary information 
for current students and graduates of the evening program.  The reason we 
have not been able to release an Evening MBA placement report is due to the 
low number of students that have entered their data.  We need enough 
reports in order to protect confidentiality.

Please take a minute and do your part.  Thanks--John
