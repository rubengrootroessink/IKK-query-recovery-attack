Jim,

We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are:

1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story.
2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.  If our contract language ends up protecting us further, all the better, but I would prefer that not to be our last resort.
