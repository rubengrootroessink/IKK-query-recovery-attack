Costs</font></b>

<p>&nbsp;By Jessica Berthold
<p>&nbsp;Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
<p>&nbsp;(This article was originally published Thursday.)
<p>&nbsp;LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A California Senate committee will
<br>&nbsp;depose former board members and managers of the state's wholesale
<br>&nbsp;power market operator next week as part of an investigation into
<br>&nbsp;whether those officials collaborated with suppliers to increase
electricity
<br>&nbsp;prices in the state, the committee's chairman said.
<p>&nbsp;The investigation by the Senate Select Committee To Investigate
Price
<br>&nbsp;Manipulation centers on an emergency request filed with federal
<br>&nbsp;regulators last December to lift a $250 per megawatt-hour price
cap on
<br>&nbsp;the market run by the California Independent System Operator.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Federal Energy
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regulatory Commission
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
agreed to lift the cap three
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
hours after receiving the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
request, which was filed by
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ISO Chief Executive Terry

Winter.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Committee Chairman Sen. Joe
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wednesday the price cap was
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the state's "last line of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
defense" against runaway
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
wholesale electricity prices.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Within three days of the cap's
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
being lifted, wholesale prices
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
had nearly tripled to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
$700/MWh, the beginning of
<br>&nbsp;months of extremely high prices that marked the worst of the
state's
<br>&nbsp;electricity crisis, he said.
<p>&nbsp;Winter, who remains in his post, has said he acted quickly on
his own
<br>&nbsp;initiative to do what was necessary to keep power flowing to
the state.
<p>&nbsp;But Dunn, whose committee began serving 16 subpoenas this week,
<br>&nbsp;said the length and complexity of Winter's 50-page filing doesn't
jibe
<br>&nbsp;with Winter's claim that he acted alone and at the last minute
in making
<br>&nbsp;the request.
<p>&nbsp;"We're trying to determine who he was working with that led to
the
<br>&nbsp;filing and whether there was generator involvement," Dunn said.
"It also
<br>&nbsp;doesn't seem right that Winter, who owes his employment to the
board,
<br>&nbsp;would run around them."
<p>&nbsp;The former 26-member ISO board was a mish-mash of generators and
<br>&nbsp;other industry "stakeholders", as well as consumer advocates
and
<br>&nbsp;representatives of municipal utilities. Gov. Gray Davis replaced
that
<br>&nbsp;board in January with five members pointedly chosen for their
lack of
<br>&nbsp;affiliation with ISO market participants. The political nature
of those
<br>&nbsp;appointments, however, has called into question the board's
<br>&nbsp;independence, an issue now being examined by FERC.
<p>&nbsp;Board Members Say They Weren't Notified
<p>&nbsp;Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who is the only current board
<br>&nbsp;member to have served on the old board, said he had no knowledge
of
<br>&nbsp;Winter's FERC filing.
<p>&nbsp;"I was surprised that something that monumental was done without
<br>&nbsp;being consulted," said Florio, who received a subpoena Wednesday.
"I
<br>&nbsp;could see the decision to file being made at the last minute,
but
<br>&nbsp;obviously someone had to do the preparation work, and while that
was
<br>&nbsp;being done there would have been time for consultation."
<p>&nbsp;Florio said that, at that time, the board was polarized on the
issue of
<br>&nbsp;price caps, with those representing generators and large businesses
<br>&nbsp;against them, and municipal utilities and residential customers
for
<br>&nbsp;them.
<p>&nbsp;Jan Smutny-Jones, a former board member and president of the
<br>&nbsp;Independent Energy Producers Association, a generators' group,
also
<br>&nbsp;said he didn't know in advance about Winter's filing.
<p>&nbsp;"Board members were not consulted, regardless of their status
in the
<br>&nbsp;marketplace," said Smutny-Jones, who received his subpoena Tuesday.
<br>&nbsp;"I understand why (Winter) made the filing. He's the CEO of the
ISO,
<br>&nbsp;and he has that authority. In November and December the market
was
<br>&nbsp;collapsing rapidly, and the board was politicized to the point
of
<br>&nbsp;dysfunction. He did what he thought he needed to do."
<p>&nbsp;ISO spokesman Greg Fishman said Winter "absolutely did not" collude
<br>&nbsp;with generators, and said the move to lift the cap actually helped
<br>&nbsp;control prices paid by the ISO, which is responsible for keeping
the
<br>&nbsp;lights on in the state.
<p>&nbsp;Rather than limit prices, the caps simply drove suppliers into
uncapped
<br>&nbsp;markets outside the state, Fishman said. The ISO then had to
buy back
<br>&nbsp;that out-of-market power at uncapped prices.
<p>&nbsp;"The official market price on Dec. 6 was $250 a megawatt-hour,
but the
<br>&nbsp;price for us was really $506 a megawatt-hour," Fishman said.
<br>&nbsp;"In-market prices did spike after the December 8 order for a
few days,
<br>&nbsp;but after the spike they went down under $200 a megawatt-hour.
The
<br>&nbsp;order also gave us the ability to ask suppliers to justify their
bids. It
<br>&nbsp;essentially brought them under our umbrella."
<p>&nbsp;The subpoenas request e-mail, telephone, travel and meeting records,
<br>&nbsp;among other items. Further subpoenas may be issued, Dunn said.
