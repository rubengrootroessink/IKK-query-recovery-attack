Join Ford Motor Company for an informal pre-game BBQ this Saturday,
September 8.  Come meet representatives from diverse functions including IT,
Finance, Manufacturing Leadership and Engineering and see select products
from our stable of automotive brands:  Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda, Volvo,
Jaguar, Land Rover and Austin Martin.  With our new offices for the Premier
Automotive Group in Irvine, California and our numerous e-business and joint
venture initiatives, our opportunities continue to grow throughout the
country and the world as we expand in emerging markets such as China, India,
Russia and Southeast Asia.

This is a casual event to kick-off the 2001-2002 academic year and celebrate
the continued close relationship between the Haas School of Business and
Ford Motor Company, so stop by, see some cars and grab some food & drink.

Time:  Noon, prior to the 2:30 kick-off
Location:  Haas Courtyard

If you are unable to attend and would like to learn more about opportunities
