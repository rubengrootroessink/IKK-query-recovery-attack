Good morning committee members,

Dr. Barkovich asked that I pass this on...

Please note:  A significant concern is that PG&E is not dropping the
filed rate doctrine lawsuit. If it wins, it will be able to recover all
of its expenses for customers when it wants.  While it says it will
attempt to recover over a long enough period to avoid rate increases,
and presumably from all customers, the CPUC could change this and
recover only from large customers (e.g. to please Burton) and with rate
increases.

I think SVMG should seriously consider not supporting unless the law
suits are dropped.   Barbara
