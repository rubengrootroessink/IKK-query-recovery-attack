Dear Jeffrey:

As you may know, Congressman Dick Gephardt will be our Keynote Speaker at
our Annual Luncheon this year.

As one of our key community partners, it is my hope that you might consider
joining us at this year's Luncheon as a Table Sponsor.

This year's lunch is scheduled for Friday, October 26, at the San Jose
Fairmont Hotel, from 12 noon until 1:40pm.  As a Table Sponsor, you would
receive ten tickets to the lunch, recognition in the program, and an
invitation to join SVMG Member Company CEO's for a private, one-hour, closed
door conversation with Minority Leader Gephardt immediately preceeding the
lunch (11am until 12 noon).  The cost for a Table Sponsorship is $1,500.  It
would be an honor to have you join us.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you soon,
and appreciate your support.

Warm Wishes,

Carl Guardino
President and CEO
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group
