I wanted send you all a short note to congratulate you on the completion of 
the program!!!  Plus, I wanted to remind you that you have full access to 
the career center forever and my services for the next 6 months.  After 
that you can continue to use my services, although $ is involved.  The fee 
for alumni is $150 for three sessions.  If you are being challenged in the 
job market or need some perspective on getting hired, we can have an 
initial session for free and after that if we both decide to go further I 
will need to charge.

In the interest of adding value to the Haas brand, just an FYI this May I 
will be completing an 8 month program on Personal Performance Coaching from 
the Hudson Institute in Santa Barbara.  If you feel the need for fine 
tuning your new area of knowledge or competency and want some assistance 
finding or applying the fit in your career, let me know if I can help.

For those of you I have had the pleasure of working with thank you for the 
opportunity, it has truly been a great learning experience for me and 
hopefully for you as well.  Some parting thoughts:

IF WE DON''T

CREATE OUR OWN

FUTURE, SOMEONE

ELSE WILL FIT US

INTO THEIRS
