There is no suitor-in-waiting for Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20
Despite a speculation-filled week, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK=
A:NYSE - news - commentary) probably isn't waiting in the wings to gobble u=
p the troubled energy giant. The risk profile doesn't fit Royal Dutch Shell=
 (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) , and it's unlikely General Electric (GE:NYS=
E - news - commentary) is ready to jump at the chance to rescue the Houston=
 energy firm from its troubles with the SEC and disgruntled investors. ?And=
 while the recent slide in Enron's stock price might seem to make it an att=
ractive target, it's implausible that an Enron competitor would step up to =
the plate and make an offer to acquire its troubled peer. ?"We do not belie=
ve there is a high probability of a bailout offer at a price significantly =
above the current price, as there is too much uncertainty about the capital=
 structure and shareholder lawsuits," says Jeff Dietert, independent power =
analyst at Simmons & Co., a Houston energy investment firm and a member of =
the TSC Energy Roundtable. ?Many metrics suggest the stock is inexpensive. =
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey recently calculated Enron's asset value=
 to be between $16 and $24 per share, which may make Enron's current price =
of less than $12 look cheap. But in nearly the same breath, Eassey downgrad=
ed Enron stock to neutral from "accumulate." Merrill Lynch has provided ban=
king services for Enron. ?"While we have not altered our view of Enron's fu=
ndamentals or its ability to weather this long-term storm, from a practical=
 standpoint we believe noise surrounding the SEC's move to a formal investi=
gation will outweigh any [earnings] analysis or net asset value calculation=
," Eassey told clients in a report Thursday. ?For Buffett: Intriguing But .=
..?Reports that famed value investor Warren Buffett is looking at Enron may=
 be correct. He is an opportunistic investor and has an interest in the pow=
er business. And, Berkshire's ownership of Mid-American Energy provides a p=
latform for an Enron deal. ?However, interest and action are two different =
things. While Buffett has said he wants additional power holdings, he seems=
 more focused on the traditional, regulated utilities rather than the more =
aggressive opportunities represented by Enron. Buffett's track record shows=
 he craves certainty and that is something Enron can't provide, especially =
now. ?There are also pragmatic issues. If Enron considered a deal, it would=
 have to be one that was both rich and immediate, something Buffett can't o=
ffer. Constrained by the Public Utility Holding Company Act, or PUHCA, Berk=
shire might not be able to purchase Enron until the sale of Portland Genera=
l, the Oregon utility, is completed sometime next year. ?The Enron culture =
could also keep Buffett away. Enron is well known for its employee stock op=
tion program that made millions of dollars for people like ex-CEO Jeffrey S=
killing while creating little value for shareholders. Buffett is a tireless=
 critic of such shenanigans. Buffett also generally looks for companies wit=
h a management team committed to remaining in place, and Ken Lay has no des=
ire to remain at the helm of Enron for the long haul, and future leadership=
 is uncertain. ?And while Buffett still may take a look, price could be the=
 ultimate stumbling block. "I think he understands the derivative trading b=
usiness better than most," says Robert Hagstrom, portfolio manager of the L=
egg Mason Focus Trust and author of The Essential Buffett: Timeless Princip=
les for the New Economy. "I wouldn't be surprised if it's caught his eye, b=
ut I don't think he would get his price. He won't pay a premium for Enron."=
 ?As for Buffett, he won't comment on anything, let alone rumors like this.=
 ?Shell: Burned Out on Gas??Another rumored suitor is Royal Dutch Shell (RD=
:NYSE - news - commentary) . Speculation has escalated to the point of sugg=
esting that Shell and Enron have signed a confidentiality agreement to allo=
w for exchange of privileged financial data. ?A Shell spokeswoman in London=
 would not comment on the speculation. An Enron spokesman also declined to =
comment. ?Shell wants to expand its gas business and in its bid for Barrett=
 Resources, showed it will pay a premium for the right assets. ?But Enron i=
s more an energy trading company than an exploration and production company=
. Shell's problems growing both its Coral trading subsidiary and its Tejas =
Gas unit -- a costly acquisition -- probably would make it shy away from go=
ing there again, Dietert says. ?Shell and Enron are very different companie=
s, he adds. "Culturally, it's a tough deal to imagine." ?GE Capital: Enligh=
tened Investor??The final name bandied about is GE Capital. This one is mor=
e difficult to figure, but an investment in Enron by the finance unit of Ge=
neral Electric isn't out of the question. However, sources tell me an outri=
ght bid is unlikely. ?"They are a potential investor," says Dietert. "If pu=
sh comes to shove, Enron would be willing to issue 30% to 40% more equity r=
ather than face bankruptcy. And, GE Capital could participate in such a dea=
l." ?However, any move is just speculation at this point. And General Elect=
ric won't comment on speculation. ?Even if an offer for Enron emerged, pric=
e would clearly be an issue. Current uncertainty suggests any offer would b=
e well below a price Enron would consider reasonable. Hence, while a bid fo=
r Enron isn't out of the question, it's likely Enron will stand to fight it=
s current battles alone. ???BANDWIDTH BEAT: Playing '20 Questions' With Enr=

ter? If the answer to that question is yes, what will Enron's shareholders =
(and their class-action lawsuit attorneys) have to say about it? ?A related=
 category might be geography. Start with an easy one: In what body of water=
 are the Cayman Islands located? ?Then move to more interesting questions. =
Why were the two LJM private investment partnerships located in the Caymans=
? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the Caymans are a tax-free=

strict confidentiality laws governing business transactions there? ?The nex=

nron Chairman Ken Lay give to George W. Bush's presidential campaign fund? =
(That one is easy because, by law, the limit is $1,000 per person for hard =
money contributions.) ?How much soft money did Lay and Enron each give to t=
he Republican Party during the 1999-2000 campaign cycle? ?How much did Lay =
give to Bush's presidential primary campaign fund? (That one is more diffic=
ult. Bush decided not to accept government matching funds for his primary c=
ampaign, so there wasn't any limit on individual contributions.) ?How much =
money did Ken Lay help raise for Bush's presidential primary campaign? (Her=
e's a hint: He was a member of the Bush Pioneers, each of whom pledged to r=
aise at least $100,000 for the fund.) ?Still in the politics category, how =
much will those campaign contributions affect the current SEC investigation=
 of Enron? (That's another easy one. All contributors to political campaign=
s will tell you that they expect nothing in return.) ?Now for the history c=
ategory. In an April conference call with analysts, who was the analyst who=

 ?What expletive did Enron's former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling call the =
analyst? (Here's a hint: In reporting the name-calling incident, a radio ne=

 Skilling said the analyst was a "short-seller." That means the analyst had=
