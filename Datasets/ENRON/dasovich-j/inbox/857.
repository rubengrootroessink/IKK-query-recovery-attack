Re:        Letter to Governor Davis asking him to consider CMTA's
proposals

CMTA released at both the Governor's Economic Summit and an Assembly
informational hearing last week its three proposals that will empower
manufacturers to grow and create new jobs.

Please go to: http://www.cmta.net/turning_california_around/index.shtml
to see the proposals and download a sample letter to send to Governor
Gray Davis and your local legislator, asking them to seriously consider
these investments in California that will keep and grow jobs and produce

more revenue for the state.  Also fax us a copy of your letter at
916-447-9401
or e-mail at gdicaro@cmta.net.

We need as many letters as possible, so please pass along.

Thank You.
