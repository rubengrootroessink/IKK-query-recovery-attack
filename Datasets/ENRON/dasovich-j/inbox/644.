yes, they already told Dan Douglas they would sign a stipulation that
replaced the MOU wit the Edison-CPUC settlement.  That is more than doable.
Dan is drafting the new stipulation now.  The stipulation commits SCE to pay
once the conditions precedent are met:  1. implementation of the settlement,
and 2. approval of the advice letter on prospective calculation of the
generation credit.  Our only current beef with that is that they exclude the
DWR charges.  Mike

Any reason in particular that you're of this view?  (I'm hoping you'll
say that Edison's informed you that it might be doable.)
