Probably no need to reiterate here (it just makes me feel better), but the =
date of the bill signing or September 1 is MUCH MUCH preferable to EES. We =
have substantial contracts that we executed at the end of August.

?=09On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out=
 of the appropriations committee.
?=09The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full A=
ssembly for passage.
?=09Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bil=
l should look like.
?=09The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tue=
sday.
?=09In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroacti=
vely end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday t=
o include its own "date certain" for the temporary suspension of Direct Acc=
ess.
?=09The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.
?=09We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to eit=
her 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1.
?=09We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's stat=
us and our progress in changing the suspension date.

Best,
Jeff

?=09The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78)=
 out of the Appropriations Committee today.
?=09If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill=
 passed out of the full Assembly today.
?=09It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
?=09If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the b=
ill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even mor=
e remote.
?=09That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed ou=
t of both houses for his signature.
?=09Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff
