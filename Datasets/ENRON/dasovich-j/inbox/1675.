I think we missed each other.  I want to delay, move slowly, because in my
view that gives us a better argument that there was no notice for exit fees.
I also think we may be better off litigating the question under ABX1.  Can't
recall which section now, but the deal provides that the relationship is
between CDWR and the end user.  And the end user has a legal obligation to
pay for it upon "DELIVERY".  If it's never delivered, the law does not
impose an obligation.  And, I would argue, if the legislature had wanted to
impose and exit fee that was in conflict with the clear terms of the bill,
they could have.  Now, that may not hold water in next session, but at least
it makes sure Sacramento picks up the issue.
 
Let's discuss if this isn't clear.  I just don't want to rush to a "deal."
 
Best regards,
 
Evie

Agreed.  We're trying to go quickly.  So if it looks like there's something
to it, we're going to move quickly.  Could you share what you're big three
issues are so that I'm sure that they get on the table tomorrow.  Hope to
cross paths soon.
 
Best,
Jeff

Definitely.  I'm very interested.  I'm concerned, however, about timing.
The longer this is left unsettled, the greater the "no notice" argument.

Shame.  We'll have to muddle through without you.  If something gets going,
you interested?

Jeff:
 
My schedule has changed, and I'll be there Thursday but not Friday.  I don't
know whether Mike will be there...he's been elusive since session ended.
 
See you Thursday.
 
Evie

Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the
PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've
helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and
Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are
organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable"
deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be
submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many
costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time
determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3)
PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for
a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less
productive ify ou're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that
permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the
Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
Jeff
