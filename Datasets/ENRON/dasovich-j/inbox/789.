The 13th would work much better, preferably in the afternoon.  Please contact Lydia Cannon (713-853-4893) to get a specific time on my calendar.  Also, any specific Perfect company information beforehand would be helpful.

Thanks,
Brad

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff
