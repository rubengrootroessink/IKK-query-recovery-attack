FYI

I asked Steve to compare the information from Sue's email re the CPUC estimate of DA load to Enron's forecast of retail load.  His response is below.

Wanda,

Given the current state of our systems, it is not possible to tell with precision which of the categories below all of our customers fall into.  For example, in the current position report the largest volumes by far in Calif appear in the rate class labelled "?".

Still, we have a total volume for 2002 of 8,331,762 MWH, or about 83% of the total reported.  Not bad.  Also, it appears from my quick review of the categorical breakout that our volumes are weighted towards the Commercial and Industrial customers, which indicates that we likely own > 90% of those volumes.  Let me know if you have any other questions.
