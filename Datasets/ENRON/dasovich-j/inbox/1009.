Hi Evening MBA students,

Textbooks and readers will be available to 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd- year 
students the first few weeks of classes (starting January 22) in the 
Evening MBA Program office:

Monday-Thursday 9:00 a.m.- 9:00 p.m.
Friday 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m..

It is possible that we may get the shipment of books the week before 
(January 14-18) and we'll let you know if you can pick them up early.

Thanks,
TJ
