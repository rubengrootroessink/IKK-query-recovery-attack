Steve and Sal:

This affirms what we heard from SCE today at the end of the meeting.  Diane Grant indicated she hadn't heard of any problmes form ESPs.  This note says that we were told there was a cutoff and that's that. We are going to go ahead and submit the complete information to SCE and the other two utilities by this Friday as we agreed in the meeting today.

Evan, I received a call from our ESP rep today informing us that SCE will reject all future DASR's that were not on the list you sent to them last week.  I reminded him that the PUC, UDC's and ESP's are meeting today in San Francisco to hash out these issues.   His reply, Until they are directed by the PUC to accept future DASR's on existing contracts, they will reject our DASR's.
