Tom --

There does appear to be some intelligence gathering going on at the CPUC.  You should speak with legal about the inquiry.  Clearly the CPUC has a right to ask anything they want - it is my understanding is that our customers have a confidentiality clause in their contract that prohibits them from responding.

Jim, et al,

Interesting e-mail from UC.  Apparently the PUC is implying to UC that DASRs
submitted after July 1 need to be associated with a contract executed prior
to July 1.  Is this consistent with our intell?  Can they make these
inquiries?  Please advise.

Tom
