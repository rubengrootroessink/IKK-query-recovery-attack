I reviewed the document and it seems fairly accurate.  I have a slight disa=
greement with one statement, as follows: "The Commission's reference to "su=
rcharge" can be interpreted to mean both the one cent and three cent surcha=
rges given that both surcharges were granted similar treatment in D.01-03-0=
82."  I don't agree that this is so black and white.  One can also take the=
 interpretation that it was meant to apply only to the 3 cent and not to th=
e 1 cent surcharge.  Obviously, SCE took the former interpretation and PG&E=
 the latter.  That is one reason why we have been very careful about attack=
ing this issue.   AReM has protested PG&E charging the one cent surcharge a=
nd supported Edison's approach in responding to the advice letters filed mo=
nths ago.  AReM continues to work with the CPUC staff to get the staff to s=
upport AReM when it responds to the advice letters.  Be aware that there ar=
e strong forces working against ESPs and anything potentially favorable to =
them. The more we can accomplish this under the radar screen, the better of=
f we will be. Commissioner Wood is still attacking retroactivity and many h=
ave raised the "cost shifting" issue.  In other words, we can still lose th=
e 3 cent exclusion.  We have to be careful how we proceed.
