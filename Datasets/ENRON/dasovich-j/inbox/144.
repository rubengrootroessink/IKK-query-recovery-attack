Topic:          The Window Cracks Open: IPOs in the 2001 Market

Stephen R. Wong, CEO, President & Co-Founder, Embarcadero Technologies, Raj 
P. Sabhlok, Sr VP, Finance & Development, Embarcadero Technologies.

What is the health of the public markets today?  Is it possible for young 
companies to go public in this environment?  It is no secret that we are in 
the midst of a severe contraction in start-up funding.  Venture capitalists 
are reserving cash to support their existing portfolio and to invest in 
later round financings.  When will this situation free up?  Will a revived 
public market make start-up financing more available?

Our September 20th U.C. Berkeley Entrepreneurs Forum will feature an expert 
in the current IPO market and the CEO and VP of Finance of a firm that has 
recently completed the IPO process.
