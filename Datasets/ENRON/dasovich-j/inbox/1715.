Jeff,

Jim and I spoke today about having Enron participate separately in this proceeding -- responding to the utilities' plans to be filed today. I believe that AReM will take a strong position and will incorporate any comments we have.  I don't see anything we can gain by paying for a separate filing under Enron's name.  Jim agreed.  Jim asked that you call him if you have major concerns with this approach.

Sue
