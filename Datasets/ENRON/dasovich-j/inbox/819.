Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight. I have a car and will talk to you enroute to Sacremento.  I am staying and meeting with SMUD at 11:30 - 1:00 and then probably meeting with PG&E on tues at 3:30.  I will either leave for Houston tues night or weds a.m. pending any possible meeting with SocalEd in L.A.  If we cannot meet with them this week, then I may reconsider that trip for next week. 

Thanks, BT
