Dear Mr. Dasovich:

I am looking for a position in the Bay area as my wife will begin teaching at the Goldman School of Public Policy in January.  Cecille Cabacungan from GSPP suggested that I contact you.

Currently, I am with Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm.  While I enjoy my work with Mercer, the timing of transfers to our San Francisco office is uncertain.  Mercer, however, has two programs through which I could move to the Bay area.   

The first is an externship program through which I could consult to a company for 6 - 12 months, or longer.  As my attached resume reflects, I have several years of experience developing business plans and assessing market conditions.  

The second is a fellowship program through which I could consult to a non-profit organization for up to 12 months at a small fraction of Mercer's standard fees.  I am particularly interested in organizations that work on economic development issues, but would be happy to help a range of organizations develop and implement their long-term strategic goals.  Specific types of work I could perform include:

*	Assessing market size and growth opportunities, e.g., utility/profitability of new services or products
*	Managing co-operative efforts with other institutions, e.g., pooling resources to increase leverage and efficiency of operations
*	Benchmarking and redistributing resources to focus on highest impact areas

I would like to learn whether you think Enron could benefit from my services or know of a corporation or non-profit that could.  I am arranging interviews for the first week of December, and would greatly appreciate talking to you before then to hear of any suggestions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,


Angelo Del Priore
