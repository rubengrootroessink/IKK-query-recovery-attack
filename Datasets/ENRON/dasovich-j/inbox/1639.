Subject: Today's FERC Filing for WPTF


Attached is a copy of today's FERC filing that advocates adoption of a circuit breaker price for the coming winter, as opposed to the existing price cap mechanism.  As you know, we usually circulate these filings in draft form so that funders can see and provide comments in advance.  I was under the mistaken impression that this filing was only to be reviewed by Gary Ackerman, so he was the only recipient of the earlier drafts and the attached copy bears all of his input and suggestions.  My apologies for not circulating it more broadly, as we normally do.
