A Brave New Idea
These are turbulent times. Turbulent in a different way than in
economic cycles of the past - there's more to it this time around.
What's worked in the past won't necessarily work going forward.
And since history tells us that the best time to invest is while
market sentiment is still down, it is crucial now more than ever
to have the right investment guide. So when the market moves, you
won't get left behind.

The Marketocracy m100 Index tracks the knowledge and strategies
of some of the world's best investors. How?  By accessing the
track records of over 50,000 investors and constantly choosing
the best stock pickers to listen to. Never before has the
investment performance of so many been so accurately measured.
Want to benefit from their stock-picking abilities?

See For Yourself - m100 Journal Free Trial
We want to give you access to the ultimate investment tool: our
m100 Journal. The m100 Journal provides timely knowledge every
week of what many of the world's best investors are doing right
now - not last quarter, or 6 months ago - including the top buys,
sells, holdings, tips, and commentary of the m100 Index.  If you
want to look over the shoulders and benefit from some of  the
best, simply hit "reply" to this email, and we will send you 4
free issues of the m100 Journal, delivered to you weekly via an
emailed PDF attachment.
