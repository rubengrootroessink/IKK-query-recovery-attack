Jeff--I have to run to a meeting, but am hoping to catch up with you in an hour or two....I am putting together some talking points for Ken Lay for a gov meeting this Thrusday(Roland/Hull/McCallum/Engler/Johnson) and they want a brief update on what's cooking in California.  I recognize that you're crazy busy but hope you can give me a bit of guidance.

I'll call you in awhile
