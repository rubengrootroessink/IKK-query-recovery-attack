Welcome back EvMBAs. Hopefully you've all acclimated after a couple of weeks or more of classes. To the first years:  Rumors of students voted off in Weakest Link style with Diane stepping in as Anne Robinson, are simply unfounded, or are they . . . ?  I am a 2nd year student, as well as hopefully your ever so resourceful Career Center liaison. What this translates to is the following:  I work with John Morel, Associate Director of the Career Center and the EvMBA and Alumni Career Advisor to serve your career-related needs. Of course, there is one caveat:  I get first dibs on job postings.

Anyway, thanks to feedback from you last year, I've prepared a charter with which to drive my initiatives this academic year. 

1. Resume directories. Although there are no plans in the near future to produce an exclusive EvMBA resume book, there are several student MBA clubs that are gearing up for their releases and welcome inclusions from EvMBA students. I'm unsure of all the fees and some do require that you are or become a member. E-mail me back if you would like a list of groups with contacts offering resume books. 

2. Networking events (on-campus and off-site).  I will be working with the account managers from the Recruitment Center as well as other members of the EVMBA Association in arranging company presentations, alumni speakers addressing particular career fields, in addition to co-sponsored events w/full time MBAs this upcoming year. Contact me if you have any ideas. 

3. On-campus recruitment. Just a reminder that you are only eligible for on-campus recruitment the academic year in which you graduate.  In other words, if you are planning to graduate in December 2002 or May 2003, you are eligible to participate starting Fall 2002. Of course, that's not to say that you cannot tap into the resources of the Career Center (including John's time) at anytime of your 3-year stay at Haas. 

4. Career-related seminars.  In the near future, John will offer forums pertaining to strategies on getting promoted or transferred, life/work/school balance, a panel of headhunters, during the break seminars on resume updates, interview coaching, salary negotiations and networking strategies. 

Furthermore, you should have received in your mail box in the MBA Lounge last week a list of events from the Managing Your Career Workshop Series, which deals with career exploration in investment banking and consulting and interview preparation, just to name a few.  These are mainly targeting the full-time students and you are encouraged to attend if you calendar permits. 

NOTE:  Unlike previous years, you will have to log on to Bear Tracks (http://web.haas.berkeley.edu/intranet/) to RSVP these seminars. If you were not available to attend BearTracks training this week (log in using your student ID and the password is the word password), directions can also be found in the Career Center.   Speaking of which, I'll have a table in the Bank of America forum during our breaks on Sep. 11, 12 and 13, during which this handout will be available, as well as all sorts of other career info. Also, I'll be there to answer questions or discuss ideas you might have. 

 5. Other useful tidbits.  

 - Don't forget to report placement information if you have recently been promoted or changed jobs, either internally or externally.  Again report this information on the EveMBA placement form in BearTracks.

- Subscribe to alumnijobs@haas on majordomo to receive weekly emails of job opportunities sent by companies or fellow alumni interesting in hiring not only alumni, but also experienced EvMBA students.  


Here's how:

  i. Send an email to majordomo@haas.berkeley.edu.

 ii. Leave subject line blank.

 iii. In the message area, type "subscribe alumnijobs@haas"

 iv. Send your message.

 - I'll be scheduling a couple of brown bag sessions in the fall to solicit additional input on a few of these topics. The next brown bag will be either Tuesday, Oct. 9 or the following day on Oct. 10. As usual, grub and drinks as well as free access to John's minibar are offered as an enticement.

 Have a great year and see you soon,

 Albert Demery
