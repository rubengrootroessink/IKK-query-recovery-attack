Paul, Jeff:

I got on the IEP Board distribution list (Parquet is also on it).  Are there any actions we need to take with our Sacto lobbiests that I can help with?

Alan

Dear IEP Board Member,

During the December 13th IEP Board Planning Meeting, a special session for
Board Members and your contract Lobbyist is being planned.  This special
session will be held between 1:00 pm and 3:00 p.m., Sterling Hotel,
Sacramento.   This memo is sent to you as a notice so that, if possible, you
can arrange for your contract Lobbyist to be available during that time.
Please don't hesitate to contact IEP if you have any questions.
