Dear Jeffrey:

. . . for startup managers these days is raising money,
and we can help. With ideas, and introductions. And you
can get both by spending just one day out of the office.
Today's funding environment is harsh -- we know that --
and investors are both more cautious and more demanding.
Yet there's money to be had and we've put together a one
-day conference of those who know how to get it.

Come learn  from the most active investors in later-stage
rounds. From CEOs who have  found new money in the last
few months.  From hard-to-reach experts like Tracy
Lefteroff, the Global Managing Partner of
PriceWaterhouseCoopers' Venture Capital Practice.  Or,
J. Sanford Miller, a co-founder of Thomas Weisel Partners,
most recently appointed Managing Director with 3i, (one of
the most active follow-on funders with 32 deals since June
1, alone).  Be sure to check out the site as more and more
speakers accept their invitations.

I hope your calendar allows you to join the other CEOs
and Investors on February 6.  To register your place and
hear these and other leading experts, please link to
http://events.venturewire.com/followon/ today and
complete the online registration form.  VentureWire's
last company-building summit in November filled quickly,
so please act promptly.  If you have any questions,
please contact me by voice on (212)343-1900 x165 or e-mail
at cunningham@venturewire.com

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Allan
