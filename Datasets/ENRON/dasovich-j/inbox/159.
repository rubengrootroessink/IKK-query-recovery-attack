TODAY'S CFOs ON THE MOVE
Assessing the Human Toll

By CFO Staff

Though Tuesday's events touched almost every American, some in the US
business community were hit especially hard by the loss of friends and
colleagues. At least two CFOs were killed in the terrorist attacks.

Waltham, Mass.-based E-business software maker Netegrity Inc. reported that
CFO James Hayden was a passenger on the United Airlines Flight 175 that
crashed into the World Trade Center Tuesday morning. Hayden, 47, was
credited with helping Netegrity become one of the more highly valued
companies in the tech industry. He is survived by his wife and two children.
Netegrity plans to start a memorial fund in his name.

MRV Communications Inc. lost CFO and vice president of finance and
administration Edmund Glazer, who was aboard the Los Angeles-bound American
Airlines Flight 11, which crashed into the other tower of the WTO. Glazer is
survived by his wife and young son. 

In other CFO news, Jack Nichols III joined Atlanta-based startup Incanta
Inc. as CFO. Incanta makes streamlining applications for broadband
providers. Nichols joins Incanta from NetSchools, an E-learning company.
Incanta is a venture-backed company started in 1999.

Officials at Palo Alto, Calif.-based biopharmaceutical company XenoPort Inc.
appointed William Harris CFO. Harris joins the startup from Coulter
Pharmaceuticals Inc., where he was CFO until Coulter's acquisition by Corixa
Corp. in December 2000.
