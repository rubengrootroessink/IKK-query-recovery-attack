I just spoke to Richard Katz, who is coordinating Edison MOU efforts for
the Governor's office.  The Proclamation declaring the Special Session
is still on the Governor's desk although Richard expects him to issue it
shortly (against Richard's advice).  Richard has spoken to several key
Senators trying to convince them to pass the MOU with some form of
direct access and exit fees attached.  He said Enron should be thrilled
with the PUC action.  I responded that Enron believes continuing direct
access is necessary and wants comprehensive legislation to do it.  He
believes a bill without direct access can't pass the Assembly.  He says
staff is still meeting, but nothing conclusive has been achieved.
Although he's made his hotel reservations for next week, he suggested
that its still not 100% certain that the session will be called.
