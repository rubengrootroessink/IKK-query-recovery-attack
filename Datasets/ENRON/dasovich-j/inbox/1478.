Karen,
I received you check. I am sending you the arrival instructions and directions. Please print them out, and read the instructions before your arrival. Let me know if there is any other information you will need before your arrival. My neighbor has expressed a preference that cars be only parked on my property. Please see the details in the instructions. We hope you will enjoy you weekend.
 
Patty Glatt, Owner

Dear Karen and Tom, 
Here is the information you will need to begin the reservation process. 
Please clarify how many guests there will be. If it will be more than four, 
there is an additional charge of $10 per night per person above four. Linens 
are not provided. The queen is in the master bedroom, a double in the second 
bedroom, and a double futon bed in the sleeping loft. You will need to bring 
sheets, bath towels, and I suggest a kitchen towel. 
Please let me know how many guests there will be if it differs from the 
contract I have drafted for four adults. 
If you have any questions, or decide that you do not want to pursue the 
reservation, please contact me.
