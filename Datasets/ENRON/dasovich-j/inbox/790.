Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a
CEA thing.

(I am copying Jeff D. as a courtesy...I think we need this to be just a
customer deal).
