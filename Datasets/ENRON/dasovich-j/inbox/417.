Rick, Jeff, Tim:

Here's the latest mark-to-market analysis of the DWR contracts.  It has been updated for recent curves but does not yet include some of the more recently singed contracts, including Pacificorp's Klamath Falls.  (We're still working on adding those contracts.) Mo Elafandi in our structuring group prepared the analysis and you contact either him or I with any questions.
