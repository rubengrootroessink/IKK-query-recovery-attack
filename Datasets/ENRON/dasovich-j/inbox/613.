Hi Jeff:
 
1.    Don't know at this point what if anything we'll do.  We haven't, as you undoubtedly seen, taken a lead on DA issues.  We do, however, have another case up our sleeve that would aid DA should it come to be. More when that develops.
 
2.    Yes, Michael does QF work.  He typically works with the QFs who have contracts to sell power; I work more on the consumer side with the QFs who build primarily to self-serve.    (In other words, he looks more a power generation, I look more at end-user issues.)  Certainly feel free to call him.  He's in DC today at the RTO workshops, but I believe he'll be here tomorrow.
 
Hope you're safe and well.
 
E

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to Michael Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
 
Hope (all things considered) you're doing well.
 
Best,
Jeff
