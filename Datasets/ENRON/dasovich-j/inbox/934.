Not sure if you guys heard about these anti-abortion trucks, but I had not.
I saw two of these trucks this morning and they are so disgusting that I
believe it is borderline harassment or obscenity.  It?s difficult because I
believe so strongly in free speech, but this really was upsetting.  You can
check out their web site at http://www.abortionno.org/
<http://www.abortionno.org/>   From there you can get into the pictures and
truck campaign.  It?s really unbelievable.
