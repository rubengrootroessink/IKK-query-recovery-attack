Hey Jeff -=20
Thanks for getting the word out there, and hi to everyone checking in. So h=
ere's the deal, I want to build a DAW (digital audio workstation) - a compu=
ter for multi-track audio recording and mixing etc... I've been researching=
 this for a while but have just gotten more serious about it in the last co=
uple of weeks, partly because I lucked into a nice piece of hardware (indef=
inate loan from a friend). An 8 to 10 channel interface called a Delta 1010=
 which gives me a nice head start.=20
    From what I have read so far, it seems that  there are some specific re=
quirements for a machine to be solid and reliable. It needs to be fast (not=
 so hard these days, but the faster the better within my budget). It needs =
to be paired down - anything running in the background like power-managemen=
t schemes can cause pops and clicks while you're recording and extraneous h=
areware uses system resources. And it should have a seperate, fast and larg=
e hard drive just for the audio data (typically a SCSI drive). I'm finding =
 a lot of recomendations against buying something off the shelf like a Dell=
 or whatever. Mostly, I think, to have more control over the specific compo=
nents and also to cut down on a lot of the unnecessary (to audio recording)=
 integrated accessories that those computers tend to have. Also, I'm kind o=
f looking forward to building it myself. I like that kind of thing and it w=
ould mean I know how the thing works.
    Here's the plan I'm formulating at this point. I'm thinking of putting =
together a dual processor system with the fastest pentium IIIs I can afford=
. There doesn't seem to be all that big a price range between the different=
 speeds just now - probably because they're yesterday's news with the P4s o=
ut there. (By the way the Pentium 4s have not been getting the best reviews=
 in the audio world - from what I can tell - and I don't think there's a du=
al processor motherboard for them yet. Also, I think they are more expensiv=
e.) For this I need to come up with a motherboard. The one that I've come u=
p with so far is an Asus Tek CUV4X-D but I'm new to all this and I don't ev=
en know what I don't know as far as what's out there so any suggestions are=
 welcome. Also I know I need a fast SCSI (ideally, 10,000rpm or better, dat=
a trasnsfer rate of 80MB per second, sustained transfer rate of at least 24=
MB per second or better, and a seek time of 6ms or less - as quoted in one =
of my sources). Of course I need a pile of memory but I understand that it'=
s pretty cheap right now. There also seems to be a debate going on about AM=
D's CPUs these days.=20
    Hopefully I can save some money going low end on stuff like the monitor=
, the keyboard, and anything else that doesn't directly pertain to audio re=
cording because I actually am on a budget . Maybe there are some elements t=
hat I can even save for an upgrade. I am willing to spend what I need to, t=
hough, because if this works well it could make for a more affordable way t=
o record True Blue's upcoming cd than going into a regular studio.    =20
    So there you have it in a rambling kind of way. I appreciate any info y=
ou all can offer. For instance I really don't know what the cheapest source=
 for all this stuff is and there are probably plenty of issues that I'm tot=
ally ignorant of. Clearly, all this points to the old saying about a little=
 knowledge being a dangerous thing.=20

  Thought I'd add Eldon, too, since he likely has some ideas and informatio=

    Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory =
and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd j=
ust go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you expl=
ain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just =
to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  =
Rory has some ideas.

    Best,
    Jeff
