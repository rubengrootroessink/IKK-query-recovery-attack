What are we doing today to ensure that 1) PG&E's assessment is accurate; and 2) they have a complete list that includes everything we have done since we sent our initial list?

Gregg,

I don't want to step on anyone's toes here, but I think this is a critical issue and needs to be addressed.  I spoke to Calvin Yee at PG&E today and he brought this to my attention, since a deadline of tomorrow has been set in the letter.  I won't be in the office tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure this issue was raised.

PG&E specifically states in the attached letter that they will be comparing our final list of "valid account numbers against all Connect DASRs received since September 20, 2001."  My interpretation is that they are planning to reject any DASR's received since September 20th which are not on our list.

I will be looking at their list of accounts today.  If you need my input tomorrow, you can reach me on my cell phone at 713.408.4578.

Kimberly
