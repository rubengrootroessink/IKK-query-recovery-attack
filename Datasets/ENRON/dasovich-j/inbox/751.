	Historically, I don't think it was an issue before Wheeler Ridge and
the increased flows at that receipt point.  Basically there is no minimum
Blythe flows set in the BCAP or by the Commission.  It is mainly an
operational issue for SoCalGas that they've somewhat managed without
getting into any Commission mandated procedure.  Actually, Florio raised the
issue as it impacts the core but the Commission never addressed it.
Typically, SoCalGas has managed the issue by having the core maintained
flows at Blythe.  As I recall there is some manner in which it is indirectly
addressed in the Comprehensive Settlement.

Greetings:
Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum
flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for
the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate
sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing
something, or don't have this right, let me know.

Best,
Jeff
