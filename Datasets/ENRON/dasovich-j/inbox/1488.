Members of the Haas community,

This evening at 5:00 p.m., Professor Louis Stern from the Kellogg School of
Management, will give the second annual David A. Aaker Distinguished Lecture
in Marketing in the Wells Fargo Room.

In his talk, titled 21st Century Marketing, Stern will address changes to
marketing strategies and tactics that are required in order to find the
right paths to profitability in the post-Internet-bubble era. Aaker
describes Stern as "One of the best speakers in academic marketing. He is
always provocative and humorous."

Seating will be on a first-come, first-served basis so please arrive early.

Regards,

Ben Hermalin
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
