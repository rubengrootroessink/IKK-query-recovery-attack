Susan, the issue is not the date--the question is, for any date deadline we're working against, what is the time cutoff for the DASR to be accepted by the utility.  An example is that SCE picks up DASRs at 5:00 pacific; if we don't submit a DASR until 6:00 pacific, but before midnight of that same day, is it still effective for the day that we submitted it, or would it be viewed as effective for the following day?

Nancy,

As we discussed,  the current proposed decision does not provide any date for closing off DASRs.  Rather, it would end the right to choose (direct access).  If direct access is suspended by the CPUC, DASRs should continue to be accepted by utilities for DASRs related to contracts signed before the suspension date.  SDG&E has already told some ESPs that it does not plan to police the contracts and will continue to accept DASRs as long as necessary. To be safe, we must be move as quickly as possible to get all our DASRs in.  The CPUC will be meeting this Thursday and is scheduled to vote on suspending DA. We can't predict the outcome; the vote could be delayed again, leaving us uncertain as to whether or when DA will be suspended.

Is there someone on the California "Crisis" Team that can answer this question?

Nancy, when we went through our last big DASR emergency week before last, the question was raised as to what was the effective date of a DASR, e.g., is it midnight of the day that you've submitted it, or if the utility picks up the information from their file server at 5:00 p.m. (SoCal) is does that determine the effective date such that anything submitted later would have an effective date of the following day?  Could you give us some guidance on the right answer?  We used the pickup time of the utility, in which case we had to have all the SCE DASRs submitted by about 3:00 Houston time to give CSC the ability to key the data into their system and run their batch process prior to SCE's pickup time.

To clarify below.  The 3:00 cutoff for SCE DASRs will not allow for 480 SCE accounts.  CSC has stated they could do about 120 in an hour.  I have indicated it below in a revision.   The 480 would apply to a group of DASRs from all utilities.  Additionally, CSC has stated that from 6:00 forward, the amounts shown below are guesses of what they can do, but there is a lack of certainty.

Mark, per our conversations, these are the details of how much CSC can handled from a DASR bandwidth perspective, and what the utility and CSC deadlines are:

Central Time		DASR Ability		          UDC Pickup Deadline	
7:00 a.m.		1200
11:00 a.m.		960				Cutoff for EEMC
12:00 p.m.		840
1:00			720
2:00			600
3:00			480	(120 SCE)		Need to have SCE DASRs to CSC 
4:00 - 5:00		Batch Process Shutdown
5:00			200
6:00			70
7:00			50				5:00 Pacific for SCE
8:00			--				
9:00			Batch Process Shutdown	
10:00
11:00
12:00 a.m.
1:00 a.m.						12:00 Eastern for PG&E and SDG&E
