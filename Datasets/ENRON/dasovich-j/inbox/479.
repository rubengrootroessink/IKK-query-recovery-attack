Jeff  -
	I will be briefing Jim Steffes with the monthly, EES/ENA update tomorrow afternoon.  I have attached the Sept. 5th report from the WSCC group below.  Would you please assist me by either adding new projects to the list, or by letting me know if there are any updates that he should be aware of.  Thanks so much for your help.

 
Thanks,

Bryan
