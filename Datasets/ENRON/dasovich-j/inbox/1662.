Hi everybody,
I happened on an addition to my search for info while doing a little research last night. There just might not be anything on this out there yet, but I was at Asus' website last night and it seems they have a new dual-processer motherboard out called a CUV266-DLS and I can't find anything about it anywhere. Maybe it's too new or too expensive for anyone to have bothered with up to this point but I'm snooping around so if you've heard anything...
Avram
