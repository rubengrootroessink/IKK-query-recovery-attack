THE WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE BRINGS HEAVY HITTERS TO HAAS
All faculty, students, staff, and alumni are invited to the 6th annual 
Women in Leadership Conference, which takes place on Saturday, October 20. 
This year's theme, "Explore, Inspire, Excel," is embodied by two 
exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO 
of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive 
vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.

The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at 
Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current 
MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater 
Bay Area.

Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded 
Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of 
hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky 
served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the 
Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted 
new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at 
Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought 
with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from 
Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot 
in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. 
She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard 
Graduate School of Business Administration.

Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community 
Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is 
also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab 
Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address.

Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 
1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic 
Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took 
a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book "Coming Up 
for Air: How to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World," published by 
Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an 
MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a 
variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions 
and workshops.  Panels planned for this year's conference include:

    + Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate
    + Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World
    + International Business
    + Wild Women

This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, 
J.P. Morgan, Johnson & Johnson, Accenture, Goldman Sachs, and Adobe.

PUBLIC AND WEST COAST SCHOOLS SUFFER IN LATEST FORBES RANKING
Public business schools, including the Haas School, lost ground to their 
private school rivals in the latest Forbes magazine ranking (Oct. 15) of 
MBA programs that attempts to calculate a "return on investment" of 
graduate management education.

All of the nation's state-funded business schools dropped out of the Forbes 
top-ten ranking this year, including the Haas School, UCLA's Anderson 
School, and the University of Virginia's Darden School.  Haas placed 15th 
in the new survey, compared with a 4th place finish last year.  Anderson 
was 12th this year and 5th last year, and Darden was 13th this year and 
10th last year.

The magazine conducts its ranking by surveying the salaries of MBAs who 
graduated in 1996.  Forbes said it "asked alumni for salary information 
from the year before they entered business school, the year they graduated 
and 2000."  Forbes then  "compared the total of five years' pay with a 
projection of what the median student would have earned for those five 
years without a degree."

In addition, all west coast business schools suffered in this year's 
rankings. In addition to Haas and Anderson, Stanford Business School, which 
was ranked 3rd last year, fell to 10th place this year.

Forbes explained the dramatic changes in this year's rankings by saying, 
"schools with strong finance programs dominated the top of our rankings," 
while the "meltdown among Internet firms" caused the top California schools 
to fall.

Kurt Badenhausen, the editor of the Forbes rankings, further explained in a 
conversation that Haas, Anderson, and Stanford hurt in this year's survey 
due to the very high pre-MBA salaries of their MBA 1996 graduates.

The Forbes' ranking:
1. Harvard
2. Wharton
3. Columbia
4. Dartmouth
5. Chicago
6. Yale
7. Cornell
8. MIT
9. Northwestern
10. Stanford
11. Duke
12. UCLA
13. Virginia
14. Carnegie Mellon
15. UC Berkeley

FOURTH ANNUAL INVESTMENT BANKING CASE COMPETITION LAUNCHES TODAY
The Haas School of Business and Goldman Sachs & Co. are proud to present 
the fourth annual Investment Banking Case Competition. This undergraduate 
competition is a great opportunity for students considering careers in 
banking, corporate finance, venture capital, consulting, and 
entrepreneurship to get hands-on experience in their area of interest.

Sign-ups for this year's competition begin today, October 1, in the Haas 
Undergraduate Program office (S450).  Students are encouraged to form teams 
of four students, though a team may compete with a minimum of three 
individuals.  To replicate the work environments that graduates will enter 
upon graduation, each team must have at least one member who is not a Haas 
major or minor.

Each year this event showcases one of Goldman Sachs' recent high profile 
transactions to give interested students an opportunity to demonstrate and 
further develop their knowledge and skill base.  The case materials will be 
available Friday, October 5, at noon in the Haas Undergraduate 
office.  Each team will be expected to present its conclusions through a 
written product, similar to the discussion materials often used in 
investment banking, consulting, and corporate board meetings (e.g. 
PowerPoint slides).  The presentations are due by 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 
October 15, 2001 in the Haas Undergraduate office.

The review committee, comprised of Haas faculty and Goldman Sachs 
representatives, will review the presentations and select three to four 
teams to participate in the final round.  The finalists will be announced 
and notified by Tuesday, October 23, and final presentations will be held 
the following Tuesday, October 30 from 6:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in Arthur 
Andersen Auditorium.

Each of the finalist groups will make a 20-minute presentation followed by 
questions from a panel of judges, which will include company management, 
investment bankers, members of the investment community and faculty from 
the Haas School.  After the winners are announced, the judges' will present 
critiques the presentations and there will be time allotted for questions 
from the audience.

Please direct questions or concerns to Haas School lecturer Stephen Etter 
at etter@haas.berkeley.edu.

HAAS CELEBRATES A VERY SUCCESSFUL HOMECOMING AND REUNION WEEKEND
Over 300 alumni, students, faculty, and friends came to the Haas School for 
the annual Reunions and Homecoming celebrations this past weekend.  Alumni 
reconnected and reminisced throughout the day -- over breakfast, building 
tours, and a sun-drenched Tuscan Italian Feast.

A presentation by Professor Rashi Glazer on the evolution of e-business and 
a career management session by the school's Alumni Career Director, John 
Morel, kicked off the day. After the events at Haas, many alumni attended 
the football game against Washington State to cheer on the Golden Bears in 
the special Haas School alumni section.

Hundreds of alumni also returned to campus to celebrate their reunions 
throughout the weekend.  The 5th, 10th, and 20th reunion classes planned 
activities and parties throughout the weekend -- some on campus, some off 
campus.  The 25th and 15th Haas class reunions enjoyed reconnecting in the 
BankAmerica Forum with cocktails and jazz.

"The class reunion activities have increased tremendously this year and we 
are excited to be working with such wonderful reunion committee volunteers 
on increasing the participation in social gatherings and class gift 
campaigns," said Tenny Frost, the Haas School alumni relations director. 
"Alumni and Development staff members Linda Coffee and Tannwen Mount did a 
fantastic job planning and implementing this year's events with our staff 
and reunion volunteers.  This strong partnership has been a recipe for 
success and we plan to continue to build on our successes and strengthen 
our class reunions program."

NEW ASSISTANT DEAN FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ALUMNI RELATIONS JOINS HAAS
Larry J. Lollar has joined the Haas School as the new assistant dean for 
development and alumni relations, succeeding Melinda Carmack, who resigned 
in December 2000. Lollar comes to Haas after a nationwide search to fill 
this position, conducted by the school with the assistance of the 
professional search firm Heidrick and Struggles. Jay Stowsky, associate 
dean for school affairs and initiatives, says, "We are delighted to have 
someone with Larry's experience and stature join us at Haas."

Lollar brings more than 20 years of fundraising experience to his new role, 
including sixteen years at Stanford University (including four years as 
director of development for Stanford Medical School) and four years at the 
University of Texas at Austin, where he was vice president for Development 
under UC Chancellor Robert Berdahl, who was UT's president at that time. 
Lollar also served as vice president for institutional advancement at 
Golden Gate University and, most recently, as vice president for external 
relations at the Preventive Medicine Research Institute.

While he was at Stanford as the director of Foundation and Corporate 
Giving, Lollar raised $480 million in foundation and corporate giving as 
part of Stanford's $1.1 billion campaign.

"I hope to build on the successes of the Haas program," says Lollar. "There 
is a wonderful staff here and although we have some vacancies to fill, I 
want to get going with meeting the fundraising goals of the school."

Larry holds a master's degree in English literature from Duke University 
and a bachelor's degree in English literature from the University of Oklahoma.

Larry will be located in the dean's suite, in the office recently occupied 
by interim assistant dean Marily Howekamp, who is returning to her job as 
director of development for the central campus. Larry's e-mail address is 
lollar@haas.berkeley.edu and his phone number is 642-3182.  JoAnn Dunaway, 
who has also been co-interim assistant dean will stay on at Haas as the 
director of development resources.

THE EVENING MBA PROGRAM WELCOMES A NEW DIRECTOR OF MARKETING AND OPERATIONS
Jane Thompson comes to Haas as the director of marketing and operations of 
the Evening and Weekend MBA Program this week.

Prior to joining the Haas School, Jane served for 11 years at the Wharton 
School as senior associate director of MBA Academic Services, where she was 
directly involved in a variety of management and curricular 
activities.  She also served as program director for several of Wharton's 
international MBA programs, traveling to southeast Asia, China, South 
America, and Europe with groups of MBA students. Jane holds a MS from the 
University of Pennsylvania in organizational dynamics and an MA from 
Pennsylvania State University in education.

"I have always been focused on enhancing the MBA experience," says 
Thompson. "I am thrilled to be at Haas." All Evening MBA students will have 
the opportunity to meet Jane at the upcoming pizza dinners. The dates are:

October 17 and 18 for first-year EvMBA students
October 22, 23, 24, and 25 for second- and third-year EvMBA students
