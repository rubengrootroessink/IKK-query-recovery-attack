MAKE THE RIGHT MOVES NOW --
SO YOU'RE READY FOR THE UPTURN

Dear Jeffrey:

Sandy Robertson and Les Vadasz -- if the term "key"
could be applied to anyone financing private technology
companies, you'd be hard pressed to find anyone to match
their experience and portfolios. What is their take on
what companies need to prove to attract investment?
What financing models do they see are best suited for
2002? What valuations are you likely to be getting in
your next rounds? On November 6, in San Jose, they'll
be sharing the answers to these and many other
questions at:

Managing the downturn: Survival strategies for 2002
VentureWire Executive Summit
The Fairmont, San Jose
November 6, 2001

http://events.venturewire.com/summit/default.asp

Robertson is a true pioneer in start-up finance. Since
1999, he has been running Francisco Partners, the firm
he co-founded, which is the world's largest private
equity fund focused on technology. Of course, prior
to that he had founded Robertson, Stephens & Company
as well as Montgomery Securities. In all, he has financed
over 500 technology companies, including AOL, Dell, Siebel
and Sun, and supported companies and CEOs in good times
and bad. What does he think should be the focus for
technology entrepreneurs and financiers in 2002? What
are your best options for preventing your company from
suffering a liquidity crunch?

Vadasz operates the world's most extensive corporate
development program at Intel Capital. Last year, they
put $1.3 billion into start-ups, and their portfolio
currently includes 550 companies. As part of Intel's
founding team in 1968, he's had various management
responsibilities within the company. He brings a great
blend of operational management expertise and investment
focus to the summit. He'll help us understand the
investment and valuation criteria that Intel applies
to candidates and share insight on the organizational
structures and focus best suited to ride out the
current market malaise.

We're delighted the roster of contributing speakers is
a "who's who" of the industry. Take a look at the panel
on the right to get a sense of others who are participating.
Through both flush and difficult times, they have built,
financed and led great companies, and gone on to turn
those companies into major industry players. Their
leadership ability and insight on people management
and motivation has been put to the test in the past.
What do they believe are the key factors influencing
their own and others' success? Discovering how to pull
through the down market and emerge well-positioned to
exploit the rebound will be fascinating.

How are you structuring your company to survive and
grow in 2002? These and other key experts will share
best-practice strategies for all operational aspects.
Whether you're looking for new financing, cash management
models, product development, sales and marketing
strategies, human resources insight or the building
of corporate partnerships and other strategic
relationships, attending VentureWire's Executive
Summit on November 6 will be a key. Join the valley's
leading executives and investors. Learn from the direct
experiences of the heavy hitters on how to manage your
company through the downturn and be among the first to
ride the upturn when it comes.
