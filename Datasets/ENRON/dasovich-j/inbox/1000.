Dear Investor:

The IPO market has come back with a bang!  A dozen 
very successful IPO's have come to market in the last 
few weeks and at least two dozen more are on the 2001
calendar. 

Magma Automation (LAVA: NASDAQ) closed its first day 
up $5.99, Weight Watchers (WTW: NYSE) rose over $7 in 
the first week and Fisher and Paykel (FPHC: NASDAQ) rose 
from its offering price of $18 to over $24 in the first 
week.  The month of December looks to be huge with billions 
in equity new issues scheduled to price.

How do you find out about these offerings BEFORE they 
come to the market?  TheStreet's IPO Pros PLUS is 
the answer.

For only $25 per month or $255, per year, TheStreet's IPO 
Pros PLUS is unique in bringing you professional insight 
into the IPO market.  Our staff of analysts, formerly traders
