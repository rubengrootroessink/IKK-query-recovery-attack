Haas students:

We all know that recruiting is going to be a challenge this year and
utilizing all available
resources will heighten our chances for success. Haas students bring a
wealth of contacts
to the program and we in the Career Center want to be sure to tap into it to
benefit
your fellow classmates.

If you have a contact that you think would be interested in hearing about
the ways that a
company can connect with Haas students through either formal or informal
recruiting events
(on-campus presentations and interviews, job fairs, job postings, student
club firm nights, etc.),
please send us the person's contact info.  It might be a hiring manager you
worked with or for.
It might be someone within the company's human resources department that has
not interacted with Haas.
It might be a personal contact that has a small business looking for that
one key person. Regardless,
we would appreciate the opportunity to pursue the potential recruiting
contact.  Please provide the
following if available:

Contact name, company, title, phone number, email address, any additional
recruiting-related
info (type of position (s)he may be interested in recruiting MBA's for, past
Haas/MBA hiring, etc.)

Depending on which industry your contact is in, please email your response
to the appropriate
account manager as follows:

Rich Wong - technology and entertainment/media - rwong@haas.berkeley.edu
Jenny Rowe - consulting, consumer products, healthcare/biotech/medical
devices, education, not-for-profit - rowe@haas.berkeley.edu
Mark Friedfeld - finance/investment banking, real estate -
friedfel@haas.berkeley.edu

On behalf of your Haas schoolmates, thanks for any leads you can provide.

Regards,
The Haas Account Managers
