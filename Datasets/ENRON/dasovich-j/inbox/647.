Folks,
to clarify...

1) The recurring call-in number for this weekly call has already been established, which is as follows 
	(same as last week):

	Call-in Toll-free:	(800) 998-2462
	Passcode:		5549022

2) Just prior to this e-mail going out, Paul had indicated to me that we should cancel the call
	as he will be unavailable (enroute/traveling to D.C.).

Thanks,
Joseph

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
