A Dynegy-Enron Deal Faces Significant Regulatory Review

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.
Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. 
A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. 
Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. 
A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. 
Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. 
Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. 
The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said.

US Physical Gas Prices Mostly Down; No Demand

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly fell Thursday, dipping on low demand and a shorter-than-usual trading session as Enron's online trading service went off the board, traders said. 
With Dynegy and Enron Corp. talking takeover matters, traders felt Enron's gas traders simply covered positions and got out of the market quickly. Marketers felt Enron's trading positions have eased in the last two weeks as the company reported a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to questionable partnerships.
Also, traders pointed to no incremental or storage demand and a lack of weather-driving prices downward. 
Fundamentals for the market remain bearish: Storage is near all-time highs, and injection season ended with Wednesday's 10 billion cubic feet build. Otherwise, some floor traders said gas marketers were shying away from trading with giant Enron Corp. 
December settled Thursday at $2.960 per million British thermal units, up 9.0 cents. Traders are looking ahead hopefully to colder weather at the end of the month, in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $2.60-$2.77/MMBtu, down 1 cent-8 cents. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.60-$2.74/MMBtu, down 5 cents-8 cdents. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $2.54-$2.65/MMBtu, up 1 cent on the bid, down 2 cents on the offer as traders feared curtailments on the pipeline. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.56-$2.74/MMBtu, down 7 cents on the bid, up 3 cents on the offer. November index is $3.01/MMBtu, a trader said Thursday. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $2.44-$2.57/MMBtu, down 3 cents on the bid, up 1 cent on the offer. November index is $2.86/MMBtu.

USA: NewPower shares advance on revised guidance.

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - National power and gas marketer NewPower Holdings Inc. revised its 2001 loss guidance downward on Thursday and saw its stock post its best one-day gain in two months. 
The projection came in NewPower's report of a third quarter net loss of $67.1 million, or $1.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96 per share for the third quarter of 2000.
Analysts had expected a per-share loss of $1.15 to $1.18, according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call, which put the consensus at $1.16. 
Purchase, New York-based NewPower is the parent of The New Power Co., which says it is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in the United States. It said total customers increased 155 percent to 805,000 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Revenues were $54.7 million in the latest quarter, an increase of 201 percent from the third quarter of 2000. 
During the third quarter, NewPower said, it gained about 80,000 new customers through the company's marketing efforts, primarily in the residential sector. NewPower recently increased its emphasis on small business customers and at the end of September had over 25,000 small business accounts. NewPower expects this to increase to more than 35,000 by the end of the year. 
Providing revised guidance for the rest of the year, the company said it expects a net loss of $41 million to $46 million or a loss per share of 65 cents to 73 cents for the fourth quarter. The full year net loss is estimated to be between $210 million and $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63 per share. 
Analysts' estimates of the year per share loss range from $3.68 to $3.74, resulting in a consensus per share loss projection of $3.71. 
NewPower said it projects the year-end customer count will be between 840,000 and 860,000, of which the fourth-quarter increase is expected to be achieved entirely through marketing. 
It said the revised forecast reflects a reduction in the number of customers the company expects to acquire through portfolio acquisitions and the impact of delays in switching Texas customers to NewPower, partly offset by the company's modified marketing strategies and continued cost reductions. 
NewPower shares reached a high of $1.25 in Thursday afternoon trading and were still up 48.15 percent, or 39 cents, at $1.20 in the final half hour of trading. 
The company is 44 percent owned by Enron Corp. , NewPower's largest provider of electricity and natural gas.

Enron Investors Still Perplexed - And Stock Shows It
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/08/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even as more facts are revealed regarding Enron Corp.'s (ENE) financial dealings, investors can agree: Things remain as clear as mud. 
Earlier Thursday, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the neighboring rivals were talks for a potential "business combination." An agreement hasn't been reached yet, and neither company will make any further comment until a contract is signed or the talks end.
Separately, Enron restated its earnings from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001. 
As the news hit the tape, Enron shares, after being briefly halted, seemed to hunt for a direction. The stock traded as high as $10, and as low as $8.40. Currently, the shares were at $8.67, down 38 cents, or 4.2%. Wednesday, the shares zigzagged. 
Meanwhile, Dynegy shares, which had fallen Wednesday as news of the talks began to leak out, regained lost ground and then added some. Dynegy shares were recently trading up $4.54, or 13.8%, at $37.54. 
"There's a lot of news to digest," said Glen Hilton, a portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Montgomery Asset Management. 
Enron shares have been in a downward spiral since it revealed last month that the unwinding of off-balance sheet transaction with a partnership run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had resulted in the loss of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. 
That bad news led to more bad news, including the downgrades of its credit ratings, which are essential to the health of its core wholesale energy marketing and trading business. Meanwhile, investor confidence eroded as market watchers asked Enron to come clean. 
The move in Enron and Dynegy shares Thursday was unusual for companies considering a merger. Typically, shares of the acquirer will fall, while shares of the target climb. 
Investors explained the move several ways. 
Some said it was a reflection of the lack of a premium Enron shareholders will be paid. Their views were based on a report in The Wall Street Journal, which cited a source familiar with the matter who said Dynegy is considering paying $7 billion to $8 billion in stock, or about one-tenth of what Enron was worth 15 months ago. 
Others agreed, and said given recent events they're being cautious. 
Larry Alberts, a buy-side analyst at American Express Financial Advisors, said he was questioning how serious Dynegy is about the transaction. He also said there is still the possibility of more bad news to come from Enron. 

As for the restatement of earnings going back to 1997, investors said it was clearly having a negative impact on Enron's stock even though some had been expecting it. 
John Waterman, of Rittenhouse Financial Services, said the information Enron disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was "hard to sort through." 
Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported. 
Enron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles. 
Revelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated. 
On Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well. 
Gilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron. 
Enron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships. The board required review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer. Whether these controls and procedures were followed will be investigated by a special committee Enron has named. 
Many expect that if Enron remains independent, more executive departures could be in store. 
"The bottom line from my perspective is that Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and the board seemed to be aware (of Fastow's dealings with the LJM partnerships)," said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzebanc Securities. "Everyone's hands are dirty, including Ken Lay. ... The firing the CFO and treasurer are not going to single-handedly solve the problems at Enron," he continued. 
Others also are questioning the role of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor. 
"People like us have to rely on people like them," said Rittenhouse's Waterman. 

According to its restated financial information, Enron had close to $13 billion in debt at Sept. 30. 
Liquidity issues remain the chief concern among investors, who continue to fret that the latest disclosure will result in a further deterioration of Enron's credit rating. 
"The clock is ticking on Enron," said Montgomery's Hilton. "Each day brings a new piece of incremental news." 
Following the release of Enron's earnings last month, Hilton had a hunch the company would likely write off additional investments as it had in the third quarter. However, he was committed to the stock, and at the time he didn't plan to sell his stake, which accounted for 2% of the close to $100 million in assets he manages. 
Since that time, Hilton has sold his Enron stock. He said he began selling after news of the SEC probe broke. 
"It just got too scary to hold," he said. 
Still, Hilton, who owns shares of Dynegy as well, isn't concerned about the possibility of a merger of the two Houston energy traders. 
"It's David taking Goliath," he said, adding that he is convinced that Dynegy's management will not enter into a transaction that will threaten the company's stability. 
Several Dynegy investors echoed Hilton's sentiment with their own expressions of confidence in Dynegy's management. However, at times these convictions were almost betrayed by a nervousness brought on by the sense that what one doesn't know could be hurtful. 
Some investors remain concerned by Dynegy's motivation. 
According to Hilton, investors don't know what would happen to the market - and as a result, to Dynegy - if Enron fails. 
So, what reason truly is motivating Dynegy? 
"It's probably both," Hilton speculated.

USA: UPDATE 1-FirstEnergy sells $4.0 bln in 3-part debt sale.
By Dena Aubin

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Utility holding company FirstEnergy Corp. sold $4 billion of five-, 10-and 30-year debt on Thursday, helped by investors' preference for defensive sectors as the U.S. economy stalls. 
FirstEnergy was able to lower its borrowing costs, trimming yields from initial indications. The sale originally was expected to offer generous yields as heavy bond issuance, weak wholesale power prices and investor jitters over the troubles of energy trading firm Enron Corp. weighed on the utility sector.
Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy will use proceeds for corporate purposes and to help pay for its recent purchase of Morristown, New Jersey-based GPU Inc. . FirstEnergy purchased GPU for about $4.5 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of about $7.2 billion in debt. The sale closed on Tuesday. 
Utility bonds are typically viewed as a conservative investments because of the industry's stable income during uncertain economic times. The sector has been under a cloud, though, as Houston-based Enron has struggled with a cash squeeze and writedowns from off-balance-sheet transactions. 
"Enron was held up as a model, growing extremely quickly, and the recent financial disclosures are just a shock," said Kelly Perl, a project director at New York utility consulting firm Applied Economic Research. 
Spreads, or the yield gaps between utility bonds and U.S. Treasuries, have widened about 0.15 to 0.20 percentage point over the past two weeks, while spreads on gas and pipeline companies have widened about 0.30 percentage points, strategists said. 
SALE TERMS 
FirstEnergy sold $1 billion of 5.5 percent five-year notes at 99.888 cents on the dollar, yielding 5.526 percent or 1.98 percentage points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries. It also sold $1.5 billion of 6.45 percent 10-year notes at 99.651 cents on the dollar, yielding 6.498 percent or 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries, and $1.5 billion of 7.375 percent 30-year bonds, yielding 7.389 percent or 2.45 percentage points more than the old long Treasury bond. 
Initial price guidance had called for spreads as high as 2.20, 2.35 and 2.60 percentage points more than Treasuries for the five-, 10-and 30-year debt. 
FirstEnergy's sale was helped by a 0.50 percentage point interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday and signs that the Fed could cut rates again. 
"There is the perception that the Fed is going to aggressively ease and err on the side of caution," said Peter Palfrey, portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles & Co. in Boston. Investors are betting that the Fed will engineer an economic recovery, helping corporate profits and spurring price gains in corporate bonds, Palfrey said. 
Analysts said FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU should benefit its credit quality. 
"It adds further diversity to their cash flow from regulated distribution companies," said Fitch analyst Robert Hornick. 
Falling wholesale power prices also should benefit FirstEnergy, Hornick said. 
"They're not a big seller of wholesale energy at this point," Hornick said. "They don't own generation facilities and need to buy (electricity) in the market, so to the extent wholesale prices are lower, they can benefit," he said. 
Standard & Poor's rates FirstEnergy's senior unsecured notes "BBB-minus," its lowest investment grade. Moody's Investors Service rates FirstEnergy's long-term debt "Baa2," roughly one notch higher, while Fitch rates them "BBB." 
Salomon Smith Barney, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley arranged the sale.

USA: WRAPUP 1-Enron, Dynegy confirm possible merger talks.
By Jeff Franks

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., plagued by investor doubts and under the gun to shore up its crumbling finances, said on Thursday it was talking with power trading rival Dynegy Inc. about a possible merger. 
The company, whose stock and credit ratings have plummeted amid an uproar about questionable business transactions, admitted it made bookkeeping errors and restated earnings for the last four years.
It also said former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing partnerships linked to the deals. The deals, which were off the balance sheet, are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
Two other executives, managing director and treasurer Ben Glisan and Enron division general counsel Kristina Mordaunt, were both believed to have links to the Fastow-led partnerships and have been fired, the company disclosed. 
The announcements threw a spotlight on Enron's stark situation, in which the nation's top energy trader has gone from Wall Street darling to pariah in a few weeks and now faces a cash crunch so dire it is seeking a merger with the much-smaller Dynegy. 
Its credit ratings have fallen to near-junk levels in recent weeks, making it difficult to get money to boost investor confidence and back the trading operations that provide 90 percent of Enron's income. The company reportedly has been seeking investors to provide a cash infusion for an equity stake. 
MODERATE PREMIUM 
Word about a possible Dynegy-Enron deal leaked out on Wednesday, and on Thursday the two companies confirmed talks about a possible "business combination" were underway, but said no agreement had been reached. 
Sources told Reuters that the two Texas rivals, whose headquarters are a few blocks apart in downtown Houston, were talking about a stock swap with a moderate premium for shareholders and a $1.5 billion capital infusion from ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy. 
The stock swap is valued at about $8 billion, or about $10 a share, The New York Times reported on Thursday. 
A merger would catapult Dynegy to the top of the energy trading industry now dominated by Enron. Last year, the company had $29 billion in revenues, compared to $100 billion for Enron. 
For Enron, it would cap an astonishingly rapid fall from grace. 
Enron stock has lost $19 billion in market value since its crisis began in mid-October and was down another 45 cents to $8.60 in Thursday trading. Dynegy shares rose $3.87 to $36.87. 
Enron restated its earnings going back to 1997, saying its auditors advised that the off-the-balance sheet deals in question should have been included in the company's financial statements. 
The restated results reduced Enron's net income by $591 million, or 22 percent, from 1997 to 2000, and increased its debt by $628 million, or 6 percent, after two of the partnership's financial statements were consolidated into Enron's earnings. 
Enron said the restatement reflects a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity that touched off the current controversy when the company offhandedly disclosed it last month. Angry shareholders suddenly worried that Enron was hiding other liabilities in its complex financial statements and began demanding more information. 
In a statement, Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the company hoped it had allayed Wall Street fears with Thursday's announcements. 
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," he said. 
Analysts, wary after last month's surprise revelations, said Enron may have more to release, but they were pleased it was finally coming forth with information. 
"It's an attempt to come clean," said Raymond Moore, an analyst with Weatherly Securities.

IN THE MONEY: Enron Transparency Not Transparent Enough
By Michael Rapoport

11/08/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So Enron Corp. (ENE) says it wants to be more transparent - to make its impenetrable financial results and corporate structure easier for investors and analysts to understand.
Based on its announcements Thursday, however, it still has a heck of a long way to go. 
With Enron's restatement Thursday of nearly five years' worth of earnings and additional information about the maze of off-balance-sheet deals related to it, we now have a lot more information about the mess at Enron than we had 24 hours ago. But we're not much closer to understanding just what HAPPENED to leave Enron in such a mess - and that's because the company's explanations of all this continue to be dense, confusing and next to impossible to grasp. 
Try this tidbit, from the Form 8-K Enron filed about the restatements Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission: 
"In addition, Enron's net income is reduced for specific JEDI revenues previously allocated to Chewco, relating to the appreciation in value of Enron stock, which eliminate upon consolidation. This, in effect, reduces Enron's share of JEDI's earnings." 
Huh? And no, it doesn't help you to know that "Chewco" is an entity that wasn't included in Enron's financial results but which Enron now admits should have been. Or that "JEDI" isn't a "Star Wars" reference but a limited partnership in which both Enron and Chewco had invested. It's still impenetrable. 
Then there are the times when Enron just plain doesn't give enough information. The company says its decision that Chewco should be included in its results after all "is based on current information that Chewco did not meet the accounting criteria to qualify as ... unconsolidated..." Uh - okay. WHY didn't it meet the criteria, and why did Enron previously believe that it did? Enron doesn't say. 
Finally, Enron makes some assertions that just make you scratch your head. The company says part of the restatement of its earnings stems from unspecified "prior-year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications which were determined to be immaterial in the year originally proposed." 
Hmmm. Beyond the fact that Enron doesn't elaborate on the nature of these "audit adjustments and reclassifications," or why they were originally considered immaterial, consider that according to Enron's own figures in the 8-K, they add up to a negative earnings impact of $87 million since 1997. That amount doesn't sound like any definition of "immaterial" I've ever heard. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
In fairness, this lack of clarity may be all but inevitable given Enron's Byzantine structure, which involves dealings with outside but related entities that also have third parties involved, which in one case have a subsidiary that allowed Enron to hedge the risks of an investment, and in another case is selling assets purchased from Enron to OTHER entities in order to finish paying Enron for the original transaction, and ... you get the idea. It's next to impossible to make clear because Enron's structure is just too baroque to understand in the first place. 
The market is plenty puzzled by all this, even in the wake of Enron's attempt to clarify things. Take a look at the company's drunken-sailor stock chart from Thursday. After news of the restatements hit, Enron stock first jumped higher, going as high as $10 a share, then soon dropped back, to as low as $8.40, as investors started to digest the details of the news. Then up again to about $9.25, then down again to its current level of around $8.50. 
There's no reason investors should be confused like this. There is absolutely no reason that a reasonably intelligent layman, with an elementary working knowledge of corporate finance, should be unable to understand the regulatory filings, structure, earnings and balance sheet of any public company. 
If that happens, it's the company's fault, not the investor's - either because the company hasn't explained things well enough or because its structure is needlessly complicated to begin with. If Enron wants to get back the market's confidence, fixing that problem, one way or the other, would be a good place to start.

RPT Dynergy sharply higher, Enron lower on merger talks

11/08/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
(Repeating to show in headline, lead that Enron is trading lower) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Dynergy Inc were sharply higher, while Enron Corp lost ground in midsession trading after the two companies confirmed that they are holding merger talks.
At 12.25 pm, Dynergy was up 3.17 usd, or 9.6 pct, at 36.17, Enron fell 0.34 usd, or 3.7 pct, to 8.71 usd and ChevronTexaco dropped 0.18 usd to 87.10. The DJIA was up 110.22 points at 9,664.59, the S&P 500 index gained 12.88 points to 1,128.68 and the Nasdaq composite rose 34.35 points to 1,871.88. 
Enron share price today was hurt after the company announced a restatement of its net income from 1997 to the third quarter of 2001. The revisions were, for the most part, reductions in the bottom-line figure. 
The 8 bln usd tie-up talks, which come at a time when Enron is being investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the markets are losing faith in the energy trader, are seen as particularly positive for Dynergy. 
Analysts see a tie-up as highly accretive for Dynergy, which is 26 pct owned by ChevronTexaco, with many synergies also possible. 
Banc of America analyst William Maze, who rates Dynergy 'Strong Buy', said: "If this transaction comes to fruition, we would be aggressive buyers of Dynergy given its accretive nature as well as the lifting of Enron's credibility issues that has been plaguing the entire industry." 
CIBC World Markets analyst William Hyler, who rates Enron 'Buy', added: "The move would also catapult (Dynergy) into a leadership role at what could prove near the bottom of the gas/power pricing cycle." 
On the other hand, Enron's position would improve as its credibility within the trading world and in the face of its trading counterparties would recover somewhat. 
To that end, Dynergy would provide a yet unspecified cash injection, believed to be approximately 1.5-2.0 bln usd, to improve Enron's standing and shore up its finances. 
ChevronTexaco, which is expected to provide a substantial part of the financing needed for the merger, also stands to gain from the situation as it would retain effective control of the combined company.

US Spot Coal: Prices Weaken As Buying For 2002 Slows

11/08/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Coal prices slumped in physical markets last week, as mild weather in the East, a slowing economy and high utility inventories undercut demand, sources said Wednesday. 
Over-the-counter prices for Central Appalachian barges for calendar year 2002 slid $1.75 from last week to $32.00 a ton on Tuesday, trading several times at that level, people in the market said.
With major coal producers sold out for the remainder of this year and most of next year, traders said, prices could move higher if there were a sudden rise in demand. 
"Utilities are comfortable in their stockpiles, a trader said. "The only thing that would make this market bounce a little bit would be some cold weather in the East." 
The cut in Enron Corp's (ENE) credit rating and a Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships was making the energy giant's coal customers anxious about getting paid, people in the market said. A coal broker said counterparties were watching Enron's credit and limiting longer-term business with the company. 
"Everyone is nervous," a buyer at a Midwestern utility said. 
Major coal producers and coal-burning utilities interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday said they hadn't suspended trading with Enron. 
Physical prices were largely unaffected by the turmoil in the trading business and continued the downward trend that began in mid-October. 
In the East, where prices softened in light trade, Central Appalachian barge deals for November delivery to the Big Sandy River were done in late October as low as $30.75 free on board, down from $33.50 a ton. December and the first quarter of 2002 traded several times Tuesday at $32.00 and $32.25 a ton, down $1.50 since late October. 
Rail deliveries were pegged between $36.00 and $38.00 a ton FOB. No deals were confirmed. 
In the West, Powder River Basin coal with a heat rate of 8,800 British thermal units slipped to $7.55 a ton for November, down a nickel since late October. Deals for calendar year 2002 were done at $8.10 and $8.15 a ton, down about 10 cents. 
PRB 8,400 Btu coal traded very little, sources said. November deliveries deals were done at $5.90 a ton, down from $6.25 a ton at the end of October. Calendar year 2002 was pegged between $6.35 and $6.45 a ton, down 10 cents. 
According to the Energy Information Agency, total U.S. coal production through Oct. 27, the latest date for which figures were available, ticked upward by 445,000 short tons to 21.8 million tons. 
Appalachian coal production, year to date, was 2% ahead of last year. Total Appalachian production in 2001 is 356,557 tons, up from 349,711 tons in the same period last year. 
U.S. Western coal production year to date remains steady at 6.4% ahead of 2000 figures. EIA reports total western coal production through Oct. 27 at 447,308 tons, up from 420,353 tons in the year-earlier period. 
Railcar loadings through the end of October were 5% higher than comparable 2000 figures, according the EIA. 
Activity on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which came to virtual standstill last week, picked up on Tuesday. On Tuesday, open interest for the December coal contract was at 217. The December contract, which expires Nov. 27, settled Tuesday at $31.75 a ton, down $2 from Oct. 30. U.S. Spot Coal Prices

STOCKWATCH Dynergy sharply higher, Enron flat on merger talks

UK: Rivals eye Enron's metals trading business.
By Andy Blamey

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy trading giant Enron Corp. , whose shares have tumbled amid a regulatory probe and doubts about its ability to raise cash, may lose or offload its metals business, senior industry sources said on Thursday. 
In the wings are several interested parties looking to snap up the company's metals customer base.
"There are people out there with the experience and the contacts who see this time as a good opportunity to get into the market," a senior metals market source told Reuters on Thursday. 
Such a move for Enron's metals portfolio would involve the acquisition of an existing organisation as a vehicle, the source added. 
"We do not comment on rumours," an Enron spokeswoman said, declining further comment. 
Other Enron Metals assets were also said to be in play, including the Henry Bath warehousing company, which operates LME-registered warehouses in the UK, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United States. 
MAJOR PLAYER 
Houston-based Enron became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London, in a deal worth around 300 million pounds. 
The company is a ring-dealing member of the London Metal Exchange (LME), able to participate in open-outcry floor trade, and is active in screen-based metals trade via its EnronOnline platform (www.enrononline.com). 
The company no longer has a stake in online metals trading platform EMETRA (www.emetra.com), having sold its holding to other EMETRA shareholders this summer. 
But while Enron may be a heavy hitter in the metals sector, base metals trading could hardly be regarded as one of its core businesses. 
The company's third-quarter 2001 results statement shows income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) from "Europe and other commodity markets" - which includes metals and steel alongside European gas and power, among others - of $53 million, unchanged from the year-earlier period. 
This compares with IBIT from Enron's gas and power market-making operations and merchant energy activities in North and South America of $710 million over the same period. 
But the third-quarter figure that has slashed the value of the company's shares is a $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity related to off-balance sheet transactions. 
On Thursday the company said it would restate its earnings for 1997 to 2001 to reflect the transactions - a move which wipes $613 million of the company's reported net income from 1997 through the first half of this year. 
The company's stock has dropped by almost 78 percent since Enron released its earnings results on October 16, falling to nine-year lows amid concerns about the company's ability to raise cash. 
The story added an extra twist on Wednesday as news broke that U.S.-based energy trading and marketing firm Dynegy Inc. was in talks to buy out Enron. 
Against this background speculation is rife about the future of the metals operation, fuelled by the company's decision last month to trim between 10 and 20 percent of its metals workforce as part of a wider staff reduction by Enron Europe. 
UNLIKELY TO REMAIN INTACT 
Any decision by Enron or a possible future purchaser to offload its metals operations would be unlikely to see Enron Metals remain intact, traders said. 
"They paid $450 million for MG. Would they get $450 million for Enron Metals? I don't think so," said one. 
"Why buy the whole concern when you can cherry-pick the best traders and the clients will follow?" added another. 
An increasing emphasis on screen trading at the expense of personal contacts may already have persuaded some Enron clients to jump ship. 
"We've picked up a fair amount of small and mid-sized trade-type business in Europe from people who've said 'I'm not going to be told just to trade on a screen,'" said one trader. 
Another trader said: "A lot of this business revolves around who you've been trading with and talking to over a period of time. It's about individuals," he said. 
"Enron Online...should be seen as an 'added value' product, not as the only way of trading. Customers still want to talk to their broker, and are willing to pay commission for the service," the senior source said. 
Enron's financial position could also prompt customers to consider other options, the first trader said. 
"As a customer, you want to place your business where there's financial stability. If a company isn't financially stable, you'll move elsewhere." 
Enron's trade counterparties are also keeping a close eye on the company's financial situation, said a trader at one LME brokerage. 
"People aren't particularly concerned about short-term trading (with Enron), but when it comes to OTC business done outside the clearing market they're backing off a bit," he said.

WRAP: Enron To Restate Results; Confirms Dynegy Talks

11/08/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said it will restate its financial results from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, as the embattled energy company and Dynegy Inc. both confirmed they are in talks on a possible business combination. 
In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said its financial and audit reports are unreliable for those periods.
Enron said that three "unconsolidated entities should have been included in its consolidated financial statements," based on generally accepted accounting principles. These entities are Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman LP. 
Enron said it has established a special committee to review all transactions. The committee will specifically review all "economic results" related to transactions between Enron and LJM. 
Last month Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter related to write-downs of investments. Of this, $35 million was attributed to partnerships run until recently by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who has since been replaced. Enron also disclosed it shrank shareholder equity by $1.2 billion, as a result of several transactions including ones undertaken with Fastow's investment vehicle. 
Later, Enron said the SEC would investigate the company's "related party transactions," including those with the Fastow partnerships. 
The restatement will reflect the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, as well as various income-statement and balance-sheet adjustments determined by Enron and its auditors. 
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay 
Over the past couple of days, Enron has been scrambling to line up quick financing from a prominent outside investor and has been in discussions with private-equity firms and power-trading companies. 
Earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that Dynegy was trying to buy Enron for $7 billion to $8 billion in stock. Both are Houston-based energy-trading and power companies. 
Because any combination of the two would likely be scrutinized for many months, and Enron needs to shore up its finances now, Dynegy reportedly is expected to inject $1.5 billion into Enron immediately, people familiar with the matter said. 
ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), which owns a 26% stake in Dynegy, is expected to provide Dynegy with the funds for the cash infusion and is playing a significant role in the negotiations, the Journal said. 
The boards of Dynegy, Chevron and Enron reportedly met Wednesday to discuss a potential deal. Enron's stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a $618 million third-quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced. 
The talks between Enron and Dynegy follow a sharp decline in Enron's stock over the past several weeks.

USA: Enron fires two employees linked to partnerships.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , the embattled energy trader, said on Thursday fired its treasurer and a counsel who the company said were part-owners of one of its off-balance sheet partnerships now under investigation by U.S. regulators. 
Enron said it was terminating the employment of Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer of Enron Corp., and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing director and counsel of an Enron division.
Enron said it believes that these two employees, along with four other former Enron employees, were involved as partners in a limited partnership called the LJM1 that had dealings with Enron. 
Shares of Enron were trading down 5 cents or .55 percent at $9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron restates net income for periods from 1997 to Q3 2001

11/08/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp announced it is restating its net results for 1997 to 2000 and for the first three quarters of 2001 to take account of various related party and off-balance sheet transactions in which the company was involved. 
The restatement have no effect on Enron's current financial position, it said.
In its restated figures, Enron posted reductions to net income of 96 mln usd in 1997, 113 mln usd in 1998, 250 mln in 1999 and 132 mln in 2000, as well as increases of 17 mln usd for the first quarter of 2001 and 5 mln for the second, but reduced the third quarter figure by 17 mln usd. 
The restatement will have no negative impact on the company's reported earnings for the nine month period ending Sept 2001, however, it said. 
The company said its changes to net income are the result of the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments LP and Chewco Investments LP beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of the LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments. 
The JEDI and Chewco consolidations will increase Enron's debt by about 711 mln usd in 1997, 561 mln in 1998, 685 mln in 1999 and 628 mln in 2000, the company said.

Enron restates earnings as company confirms talks with Dynegy
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

11/08/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered energy trading giant Enron Corp. announced Thursday it would restate its earnings since 1997, in part to reflect a controversial dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that has sparked a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
Enron, whose stock price has fallen roughly 80 percent in the past three weeks, also said it was holding talks with Dynegy Inc. relating to some form of business transaction. The New York Times reported that Dynegy was considering buying Enron, its larger hometown rival for dlrs 8 billion.
In a filing with the SEC, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that partnerships run by Enron officials during that period should have been consolidated into the financial results of the Houston-based energy trading giant. 
These partnerships are Chewco Investments L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments L.P., and a wholly owned unit of LJM Cayman L.P. 
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive. 
By its own assessment, Enron's restatement reduces previously reported net income by roughly dlrs 586 million and increases its debt by dlrs 2.59 billion. The change reflects the financial impact of retroactively consolidating the partnerships. 
The company also fired two executives on Thursday: Ben Glisan, its treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one of its divisions. Previously, Enron had ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was in charge of some of the partnerships. 
Shares of Enron were off 10 cents to dlrs 8.95 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron said it believes the restatement will include a reduction to net income of about dlrs 96 million in 1997, dlrs 113 million in 1998, dlrs 250 million in 1999 and dlrs 132 million in 2000, increases of dlrs 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and dlrs 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of dlrs 17 million for the third quarter of 2001. 
Enron, the top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the United States, had become one of the nation's 10 largest companies, recording revenue of dlrs 100.8 billion in 2000. 
But the company has been beset by huge investment losses and questions about its financial stability. In particular, its stock has plunged since Oct. 16, when the company posted a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss and revealed that its shareholder equity had been reduced. 
Enron's woes have prompted considerable speculation about a possible takeover of the company. 
Besides Dynegy, companies mentioned as possible suitors included General Electric's GE Capital unit and Royal Dutch/Shell Group. 
On Thursday, both Dynegy and Enron released statements confirming they were in talks, but declined to provide any details. 
The New York Times reported earlier that Dynegy is considering paying about dlrs 8 billion in stock, or roughly dlrs 10 per share. 
Under the terms of the deal, Enron would receive an immediate dlrs 1.5 billion cash infusion from oil giant Chevron Texaco, which holds a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, the Times said, citing executives close to the discusssion. 
Chevron Texaco would provide an additional dlrs 1 billion injection at a later date, the Times reported, while Dynegy would assume dlrs 12.8 billion in Enron debt, plus billions of dollars in other debt that has been kept off the beleaguered company's balance sheet and has been a significant contributor to its current problems.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron provides financing data, restates earnings.

11/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Thursday it provided U.S. regulators with more information about off-balance sheet deals, and other transactions that led to a shattering of the company's credibility and to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron, the once high-flying Houston-based energy trading company, also confirmed it was in talks with its hometown rival Dynegy Inc. over a possible business combination. Terms of any deal have not been agreed on, the two companies said.
Enron said that it will restate its earnings from 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001 as the company addresses concerns raised by the SEC and shareholders. 
Shares of Enron dropped 20 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $8.85 in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in North America, said the required restatement reflects the surprising - and controversial - $1.2 billion reduction to shareholders' equity the company recently disclosed. 
The restatement also reflects adjustments to the company's income statement and balance sheet, now that Enron has decided that the financial activities of Chewco Investments, L.P., Joint Energy Development Investments Limited Partnership (JEDI) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LJM1 should indeed have been included in the company's consolidated financial statements. 
As a result of the restatement, Enron is reducing its 1997 net income by about $96 million, 1998 net income by $113 million, 1999 net income by $250 million and 2000 net income by $132 million. 
It is also restating first quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income increase, second quarter 2001 results with a $5 million increase and third quarter 2001 results with a $17 million net income decrease. 
Consolidating Chewco and JEDI also increases Enron's debt by about $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000. 
"We believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in a statement.

Is Enron Too Big To Fail? Bailout Seen Unlikely
By Jason Leopold

11/08/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This story initially ran late Wednesday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Maybe Enron Corp. (ENE) is just too big to fail. Maybe not. 
Is the embattled energy trading company important enough to qualify for a federal bailout? 
Not likely, according to a number of analysts who believe that there are enough big energy companies in the U.S. to keep markets liquid if Enron goes under. 
For that reason, a federal bailout is probably not in the cards, even though Enron controls about 25% of U.S. natural gas and electricity markets, they added. 
"A bailout would only occur if needed to maintain liquidity in the energy markets in order to avoid potential for skyrocketing prices and avoid reliability risks," said Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) analyst Steven Fleishman. "In the end, government is most interested in keeping the lights and the heat on at a reasonable price." 
Once a Wall Street darling, Enron's stock has fallen about by 75% in a mere three weeks, and the company is now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. 
Because it's so big, energy companies have watched Enron's troubles closely, and speculated about what they could mean for energy markets overall. A number have said they've started to cut back on their exposure to the company. 
Enron's stock has been falling all year, but it plunged several weeks ago after it disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. The SEC subsequently launched an investigation into Enron partnerships associated with the writedown. 
Enron spokesperson Karen Denne said the company wouldn't speculate on the idea of a bailout. 
"First of all I can't speculate, and second of all we're not even going to entertain worst case scenarios," Denne said. "As far as I know no one has approached Washington about a federal bailout." 
But one source inside Enron said the company isn't ruling out the possibility of approaching Washington if "things get really bad." 
A bailout would require federal legislation. 
To qualify, Enron would have to argue that a bailout is an economic necessity, according to Christine Uspenski, an analyst at Schwab Capital Markets (SCH). Quite Different Cup Of Tea From Chrysler 

Unlike the situation that led to a $1.2 billion federal bailout of Chrysler Corp. in 1980, hundreds of thousands of jobs aren't now at risk. Enron is nowhere near the size of Chrysler. 
"When Chrysler was bailed out there were senators and congressman who were going to have unemployed constituents so they proposed federal legislation to give the company a $1.2 billion loan," Uspenski said. "A bailout would need federal legislation proposed by Texas delegation. It would be hard because Enron is not the size of an employer like Chrysler. The one caveat is bailouts happen to be the fashion of the moment. Enron would have to make a compelling case that this is an economic necessity. They would have to quantify the risk to the energy market and there's such bad karma around the energy market right now." 
Robert Christensen, an analyst with FAC Equities in New York, agreed. 
"I can't even imagine something like that happening," Christensen said. "It's so far-fetched." 
A merger, on the other hand, would funnel billions of dollars into Enron, keep the company afloat and might help the company's stock recover, analysts said. 
On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron is in talks for a capital infusion and possible acquisition by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Also, Enron said Thursday it will restate its financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001, saying its financial and audit reports are unreliable for all those periods. The company fired its treasurer and general counsel. 
Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank in New York, said a bailout would likely never materialize because there are other large traders of energy commodities in the marketplace, such as Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB), that can provide liquidity to the market. 
A merger would be a better route for the company, but would pose its own set of problems, Meade added. 
"With a merger or an equity infusion, Enron can certainly survive," Meade said. "Enron has a lot of nice attributes, it is a great trading and marketing platform and companies are certainly smart to take a look at it. But merging with or buying Enron is not an easy thing to do because of troublesome issues like a federal investigation and a range of assets that would be pretty tough to sell." 
Enron's best assets "get up and go home everyday," Meade said, referring to energy traders at the company. If Enron were to get into a friendly merger or buyout, he added, the company should lock in its top 50 or 100 traders with non-compete clauses. It would be much easier for Dynegy or other Houston energy companies to simply hire Enron employees rather than buy the company. 
Other analysts also pointed to risks in a merger with Enron. 
"A merger is certainly an option, but it gives you pause if it asks you to be the white knight," Uspenski said. A proposed merger could turn out to be a "minefield and there would certainly be a pretty sizable exposure. It would definitely make shareholders nervous." 
Gerald Keenan, a partner in PWC Consulting in Chicago, was skeptical about the proposed reports of a merger between Dynegy and Enron. 
"Dynegy is not that big a company," Keenan said. "It has a market cap of about $14 billion. What Enron needs is someone to carry it. How is an entity like Dynegy going to carry Enron? Enron has a small market cap but a huge balance sheet." 
Keenan also said Enron wouldn't be likely to secure a federal bailout. 
"The only caveat would be if the bailout would have some kind of significant effect on energy commodity markets," Keenan said. "Other than that, it's unlikely the federal government will bail Enron out."

Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3)

Enron Bonds Give Back Gains as Firm Restates Profit (Update3)

     (Updates bond and stock prices.)

     New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds pared
earlier gains as the biggest energy trader said it restated
earnings for more than four years, increasing concern that Dynegy
Inc. won't buy out the company.

     Enron's 7.88 percent coupon notes due in 2003 traded at 77
cents on the dollar to yield 27 percent, down from a bid of 82
cents this morning, traders said. The debt, which was trading near
100 last month, was bid at 77 cents yesterday. Enron shares, down
75 percent in the last month, fell 64 cents to $8.41 today.

     Dynegy said today it's in talks to acquire Enron in what
people familiar with the situation said would likely be a stock
transaction worth $8 billion. An acquisition would bolster Enron's
credit rating, which was recently lowered, traders said.

     ``Enron bonds justifiably rallied on the good news of Dynegy.
They naturally settled back down as the market assesses the
significance of the restatement,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst
at CreditSights Inc. ``The whole problem goes away and sighs of
relief all around if they come to terms with Dynegy.''

     Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in 2006 were bid at around 70
cents, down from this morning when the debt traded at 84 cents.
Yesterday, the notes were priced between 72 cents and 74 cents.

     The difference between bid and ask prices for Enron debt
widened to about 4 cents to 5 cents -- ``monster'' spreads,
Reynolds said -- from 2 cents this morning, indicating few
investors are willing to buy or sell the bonds without more news.

     While Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's credit as
``Baa2'', one rung higher than its ``Baa3'' grade for Dynegy,
other ratings companies including Standard & Poor's and Fitch Inc.
have assigned Dynegy a higher rating. Also, Enron's ratings have
been cut in recent weeks and face further reduction, while
Dynegy's credit outlook is stable.

     Enron bonds and shares have tumbled in recent weeks on
concern about partnerships run by the company's former chief
financial officer and concerns the company's trading business will
be hurt by the credit downgrades. Enron and Dynegy are both based
in Houston.

     Enron has $15.8 billion of bonds outstanding, more than
double the $6.8 billion market value of its stock, according to
Bloomberg data.



Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1)
2001-11-08 16:34 (New York)

Apache to Cut 2002 Drilling Budget 70% on Gas Prices (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in fifth paragraph and
closing Nymex gas price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Apache Corp., an oil and
natural-gas producer, plans to cut spending on drilling next year
by 70 percent, blaming wide swings in gas prices caused by traders
such as Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc.

     The company will trim spending to $300 million from $1
billion this year, Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank said in
an interview. Gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange reached
$10.10 per million British thermal units in late December and
touched $1.76 per million British thermal units in September.

     The market for gas derivatives is 15 times the cash market
for delivery to customers, and broad price changes make it
difficult for oil and gas companies to set budgets, Plank said.

     ``You've got a 150-pound tail wagging a 10-pound dog,'' Plank
said. ``You can't predict what your cash flow may be. Therefore,
your budgeting is difficult.''

     Shares of Apache were unchanged at $50.73. They have fallen
28 percent this year. Apache, Dynegy and Enron, the biggest energy
trader, are based in Houston.

     ``We can always go back and take another look at (spending)
later,'' Apache spokesman Tony Lentini said. ``We look at our
(budget) regularly, and we're known for moving pretty quickly.''

     Enron, whose plunging stock price forced it to begin merger
talks with rival Dynegy, today restated earnings for more than
four years because of losses from partnerships under investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Fearing an Enron collapse might cripple the gas-derivatives
market, Apache said yesterday it traded out of most of its gas
hedges, making $70 million so far.

     ``Apache is trying to conserve cash and retain the maximum
amount of flexibility,'' said Irene Haas, an analyst at Sanders
Morris Harris Inc. ``Apache has been traditionally very nimble in
responding to these cycles. There's something to be said for being
cautious and conservative when the visibility is bad.''

     Haas rates Apache ``accumulate'' and doesn't own its shares.

     Nymex gas has averaged $2.7 per million British thermal units
so far this quarter, down almost half from the same time a year
earlier. It rose 9 cents to $2.96 per million British thermal
units today.



Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2)

Enron Fires Treasurer, Alleges Improper Investment (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices in ninth paragraph and
information on board approval starting in 17th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which today
reduced its earnings for the last four years by $552 million
because of accounting errors involving affiliates, also said it
fired its treasurer and a corporate attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, the
general counsel of an unspecified Enron division. The two invested
in an affiliate created by Enron to buy and sell the company's
assets, the Houston-based company said in filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

     The transactions also involved two former Enron employees and
former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was
replaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees were
Kathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and Anne
Yaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.

     Lea Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, referred all questions to
her husband's attorney, who couldn't immediately be reached for
comment. Glisan wouldn't comment. Attempts to reach Mordaunt
weren't successful.

                        $30 Million Profit

     Fastow made more than $30 million by managing and investing
in two private limited partnerships called LJM Cayman LP, known as
LJM1, and LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Enron said on Oct. 24 that Fastow
had been replaced as CFO and put on leave. The filing said he is
no longer with the company.

     Enron said it believes Lynn and Yaeger remain associated with
LJM2.

     The SEC began a formal investigation into some of Enron's
partnerships last month, causing the stock price to plummet from
already low levels. Shares of Enron had fallen 89 percent this
year, as of the close of trading yesterday.

     Enron, short on cash, began merger talks with Dynegy Inc.
Yesterday, it failed to reach an agreement with Dynegy to sell
itself for about $8 billion in stock. ChevronTexaco Corp., which
owns 27 percent of Dynegy, is also involved in the talks. Dynegy
is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade Enron's debt,
people familiar with the situation said.

     Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, $8.41. Shares of
Dynegy, which is also based in Houston, rose $3.50, or 11 percent,
to $36.50. ChevronTexaco rose 31 cents to $87.59.

                            Restatement

     Enron restated its earnings for the past four years and the
first three quarters of 2001 to incorporate the first LJM
partnership, as well as Chewco Investments LP and Joint Energy
Development Investments LP, known as JEDI.

     Enron calls them special purpose entities, or SPEs. They are
vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk that can be
moved off the books under some circumstances. Enron established
more than 30 SPEs.

     The company reported that Enron and ``Enron-related
entities'' participated in 24 ``business relationships'' in which
LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of asset such as
unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity interests
in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and a put
option on some assets.

    In addition to Chewco and JEDI, a wholly owned subsidiary of
LMJ1 that ``engaged in derivative transactions with Enron to
permit Enron to hedge market risks of an equity investment in
Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.,'' which provides high-speed
networking to businesses.

     Enron said in the SEC filing that those hedging transactions
should have been consolidated into its 1999 and 2000 results
because the LJM1 subsidiary was inadequately capitalized. Enron
did not specify why transactions by Chewco and JEDI should have
been included on its balance sheet.

     Enron said it believes that Michael J. Kopper, a former
company employee, managed a Chewco general partner and invested in
it. The company said it also believes that Kopper was the
controlling partner of a limited partnership that (through another
limited partnership) in March 2000 purchased interests in
affiliated subsidiaries of LJM1.''

     The company said that it believes the limited partners in
that deal also included Glisan, Mordaunt, Lynn and Yaeger. An
``entity associated with'' Fastow was also a limited partner,
Enron said.

     Enron said that its board approved Fastow's initial
transaction with LJM1 and put controls in place that required the
review and approval of each transaction by the office of the
chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer.
     Lay and Skilling were for many years the only members of the
office of the chairman. After Skilling's resignation in August,
Enron promoted Greg Whalley to president and chief operating
officer and Mark Frevert to vice chairman. Both became members of
the office of the chairman.

     Lay, as chairman, also had the authority to require Fastow to
resign from the partnerships at any time. The board also directed
that its Audit and Compliance Committee conduct annual reviews of
transactions between Enron and LJM1 and LJM2 completed during the
previous year, the filing said.



Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2)

Dynegy Rises on Optimism It May Get Enron for Bargain (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. shares rose
11 percent on speculation that the company may be able to buy
Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, at a bargain price.

     Dynegy said today it's in talks to buy Enron. Dynegy, a rival
Houston-based energy trader, is considering an acquisition of
Enron for stock valued at almost $8 billion, people familiar with
the situation said. With 850 million shares outstanding, Enron has
a market value of about $7.7 billion.

     Enron was forced to consider a sale after its stock plunged
this year and its credit ratings were cut amid a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into partnerships run by a
former executive. Enron shares yesterday touched $7 a share, their
lowest level in more than a decade. A year ago, the stock traded
at more than $80 a share.

     ``If Dynegy can get Enron for $10 or $11 a share, it's a heck
of a good deal,'' said Sanders Morris Harris analyst John Olson,
who owns Enron shares. ``That's why the shares are up.''
     Dynegy rose $3.50 a share to $36.50. Enron fell 64 cents, or
7.1 percent, to $8.41.

     Enron failed yesterday to reach an agreement with Dynegy,
which is concerned that credit-rating agencies may reduce Enron's
debt to junk status, people familiar with the situation said.
Enron today restated earnings for more than four years to include
losses from investment partnerships.

     ``The lack of (Enron) investor confidence at this point makes
it likely that Dynegy could buy Enron and pay little or no
premium,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. Dynegy
``is unlikely to pay significantly more than Enron's current share
price if it does make a bid,'' he said.

     An acquisition of Enron would make Dynegy the biggest energy
trader, eliminating its largest rival, analysts said. Dynegy also
would get the leading energy manager for commercial and small-
industrial customers, and an Internet energy-trading operation
many times larger than its own, analysts said.

     ``People are betting for or against a deal with Enron,'' said
Meade, who rates Enron shares ``accumulate'' and doesn't own them.



NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4)

NewPower 3rd-Qtr Loss Narrows After Adding Customers (Update4)

     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph. Updates
Enron's share decline in fifth paragraph.)

     Purchase, New York, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- NewPower Holdings
Inc., a venture formed by Enron Corp. to compete with traditional
gas and electric utilities, said its third-quarter loss narrowed
after cutting costs and adding customers.

     The loss was $67.1 million, or $1.15 a share, compared with a
loss of $69.9 million, or $2.96, a year earlier. Revenue tripled
to $54.7 million from $18.2 million, the company said. NewPower
was forecast to have a loss of $1.16 a share, the average estimate
of three analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

     NewPower added 80,000 customers in the third quarter and
expects to have 840,000 to 860,000 customers by the end of the
year. The company, based in Purchase, New York, reduced sales,
general and administrative costs by 41 percent, primarily by
cutting systems-development and professional expenses.

     The company is eliminating 40 jobs, or 22 percent of its
workforce, to cut costs, Chief Financial Officer William Jacobs
said on a conference call. NewPower expects costs of $16 million
in the fourth quarter for severance and to end a business alliance
with AOL Time Warner Inc., spokeswoman Gael Doar said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, owns about 44 percent of
NewPower. Houston-based Enron, whose shares have fallen 75 percent
since Oct. 16 amid concern over affiliated partnerships run by its
former chief financial officer, said it had $544 million in losses
on investments including NewPower in the third quarter.

     Shares of NewPower rose 42 cents to $1.23. The company first
sold shares to the public in October 2000 for $21 a share. The
offering increased the number of shares outstanding to about
58 million from 23 million.

                              Fourth Quarter

     Excluding costs for severance and to end the AOL agreement,
NewPower expects a fourth-quarter loss of $41 million to
$46 million, or 65 cents to 73 cents a share, and a full-year loss
of $210 million to $215 million, or $3.55 to $3.63.

     The company was expected to lose 74 cents in the fourth
quarter, according to First Call's average of three analysts'
estimates. The full-year's loss was expected to be $3.71, the
average of four analysts' estimates.

     In 2002, NewPower expects to have a loss of $100 million to
$125 million, or $1.59 to $1.99 a share. The average estimate of
four analysts polled by First Call was $2.26.

     NewPower expects to be profitable in 2003 with 1.5 million
customers. The company is focusing more on small businesses. It
now has 25,000 small-business customers and expects to have more
than 35,000 by the end of the year.

     International Business Machines Corp. owns 1.5 million shares
of NewPower, less than 5 percent of the company.



Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4)
2001-11-08 15:41 (New York)

Enron Restates Years of Profits, in Talks With Dynegy (Update4)

     (Adds Dynegy share price in sixth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which began
merger talks with Dynegy Inc. after its stock plunged, restated
earnings for more than four years to include losses from
investment partnerships arranged by senior executives.

     The largest energy trader failed yesterday to reach an
agreement with Dynegy to sell itself for about $8 billion in
stock. Dynegy is concerned credit rating companies may downgrade
Enron's debt, people familiar with the situation said. A reduction
to junk status would precipitate a cash crisis by requiring Enron
to repay early $3.3 billion of bonds.

     ``Restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of
fraud, which in itself is justification for a downgrade,'' said
Donald Coxe, who manages 78,000 Enron shares as part of the Harris
Insight Equity Fund. ``I'd be surprised if they're not
downgraded.''

     The decision by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth
Lay to reduce earnings by $586 million since 1997 is part of
Enron's efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by the
89 percent plunge in the stock this year and a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation into how the company accounted
for partnerships it sponsored.

     Enron fired Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mourdant, a
lawyer for an Enron division. The company ``now believes'' Glisan,
Mourdant and two other employees no longer working for Enron
bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by former
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     Dynegy's shares rose as much as 14 percent on speculation
that it may decide not to buy cash-strapped Enron, or, if it did,
wouldn't pay much of a premium.

     ``People are betting for or against a deal with Enron,'' said
Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank AG who rates Enron
``accumulate.'' Dynegy ``is unlikely to pay significantly more
than Enron's current share price if it does make a bid,'' he said.

                        Shares Decline

     Enron shares declined 40 cents to $8.65 after the company
determined it violated generally accepted accounting rules when it
failed to consolidate results for three so-called special purpose
entities, vehicles for getting access to capital or hedging risk
that can be moved off the books under some circumstances.

     Enron ousted Fastow last month after revealing an accounting
error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted
in a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third
quarter. Arthur Andersen LLP was Enron's independent auditor.

     The company today reduced 1997 net income by $96 million,
1998 earnings by $113 million, 1999 results by $250 million, and
2000 earnings by $132 million. In 2001, the changes resulted in an
increase to net income of $17 million in the first quarter and $5
million in the second quarter, and a reduction of $17 million for
the third quarter.

     Enron bonds pared gains after the earnings were restated, as
the threat of a credit downgrade dimmed a rally sparked by the
Dynegy talks. Enron's debt doubled in the past four years to $13
billion at the end of the third quarter. Both Standard & Poor's
and Moody's Investors Service are considering lowering their
ratings, which are two levels above junk.

     ``Enron is running out of time and that's what's pushing them
to the bargaining table,'' said Zach Wagner, an analyst with
Edward Jones & Co., who cut his recommendation on Enron to
``reduce'' from ``accumulate'' on Oct. 23.

     Securities regulators are investigating Enron's web of more
than 30 partnerships, including two in which Fastow served as
general partner: LJM Cayman LP, known as LJM1, and LJM2 Co-
Investment LP, known as LJM2. Fastow received more than $30
million from LJM investments and management fees, Enron said.

                          Labyrinth

     The company reported that Enron and ``Enron-related
entities'' participated in 24 ``business relationships'' in which
LJM1 or LJM2 participated. They included the sale of assets, such
as unused fiber optic cable, the purchase of debt or equity
interests in Enron affiliates, and the sale by LJM2 of a call and
a put option on assets.

     The partnerships involved in the restatement are Chewco
Investments LP; Joint Energy Development Investments, known as
JEDI; and a wholly owned subsidiary of LJM1 that ``engaged in
derivative transactions with Enron to permit Enron to hedge market
risks of an equity investment in Rhythms NetConnections Inc.,''
which provides high-speed networking to businesses.

     Some companies that trade natural gas, electricity and other
commodities with Enron may pull back if Enron's finances
deteriorate to the point that it loses its investment-grade credit
rating, investors say.

     Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., a top U.S. energy trader, has
moved most of its trades away from Enron to other exchanges, such
as Intercontinenal Exchange, a venture it formed in March 2000
with other partners including BP Plc and Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
Mirant spokesman James Peters said. ``We are still trading with
them, but on a very limited basis,'' said Peters.

     ``Dynegy has to act fast,'' said Roger Hamilton, a money
manager with John Hancock Advisers Inc., which sold its Enron
shares in recent weeks. ``If Enron can't get financing and its
bonds go to junk, they lose counterparties and their marvelous
business vanishes.''

     Dynegy would gain a wholesale energy business, the leading
energy manager for commercial and small-industrial customers, and
an Internet energy trading operation many times larger than its
own, said UBS Warburg LLC analyst James Yanello.

     ``If history is any guide, Dynegy is stingy when it comes to
acquisitions, so I don't expect them to do anything stupid'' such
as overpaying for Enron, said Yanello. ``A deal could provide
Dynegy with tremendous opportunity.'' He rates Dynegy ``strong
buy'' and doesn't own shares of either company.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns about 27 percent of Dynegy,
is considering adding $1.5 billion to the transaction to help
Enron. It would provide another $1 billion when the purchase is
closed, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported.

                        Breakup Fee

     The companies agreed on a breakup fee providing Dynegy with
about $400 million if Enron accepts a higher offer, people
familiar with the talks said.

     Dynegy's shares rose as much as $4.30, or 13 percent, to
$37.30. The stock had dropped $3 yesterday when news of the Enron
talks was first reported.

     Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer
and ChevronTexaco spokesman Fred Gorell declined to comment.
     Enron plans to meet with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup
Inc. and other lenders tomorrow to discuss the merger plans and a
possible increase in the amount the company pays for existing
credit lines, according to bankers familiar with the matter.

     The company has invited more than 300 creditors to its
offices in Houston to listen to presentations by Enron's financial
team, led by its new chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, the
bankers said.

     Dynegy began in 1985 as Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a gas-
trading company. In 1998, the company took the name Dynegy -- a
combination of the words dynamic and energy -- to reflect its
expansion beyond natural gas. Chuck Watson, the company's
president from 1985, became chairman and chief executive in 1989.

     Watson is an investor with Enron CEO Lay in the Houston
Texans, who begin playing in the National Football League next
year, and is a board member at Baker Hughes Inc. As of an April
filing with the SEC, Watson owned 12.3 million Dynegy shares, or
about 5.1 percent of the common stock.





DJ FABER REPORT: More On Enron/Dynegy >ENE
2001-11-08 16:00 (New York)



  (The following is a portion of a report aired at 3 p.m. Thursday by CNBC
reporter David Faber).
  Enron and Dynegy are still talking about a deal that would result in Enron's
purchase by Dynegy. And they would like to either announce a transaction or the
lack of one, in the near term. It's still unclear at what price Enron would be
purchased, or if the deal will end up as a large investment. People close to
the talks do not expect a large premium.

  A key challenge at present for Dynegy is whether it can conduct enough due
diligence of an incredibly complex financial structure to feel comfortable with
a takeover.

  That point was made clear today given Enron just released restated financial
results for the last four years of operations. Its peak earnings in 2000 had
been $1.12 a share. Now those earnings have been restated to 97 cents.

  The key to Enron's restatement is the treatment of three off balance sheet
partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. Given that guarantee, Enron's
auditors have now concluded the partnerships should have been included on
Enron's books.

  The debt from the partnership has been included in recent quarters, but not
for years previous. And if it had been, Enron might not have been able to
employ as much leverage in running its business and supercharge the returns on
some of its trades.

  While Dynegy understands Enron's trading business as well as any company
could, it still would seem to need time to review its trading book.

  With the restatement, Enron's return on capital and return on equity is in
the mid-single digits. That's well below the ROEs of banks and brokers which
Enron most closely resembles in its trading activities.

  Other issues are also sure to be explored. For example, why did Enron have to
extend deposits to counter parties during the June 2001 quarter if business was
so good, as would appear to have been the case given the company's strong
earnings?

  And what about Enron's use of derivatives for these relatively new type
trades?

  All these are questions that Dynegy may not have time to answer and so
instead may be seeking an expansive material adverse change clause in any
merger agreement which will give it wide latitude to exit a deal should it
discover things it doesn't like in the future.



Dynegy, Enron negotiating merger
Enron fires two officers; financial results to be restated 
CBSMarketWatch.com
Lisa Sanders
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Enron's troubles deepened Thursday as the energy merchant confirmed it's in merger talks with Dynegy and announced, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, that it fired two officers and is restating financial results for four years and two quarters.
Both Dynegy and Enron confirmed Thursday that they're in negotiations following a published report that an $8 billion deal was close to being finalized. 
The New York Times reported that Dynegy's board approved a stock offer worth $10 a share for Enron. 
While confirming the talks, the companies released no further details. Dynegy had no additional comment. An Enron spokeswoman stonewalled reporters Thursday by saying the company was requiring all questions to be submitted in writing. Enron did not respond to the questions.
Shares of Enron (ENE ) initially rallied but closed at $8.41, down 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, while Dynegy (DYN ) tacked on $3.50 to close at $36.50.
ChevronTexaco (CVX ), which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, will contribute $2.5 billion to the deal, the Times reported. ChevronTexaco, which added 31 cents to close at $87.59, declined to comment.
Also Thursday, Enron in an SEC filing said it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and the general counsel of an Enron division, Kristina Mordaunt. Earlier in the month, Enron fired chief financial officer Andy Fastow for his role in limited partnerships that are now under investigation by the SEC.  Enron restated its financial results for the years 1997 through 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001. Enron has lost most of its market value over the past month after the SEC launched a probe of some transactions by company executives. 
Enron would bring huge debt
A merger of Dynegy and Enron would require the smaller company to take on the $12.8 billion in debt that's now on Enron's books. The acquisition would likely lead to the sale of additional Enron assets to pay down the debts, the Times reported. 
Boards of both companies were meeting in Houston on Wednesday night, according to the paper. 
"If you look at the balance sheets of Dynegy and Enron, (a merger) would be a tough deal," Jeff Dietert of Simmons & Co. He noted that Dynegy (DYN ) has $3 billion worth of debt and a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. 
"Enron's debt load is likely to be too significant for Dynegy to step up and swallow," Dietert said. For Dynegy to make the deal, it would have to issue equity, he added. 
It would make more sense for Dynegy to consider buying some Enron assets, Dietert said. That would also help Enron clean up its balance sheet. 
Chris Ellinghaus of Williams Capital Group said that ChevronTexaco's involvement would make a Dynegy-Enron combination more realistic.
"We would view this transaction favorably assuming Dynegy intends to dispose of Enron's myriad of non-core businesses," Ellinghaus said. Dynegy and Enron together would dwarf other natural gas and power marketers in the U.S. 
Ellinghaus said the possibility that Dynegy would buy Enron is "staggering."
"However, the failure of Enron to procure an outside equity infusion has apparently severely limited Enron's options," he said. "We do not believe the potential demise of Enron invalidates the merchant energy model or suggest deeper problems within the wholesale energy markets."
Gregory Phelps, vice president and portfolio manager of John Hancock's Patriot Group of closed-end income funds, said Enron, even in its current state, retains some intrinsic value. 
"Enron still has an incredible number of contractual trading arrangements out there that can't be allowed to crumble and fall," he added. "I think that a firm like Dynegy with a firm like ChevronTexaco as partner adds the credibility that Enron needs."
Dynegy gets to buy "assets on the cheap" that it can tie into its own growth-oriented operations, he said.
Phelps has never owned Enron stock in his funds because he says it's too volatile and the company makes it too hard to understand how it generates revenue.
Bush ties 
Enron's Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay stepped back into the CEO spot following the abrupt departure of Jeffrey K. Skilling, who left after just six months on the job for "personal reasons." Skilling was called to testify in Washington, D.C., this week, though the SEC would not confirm whether it was before their agency.
In a conference call with investors Wednesday, El Paso Energy Chairman and Chief Executive William Wise said his company would consider buying some of Enron's assets, though he declined to specify which ones. 
"We are an asset-oriented company, and we would look at their assets," Wise said. "Rather than list any of them for you, you can make your own judgments." 
Wednesday, A.G. Edwards cut its rating on Enron to "sell" from "hold," saying the only reason to own the stock now would be to bet that some company would bid for Enron or a large part of its wholesale trading operations.
Azurix divestiture 
Also Thursday, Azurix Corp., an affiliate of Enron, said it sold its Azurix North America and Azurix Industrial to American Water Works for $141.5 million in cash and the assumption of $6.1 million of debt.
Azurix is a water and wastewater company. In the third quarter, Enron took a $1 billion charge, which included $287 million for asset impairments at Azurix.
