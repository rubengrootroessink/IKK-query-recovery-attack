Are the customers in the "to be resubmitted" bucket that we are just going to turn around and D-DASR as contracts to be rejected?  If so, should we just not resubmit?  
 
What are the operational/regulatory/asset sales pros and cons?  MDS

You may be aware that PG&E recently began canceling some of the DASRs that we'd previously submitted (be glad to explain the lame reasons PG&E gave for originally cancelling them, but won't go into details here).  

We spoke with our PG&E rep about the issue a couple of days ago, and I spoke with the PG&E attorney in charge yesterday.  That attorney phoned me back today and our PG&E rep phoned Diann Huddleson to inform us that PG&E will, in fact, accept all of our DASRs. We will have to resubmit the batch that PG&E previously cancelled for processing, however.  PG&E will be sending us an email memorializing that they have agreed to accept the DASRs.  In short, fire put out.  

If you have any questions, let me know. 

Best, 
Jeff
