All - 

It is with no surprise (I've only known I was leaving for 6 months now!) and yet still with a heavy heart that I wish you all farewell and the best for the future.  I am in my last week here at the Lazy E and I am getting around the part that I dreaded the most - goodbyes.  I have and will be sending notes to most of the people I have worked with over the past 3 1/2 years (whether they like it or not), but you are the folks I have learned the most from and will miss the most painfully.  It's hard to believe the roller coaster we have been on - both the ups and downs - and I don't think it would have been as manageable, tolerable, or fun without you.  I really have had more fun in this job than I could ever have imagined coming in.  Everyone has been a great friend and mentor, and I will always appreciate the time you have spent with me, indulged my questions, put up with my wandering attentions, and made sure I got home safely in a clean cab...   

Unfortunately I am sure there will probably be more "good bye" emails to come your way over the next few weeks, so I'll keep this brief and close for now.  But I hope for the absolute best for all of you and your families, and do not underestimate the impact you have had on me or the high esteem I hold you in.    Best regards, Scott
