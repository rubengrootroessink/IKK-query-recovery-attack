Oooh, I hope they videotape this!  Sue -- you're going to be amazing!!  Jeff's just jealous that Freeman's keeping his date with you and he canceled on Jeff.  Freeman's scared of a rematch after your last VICA appearance, so they've brought in Horowitz.  Who's Fred Pickerel?

I think Sue should come down with something (I know I would).  Horowitz? Eegads. He will be relentless...

Looks like this group likes a good food fight.

I know I'm speaking on the 26th -- but I have no information on where or
