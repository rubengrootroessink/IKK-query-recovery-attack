We finally got the website up with photos and tunes.  Hope you have a chance to check it out.  It is at www.truebluegrass.com.   If you don't wish to receive True Blue mail in the future, please just reply with that info and we'll do our best to see that doesn't happen again.  Those of you who were at the Freight show last Sunday - thank you.  Your support was greatly appreciated.  The turnout was great at our first Bay Area appearance, and we look forward to doing it again.  Our next show in the vicinity will be in Davis in January - details to follow at a later date.  That's all for now!
