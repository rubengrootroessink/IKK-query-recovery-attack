Comrades:

With a view to increasing the knowledge quotient of
the collective student body regarding the spring
electives, the EMBAA and SAC are soliciting the views
of the veterans among us (you know the ones:  we are
those who wear eyepatches, prosthetic limbs and mumble
incoherently to ourselves most of the day) who may
have constructive opinions about classes they have
taken at Haas outside the core.   

Our hope is to gather, edit and package (that means
make suitable for readers of all ages) these remarks
prior to registration for Spring Semester--which is
week after next, for the schedule-challenged among
us--in order to provide some helpful guidance from our
peers to answer that pesky little question, " What the
heck should I take now!"

Please send your comments to Joe Tambornino,
tamborni@haas.berkeley.edu, by Tuesday the 5th, and we
will endeavor to supply you with THE UNOFFICIAL GUIDE
TO HAAS SPRING ELECTIVES by the end of the week, which
shall include commentary, course descriptions,
information on new professors, etc.

Thanks very much for your help,

Ken Bruce, president - EMBAA
Joseph Tambornino, chairman - SAC
