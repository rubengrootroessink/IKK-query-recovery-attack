Hi Evening MBA students,

If you plan to graduate this semester for a December 2001 degree, will you 
please come by the Evening MBA office soon (by Tuesday, September 25 at the 
latest) and fill out an Application for Candidacy form?

We have your fall transcript to assist you in filling out the form.  Since 
we need your original signature, an office visit is best.

Thanks, congratulations, and see you!
TJ
