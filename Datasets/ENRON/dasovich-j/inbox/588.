The boat: 
Built in 1924, Bagheera is one of the oldest registered sailboat in the Bay
and easily the prettiest.  We need about 30 - 35 people to charter the whole
boat for an afternoon.  Captain Jon and his crew are very experienced and
friendly.

2)  complimentary hors d'oeuvres (coffee, tea, and soft drinks available for
$1.).  You can bring your own drinks and snacks too.

Cost:
Approximately $23-27 per person, depending on the number of passengers.

If you want to join us for a memorable afternoon, please contact

October 17 and provide following information:
