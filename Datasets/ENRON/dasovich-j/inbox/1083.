That's fine.  If we live to make it into '02, I may try to get Netco into WPTF and I would like to be the contact but we can talk about it more then.

I've notified Gary that my name should replace Sue's and our involvement with WPTF only goes through the end of the year.  I'll forward to you anything that he sends to me.  That make sense?

Dan's summaries only go through the end of the year.  Same there, I've been contact with Dan.  Let me know if this answers the questions and works.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff or Paul:

Do either of you know how far out our WPTF membership goes?  Can I tell Gary that I am Enron's WPTF contact?

Also, I see Dan Douglass is still doing advice letter summaries. Jeff, are you Dan's liason on this?  Does he have a budget at this point?

Cheers,

Alan
