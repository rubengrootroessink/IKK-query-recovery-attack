06/20/2001 The Globe and Mail Metro B13 "All material Copyright (c) Bell Gl=
obemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved." WASHINGTO=
N -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in one of the first fraud=
 cases ever filed against a Big Five accounting firm, fined Arthur Andersen=
 LLP and three partners more than $7-million (U.S.) in connection with audi=
ts of Waste Management Inc.'s annual financial results.=20
In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here, the SEC alleged that Arth=
ur Andersen and its partners allowed Waste Management to continue for sever=
al years a series of improper accounting practices that inflated the garbag=
e-hauling concern's earnings. The complaint alleges fraud on the part of th=
ree audit partners assigned to the Waste Management account: Robert Allgyer=
, 56 years old, of Lake Forest, Ill., who has retired; Walter Cercavschi, 4=
5, of Harwood Heights, Ill.; and Edward Maier, 54, of Chicago.=20
Arthur Anderson agreed to pay the fine to settle the case, but the firm and=
 the auditors don't admit or deny the allegations. Among the audit partners=
, Mr. Allgyer agreed to pay $50,000, Mr. Maier, $40,000, and Mr. Cercavschi=
, $30,000. Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7-million.  As part of a campaign=
 to curb what it sees as growing accounting fraud, the SEC has broadened a =
number of investigations of companies' earnings reports to include audit wo=
rk done by outside accountants.  In bringing the first fraud case against a=
ny audit firm since 1985, SEC enforcement chief Richard Walker said the act=
ion "helps to underscore the importance of auditors as gatekeepers to our c=
apital markets and shows the SEC won't shy away from making auditors comply=
 with their responsibilities."  Under a related administrative proceeding f=
iled yesterday alleging professional misconduct, the SEC also censured Arth=
ur Andersen, the three audit partners and a fourth partner, Robert Kutsenda=
, who was the regional audit director at the time of the alleged violations=
. As part of the censure, the four audit partners are barred from doing acc=
ounting work for public companies for a period of one to five years.  "This=
 settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chap=
ter and move on," said Terry Hatchett, Arthur Andersen's managing partner-N=
orth America. "The SEC has not questioned the underlying quality or effecti=
veness of our overall audit methodology, nor has the SEC limited our abilit=
y to conduct audits for other public companies."  An attorney for Mr. Allgy=
er declined to comment. Attorneys for Mr. Maier, Mr. Cercavschi and Mr. Kut=
senda didn't return phone calls.  Waste Management said it "has co-operated=
 fully with the SEC in the investigation, and does not believe that the SEC=
 will seek any action against Waste Management in connection with the event=
s detailed in the Arthur Andersen settlement."  The Waste Management accoun=
ting scandal stands out for it size and breadth. After a board-led probe tu=
rned up years of questionable accounting, the company took a $3.5-billion c=
harge in 1998, and since then the trash hauler and Arthur Andersen agreed t=
o pay $220-million to settle shareholder litigation in the matter.  The com=
pany admitted it had overstated its pretax earnings by $1.43-billion in 199=
2 to 1996 -- the biggest restatement in SEC history. Neither Waste Manageme=
nt nor any of its employees have been disciplined by the SEC. The SEC said =
yesterday that the investigation continues.  Within the SEC, the Arthur And=
erson investigation became a centrepiece of the commission's aggressive cam=
paign to demonstrate that conflicts of interest can be caused by consulting=
 and other non-auditing services that numerous accounting firms now routine=
ly offer audit clients. =09
