Last week I attended the 1999 annual meeting for the Council of Industrial 
Boiler Owners (CIBO) in Arizona.  Enron has been a member since 1997.  Below 
is a quick summary of some issues that you might be interested in.  

Background
CIBO considers itself the "voice" of industrial energy producers promoting, 
through techinical interchange and advocacy:  1)equitable, cost effective 
laws and regulations; 2) improved reliability and cost effectiveness of 
industrial energy systems; and 3) the exchange of information among members, 
government and the public concerning policies, laws and regulations which 
affect industrial energy systems.

Regulation Challenged:
The State of Michagan et al vs EPA (98-149)

Finding of Significant Contribution and Rulemaking for Certain States in the 
Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reducing Regional 
Transport of Ozone.

Petitioners' Arguments
Interpretation of "Significant Contribution" -- cost analysis
State Authority -- EPA went beyond its authority
Split States -- built on OTAG modeling data.  Only a portion of certain 
states were considered in the modeling, but the rule affected the entire state
SBREFA -- EPA, when they published the regulations, didn't consider the 
impact to small business.
Industrial Boilers -- the definition is incorrect
Internal Combustion Engines -- now subject to a 90 percent reduction; EPA 
couldn't show why; incorrect analysis
NOx trading credits -- PP&L is arguing for earlier action credits.  They 
don't like the cap on credits b/c it doesn't give full value for the credits

***As a sidenote.....only certain members of CIBO have been funding the 
litigation effort.  Enron is not one those companies.  If you have further 
questions about the annual meeting or the litigation, please give me a call.  
I'll send around a summary of the hearing after November 9th.
