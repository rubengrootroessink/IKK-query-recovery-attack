Kathleen,
     I hope some version of the attached serves your purpose.  Please feel
free to take editorial license as I granted per our conversation.

Enron has exercised the most compelling business model, one that has been
starved from the industry's natural evolution by regulatory and
protectionist strictures.  This initiative affirms why many of us early
pioneers fought to create full customer choice in the beginning. It will
prove to be a key moment in the renaissance of this industry.
