I thought you folks were involved in this program and supported it, but I may have it all wrong.  In any case, please see attached regarding utilities joint proposal on implementing the DA suspension.  Community Aggregation would not be allowed after Sept 20th.  Is anything you care about and/or have a position on?  Thanks very much. Hope you're well.

Best,
Jeff
