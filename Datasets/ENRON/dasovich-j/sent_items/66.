Subject: Americans Show Unity Against Terrorism - Friday, Sept 14, 2001 

Friday Night at 7:00 p.m. step out your door, stop your car, or step out of 
your establishment and light a candle.   We will show the world that 
Americans are strong and united together against terrorism.  Please 
 pass this to everyone on your e-mail list.  We need to reach everyone 
across the United States quickly. 

 The message:  WE STAND UNITED - WE WILL NOT TOLERATE TERRORISM! 

 Thank you. 
 We need press to cover this - we need the world to see.
