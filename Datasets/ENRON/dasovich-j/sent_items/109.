I've only known Mark (sorry, wrong name below) since May of this year.  His company name is Interstate Gas Services, Inc. at 2500 Kitty Hawk Road, Suite 101, Livermore, CA  94550.  I did hear that they moved at some point in time so perhaps that caused a phone number change prior to my introduction to him.  gh

Thanks.  Did he change companies, or just phone numbers?

Jeff,

No Problem,  Steve's number is 925-243-0350.  I also have his fax number and address if you need it. 

FYI--He recently agreed to provide operational support for the DWR's gas supply contracts.

I have not spoken to him directly in a while. I know Glen Hass in our Omaha office talked to him the other day and could give you that number. Thanks.

Greetings.  Hope, given the circumstances, that you're well.  I'm trying to get a hold of Mark Baldwin, and the number I have gets a recording saying that it ain't the number anymore.  Do you have a number for him.  Greatly appreciated.  

Best,
Jeff
