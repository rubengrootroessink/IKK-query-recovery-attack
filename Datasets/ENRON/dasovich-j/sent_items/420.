Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to ba=
re essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The delete=
d actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3. =20

Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matte=
rs that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  A=
lso add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, =
but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then =
send to Sue Mara for review. =20

Sue:  Please review ASAP after Jeff.  I need to get this into Rick by Wedne=
sday. =20

Alan:  Please take a look and pass any comments along to me.
