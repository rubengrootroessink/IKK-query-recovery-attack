Let me see what I can do.  So this is all about sourcing, or are you aiming higher?

The pilot is with the sourcing group within Energy Services.  The first
event should launch this week or next.  All ahead of schedule because our
professional services team got stuck in Houston with the WTC tragedy and
just continued working on the project.  I have heard that Enron is VERY
happy with the pilot and intends on introducing our application all over
Enron.  Our Sponsor is Dick Leibert-VP of Sourcing Risk Management for EES.
The project lead is a manager named Rudy Sutherland-he's been here for 6
years and knows everyone.  He's a character and a really good proponent.

I was hoping to have the meetings with Deal Bench this week, but that
probably won't happen.  How about October 4th?  It looks like that's a date
that works for both Ian and me.  Will that work for your deal bench guy?

Thanks so much, Jeff.

OK, I'm getting the meetings set up.  What day do you want?  And what
about the pilot--need info, over.  And who's you're knight in shining
armor in EES?

Best,
Jeff
