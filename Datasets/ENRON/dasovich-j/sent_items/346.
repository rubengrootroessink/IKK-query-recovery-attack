Attached for your review and comment is a third draft of the application for rehearing.  The main changes are (1) the addition of several more parties (and will those who arranged for these parties to sign on PLEASE forward a copy of this draft to your contacts so that they get to see it and know how to contact me with any comments or suggestions); and (2) a legislative history section which summarizes the various pertinent bills and resolutions.
 
Please reply with any comments or suggested changes as soon as possible.  Thanks!
 
Dan
