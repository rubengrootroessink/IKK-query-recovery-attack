Before providing more elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete--but stripped-down--list of the key risk areas.  Please add anything I may have missed, send it back, and I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Thanks,
Jeff
 
?	Retroactivity (July 1)
?	No contract renewal
?	No incremental "DASR'ing", i.e., adding/subtracting load on the margin (fast food chains, for example)
?	Cost allocation risk (e.g., IOU undercollection, bonds, DWR undercollection gets distributed to DA customers)
