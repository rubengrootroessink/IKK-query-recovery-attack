Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary thing?

Best,
Jeff
