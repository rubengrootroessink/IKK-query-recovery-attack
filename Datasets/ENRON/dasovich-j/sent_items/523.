Not a problem.  Thanks for the info.  I've got a couple more questions.  I'll call you in a bit.  Thanks again.

Thanks.  Sorry to take so long to get this to you, but here is the info you asked for yesterday.  I don't have the total DA load broken out by UDC, but I will continue to search for the data.  Meantime, this will get you going I hope.
