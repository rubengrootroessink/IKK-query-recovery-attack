Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:

As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
(I'd ask, "what next?", but I'm afraid to ask.....)
However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
OK, back to Enron.
It's a mess (surprise).
I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.
Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
This week's a little tough just because with school and "the mess," I'm a tad preoccupied.
HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.

Best,
Jeff
