I'd like to do everything but the decking for the deck.  We can hold off on that.  In addition, I may have some "salvaged" redwood decking I may want to add to the mix once I get ready to install the decking.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

The cost of materials includes the bridge, should I order redwood for the deck amd have it delivered?

Best wishes,
