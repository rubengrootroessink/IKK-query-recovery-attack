Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Phil
