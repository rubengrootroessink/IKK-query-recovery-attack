Can you forward me both?  I'll take a look at them. Maybe they'll do the trick.  Also, do you have that press article where we partnered with a muni (in Canada, I think)?

Hi Jeff...I have an intro letter, and the presentation that we typically give on our first visit.  Do you think one of those might be appropriate, or shall I put together something in between the two?

Greetings:
I just talked to Marcie.  She's interested, but wants some more info to examine before setting up a meeting.  Aren't there some press articles about the sort of muni partnerships you want to pursue with SMUD and Anaheim?  Do we have anything else that I can email to her to wet her whistle for the meeting?  Will get back to you very soon about meeting with Schori at SMUD.

Best,
Jeff
