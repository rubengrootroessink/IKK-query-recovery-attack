Prentice is working at google and i'm not sure that she gets email.  try calling her on her cell phone. I bet she'd likely like to go to the 49ers game (though who knows, she's a BIG raiders fan now that jerry's there).

I have two 50 yard line tickets for the Raiders game on Sunday as well as
Dad wanting one of you to go to the Sunday night game with him.  Any takers?
