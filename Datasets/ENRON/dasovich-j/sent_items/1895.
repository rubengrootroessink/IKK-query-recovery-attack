Sarah,
 
Nice chatting with you. As I mentioned we are looking for an assistant analyst to work in the communications software and wireless area. 
 
My current coverage list includes Openwave, Palm, RIMM, Handspring, Comverse, Aether, Nuance, SpeechWorks, etc. Given the way our business is growing and evolving, we will be moving towards names like Qualcomm, Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson in the very near future. We are looking for all of the clich? characteristics: motivated, high level of initiative, self disciplined, high attention to detail, good writing skills, modeling experience, blah, blah, blah. Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR.
 
Pacific Crest is a full service investment bank focused on the Internet and communications technology companies. The Bank has approximately 100 professionals with primary offices in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest also has offices in Seattle, San Francisco (primarily IB operations), and Boston (Sales and Trading). Most of the professionals at the Bank come from a larger institutions. Before joining Pacific Crest, I was an analyst at Deutsche Bank in London and ING Barings in Latin America. 
 
If you have any other questions please feel free to give me a shout. I haven't been too specific on requirements as we are really just looking for the smartest and best people and are less concerned about previous experience, etc. It has been a fairly good hiring strategy to date-since I joined Pacific Crest, we have had zero attrition or turnover. 
 
Regards, James
 
P.S. If you are ever in town on a weekday, feel free to come by-we are at the top of the U.S. Bank Tower (big Pinky) and have the best view in Portland.
