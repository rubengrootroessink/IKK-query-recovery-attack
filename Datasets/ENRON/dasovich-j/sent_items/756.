Mike, Jeanne and Bob....the draft looks good...I have noted a few possible
changes and one question.  Let's discuss at your convenience.
 
With regard to interest, APSES asked for an audit.  Why don't we at least
ask for interest and use it at least as a trading point to get the
calculation after Jan. 18 pinned down.
