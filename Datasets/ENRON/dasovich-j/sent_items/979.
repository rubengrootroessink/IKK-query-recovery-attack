Craver, Edison's CEO, is traveling and won't be back in the office until Wednesday.  I'm trying to arrange something with his office. Might need to take two cars if you've got other meetings set up.  I'll give you a call to discuss.

Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento... I can make that. Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city. Any word from SOCALED.  

Give me a call this a.m. and we can figure out travel plans.
