Thanks.  Sounds good.  Did you say that you're living out in west Marin now (one of my favorite places and old stomping grounds)? 
 
I'm one of the many, the shameful, that's not finishing (though I'll only have one class in the Spring.  Take care.
 
Best,
Jeff

Don't know him.

I am one of the few, the proud, who is graduating next semester.

Let's try to get together sometime.  I'll pass along your regards to my better half.
