Jeff,

I will call the conferencing service and change this call to Wednesday's only.  I will make sure that the same dial number will remain for this call.

Thanks!

As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:

There will not be a call this week.
Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.

If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.

Best,
Jeff
