Gee, sure was nice of Andy Fastow to wish us all happy holidays.  You see the Lehrer News Hour spot on Enron last night?  Very ugly.  Sure seems like folks will be testifying before Congress (much) rather than later...Oh, and remind me to thank Anderson for their supportive comments--looks like a mud-fight is brewing.  

Hope you're doing OK.

Best,
Jeff
