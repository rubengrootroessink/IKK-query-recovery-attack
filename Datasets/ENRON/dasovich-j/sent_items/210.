I will send you the email later today.

We were planning on looking at hotels in the Santa Cruz area again this
weekend and hanging out with Lizanne and Ken.  We are going to Napa next
weekend, so I really didn't want to go up twice.  Unlike you guys (who
practically live up there), I like to take my parents in smaller doses.  I
will be sure to send some flowers.

Eldon called me this morning informing me that it's their anniversary
this weekend. As such, I sort of tossed any other plans out the window
and told him that we'd definitely be around.  As such, I was wondering
if you guys planned to do the same, and if so, (following up on your
note Scott), it would be totally fucking cool to play golf Sunday
morning (particularly since I have not desire to sit around a and watch
football).  You guys up for golf?  You plan on doing the anniversary
thing?

Best,
Jeff
