I'm o.k. on that day (as far as I can tell).  I'll come down, but would
prefer it to be Jeff.  Original Message-----

The Latino caucus has moved the date of the dinner from September 4,
which
did not work for Enron, to September 10 at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Please
let me know if this works for everyone.

Thank you.
