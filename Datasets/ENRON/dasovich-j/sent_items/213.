This won't work.  Try again, please.


KIDDING!  Looks great.  Thanks.  I'll forward along to Greg and Brad and get back to you soon as I know something.

Toodles,
Jeff

Jeff,

It was great to talk to you today.  Thank you so much for taking the time to
hear about our latest developments.  As I said earlier, we are very
interested in talking to your folks in the Net Works group at Enron.  The
pilot we are implementing for the Enron Energy Services group is going
extremely well.  We've been on site now for about two weeks and have pretty
much completed our user training sessions.  Everyone at Enron is very
pleased with the success of the project so far.  

I think the best thing would be to schedule a meeting for sometime in
mid-October.  That way, the Pilot Program will be completely implemented and
we will have more feedback on the use of our application.  How about the
week of October 15th?  Anytime that week will work with us and, as I told
you earlier, we are in Houston very frequently.

The people who would be a part of the discussion would be Ian Sullivan (who
heads up all implementation and professional services) and myself.

If anyone would like more information about Perfect Commerce prior to the
meeting I would be more than happy to send that over.  Just let me know.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Cameron
