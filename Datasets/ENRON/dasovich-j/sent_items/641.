Cool.  If $150 don't cut it on the check, just let me know.  No sweat.  EVERYTHING is confidential.

YOur e-mails are like icebergs. Four lines of text, and then a whole mound 
of explanation underneath.

Cameron and I are talking about the golf. It's looking good, but I'm not yet 
sure what day. I'll e-mail you later with the final verdict.

And I got the check. Cheers.
