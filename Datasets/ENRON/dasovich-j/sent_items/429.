Things are ok but not very.  When do you want the wine?  I could get the
Coastal right away, but I just ordered the 97 cab this morning and we are
only allowed 12 bottles at a time.

together again for a Spades massacre?

Could you order me one case of coastal cab, one of coastal zin and one
of Mondavi 1997 cab?

PS  Last night Prentice made the most delicious porcini risotto from a
veal stock that she and Cameron made!  It was truly (no kidding)
incredible.
