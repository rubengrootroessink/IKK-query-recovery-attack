Hello Environmental and Energy Committee Members:

Please see the following request from Dr. Kenneth Lim of the BAAQMD.  The
information he seeks is in support of a petition for additional State
funding for BAAQMD programs.  I understand how short the notice is, but if
you can provide Dr. Lim some information, I think he and the BAAQMD would be
very appreciative.  If you would like to send me your data, I will forward
it to Ken Lim without your company information.

Sincerely,

Margaret Bruce
Director, Environmental Programs
Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group

     Ms. Margaret Bruce:
     SVMG

     Hi Margaret:

     I had sent this message to Justin Bradley last week, but have not
     heard back from him.  I should have sent it to you also.

     I hope that things are going well with you.

     I'm trying to assess the emissions impact of increased Back-Up
     Generator (BUG) diesel fuel use from 2000 to 2001.  I need real data
     to support an effort to get state funds to help mitigate the
     additional emissions in the Bay Area.  This is NOT for compliance,
     enforcement, or rulemaking, etc. purposes.  I could use your help.

     I would need 2000 and 2001 data for diesel fuel use or hours of BUG
     operation:

     BUG engine, hp, fuel use 2000 and 2001 to date.  One comparison might
     be 10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     We want to verify, if it is true, that business and industry felt
     compelled by the energy situation to operate their diesel BUGs more
     hours and burn more fuel (fuel readiness testing and emergency backup
     power) than in past comparable periods.

     I was hoping that you could provide some actual use data for the
     back-up diesel engines at your SVMG member companies.  I would need
     specific engine information as indicated above.  The data information
     can be as simple as total diesel fuel use for the first 9 months of
     2000 versus the first 9 mos. of 2001.  Ideally, we would prefer
     10/1/99-9/30/00 fuel use versus 10/1/00-9/30/01 use.

     I'm seeking this information at your earliest convenience (by the end
     of the day Wednesday).  Please telephone or e-mail me if you have any
     questions.  My apologies for this short notice (I did send in an
     inquiry to Justin on 10/22/01).  Thanks very much for your
     consideration.

     Ken
