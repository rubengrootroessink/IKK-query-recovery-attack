Thanks, Jeanne.

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.
