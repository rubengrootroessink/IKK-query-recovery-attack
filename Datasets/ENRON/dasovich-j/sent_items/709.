CONFIDENTIAL. Please don't distribute.  Evie's concerned that this letter might not be welcomed by or useful to Loretta.  I think it would be, but would be useful to have your/Loretta's views.
Let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a CEA thing.

(I am copying Jeff D. as a courtesy...I think we need this to be just a customer deal).
