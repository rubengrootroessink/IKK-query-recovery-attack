Nice job.  In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision? Wood throws around the $10 billion number in his questionnaire (ruling, whatever), without any substantiation whatsoever.  Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.  Seems logical though 1) logic has prevailed much lately and 2) I'm not a lawyer, so I could be missing the boat completely.

Best,
Jeff

Dorothy -- Attached is a another version of the letter that takes a little
different approach.  What do you think?  I worried that your first letter
looks a little like an invitation to pile on the exit fees, of all types and
in any magnitude.  I think we need to attack the premise that any DA causes
an increase in DWR costs for other customers.  Bill

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a
CEA thing.

(I am copying Jeff D. as a courtesy...I think we need this to be just a
customer deal).
