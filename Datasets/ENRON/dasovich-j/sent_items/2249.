Thanks again for the stuff.  I can take it from here.  Two quick questions.
1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about?
2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?

Thanks again.  I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.

Best,
Jeff
