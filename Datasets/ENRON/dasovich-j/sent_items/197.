That's exactly right.  But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.

Best,
Jeff

PS Can you give a call when you get a minute at 415.782.7822?  Thanks.

It was held only after Brown insisted that it be held and only after Loretta
took a voice vote to over-rule Brown's hold.  Duque and Bilas joined Brown
in taking the item off the agenda.  I saw Brown this morning.  He's pissed
and he called Loretta a liar.  Somehow, he knew what was going to happen and
he prevented it.

Well, it looks like Loretta isn't as smart as she thinks she is....
