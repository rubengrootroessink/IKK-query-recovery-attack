Steve:  the decision we talked about yesterday is to cover DWR costs for the period Jan. '01-Dec' 02.  Recall that SDG&E did not get the rate increases that PG&E and Edison got.  The charge (I believe) is $14.6/Mwh on a system ave. basis.  If there's anything else you need, let me know.  This decision does not deal with the "undercollection" SDG&E has accrued due to the price cap put in place by previous Legislation.

Best,
Jeff
