Traded calls.  I'll get back to you soon as we hook up.  Can't wait to hear what Jerry says.  Probably something like, "Talked to Tom Beach.  Heard about your plan.  We'll call you."  Or who knows.  He could surprise us.  I'll let you know either way.

Best,
Jeff

You won't believe this.  Jerry Bloom left me a message.  Wants to talk, though I wouldn't get my hopes up.  I'll let you know what he says.

Best,
Jeff
