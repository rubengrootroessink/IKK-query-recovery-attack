Greetings folks.  The folks doing the appeal have asked me to inquire if you folks would be willing to sign on.  They understand (as do we) that the likelihood of prevailing is slim, but feel that beating the drum is important in continued effort to maintain current DA status and to attempt to preserve it going forward.  (DA seems to need all the help it can muster given that Karl Wood and Bob Barnett appear to have control of the issue at the PUC.) Could you let me know either way if you'll sign on.  Dorothy, talked to Keith yesterday, who said you'd be making the call on this one.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Hello lawyers,

Attached is a draft of an appeal to the Sup Ct. of the CPUC's decision
to suspend DA.  The authors would like review and comment and to
consider joining the petition. Comments back to Jeff Dasovich asap, they
want to file by Nov 9.
