Hi Barry:

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff
