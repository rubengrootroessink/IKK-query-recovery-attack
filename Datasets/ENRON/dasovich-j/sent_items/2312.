Dan: Looks good.  Sue calls me a party-pooper, but I've hi-lighted areas (in bold italics) that I think would benefit from some smoothing of the edges.  Not that I don't very much enjoy reading it.  I do.  I'm just concerned that it will unnecessarily create additional hostility in what is already--as you know--an incredibly hostile environment.  Thanks again.
 
Best,
Jeff

Jeff, I never received your input for the filing due Wedensday regarding the utilities' joint filing on DA suspension.  Could you please give me a call or email whatever you have?  Thanks!
