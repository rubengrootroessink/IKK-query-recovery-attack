Mike:  Does that legislation that passed a couple of years ago(?) that gives the Governor the power to appoint the PUC president also give the Senate advise and consent rights on the appointment of the president?  I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

IEP reported on its Leg call today that Burton told Davis -- don't even think about trying to replace Loretta as the President of the CPUC because she is the only President he will support (the Senate has to approve the appointment, apparently)
