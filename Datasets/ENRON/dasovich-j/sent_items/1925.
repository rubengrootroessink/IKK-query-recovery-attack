It's true.  I drew the short straw and will participate in place of Rob Bradley, who will be elsewhere on that day.

Best,

We just received a letter from the California State University, Sacramento,
announcing their Thirteenth Annual Envisioning California Conference: Our
Year of Disconnect; The Politics of Power in California on October 4 and 5.
The letter claims that Enron is participating in the conference and we
wanted to know if this was accurate, and if so, who?
