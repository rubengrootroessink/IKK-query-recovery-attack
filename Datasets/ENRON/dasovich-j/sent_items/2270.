I like it for 2 reasons:
 
1.    The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical.
 
2.    If we got this "gift", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state.
 
Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.

Assembly Member Tim Leslie is interested in sponsoring a bill which would
grant air credits to prospective power plant owners in exchange for using
reclaimed water.  The bill is in its infancy and none of the details have
been worked out.  His office would like to know if Enron would be interested
in providing technical assistance with the measure.  They approached Enron
because of the Roseville plant, recognizing that Roseville already has its
air credits and is already scheduled to use reclaimed water.

Thoughts?
