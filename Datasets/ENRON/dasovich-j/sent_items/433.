Dan: 

EPUC will be filing a response on Friday, supporting the CMTA/CLECA/CIU and AReM/WPTF applications for rehearing. Christine Jun from our office will be heading this effort. Could you please email to her a final of your application, which we apparently have not yet received?  Thank you.  

Evie
