I think that we should pursue both.  If we can convince the PUC that it's a good deal, and that it ought to include a dedicated rate component to cover it.  If the PUC agrees, then the rate component should cover PG&E's concern and they should be able to go forward.  Thoughts?

By the way.  I have gotten positive responses from most of the biomass guys in PG&E territory.  Covanta, Wheelabrator and Burney have all indicated that they would likely bid in their bio assets if this structure were available.  Unfortunately all of these are PG&E QFs.

FYI. Put another call into Bloom.  I'm sure he'll get back to me soon, but you know how busy these important lawyers are...

Best,
