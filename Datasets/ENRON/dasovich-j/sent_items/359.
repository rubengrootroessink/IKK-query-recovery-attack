hey, prentice has a friend in town whom you may have met.  very cool, very funny.  we'd bring her along if that's ok, and if you still want to get together tonite, which we're totally up for. let me know.  and it would be a good idea to get together since we should probably talk a bit about Jay's place.  he's been inquiring about what we're thinking.

best,
jeff
