I would have been happy to let you have it.  You still can, you know.  Just let me know (though we love to keep it).  We're allegedly going to the dome this weekend, so perhaps we could pick it up on our way back on Sunday.  But if that's a bother, don't worry about it--we can do it another time.  And what about those 9-ers?

So did I!!  Thank you for the check - I appreciate it.  I was actually kind
of hoping you wouldn't want it!  It is such great wine and I did not expect
her to give me the 50% off or I would have bought more!  When would you be
around to pick up your other wine?  I don't want to order it and have it
sitting in our clean garage!  Also the check you sent for golf was too much
because you guys walked and did not take a cart.  You should have paid $80 -
so you have an $80 credit toward wine.

Miss you guys

Thanks so much for the Storybook wine.  Extremely sweet of you, and we
really appreciate it.  I gave Eldon the check for it.  Man, did we get
CREAMED in the pool.  Sigh....

Best,
Jeff
