Dave and I are supposed to be in a meeting in Sacramento with John White at 1 PM in Sacramento.  So the timing may be tight.  Perhaps we could do 4 PM?

Best,
Jeff

Cristina, I am not sure what either Dave's or Jeff's schedule looks like but wanted to see if either would be available for a meeting  with Michael Tribolet and myself on Wednesday afternoon in SF.  Could you let me know.  It would likely be after 3:30 in the afternoon.
