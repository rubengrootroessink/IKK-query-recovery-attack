Nancy:

Here is the final.  Couple things.  The short answers are in the word document.  The long answers  are in two separate excel files.  I used the spreadsheet that you gave us to do the last long answer (the Fannie Mae question).  You can find the answer in a tab titled "Long Answer--Question IIb" and it's highlighted by yellow background.  The data for the problem is in the "data" tab.

Thanks again for a fantastic course and hope to run into you in the near future.

All the best,
Jeff
