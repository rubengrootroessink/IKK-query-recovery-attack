I'll be in the office very shortly.  My converstation with Fielder (SCE SVP I've been talking to about the PX credit) yesterday afternoon regarding the settlement was not very fulfilling:
 

he said there's still disagreement about what they owe us for the PX credit
he made a point to include in our conversation the provision in the settlement that requires Edison to "cooperate" with the AG and the PUC in litigation against generators/marketers

I told him that we needed to get the payment issue resolved very quickly.  He said that they needed a day or two to regroup and that they intended to call each and every creditor to discuss next steps.

Michael:  I call you soon as I get in--next 15-30 minutes.

 

Best,

Jeff

reliant guy, mike jines, called me about the deal with the cpuc. he thinks they will get injured and that sce will just continue the same path of doing nothing for the generators and the marketers.
he wants to talk mid-morning houston time after we've digested for our view.
with the settlement of the filed rate case, what does that do for us re the ctc claim? presumably they would pay as there would be no argument not to. am i in the right place? i hate to be too logical here. jeff saw your earlier email re your discussions but i've been in another crisis. need to decide what to do tomorrow, or, i realize, TODAY, AS IT IS NOW AFTER MIDNIGHT. michael, can you get with jeff early and start getting  our view as i finish the other crisis stuff first in the am???
