Great.  Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.  You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?  I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.  I'm thinking that I may want to attend.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

If you haven't heard, SoCal's announced their abandoning windows for OFOs.  They're holding "workshops" on how it will all work soon.  I'll get you the announcement.

Best,
Jeff
