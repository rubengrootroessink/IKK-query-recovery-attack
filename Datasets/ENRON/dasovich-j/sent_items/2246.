No problem.  Man, for someone who doesn't know much, you sure know alot, based on the note you sent.  It's your call on today's lesson.  If you're feeling under the weather, then we can pass for today.  Otherwise, I'll show up at 4:30.  Just let me know.  And you can decide anytime between now and 3:30.  I don't know how much Eldon and Rory can help, but they're both real knowledgeable and generally love thinking about this kind of stuff.
 
Best,
Jeff

Hi Jeff - Here's the deal, I've had a cold for a few days. I'm probably past the contagious stage but this is not an exact science. I'm up for teaching today but I figure it's fair to let people know in case they're concerned. I'll see you at 4:30 unless I hear from you in which case I'll understand. Hey, thanks for facilitating this little DAW discussion group. I think I understand the procedure now. I had to hunt around a little for the "reply to all" command(not on my tool bar), but I found it. Now I'm ready. I'm still learning about a lot of this stuff. Later - Avram
