"Democratic leaders may bounce a Kern County lawmaker off a special committee considering a $2.9 billion rescue
plan for financially ailing Southern California Edison Co. because he says he probably will vote against the plan.
Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter, said he will resist any move to replace him with another Democrat pledged to
vote for the plan." (Bakersfield Californian 8-29-01).
