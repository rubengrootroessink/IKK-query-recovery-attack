I'll give you a call.  Man, were you all over NPR or what with that Telco story?  Give my best to Tina.

Best,
Jeff

Hey Great to hear from you.

I CAN BE REACHED AT 415-713-4473 (this is my cell
phone and you can reach me on it anytime.)

I was just going to call you.  I just left the Yankee
Group and am looking for my next opportunity.  That
gig was just not working out for me and I decided to
move on. Tina and I are now living in Albuquerque NM
and searching for some new opportunities.  I'd love to
get back to California, but am looking elsewhere as
well.   

Hope all is well.  Take care.

Give me a ring sometime.  

Bob Lane
