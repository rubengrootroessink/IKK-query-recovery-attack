Hear you're in London.  Hope you're OK.  Unfathomable tragedy.
 
We're going to hold our 11:30 call in an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy.  Call will be brief.  With respect to Hap, John's asked me to hold off talking to him until John signals.  I agreed.  I'll keep you posted.  The State Capitol is closed down completely today.  Be safe.
 
Best,
Jeff
