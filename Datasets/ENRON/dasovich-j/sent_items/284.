ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE
     In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray 
Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the 
paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of 
California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With 
commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the 
Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that 
requires customers to buy power from their local utility company 
is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy 
purchases.
     The negative impact on California businesses, some already 
in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and 
discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. 
It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an 
economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County 
Register via Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Sept. 25, 
http://www.ocregister.com ).
