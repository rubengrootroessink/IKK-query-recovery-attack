rent "true grit."  very cool. I highly recommend--from a great coming-of-age girl's novel.  also try "wake of the red witch."  and, of course, "stagecoach."

Wait.  You mean that the first time you've seen John Wayne in a movie,
or John Wayne being spooky?

Yes.  As I have said before, I can take mom and dad only in small doses.
They fight too much for me.

We went home and watched The Searchers.  I had never seen it.  It was
great!!

Yeah.  Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in
finance tomorrow nite. Sigh...

Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your
folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were
glad just to get home and relax.

I thought the whole weekend was a total blast.  It was great having both
of
you there!!  I think every one had a very good time. There is no
possible
way that we could have done anything more in one weekend.  Pumpkin
carving,
abalone, piano roles, bluegrass, good meals, monopoly, scrabble and then
the
most incredible weather I have ever had up there!!

It was really fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  It was great to get
to play together.  I'll get Scott a check for our share of the goodies.
Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
