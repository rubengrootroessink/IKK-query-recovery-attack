Thank you so much for all you've done for Annie.  You know that I've really come to love that crazy dog, and it meant a lot that you and Eldon were always so caring.  She is truly a lovely dog and I'll miss her immensely, but it helps that everyone was so loving.  And I'm really sorry that I couldn't be there for her today, but the Enron thing is really a mess and I've got responsibilities on that front that I just can't pass off. Thanks again so much for everything.

Hugs,
Jeff
