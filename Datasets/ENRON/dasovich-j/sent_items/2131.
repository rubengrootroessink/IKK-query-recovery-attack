Got your message.  As soon as I get a hold of Williams--not sure where he is--we'll have the call.  Hopefully we can do it within the next 30 minutes or so. That work for you?  And when it happens, I can conference folks in using my phone.  What's your direct dial.

Best,
Jeff

P.S. Sanity is a good thing.
