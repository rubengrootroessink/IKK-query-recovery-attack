Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
