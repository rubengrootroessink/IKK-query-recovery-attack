Here's my take.  Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the "Estate" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.  

Best,
Jeff

It makes no sense to me to engage our lobbyists in the meeting.  There is no next year for them--i.e., we will not be retaining them in 2002--unless things change dramatically.  

So ....

Paul, Jeff:

I got on the IEP Board distribution list (Parquet is also on it).  Are there any actions we need to take with our Sacto lobbiests that I can help with?

Alan

Dear IEP Board Member,

During the December 13th IEP Board Planning Meeting, a special session for
Board Members and your contract Lobbyist is being planned.  This special
session will be held between 1:00 pm and 3:00 p.m., Sterling Hotel,
Sacramento.   This memo is sent to you as a notice so that, if possible, you
can arrange for your contract Lobbyist to be available during that time.
Please don't hesitate to contact IEP if you have any questions.
