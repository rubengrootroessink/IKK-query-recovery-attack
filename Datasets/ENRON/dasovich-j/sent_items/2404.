I'd love tickets. but don't kill yourself over.  Get better--cold's not bad, but it's damned annoying.

Snorkel?  I'm not sure I understand the reference. 
Naturally, my mind leaps readily to the vulgar and
prurient:  I could guess that one would use such a
device if one were kissing ass so deeply that one
would suffocate without a piped-in air supply
(crikey!), but then, having a snorkel in one's mouth
would render one unable to kiss effectively--ass or
otherwise--thereby defeating the purpose of said
object.  Just--a--hold your breath, shut your eyes and
pucker up, I always say.  With practice, one should
get along fine without additional devices.

heh heh, sheesh.

Thanks for the warning, though, as I will undoubtedly
have a hangover Saturday morning resulting from our
company Xmas party on the preceding evening.
  
I too am coming down with a cold, so next week will be
okay with me, but is Monday night free?  I have Bach's
Christmas Oratorio with the Symphony all the rest of
the week.  If you and Prentice are interested, I might
be able to get you tickets.
