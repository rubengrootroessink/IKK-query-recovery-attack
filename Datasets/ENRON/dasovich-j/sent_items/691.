Forgive my ignorance, but I'm assuming that "related party transactions" refers to the Fastow deals?

Sue- 
FYI- we issued the attached release this morning. I know our govt affairs teams will have lots of questions and will probably be asked several questions.  Unfortunately, given the legal nature of this inquiry, we cannot say anything more than this at this time.  We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this.  Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning.  It would be a good idea for everyone to tune in, if possible (or review the playback later in the day.) 

I am also attaching a brief INTERNAL Q&A about the SEC request- just to give a little more information.

Thanks-
Meredith
