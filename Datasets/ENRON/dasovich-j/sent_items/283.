He believes his interests are aligned with Jeremy's.  He is TOTALLY on board with our approach -- agrees that we must try to get DA reinstated.  He said we have the worst of all possible worlds right now -- no DA and uncertain rules.  He realizes hedging is a problem with the uncertain rules but can deal with it.
