Here it is.  It's somewhat quick, but I don' t know what your timeline is (hopefully quick).  Let me know what you think (hope you don't mind that I modified your title).

Any word from Loretta re: whether a letter from big customers would help in the fight against tantrums from Angelides?

Best,
Jeff
