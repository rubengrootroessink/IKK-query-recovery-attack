Subject: Pulling it all together in one place


I am sick of keeping track of lots of little documents, so I have assembled in one document and attached the latest version of my contract descriptions.  I have addressed Stefan Bird's comments, cleaned up the Calpine peakers piece to answer Rich Ferguson's questions, and made a few other generally minor revisions.
