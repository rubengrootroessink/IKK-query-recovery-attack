They're yours.  Just let me know as soon as you can if you'd like them.  Hope you're doing well.  Stay buckled up.  It's bumpy out there.  But at least they're starting to publicly clean house.

Best,
Jeff

April:  Could you please distribute this to the office?  Thanks a bunch.

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Best,
Jeff
