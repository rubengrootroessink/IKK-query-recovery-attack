"The Administration does not project that the State will need to make addit=
ional State loans to support the DWR Power Supply Program even if DWR does =
not issue its revenue bonds as planned during the 2001-02 fiscal year. DWR =
projects that its funds on hand at the date of this Official Statement and =
projected revenues appear to be sufficient to finance the Power Supply Prog=
ram. The cash needs of the Power Supply Program depend, among other things,=
 on future power purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from pow=
er sales, the availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of t=
he issuance of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and =
advances from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001,=
 to amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500=
 million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days. However, =
the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to order additi=
onal loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further mitigate the emerg=
ency.

=09The State expects to maintain adequate cash reserves to fund its normal =
operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year whether or not DWR repays the Sta=
te loans during the fiscal year. The State plans to issue short-term notes =
to assure that adequate cash balances are maintained. The State has regular=
ly issued short-term debt in the past to meet its cash flow needs. See 'Sta=
te Indebtedness-Cash Flow Borrowings.'"
