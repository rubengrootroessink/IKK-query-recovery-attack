If you're referring to the Tues/Thur call, we've talked some and thought we'd go to once per week with Sacramento folks having the option of callling in, since the Legislature's gone until January. You have thoughts on the Monday call?  That one may not be as critical anymore.
 
Best,
Jeff

Should we set up a different call schedule for CA given the new environment - maybe just once a week?
 
If we do, we need to send out a notice to the key business people.
 
Thanks
