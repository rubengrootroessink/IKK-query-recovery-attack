WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's a=
pproach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle w=
ants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other init=
iatives popular with Democrats.  Daschle's aides and party strategists say =
the Senate's top Democrat wants to keep the White House on the defensive, d=
raw attention to popular Democratic goals such as promoting conservation an=
d alternate power sources, and inoculate his party against Republicans' cha=
rges that it has ignored the country's energy needs. Activists on both side=
s see potential for compromises that would lead to legislation Bush can sig=
n. =09

   "With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you g=
o with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people act=
ually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."  De=
mocrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.=
 Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bus=
h is handling energy and environmental issues.  What's more, the House of R=
epresentatives voted to block the administration from drilling for oil and =
gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great Lakes. Both measures passed w=
ith support from 70 Republicans.  "When the Republican-controlled House sou=
ndly rejects key components of the president's energy policy, it signals an=
 opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus that begins in the center," sa=
id Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.  The decision to highlight energy policy=
 came late last week after Daschle met privately with his chairmen of key c=
ommittees. Democrats present also called for action on raising the minimum =
wage, hate-crimes legislation, a prescription-drug plan for seniors and oth=
er issues popular with their supporters.  But concentrating on energy polic=
y first gives Democrats an opportunity to seize what has been a Republican =
issue and turn it to their advantage, aides said.  Bush and Vice President =
Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former Texas oilmen. From th=
e moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production to satisfy the energ=
y needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush and him as beholden =
to special interests.  "The White House and Republicans are in the 35 perce=
nt end of public opinion on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who sp=
oke on condition of anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for =
the Republicans."  With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the N=
ew Mexico Democrat who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources comm=
ittee, plan to have a comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. I=
t will be a full- scale alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in =
May.  The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as nex=
t week, when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Departme=
nt. Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fendin=
g off Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling ne=
ar Florida beaches and on national monument lands.  The White House helped =
defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier this week by scaling bac=
k its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge disagreements remain o=
ver drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a centerpiece of =
Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer an amendment to the Inte=
rior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in the refuge.  Democrats a=
lso want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of pollutants=
 that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines conservati=
on and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements for spor=
t utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel econo=
my standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later thi=
s month.  The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle =
extra manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republ=
icans such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Co=
llins, both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.  Sen. John Mc=
Cain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill of rights=
 and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more conservatio=
n measures than the White House proposes.  "He'll be very prominent in cobb=
ling a centrist coalition on the issue," said Marshall Wittman, a senior fe=
llow at the conservative Hudson Institute research center and a political a=
dviser to McCain. "You can already see the outlines of that proposal -- enc=
ouragement of conservation, some exploration, but everything is environment=
ally friendly."  The White House already has reacted to the criticism of it=
s energy policies. Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spend=
ing for renewable energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He als=
o has paid more attention to energy conservation, indicating support for sp=
ending on efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.  But the=
 president is not backing away from his position that the United States nee=
ds to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House officials=
 say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States. The energ=
y plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in the Alas=
kan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to pay f=
or research into alternative energy sources.  In addition to public disappr=
oval of his stands on the environment and energy, the president is losing t=
he sense of urgency that initially accompanied his energy proposals. Rollin=
g blackouts in California are on the wane, gasoline prices are falling and =
last week John Browne, the chief executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call=
 for new oil refineries.  That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue =
and attack the president without competing pressure from the public for qui=
ck solutions.  "It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a polit=
ical scientist at the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Lik=
e the patients' bill of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, e=
nergy right now "is low-hanging fruit," he said.  =09
