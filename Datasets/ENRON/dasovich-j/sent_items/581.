Playboy Online staff cutbacks

Playboy Enterprises  plans to cut about a third of the jobs in 
its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As 
part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media 
company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. 
Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six 
months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its 
service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can 
look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we 
look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it 
well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.
