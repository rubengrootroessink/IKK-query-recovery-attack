Religion, huh?  Interesting.  Your folks may disown you, though.  I don't know how you could think that cooking would be more fun than bond finance--you crazy?

The Pilot: I need to know exactly what the pilot is and with whom your doing it.  Yes, I need the champion's name, and fast.

The meetings will work, but I forgot, what week?  Next week or week after?  (May want to wait until plane service gets normal?)

Have fun in SC--why don't you guys live there?  Not a bad commute for you; Scott can surf; we can come down and play bluegrass!  Sell the flat, dammit.

Kisses,
Jeff

PS Colleen doing OK?  I can come by after class on Wednesday--class is at Boalt, so we get out at 8:30, you know what slackers law students are....

Nope.  She was in NY last week, though.  Scary.

I have class on Tuesday and Wednesday now also!!  On Tuesdays I have a
religion class through UC Extension (its all on how the different religions
view "why we are here").  Pretty relevant for today, huh?

On Wednesdays I am taking a cooking class at home chef in Laurel Village.
Should be fun.

Bet my classes are better than your classes.

The pilot at Enron is going EXTREMELY well.  I will get you the name of our
champion.  He wants to introduce this all over Enron.  Energy Services just
loves it.  Ian has been living out there in Houston for almost two weeks
now.

How are the meetings coming along with Deal Bench and Net Works?

We are still in Santa Cruz - we'll be back tomorrow, hopefully we'll see you
Wed night after class??

Colleen is coming over for dinner next Tuesday and we are going to make
some
lavish dinner from gourmet recipes.  Let me know if you guys want to be
there so we can plan and get enough for you.
