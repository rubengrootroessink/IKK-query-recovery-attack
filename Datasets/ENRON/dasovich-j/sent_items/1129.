Sam:  Congratulations.  But I've been informed that the buring chicken in the office kitchen ate up about 10% of the emission credits previously secured for the plant.  The CEC is revising the credit numbers and may have to modify today's decision as a result.

Best,

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.
