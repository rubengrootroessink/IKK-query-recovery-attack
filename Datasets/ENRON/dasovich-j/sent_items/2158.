Thanks for your efforts, thanks for trying, and thanks for your strong sense of decency.  If there's anything whatsoever I can do to assist, don't hesitate.

10 to 20 people can bring down what thousands have built...we're proving that. I am deeply saddened and angry at what has occoured, but it's beyond my control to fix. This has been a special place for me and so many others...perhaps we can preserve some of that...We'll at least try.
