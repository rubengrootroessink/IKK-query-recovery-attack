Subject:	Edison's Argument Regarding PX Credit

I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:

1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and,
2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.

Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
