Jim:
Let Jeremy know that there will be some big dogs (i.e., large customers) coming out with guns a'blazin' on this and that we're working closely with them.

Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?

Best,
Jeff

Sue -

Received your voice mail.  Having AReM only file is ok with me.  Spoke with Lamar Frazier - Jeremy sounds worried.  Let's make sure that the contract question is vetted with internal and external lawyers - agree not to give CPUC any info.

Thanks,

Jim
