Since it was only Friday since Delainey directed me to send info directly to him, I included him and the others on the last note in order to avoid looking like I was disobeying direct orders 48 hours after receiving them.  Hopefully we can work something out where you distribute as you deem fit.  Hope it's not creating undue headaches.

Best,
Jeff
