Professor:
Thanks for the response.  However, I sent you a copy with a few egregious typos.  Since it is still October 31, I hope you'll discard that copy and replace it with this one, which I think is now typo-free.  My apologies for the mix-up and thanks for your consideration.  You'll note that this copy is dated "1031,"  whereas the previous copy was dated "1029."

Best,
Jeff
