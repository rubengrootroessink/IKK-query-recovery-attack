In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.  Noncore customes receive cheaper transporation rates.I'm not sure what sort of limitations you're specifically focused on.  There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past "stranded costs" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Per our conversation, I am trying to put together some data on the status of gas markets in California, Nevada, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Oregon.  In particular I need the gas market characteristics in these states.  Are the markets open to retail competition for commercial and industrial customers and if so, what are the requirements and are there some limitations.  Please E-mail me your response as I will be in Long Beach tomorrow.

Thanks.
