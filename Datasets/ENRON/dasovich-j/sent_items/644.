Ridota's a tough customer.  Very political type--knee-capper from the Wilson administration who was involved in the conflicts between Fessler and Knight, large customers and utilities, etc.  DA and Dereg done right (i.e., California never de-regulated) sound good.  May want to add the great job Davis did at locking a generation of Californians into $46 billion of contracts.  Maybe, on the energy issue, Riordin wants to look like a statesman, saying that if he were governor, he'd get everyone to the table to settle this thing once and for all--law suits, bad DWR contracts, ensuring customers have choices.

Gary Ackerman was contacted by the campaign and agreed to meet with them on the 22nd. He will meet with Joe Ridota who is responsible for energy policy.  Gary would like some direction -- I'll be chatting with Gary on DA and let's do deregulation right.  ANything else you'd like to me pass along?
