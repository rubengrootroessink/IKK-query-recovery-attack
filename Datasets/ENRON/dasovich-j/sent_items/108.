Got Mark's number.  I'm going to call him today.  Any specific info you'd like to have, or just generally what he and DWR are up to on the gas side.  I also assume that we'd like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities?

Best,
Jeff

Greetings:

1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.

2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff
