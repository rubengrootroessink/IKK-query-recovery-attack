You've really been nice about this.  Thanks very much.  Could I stay in SF and work for NEG?  And  people don't really hate me, do they?  (Kidding.)  I'll give Dan a call.  Have a great weekend.

Best,
Jeff

FYI.  You should call him.  Geez, I'd like a job at NEG......and I don't
hate you, but there are some Neanderthals around here who hated Enron...
