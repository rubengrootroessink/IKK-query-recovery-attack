Don't hate me for sending a note.  What do you think?
"California made two big mistakes:  First, they never made a market.  They didn't deregulate.  They just re-regulated the failed monopoly structure they'd been living with for decades.  Second, when the first mistake led to an energy crisis, California's leaders didn't stop, learn from their mistakes, and get deregulation right.  Instead, they blamed everyone but themselves, including Enron.  Those mistakes led to the nightmare California's been living for over a year now, and they still California still has woken up."
"Enron's the model of the virtual organization.  Whether the problem's in California, or India or Sweden, Enron creates the virtual organization needed to solve the problem.  That's what we did in California.  Houston is definitely the brain, but you need all the other limbs and organs to function well.  What makes the "virtual" part of it work is a committed management team, great technology and an incredible team of talented, flexible folks from across the company.  That allowed us to coordinate extremely well under challenging conditions. It's been a great experience."
