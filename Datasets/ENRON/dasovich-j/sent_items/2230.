This is very sad.  Prentice (now one of PWC's finest) and I talked and here's where I come out.  I love Annie and want to remember her the way she is.  And I bet she would feel the same way.  All the chemo gets her is a little more time, and who knows how long, and the quality of extended life is likely to be very low.  It's really hard, but I think that the best thing for Annie, and everyone else, is for Annie to go to sleep, peacefully and quietly.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to pass on the 6 o'clock phone call.  I hope you understand.  I'll be at your place on Thursday to see her.

Best,
Jeff

We need to have a conference call all together tonight to discuss how to
move forward with Annie.  She has cancer and without treatment would
probably live only a few weeks.  Chemotherapy could prolong her life
reasonably comfortably from 6 months to a year.  The minimum cost would be
about $1,500.  I think it would be best if we all got on the phone together
around 6 - does that work for all of you??
