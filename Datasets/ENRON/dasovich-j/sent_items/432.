That's great.  More the merrier.
 
I assume you heard about what happened at the PUC today.  I think it classfies as amazing.  The planets may be favorably re-aligning just a little bit (one hopes).
 
Best,
Jeff

Dan: 

EPUC will be filing a response on Friday, supporting the CMTA/CLECA/CIU and AReM/WPTF applications for rehearing. Christine Jun from our office will be heading this effort. Could you please email to her a final of your application, which we apparently have not yet received?  Thank you.
