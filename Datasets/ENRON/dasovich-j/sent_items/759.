Greetings:
Thanks for talking the other day.  Quick question.  Are the minimum flows at Blythe set in the BCAP?  Presumably, SoCal's 100% at risk for the flows/dollars once they're set?  Or is there some proportionate sharing?  And what's the sharing, if any on the upside?  If I'm missing something, or don't have this right, let me know.

Best,
Jeff
