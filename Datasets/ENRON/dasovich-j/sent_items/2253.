Hi Evie:
As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a "reasonable" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?
 
Best,
Jeff
