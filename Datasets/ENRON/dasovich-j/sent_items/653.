Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
