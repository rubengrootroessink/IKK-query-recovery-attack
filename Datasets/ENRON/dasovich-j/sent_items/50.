CLECA, CIU and the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group have also come out wi=
th all guns blazing against the draft decision dealing with the DWR revenue=
 requirement.  They decry the lack of hearings, state that there are fundam=
ental untruths in the decision and conclude that, "The DWR has made it clea=
r that it needs to have a decision on its revenue requirements quickly so t=
hat it can successfully issue bonds to generate revenue to re-pay the gener=
al fund.  No one has been permitted to test that proposition, but it seems =
to be accepted as fact by decision makers.  The problem is that this record=
 does not support approval of any particular revenue requirement for DWR an=
d it certainly does not support the allocation proposed in the DD.  If the =
Commission must act quickly, then it must act provisionally and set for fur=
ther hearings the many questions identified here and, we suspect, in the co=
mments of many other interested parties concerning the basis of the allocat=
ion among the utilities."
