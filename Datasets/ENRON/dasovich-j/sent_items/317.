I'm off the bottle for a few weeks to get a true read on my cholesterol. Seems alcohol is processed first by the liver and is converted quite readily into fats that then become precursors to cholesterol ....  Feels good, easy to do......

talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  andw e're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
