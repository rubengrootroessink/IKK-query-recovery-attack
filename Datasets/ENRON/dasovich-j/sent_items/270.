Two things:  When Aleck said that he was leaving "effective immediately," does that mean one can't use email to send him a note to wish him well?  If that's the case, do we have a forwarding telephone number for him?

Also, just wanted to make sure you're aware that Calger continues to express concerns about us having any fingerprints on any attacks on the contracts.  His concerns are two-fold:  Generally, he thinks it would be very damaging to our commercial reputation, since many of the folks holding the lousy contracts are folks we regularly transact with. And specifically, we're tied up with Allegheny (sp?).  

I've told him that we don't like the contracts, that we're talking to folks about how bad they are, but we're "staying under radar" and stating publicly that we never support the unilateral abrogation of anyone's contract rights.
