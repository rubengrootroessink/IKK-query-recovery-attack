If NYG win - tied for 3rd
If Denver - around 8th (along with a lot of others)

We are OUT of the pool.  I want my money back.  Prentice, please get
your stuff out of my apartment.  You can have the cats.

Love,
Jeff

Thanks for helping, Nancy. So what place are we in?

As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice
message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the
paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the
games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle
and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that
you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on
the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered
all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what
you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm
sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when
you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?
