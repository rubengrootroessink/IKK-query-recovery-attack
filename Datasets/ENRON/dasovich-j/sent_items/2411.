Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Jeff
