Ok.  How about this. If you don't hear back for a week, THEN ping him and
ask for a date the first week of November????

Really don't want to write anymore notes.  while he's a friend, and i've
known him since he was a lowly VP, sending lots of emails to CEOs, even
in a flat org. like enron, is, well, bad form.  let's see what happens.
just let ian know that there's a chance that the meeting might take
place prior to the EES debrief.  The cooking thing is great.  The
funniest thing is that Prentice has always said that she hates rice, and
therefore risotto.  so i'm psyched.

Maybe you could send an email to them now explaining when the pilot is
supposed to finish and that it might be better to schedule after that
date.
That way you are also bringing us up and having them think about us
again.
Pure psychology.

I think PP really liked the cooking class.  She looked cute in the apron
and
she now knows everything about soaking and draining mushrooms.  Did she
tell
you that she is going to make you risotto (with out OWN veal stock) next
Monday night???

babe, if they get back to me with a date that week, i think that you
ought to just have the meeting, understanding that the meeting with
execs may not have occured yet.  nevertheless, you'll have a darned good
idea by that time whether its working well or it's a flop, non?

anywho, let's see what response i get back.  maybe they'll want to push
back.

her hair looked really good (it was pretty all over the place
previously).  now, with a few professional flourishes, she look even
more gorgeous (if that's possible).

best,
Jeff

OK, so the oct 15th date is a little too early.  The pilot review with
execs
at enron is at the end of the month.  SO, we should target early
November
for this meeting.  Can you help facilitate that?

What did you think of PP's hair.  I was shocked.  It looked really good!

We are tentatively scheduled for a Pilot Review with the VP of EES on
10/30
in Houston, so early Nov. for this meeting is probably the best bet.

I pushed this date way out.  We can easily push it out more. Jeff fully
understands that we want to schedule this meeting after the pilot has
been
completed (not get in the way, see the real value of the system
first...etc.).  My question to you is when is the pilot scheduled to be
completed so I have a time frame on when these discussions might take
place.

Thanks,
Cameron

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project-we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES-acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time-the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff
