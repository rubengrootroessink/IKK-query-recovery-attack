Janelle:
Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to Marcie.  Let me know what you think.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Marcie:

	Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  Elena tells me that you're having a great time.

	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  

	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.

Here are some of the program's highlights:

Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.

Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. 

Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities

Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.

Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.

Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. 

	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.

All the best,
Jeff
