Ah ha.  Now I see why you were asking.  So sorry that you "have to visit" Maui.  Tough break.

I am planning to take 5 days around Thanksgiving.  I will be gone on Nov 19-21 (M-T-W) and also Nov 26 and 27 (M-T).  ALtogether, I'll be gone the week of the 19th and the first two days of the following week. I'll return in Nov 28. We just have to visit the in-laws who live in Maui.
