OK, dude.  Now that I'm a full-fledged slacker, please tell me how much you need us to contribute for the weekend, which I'll add on to the $65 you paid for the guitar.  If I'm missing any other expenses, please let me know and tack them on.  It was alot of fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.

Best,
Jeff
