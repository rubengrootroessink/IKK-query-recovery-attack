Might be able to do Sunday morning.  Eldon's going to check and see if there's a tee time.  Will report back as the news breaks.

FYI - Eldon has rehearsal/concerts on both Sat and Sun which means you
really can't play NVCC - however, there are certainly other places that you
could play - Silverado, Kennedy, etc.

I have a mandolin lesson at 11am on Saturday, which I can't miss because Tom

is teaching me less these days. That means I can be up in Napa for a 2 pm 
tee-off. Or, we can play on Sunday at 1 or so, after the first set of games?

Or earlier, if you want. How does that sound? Let me know.
