Hi Glen:
Two things.  1) If you'd like me to join in on the call on Wednesday to determine what TW should do regarding the re-surfacing of the SoCal settlement, I'd be happy to join.  Just let me know.  2) Are you going to the SoCal "no more windows" meeting on Thursday?  I'd planned to go but it looks like I might have a conflict now.  I'd like to get a copy of anything they hand out at the meeting.  And if anyone provides any summaries, that would also be useful.  Let me know if you plan to attend.  If you don't, know sweat.

Best,
Jeff
