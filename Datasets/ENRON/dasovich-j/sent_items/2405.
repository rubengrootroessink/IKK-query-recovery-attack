The trust could not run deeper.  Just to clarify, we'll want to focus solely and exclusively on the registration.  We're not in arrears on the bond.....yet.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

Jeanne, with Heather's assistance, please contact Jeff D. ASAP and get  the
details so that Enron (I believe the EES and EEMC entities are at issue, but
I do not know for sure which one) need to file their $1000 fee and their
registration update forms, as they are tardy.  They  will also owe SEction
394.25 standard service plan forms and must update their deposit bond by
Jan. 2, 2002.  Please help get this taken care of ASAP, Jeff considers it a
priority--and needless to say does not trust me to do it correctly.  Thanks,
Mike
