Lad:  Sorry that I didn't respond.  I'm travelling.  Please call me on my cell phone 415.505.6633, or page me at 888.916.7184.  I'll be available beginning about 6:45 AM tomorrow.  Generally, there's going to be considerable support for the Bilas decision--at least from the lion's share of folks who made up the core of the settlement.
 
Best,
Jeff

Folks: 
Before filing comments on Bilas' proposal to modify our settlement with 
SoCal and vote it out on the 25th, I wanted to get a sense of how folks 
feel about it generally.  Hope all is well. 

Best, 
Jeff
