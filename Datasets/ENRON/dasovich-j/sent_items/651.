I'll take care of it and if there's anything we need to do, I'll let you know.

Best,
Jeff

Let's get Bev or Hedy to deliver the message.  Great idea.

We might be able to communicate this less formally through our lobbyists.  If it's OK, let me check with them first, and then I'll get back to you.  Sound good?

Best,
Jeff

We are not giving any more money in California.  To that end we just sent a letter to the D's saying, essentially, "we're giving the money we thought we were going to give you to the N.Y. Disaster Relief fund."   Prior to the "no more money" decision, we also concluded that it made no sense to give individual donations.  So ... the following should a letter similar to the following should work:    

"Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in your October 24 reception.  Earlier this year, we made a corporate decision to direct our campaign dollars in California to the California Republican Party and not participate in individual races."  

Jeff: your thoughts??
