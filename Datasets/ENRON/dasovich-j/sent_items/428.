Eldon is having some computer problems, so I am sending this out.  It might
be a good idea to copy me on your e-mail picks this week.
NANCY.SELLERS@ROBERTMONDAVI.COM


Let's hear it for the 49'er faithful!  All four of this week's winners put
their money on the Niners!

 1st place - NARVCO - also the ONLY person to take Baltimore over Denver!
 2nd place - HANK - hey, wait a minute - he's a RAIDERS fan!
 3rd place - ELDON
 4th place - GROWNEY

4 more people sat down thanks to the Colts and the Jaguars:  Andy, Daryl,
Eldon and Kent - leaving 16 people in the pool.

Attached also is the pick sheet for "Week 5"
