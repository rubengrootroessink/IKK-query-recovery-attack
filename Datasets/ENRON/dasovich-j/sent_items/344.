Maybe the best thing for you to do is take a cab from the Hyatt to the Burbank airport Monday morning.  My flight arrives on Southwest  (from Oakland) at about 8 AM.  I've rented a car.  Then we can drive to Edison from there (it's about 30 minutes from the airport), east of Pasadena on 10.  Then I can drive you back with me from Rosemead and you can catch a cab from Burbank to LAX.  Should be pretty easy that way.
