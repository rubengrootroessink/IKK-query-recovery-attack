Thanks.  Hanging in there about as well as everyone is.  No worries on getting back to me.  Just wanted to keep folks in the loop.  Been in contact with the desk.  Best of luck with the transaction. Enjoy the time off.  Talk to you in a couple days.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
Thanks for this and all of the prior updates.  Thanks als for the calls last week, or was it the week prior.  The last couple of weeks have been brutal.  Hopefully things get better from here.

I have been leaving the day to day management of the ees/iso situation in the capable hands of steve hall and jeff richter.  So far so good, although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon.

I'm taking the next couple of days off.  I'll call you towards the end of the week t catch up.  Sorry I've been so hard to reach.

I hope that you are hanging in there.

Tim
