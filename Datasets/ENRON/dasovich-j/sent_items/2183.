thanks.  I think "hump day" is putting it mildly.  You see in the press that we approached (are still approaching?) KKR?  And that Buffet ain't interested?  What a world.

Someone in real estate finance I know compared what Fastow & Co. did to the FirstPlus fiasco.  That hurt.

Best,
Jeff

Lisa and I met with him at 9am.  Three minutes into it he looked up and asked "can I reschedule?" and then asked us to have Lavorato or Kitchen decide. Rather surreal.    We are on for Louise at 1pm cst.    Will let you know.


PS ran into one the corporate development folks in the elevator.   This person said to is "hump day" for a deal.
