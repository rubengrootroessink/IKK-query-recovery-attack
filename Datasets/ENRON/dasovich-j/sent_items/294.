The meeting will happen.  Will only be a matter of who attends.  I'll
let you know what I hear back.  Good luck with everything else.

Best,
Jeff

You rock.

Hopefully they will actually respond.  I'll keep you informed as to the
continuation/conclusion of the pilot so that this meeting gets scheduled
after that time.

Thanks!!!!

Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting
(in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff
