Let's go ahead and do a call.  Good time for the 3 of us to catch up on what we've been up to (unless Alan and Sue are strongly opposed).  But no need to set up a formal agenda.

Best,
Jeff

Did you folks want to try to have a Staff meeting/call this week?
or would you rather let it go until Paul returns?

Pls advise,
Thanks,
Joseph
