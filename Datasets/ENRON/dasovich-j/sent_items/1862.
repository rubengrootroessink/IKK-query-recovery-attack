Subject: Sujan's True Identity


Comrades:

It is with a sense of the most abject humiliation that
I admit to you I made a total mess of Sujan's surname
in my listing of the SAC members in yesterday's
message.

His actual moniker is:

Sujan Punyamurthula

Haas email:  punyamur@haas.berkeley.edu

My sincere apologies to Sujan for this unconscionable
oversight.  Please let it not unduly impugn my moral
credibility, and thank you all for your condescending
forebearance of my personal failings.

JT
