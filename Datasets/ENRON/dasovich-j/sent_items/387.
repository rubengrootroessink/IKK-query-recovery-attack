Oh dear.  Get a story straight?  That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?  Wednesday looks good for me.

My recollections is that Paul wanted a meeting before meeting with commercial folks to "get our story straight."  Can you set that up? Wed afternoon would work for me.

Jeff and I are still planning to thumb our noses at the terrorists and fly up there on Thursday morning.  We were planning on a 10 am to 2 pm meeting, working through lunch. Does this sound good to you two?
