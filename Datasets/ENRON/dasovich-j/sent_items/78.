Sweetheart, very sorry to hear.  You're in my thoughts and prayers and I ho=
pe you're doing OK.  Sometimes, things just aren't very fair.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Friends,
=20
Today, a very delicate and beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to me=
 from Enron Government Affairs.  It is a bouquet of blooming orchids, purpl=
e hydrangia, pink roses and one yellow rose.  It is a delicate and beautifu=
l arrangement of flowers that remind me of my relationship with Jude Moussa=
.
=20
Jude was an emissions broker for Cantor Fitzgerald and worked on the 104th =
floor of the North Tower at the World Trade Center.  Jude and I met last Ap=
ril while I was working at Enron Global Markets.  In addition to sharing so=
me wonderful times together in Houston and New York City, we talked often. =
 Last Friday morning, Jude called me to say hello - one last time. =20
=20
My friend was a kind and considerate man with a gentle heart.  The irony of=
 his life is that he and his family fled Lebanon in the eighties to escape =
the war there. =20
=20
Jude's world is now a world of eternal love and peace.  And his spirit will=
 be kept alive by the memories that his family and friends share with each =
other, and with those of you who didn't have the joy of knowing him persona=
lly.
=20
Your flowers, your comforting words, and your friendship have eased my sadn=
ess these past few days.  Since yesterday, I have been in contact with Jude=
's family and I have relayed to them the outpouring of prayers and sympathy=
 that are directed at their son and the other victims of this terrible trag=
edy.
=20
Setting aside my grief, I hope that your own sorrow and loss are eased in t=
he presence of family and friends. =20
=20
Love,  Janel
