California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. 
The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. 
The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . 
Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. 
Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. 
Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. 
From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. 
He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. 
In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually. 
Calls to Berry and the SFPUC seeking comment were not returned by press time.
