great time.  SO sorry I passed out.  Man, I just suddently hit the wall.

On the Jay thing.  There's no pressure at all.  If you guys are uncertain, that's no problem.  Just need you to understand that I'm moving ahead.  Most importantly in the near term.  Are you guys hip on sharing the cost of getting appraisals?  Just let me know.  And again, let's keep this light.  No frictions.  Everyone needs to feel comfortable with where they are, etc. etc. etc.  Worse thing in the world is to let biz/finances get in the way of friendships.

Keep your taht moh rising.
