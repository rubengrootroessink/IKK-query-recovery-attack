Well, I think that Enron's fate is going to affect everyone, including me. But no worries, I'll land on my feet.  Love to have tea, just let me know when.  How you doing?

Hey, what's going on?  I'm reading terrible things about Enron - is it affecting you?  Let me know how you are and if you can meet for tea.
