Enron has been invited by Lindsey How Downing to have a representative on
the energy panel discussion at the CCPUC conference in Monterey on Oct. 15.
Do you want to send someone?  I will try to find out who else will be on the
panel, I am guessing that it would be a utility, the CPUC and Calpine.  Mike
