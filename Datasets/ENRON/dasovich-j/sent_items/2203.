So where is his great statement on DA?  IS that a tar baby now?

Subject:	Riordan Starts Campaigning in California--Focused on Energy Issues

Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. 

The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.
If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority.
If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.

I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.

Best,
Jeff
