In a speech last night at Standford's Hoover Institution, Abraham announced the money to Upgrade Path 15 and said it should be completed by '03.  Said a consortium of IOUs (including PG&E), munis and generators will participate.


Press is also reporting this morning that Davis administration is confirming that it's trying to rework some of the long-term DWR contracts.

 
Best,
Jeff
