This is the last straw:

Peace just called to thank us for resolving the contempt issue.  He then went on ad nauseum--and I mean nauseum--about just about everything in the world.  Unreal.

I told him that in exchange, we expected him to get rid of Bill Lockyear.

Richard:  He complained a little about Kirby.  I told him Kirby was worth his weight in gold.

Best,
Jeff
