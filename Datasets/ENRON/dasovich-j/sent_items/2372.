Greetings Professor:
I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:

--I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.

--I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.

Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
