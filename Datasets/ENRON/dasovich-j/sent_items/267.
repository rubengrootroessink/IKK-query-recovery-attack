Retroactivity (July 1)
No contract renewal
No incremental "DASR'ing", i.e., adding/subtracting load on the margin (fast food chains, for example)
Cost allocation risk (e.g., IOU undercollection, bonds, DWR undercollection gets distributed to DA customers)


Before providing elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a complete list of the key risk areas.  Please add to/subtract from this list, and then I'll take a shot at fleshing it out.

Thanks,
Jeff
