Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.

Best,
Jef

Jeff,

My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?

Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
them.

Regards, Lynne
