Jeff, 

In what time frame are these decisions looking at being made?  keep me posted on the July 1st roll back since it would have the biggest implications for EWS/EES existing positions.

Thank you, 
Jeff Richter

The state treasurer sent a letter this afternoon to Loretta Lynch. 
The treasurer claims in the letter that, by extending DA  through Sept. 20th, the PUC could have shifted more than $8 billion to small customers. 
He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1. 
We have started working with large customers to refute the letter. 
If you would like a copy of the letter, please send your fax number to Joseph Alamo. 


Best, 
Jeff
