Didn't work.  Was it in yesterday's gas daily?  If so, I can access it.  Thanks very much for your help.

Barry asked me to send you this article about DWR in yesterday's Gas Daily.  The article is on page 5.  I am not sure if this will work;  if it doesn't, email me back and I will send the article a different way.

Thanks, 
Mara Bronstein
