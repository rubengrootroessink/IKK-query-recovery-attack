See what a good night sleep can do!  We'll set up the meeting and determine the attendance list.

Sue has informed me that since she has most recently drawn the short straw, I'm next in line for meetings with Brown.  I've asked Mike Day to set up a meeting with Brown, me and Mike to begin our efforts to rehabilitate Mr. Brown.

Jeff
