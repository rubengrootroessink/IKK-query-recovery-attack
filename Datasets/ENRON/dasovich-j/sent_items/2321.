Subject:	ARM Comments on Suspension of DA

The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.

Best,
Jeff
