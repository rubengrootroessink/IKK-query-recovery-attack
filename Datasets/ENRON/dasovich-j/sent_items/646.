Hi Rita:

Not sure if I did this right.  Was the idea to rank no more than 5, using 1=
-5, or more the way I did it.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Ginger - Please forward to Gov't Affairs group.  Thanks!

We're trying to identify information needs - both specific and general.  Ma=
ny of these are already provided, and response to this survey will help in =
identifying new services and prioritizing/improving existing offerings.  De=
pending on the response to each offering, most will likely be made availabl=
e.  For this effort, please rank up to five choices in the list below (1=3D=
highest).  We'll tally the results, identify which items will have priority=
 and communicate back how those needs will direct implementation efforts.  =
Please note that items marked with (*) would require your input.  Please cl=
ick on Forward for this message to allow you to type in your ranking number=
s, and send the response to Rita Hartfield by Wednesday, October 17.

Thanks!
Elizabeth
