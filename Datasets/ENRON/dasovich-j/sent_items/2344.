Thanks very much.  Really appreciate the help.  I'll submit them just as soon as I get them.  Have a nice weekend, despite it all.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff -- hope the following information helps a little.  As soon as you get your grades, submit them to the HR Service Connection at MS #3698.
Thanks.

JoAnn,

If the employee is attending class at this present time and waiting for grades to be received in December, then have employee submit grades to HR.  With the recent developments with Enron, we will have to get tuitions approved by Executive HR - VP.

Should you have further questions, please let me know.

Veronica -- can you tell me if this is in the queue as it's in the current semester?  Sheila Walton has told me that if it is current, once grades are submitted it would be paid.  Can you confirm?

Thanks.
Jo Ann
