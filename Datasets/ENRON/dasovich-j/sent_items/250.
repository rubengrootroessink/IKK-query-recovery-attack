I was trembling.  I mean, it read like a chilling cold-war spy novel.  Can barely write.  I'm quivering all over....

Yep.  I think they spelled Stout's name right--several times.   O.K. so it's a bit self-serving.

FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.

Best,

Jeff
