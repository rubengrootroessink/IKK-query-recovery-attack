Jeff --

I'd leave the number blank for all parties to be discussed between the different parties.  Best way would be to have some Attachments for the amount that the companies can sign after everything else.  Don't want Dan Douglas to know the $$$ before Richard Sanders oks.

Quck question:  w.r.t. to the stipulation with Edison.  1) Do we care that D. Douglas will know what our claim (or proposed settlement amount is), i.e., do we prefer that Dan sign a confidentiality agreement?  2)  When we file the stipulation at the Commission, do we care that the universe will see the number, i.e., do we prefer to file any such stipulation under seal at the Commission?  Not sure if this matters whatsoever. But it might.  Who's the person that needs to answer these questions?

Best,
Jeff
