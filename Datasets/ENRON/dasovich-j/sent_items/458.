Thanks.  I have to clear with Calger first.  Also left a message with Kean re: same.  May be that we give the idea to the large customers and they run with it so no fingerprints on our part.  I'm going to sketch out a proposal and pass it around for people to swipe at.  I'm for severing IF Riordan loses (you think he can win?).

You going to the Astros/Giants game tonite.  Hopefully they'll actually throw a strike to Bonds tonite.

Best,
Jeff

Take another run at core/non-core...why not?  Would Lincoln turn over in his grave if we voluntarily severed California from the Union?
