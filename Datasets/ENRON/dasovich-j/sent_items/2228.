You think I should submit the reimbursement now, before the semester ends, just to get it in the door?

They should reserve a place for Fessler at the same place Davis deserves to go--history's trash heap.  You know that Fessler works with Klauberg, right?  Some people you just can't get rid of....

Best,
Jeff
