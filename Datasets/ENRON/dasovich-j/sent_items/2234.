Thought I'd add Eldon, too, since he likely has some ideas and information, too.

Hi Avram.  Meet Rory, Prentice's brother and computer guru-type.  Rory and I talked a little bit about what you're looking for, so I thought I'd just go ahead and facilitate a little chat room here.  Avram, could you explain one more time to Rory exactly what it is that you're looking for, just to make sure that I've accurately and adequately described the situation?  Rory has some ideas.
 
Best,
Jeff
