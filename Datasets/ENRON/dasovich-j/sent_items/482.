Dear Everyone,
 
I will be performing at Strings in the East Bay on Wednesday, October 10th.  It's a homey room and extremely artist-friendly, so far off the corporate path that the owner doesn't advertise or even publish the address on the web.  Of course, it's not so homey that you can't get a drink, and it's close enough to the pulse that artists like Shawn Mullins still appear there regularly.  For those of you wary of crossing the Bay Bridge, it really isn't all that far (20-30 minutes), and this may be your last chance to catch my act this year.  Here are the details:
