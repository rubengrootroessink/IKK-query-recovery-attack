Hey Guys,

Just wanted to let you know that the Holiday Party at my Parents house will
December 8th.  As always it will start at about 10:30am.

I will send out invites in a week or two.  Please do not mention the party
to anyone not on this list as my mom will only let me have a limited number
of friends over to play.
