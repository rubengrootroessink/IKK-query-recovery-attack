My understanding is that we'll all try to attend.

Subject: Black Caucus 


The African American caucus would like to have dinner with us in 

Sacramento 

on September 6 from 7:00 to 8:30. The total number of caucus attendees 

will 

be dictated by how many of us can make it.  They will do the 

coordination. 

Any takers?
