Love to go to lunch.  Maybe Friday?  If not Friday, let's try next week.

Hi Jeff,

I have been wanting to e-mail you to meet up for lunch, now that I am in the city.  I know you are super busy, but let me know if you have time.  The only day that is not good is Tuesday - I have an aerobics class at 1 with a gay drill sergeant - he's great!  He dances around the class yelling at us.

Also, we are planning a trip to Tahoe the weekend of Dec 15th to celebrate graduation.  I know you're not, but let me know if you want to come.

take care and hope to see you soon,
Jackie

Hey, I haven't seen you at all and have been thinking about you.  Just wanted to check in and see how things are going.  Hope you are well and things are going swimmingly.

Best,
Jeff
