Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to bare essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The deleted actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.  

Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matters that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  Also add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then send to Sue Mara for review.  

Sue:  Please review ASAP after Jeff.  I need to get this into Rick by Wednesday.  

Alan:  Please take a look and pass any comments along to me.
