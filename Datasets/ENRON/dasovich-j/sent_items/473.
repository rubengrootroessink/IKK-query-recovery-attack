Listening to the Edison call w/investors
Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02.
My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims.
Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.
