Given that 1) the PUC has quite a few important issues on its agenda and 2) the PUC meeting will likely coincide with our regularly scheduled meeting time, we'll reschedule our 11:30 AM PDT call to 3 PM PDT for today only.  

With the Legislature adjourned (thankfully), we'll re-assess the need for a twice-weekly call and get back to folks.  The potential for a 3rd extraordinary session may affect what we do.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call.

Best,
Jeff
