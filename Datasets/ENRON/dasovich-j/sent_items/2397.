You have just used your quota of exclamation points for the remainder of this year and for all of 2002.  It was very fun.

Thank you so much for a wonderful night on Friday.  You were far too
generous in paying for dinner since the wine and corkage were our share and
there wasn't much of that!  It was so fun and I think Prentice really had a
good time too.  Lots  of love and kisses!
