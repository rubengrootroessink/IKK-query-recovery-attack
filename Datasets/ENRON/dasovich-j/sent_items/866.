I apologize.  I thought I'd put you on my "big" distribution list.  When and if I do any updates to smaller groups.  I'll put you on those, too.  Look forward to meeting and discussing next time I'm in Houston.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
	Hope everything in California is going well and hope you had a good 4th of July.  Earlier today, I was meeting with some people from EES/ENA and they mentioned that you send out regular updates on California.  I would be very interested in being added to the distribution list.  This would help us see if there are any discrepancies in what we independent report and give us insight on which issues need to be explored further.  If you are ever in Houston, I would love to meet with you and discuss some of our common interests as it relates to commercial operations.  Please let me know if you have any questions or are unable to add me to the distribution list.  

Thanks,
Kristin Walsh
