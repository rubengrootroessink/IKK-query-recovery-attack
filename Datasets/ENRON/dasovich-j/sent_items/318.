FYI.   Don't think it's anything that raises any concerns, but since you're signing on, thought you might want to peruse.

Best,

Subject: ______________ 

Attached for your review and comment is a revised draft of the application for rehearing to be filed on Friday the 28th. There are two primary changes. The California Chamber of Commerce has been added to the application and an argument has been added that the Decision contradicts the most recent legislative intent expressed in ABX2 9 that direct access continue, at least for aggregation and community choice purposes. 
Any and all comments will be very much appreciated. Also, I would appreciate it if Sue Mara would forward the document to her contact at the Chamber so that they can also review the draft. Thanks!
