FYI:
On the call today with Jeremy Blachman & Co. today, we decided to the do the following:

Sue will make sure that EES legal (Mike Smith) reviews ARMs petition to modify the Commission's order suspending DA.
Sue will send Jeremy a one-page summary of the petition and Jeremy will use it to solicit participation from Enron customers (i.e., see if any are willing to sign the petition).
Jeff will work with Karen Denne to start drafting a couple of one-page letters that customers would sign and send to Legislators in the event Davis is successful in calling them back in October to work on energy matters.

Let us know if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Jeff
