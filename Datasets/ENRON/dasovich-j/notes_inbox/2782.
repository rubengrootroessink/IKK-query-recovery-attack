Davis' energy fix

Gov. Gray Davis' recent plea for a quick presidential
energy fix in the form
of price caps is an ominous sign that he has given up on
his own solutions.
Apparently Gov. Davis has completely run out of ideas on
how to fix the
energy crisis he ignored for two years until it was too
late, and his begging
for price caps comes in the face of bipartisan opposition
to such a
short-sighted solution.

The fact is that last December, Davis' energy advisers at
the ISO asked the
FERC to remove price caps because they were constricting
supply and
threatening blackouts. Even President Clinton's FERC
chairperson opposed
price caps because they can lead to blackouts.

If the governor's only solution is to blame Washington
for his own problems,
then he ought to consider forfeiting his paycheck because
he will have
completely abdicated his responsibility to provide
Californians with solutions.
Here are some unsolicited suggestions: Let's make
California an
energy-independent state by 2004. Let's invest in our own
home-grown
energy sources and use energy more efficiently. Let's
ensure we have healthy
utilities and that our state isn't burdened for decades
by high energy costs.
