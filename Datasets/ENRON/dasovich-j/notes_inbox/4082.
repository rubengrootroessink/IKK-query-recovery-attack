Jeff:

Jim agreed that it makes sense for you to be the Enron rep. at the CERA 
roundtable this week.  This is the web site with registration:
http://www20.cera.com/attachment/preview/1,1322,2964,00.pdf

I will be interested to talk to you after to see what you learn/who you 
meet,etc.  By the way, if you get a chance, please say hello to Michael 
Zenker. He 
runs the CERA office in CA and I spoke with him briefly last week on the 
phone (a friend of mine, Sean Becker, who works at CERA's Cambridge office 
got us in touch).   

If it is really valuable roundtable, let me know and perhaps I could arrange 
to go to the roundtable they are holding in Calgary on May 2. 

Jennifer
