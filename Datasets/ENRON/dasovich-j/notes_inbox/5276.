Hi Team, 

I ran my own numbers this morning, and verified what you guys have  
sent out. I think we can use Mark's or Jeff's write-up as is. Just have 
one clarification re: Q2 - my?spreadsheet shows that if we increase ad 
expenses for five years only '94-'98 (as opposed to in perpetuity), 
then the stock price ends up being 22.73 v/s Mark's 22.20. I do get 
22.20 if?I also increase the 6th year ('99) expenses to 27% - perhaps
this was an oversight - can someone pls confirm? 

For Q5, merely changing terminal growth to 4%, and WACC to 10%
gets us to an $80 stock price.?But?4% in perpetuity is probably 
unrealistic?

Re: the last question, I agree with Mark's analysis - firms that 
have huge R&D cycles and patent protection over 17 years etc.
e.g. pharmas would be good candidates for foreacsting over a 
longer term horizon. 

Rest looks great - you guys are awesome!! 

-Anil

Since it seems like folks may have only been sporadically receiving my 
emails, please let me know if you receive the memos and accompanying 
spreadsheets that I just sent.? Thanks. 

Best,
