Dear Jeffrey:
I'd like to tell you about another opportunity to
understand the people and companies driving the
private equity markets, let you know that you can
save $100 by registering for Financial Services
Outlook now, and offer you an exclusive chance to
win a free registration to a future conference from
Technologic Partners.

Our database shows that investment in financial
services technology companies is very strong, with
over $750 million in private equity invested in the
sector this year.

Many of those venture-backed companies, as well as
other strong investment candidates, will be presenting
at Financial Services Outlook in New York on July 31
at the Marriott World Trade Center. Read on to find
out how to be entered in a special contest for
VentureWire subscribers.

The e-finance landscape is rapidly redefining itself,
and the editors at Technologic Partners have put
together a comprehensive agenda and compelling set
of private companies. Understand the growing oppor-
tunities for companies in the following illustrative
sectors:
* Online Banking and Trading
* Payment and Presentment
* Investment Services
* Financial Services Globalization

In one day, Financial Services Outlook will deliver:
* Private Equity Platform -- Speak with some 50 CEOs
of the most promising start ups as they present their
business plans to investors
* Keynote Presentations -- Listen to executives such
as Robert L. Reynolds, vice chairman and COO of
Fidelity Investments and Pete Sinisgalli, president
and COO of CheckFree as they detail their views of
the technological revolution in financial services
* Product Demonstration Reception -- Network with
fellow attendees at an end-of-conference reception
where up to 25 companies will demonstrate firsthand
their services and products

And, for all those VentureWire subscribers who enter
the code "FSOVW" in the last box of the registration

registration to a future Outlook conference.  The
