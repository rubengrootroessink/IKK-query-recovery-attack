The deals include so many intricate pricing formulas that Connell said she=
=20
couldn't immediately predict exactly how high California's hourly power cos=

Walter Barnes, chief deputy controller of finance, said the contracts=20
probably would be "well in excess" of the $69 a megawatt-hour that Davis on=

The contracts' prices range from $55 to $249 a megawatt-hour, and most are=

The state Department of Water Resources, the state's power buying arm, late=

"We're on pretty solid ground here," he said.=20
As the statewide elected official who pays California's bills, Connell=20
repeatedly has criticized the governor for his electricity spending, saying=

that she never believed the contracts should be kept secret.=20
But Davis' office blasted her for giving out details that power generators=

"When they open their electric bill next time, every Californian can thank=

Although seasonal swaps are common, the 2

and inexperience on the state's part, he said.=20
The consultants who advise California on power deals were frenetic at the=

In several of the contracts, the state agreed to pay generators a 25 percen=

Before deregulation, utilities generally received 3 percent to 18 percent=

"We're all going to have to pay more for power plants over the next 10 or=

Several contracts were drafted in the late winter and early spring when=20
California endured Stage 2 and Stage 3 energy alerts.=20
The unmasked terms in some of those agreements reflect the state's=20
desperation for megawatts amid fears of routine blackouts when temperatures=

For example, the state agreed in a March 29 contract to pay Calpine $232 a=

=20
But a more recent Calpine contract calls for about $59 a megawatt-hour,=20
starting Oct. 1.=20
Time made all the difference, said Jim Macias, a Calpine senior vice=20
president. He said that last winter, Calpine couldn't guarantee that plants=
=20
under construction in Sutter County and the East Bay would be on line by=20
summer. So the company bought the power on the spot market for the state,=
=20
Macias said.=20
"Back in the winter, $232 was a good price for electricity this summer," he=
=20
said.=20
Calpine officials said that they made no money on the sale and even knocked=

Kathleen Potter, Calpine spokeswoman.=20
"It was a great transaction for us," Potter said. "We appreciate the=20

Duke, rebutting allegations by three ex-workers that it adjusted production=

the state Independent System Operator. The allegations focused on Duke's=20

its first wave of rolling blackouts.=20
In some cases, the plants were "literally driven by the ISO" through a=20

by the ISO, sometimes as often as every 10 minutes, Stokes said.=20
"Duke Energy was not making the decisions to ramp the plant up and down," h=

said. "(The ISO was) ramping it up and down to meet the minute-by-minute=20
changes in the grid."=20
Duke released a memo from Tracy Bibb, the ISO's director of scheduling, to=

that Duke was following the ISO's dispatch orders.=20
The memo, along with the plant records, "clearly refute the allegations,"=

Stokes said.=20
Yet Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of a Senate select committee probing=20

Asked about prices, Stokes declined to release detailed information but sai=

Duke charged California roughly $1,200 a megawatt-hour for power from the t=

plants during the three January days cited by the ex-workers. The high pric=

Stokes said Duke will disclose actual prices "at the appropriate time and i=

Stokes also disclosed that Duke agreed Monday to forgive almost $20 million=

that it says it's owed by California for power supplied in January and=20
February. The reduction was ordered in March by the Federal Energy Regulato=

Commission, which said Duke and other generators had overcharged the state.=
=20
Even with the $20 million deducted, Duke says it has received just "pennies=

On the other hand, the ISO has calculated that Duke overcharged California =

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=
=20
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r=20
the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=
=20
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=
e=20
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=
=20
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the=20
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=
.=20
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=
=20
established during the latest alert.=20
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=
n=20
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=
=20
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=
98=20
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=
it=20
risk in selling to the state.=20
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=

Duke Energy agrees to refund money=20






By Bill Ainsworth=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
July 3, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- As hot summer weather triggered the first Stage 2 power alert=
=20
yesterday in more than a month, Duke Energy agreed to refund money from an=
=20
earlier extremely high price to comply with an order from federal regulator=
s.=20
While California was able to squeeze by with tight power supplies, southern=
=20
Nevada was not so lucky and was forced to endure brief rolling blackouts=20
during triple-digit heat.=20
California's electricity grid manager, the Independent System Operator, had=
=20
issued the last previous Stage 2 alert on May 31.=20



The hot weather is expected to continue. "Conservation is going to play a k=
ey=20
role in reducing demand," said Greg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO.=20
California's electricity demand peaked at about 4 p.m. with 41,600 megawatt=
s,=20
with an available supply of 42,402 megawatts. A megawatt can power about 75=
0=20
homes.=20
Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced that it would follow rather than fight an=
=20
order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to refund money from=20
January when it charged a state record $3,880-per-megawatt hour. Duke was=
=20
allowed to charge only $273 per megawatt-hour, according to FERC.=20
The North Carolina-based company said that it would slash $20 million from=
=20
California's power bill, including $2.1 million from February.=20
Unlike the action for January, the February price cut was not ordered by th=
e=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
"It's our way of creating a good working atmosphere to come up with some=20
solutions," said Terry Francisco, a company spokesman.=20
The money is a mere fraction of the $805 million that the ISO says the=20
company overcharged California residents.=20
In all, the ISO says power companies have overcharged California at least=
=20
$8.9 billion.=20
Company officials, meanwhile, continued to fight price-gouging charges=20
leveled by former employees of Duke's Chula Vista plant.=20
They held a news conference explaining in detail the actions it took from=
=20
Jan. 16 through Jan. 18, a time when it charged the state the record price=
=20
for power.=20
Previously, the company had released a memo from the ISO saying that the=20
Chula Vista plant was operating under the grid manager's instructions when =
it=20
throttled up and down during that period.=20
Jeff Stokes, executive vice president of Duke, would not detail the price t=
he=20
company charged during that time. But in addition to the $3,880 per megawat=
t=20
hour, he said, Duke charged between 25 percent and 33 percent of that recor=
d=20
price. That would make the other prices about $1,000 per megawatt hour.=20
Yesterday, a megawatt hour sold for $92 on the spot market, and that's abou=
t=20
three times the going price in the spring of 2000.=20
Officials from the ISO say the amount of the bids the company offered is=20
needed to determine whether Duke engaged in price gouging.=20
A March report by the ISO accused generating companies of driving up prices=
=20
in two ways: by withholding power and by bidding prices so high the state=
=20
couldn't afford them.=20
Gov. Gray Davis said, in a written statement, that Duke owes Californians a=
n=20
explanation.=20
"Duke has a lot of explaining to do for charging Californians the outrageou=
s=20
price of $3,880 a megawatt hour," he said.=20

Uncensored electricity contracts show some edge for both sides

SACRAMENTO -- Uncensored copies of long-term contracts that commit Californ=

"Some of these prices are more favorable to the utilities than we could tel=

from the earlier contracts," said Roger Bohn, an energy specialist and=20
associate professor at UCSD. "Then there are some provisions that look more=
=20
favorable to the state ... at least in the short run."=20
Bohn, who served on the market monitoring committee of the defunct state=20
Power Exchange, reviewed several of the largest contracts, including that o=
f=20
Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric.=20
Under court order, Gov. Gray Davis' administration released the long-term=
=20
contracts June 15. But significant sections of some, and snippets of others=
,=20
had been omitted or blacked out to protect proprietary information and the=
=20
state's bargaining position, administration officials said.=20
Several news organizations, including The Copley Press, which publishes The=
=20
San Diego Union-Tribune, sued seeking full disclosure. State Controller=20
Kathleen Connell, who has openly feuded with fellow Democrat Davis, also ha=
d=20
urged a public airing of the complex documents.=20
A San Diego judge last week issued an opinion in favor of releasing the ful=
l=20
contracts, but had not yet made her ruling final.=20
Yesterday, Connell released unabridged versions of some 41 contracts, most =
of=20
which stretch over the coming decade. At least one extends 20 years.=20
Connell's move touched off another heated exchange with the governor's=20
office.=20
The controller said the state almost certainly has never before assumed suc=
h=20
a massive financial obligation without prior public review.=20
Connell and her top aides said the previously excised portions of the=20
agreements show the governor saddled the state with huge electricity costs=
=20
through the end of the decade.=20
She also released short-term contract information which was of particular=
=20
concern to the governor's office. Steve Maviglio, the governor's press=20
secretary, criticized that decision, saying it would help power generators=
=20
continue to manipulate the market.=20
"Unfortunately, the controller is seeking political vengeance at the expens=
e=20
of the California ratepayer," Maviglio said. "She's uninformed and clueless=
=20
about the impact of the long-term contracts on bringing down spot-market=20
prices."=20
Few others were weighing in on the debate yesterday. Most consumer advocate=
s=20
and other analysts were reserving judgment until they finished poring throu=
gh=20
the nearly 30 pounds of documents.=20
But Walter Barnes, the controller's chief financial officer, said the=20
contracts' average cost "probably will be well in excess" of the $69 per=20
megawatt-hour claimed by the governor's chief negotiators.=20
UCSD's Bohn called that conclusion "plausible," but said it will depend on=
=20
the future price of natural gas, which no one can predict. Many power plant=
s=20
are fired with natural gas, the cost of which gyrated wildly over the past=
=20
year.=20
"Neither (Connell) nor the governor are saying what gas prices they assumed=
,=20
so we don't really know what the $69 figure is based on," Bohn said.=20
While generators may have bargained for higher rates than previously though=
t,=20
the state secured what appear to be floating market rates with a cap in at=
=20
least one major contract, the deal with Sempra, Bohn said.=20
In that agreement, the state is "not locked into an arbitrarily high price=
=20
for this summer. The way things are looking now, that may turn out to be a=
=20
good deal for California," he said.=20
While largely critical of the contracts, Connell appeared to confirm that=
=20
many of the deals have a flexibility that could prove beneficial to=20
ratepayers.=20
She said her staff found an "interesting pattern" in the state's June power=
=20
purchases. Given a choice between available long-term supplies and the spot=
=20
market, the state's energy traders bought almost as often in the spot marke=
t.=20
While entering into long-term contracts, the state's ability to continue=20
buying some power on the spot market benefited consumers when prices on the=
=20
market started to fall, according to Davis associates.=20
S. David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser, said the long-term=
=20
commitments drained some demand and restored some sanity to a spot market=
=20
that had been rising to unheard-of prices. Since then, the Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission also has imposed wholesale price controls in Californ=
ia=20
and 10 other Western states.=20
Freeman said the state negotiated the best deals it could starting in=20
January, when it endured rolling blackouts and spot market prices averaging=
=20
nearly $280 per megawatt-hour.=20
Along with the contracts, Connell released details of power purchases to da=
te=20
under the long-term agreements.=20
Contract power purchased so far appeared to average $173 per megawatt-hour.=
=20
The administration, however, had warned the rates it negotiated were steepe=
r=20
at the front end.=20
Connell said the contract prices range from $55 to $249 per megawatt-hour,=
=20
with most exceeding the $69 average the administration has claimed. Perhaps=
=20
more troubling, she said, is that many of the contracts contain clauses tha=
t=20
could prevent purchase of the power at the lower prices.=20
In addition, she said, "there is a great deal of negotiation that remains t=
o=20

"So the state does not have a firm commitment on price, other than a floor=
=20
price on many of these contracts."=20
The deals should guarantee nearly 600 million megawatt-hours for the state=
=20
over the next decade. That is projected to cover about 45 percent of the=20
amount of power the state's utilities cannot cover with their own plants.=

Stephanie McCorkle, spokeswoman for the ISO, said the pricing information i=

"The ISO frequently orders plants to ramp down because the plant owner is=

The ISO has the pricing information but is not allowed to release it withou=

Duke spokesman Williams yesterday said the ISO memo shows that Duke reduced=

He said Duke charged high prices during those three days in January,=20

Hidden Costs Revealed in Power Pacts=20


By RICH CONNELL,ROBERT J. LOPEZ and JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writers=
=20

?????California consumers on Monday were given their first detailed glimpse=
=20
of the unpredictable and potentially higher costs they'll face in the futur=
e=20
under power-buying deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis' administration.
?????State Controller Kathleen Connell released previously secret elements =
of=20
the state's long-term electricity contracts, along with a new warning that=
=20
the price tag could exceed the administration's previous estimate of $43=20
billion.
?????Technical vagaries in the pacts, Connell said, could leave state power=
=20
bills open to wild fluctuations over the next decade. Even after weeks of=
=20
analyzing the 41 agreements, she said, her office is still unable to say=20
"what the [cost] ceiling could be."
?????Among other things, the controller said, most costs under the contract=
s=20
are now running between $70 and $200 per megawatt-hour, and she predicted=
=20
that costs over the next decade will be far higher than the $69 per hour=20
suggested by Davis' aides.
?????More certain are the amounts the state is paying more than two dozen=
=20
private consultants who have been drawn into the electricity crisis and who=
se=20
contracts also were released Monday by the controller.
?????Some of those consultants--working on behalf of Davis or the state=20
agency that has been purchasing power since January--are making tens of=20
thousands of dollars each month.
?????Connell's release of the uncensored electricity contracts came one day=
=20
after the California attorney general said Davis would not appeal a judicia=
l=20
order declaring them public records in their entirety. The court action in=
=20
San Diego was filed by The Times and other news organizations.
?????Three weeks ago, after another ruling favorable to the media, the=20
administration released the contracts, which will govern the cost of=20
wholesale electricity for years to come. But key technical provisions were=
=20
redacted from those documents.
?????Davis planned to release the contracts later this week, but the=20
controller upstaged him Monday, offering her own spin on the deals and=20
prompting the governor's office to shoot back.
?????His aides insisted Connell's warning of possibly higher costs was base=
d=20
on incomplete information. Her price figures, they said, were skewed toward=
=20
purchases made earlier in the year, when electricity and natural gas prices=
=20
were significantly higher.
?????"Unfortunately, the controller doesn't let the facts get in the way of=
 a=20
good story," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, adding that the controlle=
r=20
has been at odds with Davis since he endorsed her rival, Antonio=20
Villaraigosa, in the Los Angeles mayor's race. "This is just a drive-by=20
shooting where she does not have the full set of information."

?????Millions in Hidden Costs
?????Still, the contracts released Monday show for the first time the=20
millions of dollars in hidden costs that are being shouldered by taxpayers.
?????At least one of the energy suppliers, Houston-based Dynegy Inc.,=20
negotiated terms that allow it to pass along to the state high-cost deliver=
y=20
charges for natural gas, experts said.
?????Robert Michaels, an energy consultant and professor of economics at Ca=
l=20
State Fullerton, said the Dynegy contract permits the firm to use the state=
's=20
most costly benchmark of natural gas prices.=20
?????Dynegy "has its choice of the highest [cost delivery] point," said=20
Michaels, who once advised the company. Like Connell and others, Michaels=
=20
said that even with the complete picture of the contracts, it is difficult =
to=20
determine how much added cost ratepayers may face as the deals extend into=
=20
the next decade.
?????Also, in just the first three months of the Dynegy contract, the state=
=20
picked up about $10 million in pollution, start-up and other operational=20
costs for the firm.
?????Likewise, a contract with San Diego-based Sempra Energy Resources,=20
parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, allows the company to choose=20
where it delivers electricity into the state grid, Michaels said after an=
=20
initial review of the agreement.
?????"It seems to offer a lot of flexibility for the supplier," said=20
Michaels, who also has been a consultant for power suppliers. "It's not=20
obvious what the state got out of this [deal]."=20
?????The new details on fuel and emission costs underscored some critics'=
=20
fears. "As you look at the devil in the details, it gets worse," said UC=20
Irvine economist Peter Navarro.
?????He noted, for example, that Dynegy has been one of the power merchants=
=20
labeled by Davis as "pirates."
?????But examining the company's complete contract Monday, Navarro said, it=
=20
seemed as if the state was saying, "You pirate, take California's dowry."
?????Navarro and other critics note that power prices have fallen=20
dramatically in recent weeks, well below those the state is paying under th=
e=20
long-term contracts.
?????A Times analysis of payments made so far under the contracts shows the=
=20
average cost per megawatt-hour has been $173. Recent spot prices for peak=
=20
power have been as low as $50 a megawatt-hour, according to surveys by Plat=
ts=20
Energy Trader, an industry newsletter. By Monday, when an energy emergency=
=20
was declared, the price had risen to about $92 a megawatt-hour.
?????Administration officials, including Davis' chief contract negotiator, =
S.=20
David Freeman, have said the state had little negotiating leverage when man=
y=20
of the deals were struck early this year.=20
?????"Early on, we were having a very difficult time gaining any advantage,=
"=20
said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources,=
=20
which oversees power purchases. Still, Hidalgo and others in the=20
administration contend the power deals will stabilize prices in the long=20
term, and have tamed high spot prices this year.
?????"Now, we have gained the upper hand," Hidalgo said.

?????A Big Payday for Consultants
?????Meanwhile, payments to outside consultants hired to assist the governo=
r=20
and the state Department of Water Resources in dealing with California's=20
energy crisis reached nearly $2.8 million by late last month, according to=
=20
the figures released Monday.
?????But those payments represent only a fraction of the total contracts th=
e=20
state has signed with a broad array of consultants to assist with the=20
purchase of power and acquisition of transmission lines, to provide legal a=
nd=20
technical advice, and to mount advertising campaigns and polish Davis' imag=
e.
?????The agreements include a $1.5-million multiyear contract with the=20
Washington, D.C., law firm of Grammer, Kissel, Robbins, Skancke & Edwards,=
=20
which specializes in energy and environmental law.
?????Attorney Elisa J. Grammer and other members of the firm will represent=
=20
the state in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission an=
d=20
related court proceedings through the end of May 2004.
?????Another contract calls for the state to pay $1.1 million to two New Yo=

consulting firms--the Blackstone Group and Saber Partners--at the rate of=
=20
$275,000 a month. The contract includes the services of Joseph Fichera, one=

financial incentive for the consultants to boost the price the state will=

several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday=

afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.

State Controller Kathleen Connell yesterday released uncensored versions of=
=20
California's energy contracts, including short-term contracts that Gov. Gra=
y=20
Davis had hoped to keep under wraps for three months.=20
Connell said the contracts for $43 billion worth of power were negotiated a=
t=20
the worst possible times, for higher prices and longer periods than are=20
necessary. But Davis' office countered that Connell was grandstanding and=
=20
that her release of short-term contracts would hurt the state in its=20
negotiations with power generators.=20
Connell said the contracts showed California paying more than the $69 a=20
megawatt hour Davis had stated. Ranging from $44 to $249 per megawatt hour,=
=20
most are between $100 and $200 a megawatt hour, she said, adding that=20
variables prevented calculating an exact average.=20
But Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said Connell had selectively mixed in=
=20
some higher-priced short-term contracts "to misrepresent facts about the=20
price we negotiated."=20
Although a fellow Democrat, Connell has long had a contentious relationship=
=20
with Davis. In an interview yesterday, she said the deals Davis made could=
=20
mean the general fund would be in debt for years to come. She added that it=
=20
appeared the administration would run out of money to buy electricity by=20
December.=20
Davis is "indebting future generations of Californians to ease the potentia=
l=20
pain a portion of people might feel over the summer of 2001," she said.=20
A judge ordered the contracts to be released two weeks ago, but Davis' offi=
ce=20
blacked out many vital elements, such as where power would be generated and=
=20
transmitted. The judge last week ordered Davis to release that redacted=20
material, which the governor's office said he had planned to do this Thursd=
ay=20

Among other new revelations:=20
-- Consultants. The state signed agreements for more than $15 million to=20
consultants for help in negotiating the contracts, legal advice and other=
=20
services, some for months or years into the future. To date, the state has=

David Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and=
=20
Power, whom Gov. Gray Davis retained as an energy adviser in April.=20
The largest of the 27 consulting agreements was for up to $6.2 million with=
=20
Electric Power Group LLC of Pasadena for help in negotiating the long-term=
=20
contracts with the power providers. The firm is headed by several former=20
executives with Southern California Edison.=20
"There are a number of consulting contracts that appear questionable,"=20
Connell said. Citing one example, Connell said she had refused to pay the=
=20
contract of Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, two political image consultants=
=20
retained by Davis, because the firm was also representing Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison.=20
Maviglio said: "The governor makes no apologies for hiring the best talent =
to=20
fight the arsenal of generators. They have several floors of skyscrapers in=
=20
Houston armed with the best talent money can buy."=20
-- LADWP. Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Los Angeles Department of Wat=
er=20
and Power, sold the state $57.8 million worth of power in March and April.=
=20
LADWP charged the state between $213.50 to $174.60 per megawatt-hour of=20
electricity, a price that included a 15 percent premium.=20
LADWP was not profiteering, said Eric Pharp, director of public affairs for=
=20
the municipal utility. "I don't think most people would think that is=20
excessive," Pharp said. "Fifteen percent is what people felt was a reasonab=
le=20
return." The 15 percent markup was decided on last December by Freeman, the=
n=20
LADWP's director, and approved by the LADWP board.=20
"What if LADWP found itself short of power, would it expect to get that pow=
er=20
from the state at a reasonable cost?" asked Severin Borenstein, head of the=
=20
University of California Energy Institute. "If they expect backstop help fr=
om=20
the state if they ever get in trouble, now's the time to step forward on th=
at=20
basis."=20
-- Price. Bill Marcus, principal economist with JBS Energy, a Sacramento=20
consulting firm that represents consumer and environmental groups in utilit=
y=20
issues, said the new material showed the state had paid huge amounts for=20
short- term power, more than twice as much as recent federal price caps.=20
He also questioned whether California had acted in a panic to buy too much=
=20
power. "The system is not going to have enough flexibility built into it,=
=20
come three to four years from now if we keep signing contracts," he said.=
=20
"I'd like them to stop and take a breath, see if there are ways to change t=
he=20
worst contracts, rather than running hell-bent for election as fast as they=
=20
can, trying to sign these things."=20
Maviglio said the contracts represented a "balanced portfolio" of purchases=
;=20
provided California with a reliable price for electricity; and had helped=
=20
drive down spot market prices. "Instead of being vulnerable to the whims of=
=20
the market, we know exactly how much we'll be paying," he said.=20

Chuck Umnuss, an elderly resident who lives in Summerlin but wasn't hit by=

IPPNY Plan Designed to Prevent California-style Crisis in New York=20
ALBANY, N.Y., July 2 /PRNewswire/ -- The Independent Power Producers of New=
=20
York, Inc. (IPPNY) today unveiled its Energy Solutions Program (ESP); a=20
five-point action plan to address the long-and short-term energy needs of N=
ew=20
York.=20
Designed to avoid a California-style energy crisis, IPPNY's ESP addresses t=
he=20
supply and transmission issues facing New York. It calls for -=20
-- Increasing energy conservation,=20
-- Encouraging utilities to enter into contracts to protect consumers=20
against short-term price volatility,=20
-- Accelerating the siting process for new, cleaner, diverse power=20
sources,=20
-- Fostering an efficient, multi-state energy marketplace, and=20
-- Upgrading the state's power transmission system.=20
"New York is at a crossroads: We can either go down the same road as=20
California, leading to high energy prices and debilitating shortages, or we=
=20
can follow the examples of other regional energy markets so that we continu=
e=20
to enjoy reliable energy at competitive prices," said IPPNY Executive=20
Director Gavin J. Donohue. "As we move into the hot, humid days of July and=
=20
August, when the air conditioners are humming and power demand skyrockets,=
=20
the time is right to highlight the need to solve the potential energy=20
shortages and volatile energy prices that face New York consumers."=20
Mr. Donohue said that while a California-like emergency is unlikely to hit=
=20
New York this summer, the state will experience energy shortfalls and=20
resulting price increases in the near future unless the government, power=
=20
suppliers and consumers begin to take steps now to address known problems. =
In=20
developing its plan, IPPNY examined the experiences of other states along=
=20
with those of various metropolitan markets in New York since the state bega=
n=20
to restructure its power market in 1996.=20
"We were struck by the contrast between California and states like=20
Pennsylvania, where customers enjoy adequate supply and prices 4.5% below t=
he=20
national average," said Mr. Donohue. "We based the IPPNY ESP on proven=20
results."=20
IPPNY's five-point program calls for -=20
1. Conservation. Energy conservation, particularly by commercial and=20
industrial consumers, can help reduce New York's power needs in the=20
short term, as well as help with long-term supplies. The New York=20
Energy Research and Development Authority's "Energy Smart" program --=20
which provides energy efficiency information, conducts research and=20
development on energy efficiency, and provides incentives to consumers=20
to purchase energy efficient products -- is a good start. Conservation=20
would be further encouraged if all energy users were able to readily=20
see how the cost of electricity differs throughout each day. An easy=20
start would be a tiered system of rates with higher costs for power in=20
mid-day -- when power is at peak consumer demand -- than the morning.=20
2. Encouraging New York's utilities to enter into contracts and use=20
financial risk-management techniques to protect consumers against=20
short-term price volatility. In a competitive energy market, prices --=20
particularly in a daily spot market -- rise and fall based on supply=20
and demand. Utilities can insulate their customers from abrupt and=20
sharp price changes by relying less on daily spot markets to set their=20
customers' prices and instead enter into a rational blend of contracts=20
with power suppliers to stabilize prices. Several New York utilities=20
already employ these tools to protect customers from price spikes; all=20
New York utilities should do the same.=20
3. Getting new, cleaner, diverse power sources on line. The New York=20
Independent System Operator (NYISO), the non-profit entity that manages=20
the state's power supply, says that the state needs 8,600 megawatts of=20
new generating capacity by 2005 to meet growing demand. New York=20
hasn't put a major new power plant on line since 1995.=20
New power plants are cleaner and more efficient and New York's=20
rigorous permitting process guarantees environmental protections. At=20
the same time, we must maintain our existing base of generation,=20
powered by a diverse mix of fuel types to prevent over reliance on one=20
fuel.=20
New York's ever increasing demand for power dictates that the time=20
is now to get new, cleaner, more efficient plants up and running.=20
4. Creating a seamless, multi-state energy market. Current administrative=
=20
and regulatory differences between New York, New England and the mid-=20
Atlantic states prevent power from flowing smoothly among them when=20
truly needed. As a result, consumers are losing out on the=20
opportunities for lower costs, better environmental performance, and=20
higher reliability. The ISOs for each of these bordering regions,=20
together with the state and federal governments, should expedite=20
ongoing efforts to eliminate such differences and foster the creation=20
of a unified northeast market. The recent agreement between the NYISO=20
and ISO New England on sharing operating reserves is an example of how=20
this cooperation can work.=20
5. Upgrading transmission lines so power can efficiently flow from where=20
it is produced to where it is needed. New York's energy transmission=20
system is antiquated, inefficient and insufficient to meet the state's=20
rising demand. For example, the inability to transmit power from=20
western New York to the eastern part of the state as well as inadequate=20
power interconnects with the mid-Atlantic and New England regions=20
inflates prices in the east and New York City. State policymakers need=20
to quickly determine how to build and pay for an improved transmission=20
system that will make it cheaper, easier and more efficient to move=20
power around the state.=20
"These five steps, if instituted by utilities and state and federal agencie=
s,=20
would go a long way towards ensuring that New York's lights stay on and pow=

LOS ANGELES, July 2 -- Duke Energy, one of California 's larger electricity=
=20
generators, and state officials today rebutted charges by three former Duke=
=20
employees that the company had manipulated output to drive up prices, sayin=
g=20
the shifts had been ordered by a state-controlled agency. And the agency, t=
he=20
California Independent System Operator, agreed.=20
Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the semi-independent agency, which is=
=20
empowered to manage the state's power grid, said it largely controlled how=
=20
much power was being produced by the Duke Energy plant. She added that the=
=20
agency had not offered this information at the time the former employees=20
testified in the State Senate because it had not been asked.=20
In the Senate hearings on June 22, the three former plant workers said the=
=20
company had ramped output up and down, manipulated maintenance schedules an=
d=20
even thrown away some spare parts at a plant in suburban San Diego County i=
n=20
an apparent effort to drive prices higher in January when supplies were=20
tight.=20
The hearing was another theater in the war of words between the state and t=
he=20
electricity generators, as each has accused the other of causing the energy=
=20
crisis.=20
The state, particularly Gov. Gray Davis, has accused the generators of=20
gouging the state on the wholesale power market. Gov. Davis recently demand=
ed=20
about $9 billion in refunds from the generators, including Duke, while the=
=20
companies have asserted that the state fell victim to market shortages=20
created by its own policies.=20
Some top state officials had called the testimony by the three former Duke=
=20
Energy employees -- two plant mechanics and a control room technician -- th=
e=20
first ''smoking gun,'' proving market manipulation.=20
''In my opinion, there was price manipulation,'' Glenn Johnson, a certified=
=20
power plant mechanic, said of Duke's actions at the San Diego plant. Duke=
=20
supplies about 5 percent of California 's electricity from four plants in=
=20
California .=20
But today Duke Energy sought to demonstrate that the state itself had cause=
d=20
the fluctuations at its plants and that the people who testified were simpl=
y=20
unaware of the company's overall commitments to the market.=20
The company offered a highly detailed presentation, saying that the rise an=
d=20
fall in output had been ordered by the agency.=20
Jeff Stokes, an executive vice president of Duke Energy, which has its=20
headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., offered copies of handwritten logs from th=
e=20
plant and other documents to show that the workers saw only a partial pictu=
re=20
of the operation of the plants and so were unaware that at various times th=
e=20
agency had deliberately set aside some of the output capacity as a reserve.=
=20
Mr. Stokes explained that at times the plants are actually put at the=20
disposal of the agency, which increases or decreases output to maintain=20
balance in the overall electrical grid. At other times, the agency keeps so=
me=20
operating capacity off-line as a reserve, so it can meet sudden increases i=
n=20
demand, he explained.=20
Mr. Stokes said the bottom line was that during those critical days in=20
January covered by the testimony in the State Senate, the plant, which has=
=20
four operating units, was effectively at the state's disposal.=20
''The full available output was offered at all times,'' Mr. Stokes said.=20
Ms. McCorkle, the spokeswoman for the agency, said of the presentation, ''I=
=20
thought it was a very accurate description.'' She added that at times the=
=20
agency had not bought all the output from the plant because Duke was asking=
=20
too much for the power, not because it was being withheld from the market.=
=20
Still, some remained skeptical. Governor Davis, who switched on a brand new=
=20
power plant in Sutter County today, said through his spokesman that he was=
=20
not convinced. Earlier, Mr. Davis had invited the three former plant worker=
s=20
to breakfast and had offered a tribute to their integrity.=20
''There are still a lot more questions out there,'' said Steve Maviglio, th=
e=20
governor's spokesman.=20
Mr. Maviglio said that even if Duke had refuted the charges the most=20
important issue outstanding was how much the power generators should refund=
=20
to the state for overcharges.=20
There have been numerous investigations by federal and state agencies of th=
e=20
wholesale prices charged this year, and several have found what they have=
=20
described as convincing evidence of overcharging. But no definitive orders=
=20
have been handed down and a host of investigations are continuing.=20
Indeed, for an industry that was supposedly deregulated several years ago,=
=20
the utilities and power generators are now subject to the most intensive=20
regulatory scrutiny perhaps in their history.=20
In fact, California triggered price limits in 11 Western states today by=20
issuing a power alert. It was the first time the limits went into effect=20
since they were imposed by federal regulators two weeks ago.=20
