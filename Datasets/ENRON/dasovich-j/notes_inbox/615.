 Dow Jones Energy ServiceNevada Governor To Decide On Deregulation By Next 
Week ? 09/25/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Nevada governor Kenny Guinn will decide by early 
next week on whether to implement electricity deregulation by November, as 
recommended by the state's Public Utilities Commission, a spokesman for the 
governor said Monday.   

Deregulation was set to become law March 1, 2000, but was stalled due to a 
lawsuit brought by Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) Co. unit Nevada power that 
challenged deregulation as unconstitutional. Nevada Power withdrew the 
lawsuit after the state approved a $110 million rate increase for the 
utility's customers. 

Guinn's spokesman would not say why the governor was considering a delay in 
deregulation.   

"All those details will be discussed when the decision is announced," said 
spokesman Jack Finn.   

The PUC's proposed deregulation schedule calls for competition to begin with 
large commercial customers on Nov. 1, 2000, followed by medium commercial 
customers April 1, 2001, and residential customers Sept. 1, 2001.
