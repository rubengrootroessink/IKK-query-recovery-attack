Hi Jeff,

I hope you had a great New Year without any utility emergencies. Here at
Cambira we have been making significant progress in forming alliances with
major carriers and broadband service providers and to this end I would like
to know if you could refer me to someone within the Enron Broadband Services
Group that I could contact. We intend to have product out around the end of
Q2 and I am looking to get our strategic alliance partners in place. To keep
you up on our advancements I have attached our latest presentation. I hope
all is well and that you will be able to provide me with a contact in the
broadband services group.

Best regards,

John Protzel
