Earlene/Elizabeth:

 Jeff Dasovich's Notes problem has been solved.  It turns out that his 
network connection got disconnected, so he not only could not use Notes, he 
was not actually connected to the network at all.  I spoke to him and we 
worked through this.  In troubleshooting this, I believe his media slice is 
defective, as we undocked it and this "fixed" his mouse problem.  I still 
have Erin working on sending him a new unit, as the keyboard sounds like it 
is having its own set of problems.  Also, I have put in a request to have his 
mail move bumped up on the priority list, as he has a Palm Pilot that he 
cannot sync until we move him over.

Thanks
