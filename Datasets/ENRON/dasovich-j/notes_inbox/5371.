I am trying to put some figures together for Dave Delainey

First, does anyone know how many MW of capacity that would be available for 
CA this Summer if there were limited or no restrictions on environmental 
permits.  I understand (via Mary Schoen) that the regional air quality 
districts have either expanded the hours (200 to 500) for small units.  Does 
anyone have a good number on how many MW this allows to operate into the 
market?

Also, does anyone know anything about any power plants idled (for whatever 
reason) recently that could be re-started?

Thanks
