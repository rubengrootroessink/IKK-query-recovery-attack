I keep getting e-mail bounced back from Anil so I'm not sure if he is
receiving
things.  Message says that Yahoo is rejecting e-mail due to size
constraints.

Please see attached revised PowerPoint and excel file.

- I added a chart on KO's stock price for the last 5 years (past 15) and a
new "market reaction" slide showing KO, PEP, OAT and S&P500 performance over
last 12 months.
- In the "data" worksheet of the new excel file I added the deal multiples.
All look reasonable except for the TEV/EPS.  Looks like it should be taken
down by a factor of 10, but I'm not sure how to justify that.  Can  someone
take a second look at please?

Anil - let me know if you need help with anything.  I know you have a lot
going.
