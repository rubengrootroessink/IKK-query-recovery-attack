Hi, guys.  The House Commerce Committee currently has five Republican 
vacancies with two likely to go to Californians.  Last week, Leadership 
determined that Freshman Members are ineligible for this assignment.  
Obviously it is important that these new California Members be supportive of 
Enron on electricity restructuring.  Currently, Congresswoman Mary Bono and 
Congressman George Radanovich have expressed their interest in securing 
appointment to this Committee.  We can certainly work with these Members, but 
are there other non-Freshman, California Republican Members who would be 
better?  Many Members are unaware of how few Members are seeking these 
vacancies so a little education on our part could sway their interest.  
Please advise.   Many thanks.  Cynthia
