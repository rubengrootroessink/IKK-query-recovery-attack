Helping clients IS my job description--how's that for a slogan?  The
Commission did precious little today, so the inaction was more significant
that the action.  It held all items related to QF issues, including the Wood
decision.  That should mean that the March SRAC posting will be under the
old formula (unless the assigned commissioners issue a ruling extending the
current suspension to March 27, the date of the next meeting).  They also
held 4 orders that related to the funding of DWR's power pruchases through
rates (the California Procurement Adjustment of AB 1X) and similar issues,
leaving DWR in limbo for a while longer.  They did issue an order preventing
the utilities from cutting costs by laying off workers or reducing services.
They opened a rulemaking on whether PG&E and SoCalGas' gas curtailment and
diversion rules should give greater priority to electric generators--SDG&E
already has its own proceeding on this subject.  They approved a low-income
assistance order.  That's about it,  No continuation meeting, so the next
opportunity for mischief is March 27.
Brian

Brian,

Thanks.  I know this is not in your job description but if there was
anything to report from today's meeting, could you let Mark or I know?

Alan
