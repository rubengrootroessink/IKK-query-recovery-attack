California selling surplus power at fraction of cost it paid =20

By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 19, 2001  SAN FRANCISCO =01) Calif=

acknowleges the power sales, but says the surplus represented only a blip i=

an otherwise typical scorching summer and that blackouts still could roll i=

However, the surplus power selloff could encourage criticism that the state=

bought too much power at too high a price in its haste to fend off rolling=
=20
blackouts and power prices 10 times higher than the year before.  "If the=

price is $138 on average for a month and you have to turn around and sell a=
=20

Forum in San Jose.  "I just don't think many people in California truly=20
understood what their state did when they stepped into this business." =20
Unlike natural gas, extra electricity cannot be stored away for a later day=
.=20
Since Californians haven't been running their air conditioners as often as=
=20
expected over the past week, the state hasn't needed the entire 38,000=20
megawatts it had figured it would need.  The state Department of Water=20
Resources, in charge of buying power for three financially ailing utilities=
,=20
has spent the past few months arming the state with long-term energy=20
contracts while weaning itself away from buying the highest-priced power on=

the last-minute electricity market.  Those contracts, along with last month=
's=20

there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.  Energy traders say=
=20
the state has tried to sell as much as 6,000 megawatts at one time, Ackerma=
n=20
said.  That's around 16 percent of the 38,000 megawatts the state estimated=
=20
it would use around this time of year, Ackerman said. A megawatt is enough=
=20
electricity to power roughly 750 homes.  "We know from traders who have=20
bought that it's gone as low as a dollar and last week we know it was as lo=
w=20
as $5," Ackerman said. "When a seller shows up with an enormous amount of=

prices."  California Energy Markets, a trade weekly, said the state sold=20
power last Thursday at $25 per megawatt =01) a price that Steve Maviglio, a=
=20
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said was "much closer to reality."  The stat=

"never sold anything more than 1,000 megawatts on any single day," Maviglio=

said. "(Ackerman) has no evidence" of California selling power for $1,=20
Maviglio said. "California Energy Markets is much closer to reality."  Osca=

Hidalgo, a DWR spokesman, acknowledged the state has been trying to sell as=

PUC reveals plan to transfer much of watchdog role =20


\
objattph=20
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  The California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission laid out a framework yesterday for transferring=
=20
much of its watchdog role in ensuring fair electricity rates to the state=
=20
Department of Water Resources.  The controversial proposal is in response t=
o=20
legislation earlier this year that puts the water department in charge of=
=20
state power purchases. Utilities commission action is needed to ensure that=
=20
the water department has enough revenue to make the purchases and to clarif=
y=20
areas of responsibility, including oversight of power rates.  Under the dra=
ft=20
agreement made public yesterday, the commission would guarantee that=20
consumers pay enough to cover interest payments on a planned $13.4 billion=
=20
bond sale later this year. The guarantee is considered an essential element=
=20
for completing the bond sale.  The bonds' proceeds are needed to repay some=
=20
$8 billion the water department already has spent to purchase electricity a=
nd=20
to cover future payments.  California began buying electricity through the=
=20
water department earlier this year after the state's utilities were unable =
to=20
make purchases because of credit problems brought on by the state's failed=
=20
deregulation plan.  No mention was made in the draft agreement of the=20
possibility of further rate increases to cover electricity purchases. Some=
=20
observers have speculated that the current rate structure, even after two=
=20
rounds of rate increases, may not cover all costs.  On the other hand, the=
=20
draft agreement states that the water department itself will determine if t=

prices it pays for electricity meet the legal test of being just and=20
reasonable, a determination heretofore made by the utilities commission. =
=20
Under the utilities commission's procedure, the public is invited to commen=
t=20
on the draft. An administrative law judge for the commission will consider=
=20
the draft before issuing a proposed decision. A full commission vote is=20
expected Aug. 23, a deadline that would have to be met if the bond offering=
=20
is to proceed as planned later this year.  Harvey Rosenfield, president of=
=20
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said the utilities=20
commission's draft agreement would allow a "secretive agency of dubious=20
competence controlled by the governor and completely unaccountable to the=
=20
public" to unilaterally order rate increases.  "It was deregulation which g=
ot=20
us into the mess we are in today," Rosenfield said. "Now Wall Street is=20
demanding that the (utilities commission) be forced to surrender its=20
authority and legal responsibility."  He urged the commission to reject the=
=20
draft proposal.  Carl Wood, one of five members of the Public Utilities=20
Commission, said the draft agreement was driven largely by legislation=20
empowering the water department as an electricity purchaser. With a state=
=20
department buying power, Wood said, oversight shifts to the governor and th=
e=20
Legislature.  Commissioner Richard Bilas said he saw the agreement as=20
empowering the water department as "prosecutor, judge and jury" in matters =

electricity purchasing.  "The argument is that it's better off this way tha=

Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's=
=20
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.
By JERRY HIRSCH
Times Staff Writer

July 20 2001

For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more=
=20
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the=20
utility to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the=
=20
proposed $2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas prices-=
-a=20
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison ha=
s=20
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates=20
approved by state regulators.

The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on=20
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunc=
h=20
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover=20
several hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from i=
ts=20
purchases of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power cris=
is=20
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come=
=20
online and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would=
=20
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another=
=20
spike in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make=20
payments on a proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt=
=20
from energy purchases before Feb. 1.

Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office=
=20
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out=
=20
of U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmissio=
n=20
lines, which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to=
=20
rescue the utility.

Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improvin=
g=20
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 millio=
n=20
in defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded=20
positively, boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the=
=20
last six weeks to a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange=
.

Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs, i=
ts=20
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two=
=20
wild cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on tha=
t=20
cash and the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use=
=20
the money to repay its debts.

The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million=20
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities=
.=20
The agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take fro=
m=20
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering t=
o=20
cover the state's purchases.

The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in Januar=
y,=20
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utilit=
y,=20
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in Apr=
il.

"What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep," sai=
d=20
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that ha=
s=20
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera,=
=20
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the=
=20
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to=20
implement the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the=
=20
state's current and future power purchases.

Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay o=
ff=20
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state=20
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends=20
appear to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts=20
cautioned that the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if t=
he=20
state doesn't provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

"While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally=20
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt," said Brian=
=20
Bennett, an Edison vice president. "But without knowing what [the water=20
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates t=
o=20
cover our costs."

Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled u=
p=20
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity=20
costs--on what he called "flawed regulatory policies."

Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, "We are just only beginning to=
=20
repay the under-collection."

The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushe=
d=20
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bil=
ls=20
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the=
=20
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that=
=20
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this=
=20
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by=
=20
May and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of=20
electricity from this group of generators represents more than $200 million=
=20
in savings for Edison on an annual basis.

Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or=
=20
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, "then rates once again=
=20
may not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperati=
ve=20
that this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish=20
predictable, stable rates for our customers."

Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through=
=20
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved=20
before lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said=
=20
they are content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is=20
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some=20
consumer groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

"Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first,=
=20
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses," said Harvey Rosenfield,=
=20
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monic=
a.=20
He said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolv=
e=20
its financial problems.

Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can=
=20
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put t=
he=20
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more=
=20
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were=
=20
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be=20
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into=20
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company=
=20
ahead of others that are owed money.=20

Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede=

=20
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement=20
"overreaching" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is=20

Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in=

The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and=

expressed their support for the measure.=20
"This is better for ratepayers," said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform=

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy=20
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for=
=20
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency=
=20
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis.=20
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis=
=20
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics=
=20
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday.=20
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put i=
n=20
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democrati=
c=20
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to=
=20
blur perception of the current energy troubles.=20
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And=
=20
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush,"=
=20
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a=20
triumph -- for Davis."=20
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power."=20
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis=
=20
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank,=20
released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away a=
s=20
the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not=
=20
Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows.=20
The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political=
=20
adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history."=20
"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raise=
d=20
one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday=
.=20
"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like=
=20
Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his=
=20
mess."=20
The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as=
=20
members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including =
a=20
California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White=20
House's energy policy.=20
But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of=
=20
California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in=20
California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow=
=20
your state the way they have . . . it creates problems."=20
Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures=
=20
that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administratio=
n.=20
In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers =
to=20
seek state approval for new plants.=20
While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I=
=20
thought the flaws would be addressed."=20
"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding=
=20
that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the=
=20
legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while."=
=20
But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's=20
energy woes -- had benefits for the state.=20
Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to bui=
ld=20
new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians."=20
Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns=
=20
about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early=
=20
1970s -- to build large power plants.=20
Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions=
=20
made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with ou=
r=20
handiwork."=20
Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the=20
California Energy Commission about coming blackouts.=20
And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and=20
skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in=
 a=20
crisis: emergency powers.=20
Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested=
=20
it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He use=
d=20
his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the=20
bridges within 65 days.=20
South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the=20
energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full=

California buzzing with power - but for how long?=20
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Gray skies, chill fog, unseasonable rain, and=20
moderate temperatures might not make for a perfect California summer -- but=

this year, it is exactly what the sun-loving state was praying for.=20
With power supplies critically short and forecasts of summer blackouts=20

r=20

But a state that prides itself in defying prediction has done it again,=20
sailing through the first weeks of summer with so much power it is selling=
=20
its excess on the open market.=20
``Various forecasters have predicted various horror stories, and we have go=
t=20

an=20
for Gov. Gray Davis -- who has staked his career on beating the blackouts.=
=20
``But the situation is unpredictable, and the weather is the most=20
unpredictable thing of all.''=20
No one is saying California's energy crisis is over. The state is still=20
struggling to control the wreckage of its power deregulation scheme, a 1996=
=20
policy which was supposed to bring lower power prices and more consumer=20
choice. Instead it sparked spiraling wholesale power costs, a major utility=
=20
bankruptcy, critical power shortages, and six days of blackouts between=20
January and May.=20
The last outages swept the state May 8, unplugging tens of thousands of=20
customers in what industry experts warned was the first of as many as 260=
=20
hours of summer blackouts.=20
The absence of new blackouts has been attributed to consumer conservation=
=20
among the state's 34 million residents, improved power supplies, increased=
=20
federal price controls and above all, the unexpected blessing of a dreary=
=20
summer.=20
``Mother Nature has been very, very kind to us,'' said Severin Borenstein,=
=20
director of the University of California Energy Institute.=20
While temperatures have been several degrees lower than normal over the pas=
t=20
few days throughout California, meteorologists say the summer so far has=20
actually been marginally warmer than most.=20
But the state has so far escaped the governor's worst nightmare -- a searin=
g=20
stretch of extremely hot days that sends people running to their air=20
conditioners.=20
``Temperatures have been nominally above normal, but you haven't had a lot =
of=20
extremely hot days. If it's only moderately warm, the state can deal with=
=20
it,'' said Ed O'Lenic of the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction=
=20
Center. ''The cloudiness and the precipitation has probably helped.''=20
The cooperative weather has been matched by Californians' own conservation=
=20
efforts. Electricity use, adjusted for economic and population growth and=
=20
weather, has been falling steadily every month this year, culminating in a=
=20
12.3 percent savings in June compared with the year-ago level.=20
Conservation during the critical peak demand hours, when the threat of=20
blackouts is greatest, cut use an even more significant 14.1 percent -- a=
=20
saving of some 5,570 megawatts, or the equivalent of five big nuclear power=
=20
plants.=20
The energy picture -- further improved by three new power plants -- has=20
boosted supplies to such a degree that California recently found itself=20
selling extra power on the open market.=20
Locked in to long-term purchasing contracts and unable to store the=20
electricity, California has dumped excess power for prices far lower than i=
t=20
paid, leaving consumer groups fuming.=20
Officials dismiss the complaints as absurd, noting the amount of power=20
involved is ``inconsequential'' and stressing the entire state's power supp=
ly=20
could tip back into crisis within 24 hours of the start of a heat wave.=20
``After being blasted for blackouts, I am very happy to be criticized for=
=20
having a tiny bit too much,'' said David Freeman, Davis' chief energy=20
adviser.=20
The question now is whether California will be able to keep up its energy=
=20
balancing act for the rest of the summer.=20
The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), an industry group=
=20
which projected the 260 hours of blackouts this summer, has conceded those=
=20
forecasts might have been high. But it points to continued problems dogging=
=20
California's energy system including transmission bottlenecks, and inadequa=
te=20
power generation.=20
Officials and industry analysts say the biggest danger the state faces is a=
=20
sudden change in the weather, followed closely by a relaxation of consumer=
=20
conservation efforts.=20
Those worries are increased by the fact that August and September are=20
historically the hottest months across the most heavily-populated areas of=
=20
California, where late autumn heat waves are not uncommon.=20
``When we get the three-day, West-wide heat wave we are in deep trouble, an=

it is very likely we will get that sort of a heat wave at some point,''=20
Borenstein said.=20
Vancko of NERC said the current spate of good news about California's power=

consequence is that it has aggravated the crisis for utilities and their=20

as a direct result of the FERC price controls.  In today's FERC filing, Pug=

Harvey Rosenfield, the president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consume=

Geoff Dryvynsyde, a legal adviser at the Public Utilities Commission, said=

With the Legislature set to quit for the summer as early as today, the=20

"I can't imagine that in the next 24 hours" lawmakers will reach consensus =

coauthored one of the lower house's rescue bills with Assembly Speaker Bob=

One indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that Keeley=

himself does not support the measure that bears his name. "I don't believe=

that this bill in its current form should become law," he said. "This bill =

Hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may=

To avoid mass blackouts, California has been purchasing billions of dollars=

Days later, Davis reached a tentative rescue deal with Southern California=

Last week, lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward wi=

Legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the Assembly=

However, it became evident Thursday that the dueling measures making their=
