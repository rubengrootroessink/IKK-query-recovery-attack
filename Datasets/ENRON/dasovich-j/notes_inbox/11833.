=09=09 Subject: Resolution E-3726 Approved



The Commission approved Resolution E-3726 on a 5-0 vote at the July 12 =20
meeting.? A copy of the final resolution, which has several changes from  t=
he=20
draft issued a few weeks ago, is attached for your information.? The =20
Resolution explicitly states that DA customers are exempt from the AB 265=
=20
rate  surcharge, as AReM advocated in its July 9 comments.? It also states=
=20
that  any DA customer returning to bundled service will not be exempt from=
=20
the  surcharge.? However, a subsequent return to DA appears to make the=20
customer  exempt again.? The following are some excerpts from the Resolutio=
n=20
relating  to these issues.:
?
?"Two parties filed comments on the re-circulated resolution,  SDG&E and AR=
M,=20
both on July 9, 2001.?  Some of the implementation issues raised by SDG&E=
=20
require  clarifications as discussed in the remainder of this section. . . =
.=20
. . . =20

?SDG&E next maintains that the draft  Resolution resolves two issues that=
=20
instead should be resolved in A.00-10-045  and A.01-01-044:? changes in the=
 =20
definition of =01&small=018 customers and the treatment of DA customers.? (=
We note=20
that the Commission has not  publicly issued a Proposed Decision or draft=
=20
Alternate Decision in those  proceedings addressing the treatment of DA=20
customers or the definition of small  customers.) . . . . .=20

With respect to the treatment of DA customers we see no  reason why it is=
=20
improper to address that issue here, as that issue has been  addressed by t=
he=20
participants in this informal proceeding.? Accordingly, we determine that D=
A =20
customers are exempt from recovery of the undercollection that results from=
=20
the  AB 265 energy price ceiling based only on the record established for=
=20
this  Resolution.? That is we base this  determination on relevant=20
information contained in protests and responses to  protests on the advice=
=20
letters addressed by this Resolution and comments and  reply comments on=20
drafts of this Resolution that were circulated for public  comment . . . . =
.=20
. . .?

?SDG&E also asserts in its July 9, 2001 comments  that the draft Resolution=
=20
finds DA Issues moot but addresses them anyway.?? SDG&E also argues that it=
 =20
withdrew AL 1264-E and that the draft Resolution inappropriately addressed=
=20
two  issues:? exempting DA customers from  any future cost recovery=20
obligations associated with AB 265 rate ceiling  benefits, and determining=
=20
what the obligations are of DA customers who return to  utility bundled=20
service.? SDG&E  also maintains that the Resolution must be revised to avoi=
d=20
gaming by customers  who attempt to avoid paying their share of the=20
undercollection.

We first note that the draft Resolution clearly noted at page  6 the=20
continued relevance of DA issues despite SDG&E=01,s withdrawal of AL  1264-=
E.?=20

The passage of Assembly 1X 1 and the potential for the  Commission to suspe=

miss-matches between benefits and repayment obligations are inevitable.?=20
Limiting rate ceiling cost recovery  responsibility to bundled service=20
customers is an expedient way to mitigate such  mismatches and is supported=
=20
in the discussion section of the resolution by the  ADJ's intent to not=20
discriminate against DA customers.?=20

SDG&E states in its July 9 comments that the draft  Resolution? must be=20
changed to  clearly state that customers cannot avoid paying for costs simp=
ly=20
by switching  back and forth between bundled service and DA, and that the=
=20
only customers who  will avoid paying for costs are those who never caused=
=20
them to be incurred in  the first place.? But the reverse  could also be=20
true.? Some DA  customers that were returned to bundled service in early=20
2001, not having  received the largest part of the rate ceiling benefit,=20
might have the same  repayment obligations as bundled SDG&E customers that=
=20
received the benefit  back to June 2001, as well as those that just move in=
to=20
SDG&E service  territory when the benefit ends and the repayment begins.?? =
We=20
do not address these issues in  this Resolution.? In the Resolution, we=20
determined that the complexity of individual  tracking at this point is=20
likely to outweigh its benefits. . . . . . . =20

ARM, in its comments on the re-circulated resolution, supports the order =
=20
that DA customers should not be liable for any SDG&E undercollection =20
balancing account.? However, ARM  proposes a single change to the draft=20
Resolution, regarding the treatment of  customers who spend some time on, a=
nd=20
sometime off, direct access (DA), and who  find themselves, for whatever=20
reason, off DA when SDG&E recovers  under-collections arising from AB265.? =
=20
If the Commission is unwilling to require individual customer tracking,  an=
d=20
if these customers are for whatever reason off DA when SDG&E assesses =20
under-collection obligations arising from AB265, the Commission should trea=
t =20
them as DA customers.?=20

We will not adopt ARM's proposal on this record.? Customers in the position=
=20
described by  ARM would have at least received a portion of the rate ceilin=
g=20
benefits and are  not differently situated from new customers in the SDG&E=
=20
service  territory.???=20

ARM argues that a DA customer who has not received the  benefit of the rate=
=20
cap has not contributed to the utility=01,s purchased power  undercollectio=
n.?=20
If that customer  later finds herself, for whatever reason, on bundled=20
service and subject to the  AB265 rate cap, she should be liable for her=20
share of undercollections incurred  during the period when she was on bundl=
ed=20
service.? But since SDG&E contends that it  cannot support individual=20
tracking, ARM proposes that customers that were DA  during the period since=
=20
June 2000 be exempt from the repayment obligations.?=20

As further support, ARM also cites the ACR issued on July 2,  in A.00-11-03=
8,=20
seeking comments by July 10 on a =01&proposed settlement of pending  litiga=
tion=018=20
between the Commission and SDG&E.? As part of the settlement, SDG&E  would=

ARM contends that if the Commission were to adopt the  =01&proposed settlem=

of pending litigation,=018 DA customers below 100 kW would  lose out on the=
