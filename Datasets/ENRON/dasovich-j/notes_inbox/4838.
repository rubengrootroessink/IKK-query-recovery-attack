Small Power Firms' Cutbacks Contribute to Blackouts 
 Outages: Alternative generators of solar, wind and biomass energy, and 
smaller gas-fired plants, haven't been paid since November. 


By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer





     SACRAMENTO--The rolling blackouts that swept California on Monday were 
sparked in part by a crucial group of small energy producers that have cut 
supplies to the state's utilities because they are not being paid. 
     California's power supply dropped Monday when alternative producers 
reduced output or went offline, cutting their usual deliveries to utilities 
in half. The lost electricity--more than seven times the cuts the companies 
were making just weeks ago--could have served 3 million homes. 
     "I think we're just getting at a breaking point for many of these 
businesses," said Ed Tomeo, president of UAE Energy Operations Corp., a San 
Ramon company that operates a biomass plant and a small gas-fired plant. 
     Tomeo said he expects to take his gas-fired plant offline today because 
he's run out of money to buy natural gas. 
     Tomeo's firm is among the nearly 700 alternative energy producers that 
generate more than a fourth of the power consumed in California. 
Collectively, the group estimates it is owed $1.5 billion by the state's two 
largest utilities. 
     Big out-of-state power producers are getting paid because the state 
stepped in to buy electricity for the foundering utilities. 
     But the California producers of solar, wind and biomass energy and, 
typically, smaller gas-fired generators, have received no payments since 
November from Southern California Edison and only partial payments from 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. for December and January deliveries. 
     Edison's debt to the producers is estimated at $835 million as of March 
1. PG&E's debt to the producers was $651 million as of March 8. 
     Jim Detmers, director of the California Independent System Operator, the 
agency that operates the state's power grid, said Monday's shortfall from the 
alternative producers was mostly caused by reduced output by about a dozen 
companies that have been cutting back electricity deliveries for the past two 
months. 
     Detmers said he could not say whether the action was orchestrated, but 
it appeared to be a business decision. 
     The cuts have grown from about 400 megawatts a day in early February to 
3,000 megawatts over the last several days, according to state officials. 
     Assemblyman Fred Keeley, a Boulder Creek Democrat, said he did not blame 
the small producers, who are formally referred to as "qualifying facilities," 
for shutting down. 
     "Although I feel it is unfortunate for consumers, I don't blame [them] 
at all," Keeley said. "They're the only ones generating electricity and not 
getting paid." 
     Keeley said he will revive efforts to pass legislation that would ensure 
that the alternative energy producers get paid while cutting their rates. A 
previous effort to slash the rates paid to the group, SB 47X by Keeley and 
Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta), appears doomed. 
     Gov. Gray Davis huddled for more than two hours with Democratic 
legislative leaders Monday, after keeping his distance for several weeks, and 
an agreement emerged to give small generators a choice: Take a higher price 
in exchange for short-term commitments to buy their power, or accept a lower 
price in exchange for a multiyear commitment to buy their power, sources who 
attended the meeting said. 
     And the governor and Legislature would quickly devise a way to ensure 
that the producers start getting paid, at least for power they continue to 
produce. As long as the utilities are collecting money from their customers, 
Davis later told a labor group, "they're going to make the payments." 
     The alternative producers' rates are pegged to the price of natural gas, 
which has skyrocketed in recent months. Driving down and stabilizing their 
prices is a critical factor in Davis' overall plan of buying power without 
imposing additional consumer rate hikes. 
     As a growing number of unpaid producers have dropped offline, state 
officials have been forced to purchase replacement supplies on the pricey 
spot market. A worst-case scenario materialized Monday, when a lack of 
electricity supplies forced state officials to order rolling blackouts. 
     "A number of plants are out for maintenance, but it's very clear to me 
that there are a significant number that are off due to nonpayment," said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. "My 
concern is that this is a prelude to what we'll see this summer." 
     PG&E spokesman John Nelson described the alternative producers as 
victims of the state's energy meltdown. "Many of these generators are 
relatively small enterprises that cannot afford to continue operating on a 
daily basis." 
     Nelson said his company's inability to fully pay the producers it has 
contracts with is caused by the rate freeze that bars PG&E from passing the 
true cost of electricity on to customers.
