PG&E TO5

On Nov 22, FERC set this for hearing.  Enron intervened late, but we are now 
a party.  PG&E is attempting to increase its rates by about 16%.  FERC 
delayed implementation of the rates until May 6, 2001.


PG&E Wholesale T Rate Refund

Filed Dec 6.  references about a $100,000 refund.  WIll be returned to 
scheduling coordinators, so ENA should be returning some money to EES.

If you need to see the filing or the order mentioned, they are on the pile on 
my desk on the right-hand side.
