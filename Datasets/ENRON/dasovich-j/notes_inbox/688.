Hi, Jeff --

Thanks for your call yesterday.  It was good to talk to you.  Attached is
the preliminary program I wrote for the Alliance for Retail Markets.  This
one is for you...I'm sending a hard copy to you that will arrive
tomorrow.  As an FYI, Rick Counihan will get his copies tomorrow as well.

My hope is that with this, or with another opportunity, I'll be able to
jump back into this issue with both feet.

Looking forward to hearing from you...and seeing you once you can free up
your schedule to come to San Diego.

Best,
Dana
