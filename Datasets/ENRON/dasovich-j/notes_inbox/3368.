Piper -- Thanks so much for your assistance in pulling this meeting
together.  Attached is a sample invitation we'll send from Ken Lay to the
CEOs of the companies in the attached spreadsheet.  I appreciate your calls
to the policy folks at these companies to supplement the email from Ken --
hopefully, we'll get a good turnout.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you!

Karen
