Many rural towns to escape blackouts, utility maps show=20
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 5, 2001)=20
Huge stretches of Northern California, including many rural foothill and=20
valley communities, won't face rolling blackouts this summer, spared by a=
=20
combination of geography and circuitry.=20
Placerville and Loomis, Esparto and Isleton are among the many towns that=
=20
will be largely or entirely bypassed by deliberate blackouts, according to=
=20
new Pacific Gas and Electric Co. outage maps.=20
Such communities are served by so few circuits that each one has been=20
exempted from outages because a critical facility, such as a fire station o=
r=20
a water treatment plant, lies along the circuit somewhere, PG&E spokesman=
=20
John Nelson said.=20
Both PG&E and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District have begun shedding=
=20
more light on their strategies for rotating outages in the wake of a=20
governor's order requiring utilities to let people know where blackouts wil=
l=20
strike next.=20
For PG&E, that has meant quickly posting and then updating blackout maps on=
=20
its Web site. For SMUD it has meant publicly detailing, for the first time,=
=20
the boundaries of 78 separate rotating outage areas and listing by number=
=20
which areas could be tapped next.=20
"We were contemplating putting the map on the Web before the governor's=20
order, but the timing coincided very well," said John DiStasio, SMUD's=20
assistant general manager for customer service.=20
SMUD updated its Web site, www.smud.org, on June 22 so that now people can=
=20
click on "rotating outages" and then "next likely locations and map" to see=
=20
the shape of outages to come.=20
The map replaces less-precise neighborhood names, which is all SMUD supplie=
d=20
until Gov. Gray Davis ordered utilities to give the public "common=20
geographical boundaries, grid or block numbers, maps or similar identifying=
=20
information" about where outages will strike.=20
With six days of rolling blackouts already behind California this year, and=
=20
forecasts that more probably lie ahead, Davis has told utilities and the=20
state Independent System Operator to give better notice of when and where=
=20
blackouts might occur.=20
Grid operators and utilities have cautioned that Davis' program of two-day,=
=20
one-day and one-hour warnings could produce many false alarms because power=
=20
supplies often come through at the last minute. There is also some wariness=
=20
about outage maps, which SMUD and PG&E warn could change at any time.=20
But the maps do provide insight into how each utility will roll blackouts=
=20
through its territory. PG&E's maps, on the Web at www.pge.com under "find=
=20
your outage block" and then "rotating outage block map," have recently been=
=20
updated to be searchable by zip code.=20
They show that the vast majority of El Dorado and Placer counties and much =
of=20
Yolo County are in PG&E's "block 50," a designation for a circuit that won'=
t=20
be in line for rolling outages because someone along it is crucial to healt=
h=20
or safety.=20
Police stations, fire stations, hospitals and airports are all deemed=20
essential customers that should keep functioning even when the state power=
=20
grid is so overloaded that blackouts are needed to keep it from collapsing.=
=20
In densely populated areas, circuits tend to be compact, leaving lots of=20
neighborhoods eligible for rolling blackouts, Nelson said.=20
But "in rural areas, particularly remote rural areas, a circuit can go on f=
or=20
miles and miles," Nelson said. "You can have multiple communities on one=20
circuit =01( (and) virtually every community has either a police station or=
 a=20
fire station or a hospital or a drinking water facility."=20
That has been good news for communities like Placerville, which scrambled f=
or=20
traffic control earlier this year when a rolling outage took out the signal=
=20
lights on Highway 50, which bisects the town of 10,000.=20
"That has been our biggest concern because of the amount of traffic that go=
es=20
through there," said City Manager John Driscoll. Placerville will be spared=
=20
future outages because regulators now are protecting more hospitals from=20
blackouts, and much of the rest of the town shares circuits with hospitals.=
=20
"We didn't ask to be exempted out, but I feel very happy that we are. From =

Details emerge in power contracts
By Carrie Peyton and Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writers=20
(Published July 3, 2001)

California's power bills for the next decade probably will exceed the=20
forecasts of Gov. Gray Davis, the State Controller's Office said Monday as =
it=20
released unedited versions of long-term contracts in a new jab at the=20
governor.=20

Some show that builders of new power plants could recoup the entire cost of=

those plants in four years or less. Some show lucrative swaps for power,=20
including one arranged the same day California was rocked by rolling=20
blackouts.=20
More than two dozen additional administrative contracts detail the price=20
California is paying its consultants to seek a way out of the power mess,=
=20
from tens of thousands for Davis' aides down to $51 an hour for copying and=
=20

The governor's office defended its estimates of the state's future power=20
bill.=20
The 41 long-term contracts, 27 consulting contracts, five short-term deals=
=20
and stacks of receipts and invoices released Monday by state Controller=20
Kathleen Connell may just be the start.=20
Her office hopes to provide details about how much California has already=
=20
paid individual power generators in the volatile short-term, or "spot,"=20
market.=20
The deals include so many intricate pricing formulas that Connell said she=
=20
couldn't immediately predict exactly how high California's hourly power cos=
ts=20
would go.=20
Walter Barnes, chief deputy controller of finance, said the contracts=20
probably would be "well in excess" of the $69 a megawatt-hour that Davis on=
ce=20
said would be California's average cost for contract power for the next=20
decade.=20
The contracts' prices range from $55 to $249 a megawatt-hour, and most are=
=20
more than the $69, Connell said.=20
The state Department of Water Resources, the state's power buying arm, late=
r=20
revised the $69 forecast to $70 a megawatt-hour through the end of 2010, wi=
th=20
the higher priced power coming first.=20
If anything, those figures could decline because natural gas, the fuel for=
=20
most new power plants, is getting cheaper, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said=
,=20
adding that his office sticks with its forecasts.=20
"We're on pretty solid ground here," he said.=20
As the statewide elected official who pays California's bills, Connell=20
repeatedly has criticized the governor for his electricity spending, saying=
=20
that she never believed the contracts should be kept secret.=20
But Davis' office blasted her for giving out details that power generators=
=20
and traders could use to learn the state's negotiating positions and buying=
=20
practices and said the information could boost wholesale prices within days=
.=20
"When they open their electric bill next time, every Californian can thank=
=20
Kathleen Connell for higher electricity costs," Davis spokesman Steve=20
Maviglio said.=20
The long-term contracts were first released June 15 by the water resources=
=20
department with power plant names, performance data, delivery points and=20
other details blocked out under heavy black strokes.=20
Analysts said that was the sort of data they could have used to calculate h=

electricity purchased on behalf of three cash-strapped investor-owned=20
utilities.=20
As analysts began sizing up some of the specifics Monday, early reactions=

were wary.=20
"This just shows when the state comes in and takes over the utility system,=
=20
we're just going to be in deep from all sorts of expenses and inefficiencie=

that we were trying to get away from" with deregulation, said Arthur=20
O'Donnell, who edits a trade newsletter, California Energy Markets.=20
Bill Marcus, a power consultant who had analyzed the edited contracts for a=
=20
consumer group, quickly read through the unedited versions muttering things=
=20
such as "offensive" and "they got absolutely ripped here."=20
In one swap that was negotiated on a day of rolling blackouts in March, the=
=20
state agreed to send Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's=20
government utility, 2* times more electricity in the spring than Powerex=20
would return in the summer.=20
Although seasonal swaps are common, the 2*-to-1 ratio was a sign of "panic"=
=20
and inexperience on the state's part, he said.=20
The consultants who advise California on power deals were frenetic at the=
=20
time, with one staffer at the Navigant consulting firm billing for hours=20
worked that were the equivalent of 9.7 hours a day for 34 consecutive days.=
=20
The power purchase terms disclosed Monday confirm many energy analysts'=20
predictions that California consumers would be paying premium prices for=20
years to cover the costs of the new plants coming on line.=20
In several of the contracts, the state agreed to pay generators a 25 percen=
t=20
to 30 percent annual return on their plant construction costs, which could=
=20
pay off the entire plant in four years or less.=20
Before deregulation, utilities generally received 3 percent to 18 percent=
=20
annual return on their capital investments over 30 years, said Marcus, a=20
veteran energy analyst whose firm, JBS Energy Inc. of West Sacramento,=20
represents ratepayer groups.=20
"We're all going to have to pay more for power plants over the next 10 or=
=20
more years because the generators are looking to pay off their plants in ha=
lf=20
the time," he said.=20
"Beyond blackouts and price spikes, this will be the long-term legacy of=20
deregulation," he said. "The private market needs a high rate of return on=
=20
their investment."=20
Several contracts were drafted in the late winter and early spring when=20
California endured Stage 2 and Stage 3 energy alerts.=20
The unmasked terms in some of those agreements reflect the state's=20
desperation for megawatts amid fears of routine blackouts when temperatures=
=20
and energy use began to rise in the summer.=20
For example, the state agreed in a March 29 contract to pay Calpine $232 a=
=20
megawatt-hour to supply 300 megawatts nonstop from July 1 through Sept. 30.=
=20
But a more recent Calpine contract calls for about $59 a megawatt-hour,=20
starting Oct. 1.=20
Time made all the difference, said Jim Macias, a Calpine senior vice=20
president. He said that last winter, Calpine couldn't guarantee that plants=
=20
under construction in Sutter County and the East Bay would be on line by=20
summer. So the company bought the power on the spot market for the state,=
=20
Macias said.=20
"Back in the winter, $232 was a good price for electricity this summer," he=
=20
said.=20
Calpine officials said that they made no money on the sale and even knocked=
=20
15 percent off their price to maintain good relations with the state power=
=20
buyers.=20
The gesture more than paid off with the signing of the 10-year contract, sa=
id=20
Kathleen Potter, Calpine spokeswoman.=20
"It was a great transaction for us," Potter said. "We appreciate the=20
business."=20
Proponents of "free-market" energy buying have said that in the long-run,=
=20
competitive forces would result in more-efficient, less-costly power=20
generation.=20
But the contracts show that pressed for more electricity this summer and=20
fall, officials resorted to buying power from some of the least-efficient=
=20
plants in the state, guaranteeing owners of these aging generators 10 more=

New FERC member seems attuned to state's woes=20






Texan may become agency's next chief
By Toby Eckert=20

July 5, 2001=20
WASHINGTON -- During his first weeks at the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, Pat Wood has set a decidedly different tone in the agency's=20
strained relationship with California.=20
After meeting with Gov. Gray Davis last week, Wood -- who was recently=20

power problems. It was a stark contrast to the almost constant criticism fr=

FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert.=20



"It certainly seems to me that both the political leadership and the=20

The former Texas utility regulator also raised the possibility of closer=20
cooperation between FERC and state regulators, including a "joint effort" o=

inspecting power plants. State officials have accused generators of idling=

plants to drive up electricity costs, a charge generators deny.=20
"If we're kind of co-regulators with the state, and in many regards we are,=
=20
it's helpful to work off the same set of facts so you get to conclusions mu=
ch=20
more expeditiously," Wood said, though he was quick to add that he has not=
=20
seen any evidence of intentional withholding of supply.=20
State officials hope Wood's statements signal that FERC is poised to take a=

more aggressive role in helping the state. If elevated to chairman, Wood=20
would set FERC's agenda and shape its approach to dealing with California.=
=20
The agency regulates wholesale electricity and natural gas markets, which=
=20
have subjected the state to skyrocketing prices.=20
Wood "has brought a very good perspective to FERC," said Howard Gantman, a=

C.=20
"In a refreshing change from my past dealings over the past year with the=

between Davis and FERC.=20
Wood, who professes a "religious zeal about competition," raised concerns=

about a possible move by the California Public Utilities Commission to keep=

He also criticized threats that Davis and other California politicians have=

"I think the rhetoric's still pretty hot out there. If I were a generator=

Once considered a bureaucratic backwater, the five-member FERC has come to=

play a high-profile role in the California debacle and other disputes=20

The commission is charged with ensuring that "just and reasonable" prices=

Bush is expected to make Wood the FERC chairman because Hebert is seen as t=
oo=20
much of a lightning rod.=20
Before coming to Washington, Wood, who turned 39 yesterday, headed the Texa=

Electricity price-cap tests spark allegations=20






Suppliers said to have held back; industry blames ISO
By Craig D. Rose and Bill Ainsworth=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS=20
July 4, 2001=20
The first emergency tests of new electricity price controls have generated=
=20
accusations that suppliers were withholding power and questions that the ca=
ps=20
might need to be revised or scrapped.=20
And in a case of turnabout, a power industry spokesman yesterday said the=
=20
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's electricity grid,=20
might be using the federal price caps to manipulate the electricity market.=
=20
This time, however, the charge is that the ISO is gaming to push prices=20
lower.=20
At any rate, California survived its second consecutive day of power=20
emergencies without blackouts under price caps recently imposed by federal=
=20
regulators, but not without some bumps along the way.=20



The main culprit was hot weather that baked Western states for two days,=20
forcing the ISO to issue Stage 1 and then Stage 2 alerts. Yesterday, the IS=
O=20
warned that rolling blackouts might hit in the afternoon.=20
But as has happened often this year, the ISO bought power in the last minut=
es=20
to avoid outages. The grid operator also credited conservation efforts with=
=20
shaving from 2,000 to 4,000 megawatts of consumption. A megawatt can power=
=20
about 750 homes.=20
"It was a lot hotter than expected and a lot more humid," said Kristina=20
Werst, spokeswoman for the ISO.=20
Today, state officials expect to avoid any blackouts because of the holiday=
,=20
which tends to decrease electricity demand, Werst said.=20
The price controls ordered last month by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission set up formulas for maximum prices during emergency and=20
nonemergency periods. The FERC said the complex system was intended to=20
balance the need for lower costs with its desire to promote a power market.=
=20
But questions are growing about the effectiveness of the FERC price caps.=
=20
A Department of Water Resources spokesman, which buys power for the state,=
=20
said generators withheld between 660 and 1,500 megawatts of electricity=20
during a critical period earlier this week because of the price caps. That=
=20
would be enough to cut electricity reserves from 7 percent to 5 percent and=
=20
bump a Stage 1 alert to a Stage 2.=20
Sempra Energy Trading, a marketing unit of San Diego Gas & Electric Co.'s=
=20
parent corporation, admitted that it ceased selling power to the state for=
=20
what could have been a critical 30 minutes Monday.=20
A spokesman for the trading company said it halted sales for the half-hour=
=20
because it was unsure about where the ISO would set maximum prices during t=
he=20
first power emergency under the new caps.=20
When power emergencies are called under the FERC plan, a new price cap is s=
et=20
based on the cost of operating the least efficient, most costly electric=20
generating plant. Because the identity of that plant is unknown beforehand,=
=20
the selling price is set retrospectively by the ISO.=20
"It was unclear to the traders what the proxy price would be," said Doug=20
Kline, a Sempra spokesman, who emphasized that the company's trading unit=
=20
resells power generated by other companies. "So it was unclear whether the=
=20
ISO would come back later and say, 'You purchased power at $70 per=20
megawatt-hour but we're only going to pay you $60.'?"=20
For its part, the ISO said the impact of price controls on electricity=20
supplies during emergencies is still unclear. The controls this week kept=
=20
emergency prices Monday from a little over $70 per megawatt-hour to a high =
of=20
about $90. FERC's nonemergency price cap has been about $92 per=20
megawatt-hour.=20
Earlier this year, the average price per megawatt-hour was nearly $300.=20
Before the power crisis hit last year, the price was about $30.=20
The ISO said several factors other than the price controls might have=20
contributed to tight supplies this week, including plant shutdowns in other=
=20
states and the regional heat wave.=20
But a spokeswoman for Nevada Power said the utility believed the price caps=
,=20
or confusion over their implementation, had contributed to a power shortfal=
l=20
that led to blackouts Monday. The utility fell about 100 megawatts short of=
=20
its need as temperatures in some of its service areas hit 122 degrees.=20
"Power is tight in the region," said Sonya Heagen of Nevada Power. "What=20
tipped it over (for southern Nevada) was several utilities decided to hold=
=20
back power."=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
industry group, said the FERC's price-control plan fails to allow the=20
recovery of electricity transportation costs. That has the effect of keepin=
g=20
electricity in the region in which it is generated, rather than where it=20
might be needed most, he said.=20
Ackerman said transportation costs, which typically run from $2 to $8 per=
=20
megawatt-hour, are more significant now that overall prices have settled in=
to=20
a $100 range.=20
"They didn't mean as much to the suppliers when they were getting $400 per=
=20
megawatt-hour," Ackerman said.=20
He also said some of his members suspect the ISO made moves during power=20
alerts to artificially keep prices lower.=20
The FERC pricing regime sets nonemergency prices at 85 percent of the last=
=20
full hour of a Stage 1 emergency. But this week, the ISO twice went from a=
=20
Stage 1 to a Stage 2 alert in less than an hour. That kept the nonemergency=
=20
price cap in place at about $92 per megawatt-hour, set back in May.=20
"Some traders said the ISO is 'gaming the market' to keep the price lower,"=
=20
Ackerman said. "I have a few traders who think the price should be higher."=
=20
The ISO rejected the charge of manipulation and said it continues to make i=
ts=20
emergency declarations based on power supply and demand. The ISO also said =
it=20
has not identified transportation costs as a problem under the FERC order.=
=20
Other energy experts, however, said the FERC system of using the most=20
inefficient power plants to set emergency prices was a mistake.=20
Frank Wolak, a member of the ISO's market monitoring unit and a Stanford=20
University economist, said the plan invited energy companies to keep their=
=20
least efficient plants in operation to ensure the highest prices.=20
But James Sweeney, also a Stanford professor and energy expert, said he=20

the state's power. But the energy crunch and the state's effort to resolve =
it=20
could end up shrinking the role of renewable energy in the coming years jus=
t=20
as backers were hoping to see it expand.=20
For example:=20
?Long-term power contracts obtained by the state to reduce costs will cover=

most state needs for a decade. Nearly all of the contracts are with natural=

gas-fired plants, reducing the long-term market for new renewable plants.=

including "green power" from renewable sources, directly to customers. A=20
large base of ratepayers must stay in the state program to pay off a power=
=20
bond of up to $13.4 billion over 15 years. The state Public Utilities=20
Commission yesterday for the second time put off a decision whether to=20
curtail such direct access.=20
State and federal programs had been encouraging renewable energy to reduce=
=20
dependency on the new wave of relatively clean and efficient natural-gas=20
power plants. The cost of electricity from those plants could go up if the=
=20
demand for gas outpaces supply.=20
Renewable energy, with the exception of some biomass plants, also avoids th=
e=20
pollution problems of power plants fueled by oil and coal -- not to mention=
=20
the safety and radioactive waste-disposal problems of nuclear power.=20
A spokesman for a coalition of renewable generators and environmental group=
s=20
said he thinks renewable energy has suffered during the electricity crisis=
=20
because of a lack of attention, not a shift in state policy.=20
"I think the renewables are an unintended casualty," said V. John White of=
=20
the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies.=20
The state became a major player in the power equation in January when it=20
began buying power for debt-ridden utilities.=20
State officials say they would like to have a mix of power to spread the ri=
sk=20
if something goes wrong with one source. For example, soaring natural gas=
=20
prices last winter were part of the reason for the high cost of electricity=
.=20
In a trade-off, the state scrambled to obtain long-term contracts that woul=
d=20
lower the price of electricity now in exchange for prices that are expected=
=20
to be above the market in the years to come.=20
The 38 contracts, worth $43 billion over the next decade, will help finance=
=20
the construction of gas-fired power plants. About 70 percent of the power=
=20
will come from plants that have not yet been built.=20
Only four of the contracts are for renewable power, and their 120 megawatts=
=20
is a tiny fraction of the total amount of power now under state contract. A=
=20
megawatt can provide power for 750 to 1,000 homes.=20
"We agree the portfolio is lopsided and should be more diverse than it is,"=
=20
Ray Hart, head of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Wate=
r=20
Resources, told the Senate Energy Committee last month.=20
The state has agreements in principle on an additional 19 contracts for 1,2=
70=20
megawatts from renewable sources. Most of the power, 1,172 megawatts, would=
=20
come from wind generation.=20
"Anything could happen," said Oscar Hidalgo, a Water Resources spokesman. "=
It=20
could increase or decrease, depending on what gets signed."=20
One renewable generator, CalEnergy, said the state rejected its offer to=20
provide 340 megawatts from a geothermal plant in the Imperial Valley for 20=
=20
years at 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, a price that is said to be the 10-yea=
r=20
average of the state contracts.=20
"We were astonished," said Jonathan Weisgall, CalEnergy vice president.=20
Hidalgo said state power purchasers "don't recall the specifics" of the=20
CalEnergy offer. He said the proposal may have been rejected because of its=
=20
length, the time of the power delivery, or other reasons.=20
"They may have to regroup, restructure, repackage, and look for what we=20
want," Hidalgo said.=20
Under deregulation, part of monthly ratepayer bills were earmarked for a fu=
nd=20
to encourage renewable energy sources. The fund provides five-year incentiv=
es=20
of up to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
The state held auctions in 1998 and again last summer that awarded $202=20
million in incentives for dozens of new small renewable plants that could=
=20
produce about 1,000 megawatts. The average incentive was .4 cents per=20
kilowatt hour.=20
But at this point, said Marwan Masri of the California Energy Commission,=
=20
only plants capable of producing 180 megawatts have been completed.=20
"There is the overall issue of who will buy the power," said Masri, "and at=

SDG&E spreads word of looming blackouts=20

July 4, 2001=20
While power supplies dwindled and the likelihood of blackouts loomed, San=
=20
Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the first time yesterday was able to warn=20
customers in advance that they might go dark.=20
Under increasing pressure from businesses and residents, SDG&E launched a n=
ew=20
system to notify customers by pager and e-mail whenever the state declares=
=20
supply emergencies that might lead to blackouts.=20
Some 5,000 customers signed up for the warnings, which ended up being false=
=20
alarms by midafternoon when the Independent System Operator, which manages=

the state's electricity grid, was able to find enough megawatts to avoid th=
e=20
first blackouts since May.=20
"This at least gives people the opportunity to make a switch over to backup=

"=20
SDG&E spokesman Ed Van Herik said.=20
"It's definitely an improvement, but we'll certainly look for ways to=20
increase the effectiveness of the notification process."=20
Even so, the warnings from SDG&E came barely an hour before the ISO was=20
expected to issue a Stage 3 power alert, meaning that demand had climbed to=
=20
within 1.5 percent of available supplies. As it turned out, the state never=
=20
rose above a Stage 2 alert.=20
As the threat of blackouts continues to vex state power officials, early=20
warnings about potential outages have become a key issue for businesses and=

residents who rely on uninterrupted service.=20
During blackouts earlier this year, darkened traffic lights caused numerous=

"Regular notification is a good idea," said Samuel Ingersoll-Weng of the Sa=

"It would be very helpful in terms of scheduling staff, canceling or holdin=

For most of the year, SDG&E was telephoning a small number of such customer=

But the problem is that when orders to pull megawatts from the grid come fr=

Yesterday, SDG&E was told 90 minutes ahead of time that a Stage 3 warning=

described as a Southern gentleman.=20
But Curtis L. Wagner Jr. can lose the folksy charm in a New York minute.=20
Wagner, chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, showed his=

company executive in his hearing room in May. The executive confidently=20
insisted he didn't need his boss' approval to enter into a $39-million=20

Wagner didn't buy it.=20
"I'm appalled that you're trying to pull this over my eyes," intoned the=20
judge, stunning a courtroom of high-priced lawyers into catatonic silence.=

Added Wagner, owner of a 32-foot sailboat named "Hizzoner": "The head, for=

Visibly squirming, the witness acknowledged that his boss had, in fact, OKd=

That kind of mettle prompted FERC's governing board to assign the overcharg=
e=20
settlement case to the 72-year-old judge, who likes to stay in shape by=20
attending early-morning aerobics classes in the agency's exercise room. "I=

Commissioner Patrick H. Wood III.=20
Expectations are low that anybody can bridge the chasm between California a=
nd=20
electricity generators and marketers, with the state alleging it was gouged=

by $9 billion and the companies muttering about governmental extortion.=20
"There are some very large numbers being talked about, which makes it=20
unlikely that the companies would want to agree to a settlement," said Kit=
=20
Konolidge, an electricity industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York.=

But in an interview, Wagner said he feels "pretty good" about the chances. =
"I=20

nd=20
then all of a sudden it comes together."=20
FERC, the equivalent of a national utility commission, is also dangling som=
e=20
carrots in front of the parties. Along with refunds, Wagner is trying to ge=
t=20
a deal on long-term contracts for power and guarantees that the generators,=
=20
which are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, will be paid.=20
The commission set a short time frame for the negotiations, which are to=20
conclude Monday. If a settlement is not reachable, FERC would impose its ow=
n=20
solution. A mandated settlement is likely to be challenged in federal court=
,=20
where it could bog down for years.=20
FERC employs more than a dozen administrative law judges like Wagner to hea=
r=20
disputes involving the companies it regulates. While presiding over the=20
closed-door settlement talks, Wagner has traded his robes for a business=20
suit.=20
He has come down from the bench and sits at a table, eye-level with more th=
an=20
140 lawyers in his hearing room. "There's a lot of billable hours there," h=
e=20
said.=20
The lawyers have been sorted into three big working groups, representing=20
state agencies, power sellers and energy marketers. The negotiations are=20
expected to intensify this week, and participants said Wagner admonished al=
l=20
sides on Friday to be ready to deal or face summary judgment from the FERC=
=20
commission.=20
The judge has been variously quoted as saying that $1 billion, $2 billion o=
r=20
$2.5 billion might be an appropriate total refund. "None of those [figures]=
=20
are really attributable to me. I did make a statement--and I probably=20
shouldn't have--that it was probably less than $9 billion." Of the $9 billi=
on=20
in overcharges claimed by the state, only $5.4 billion is attributable to=
=20
sellers within FERC's jurisdiction.=20
James J. Hoecker, immediate past FERC chairman in the Clinton administratio=
n,=20
said that, in 23 years as chief judge, Wagner has built a reputation for=20
making things happen in difficult situations.=20
"What is behind that is a lot of years on the bench and a certain amount of=
=20
self-confidence," Hoecker said. "He has the ability . . . to move the parti=
es=20
closer together. Sometimes that requires some fairly dramatic statements,=
=20
which are calculated to get people to feel the heat and get more creative=
=20
about the flexibility they might have."=20
A senior FERC official said Wagner is like a pitcher who gets called from t=

=20
over to Curtis," said the official, who asked not to be identified.=20
Wagner has had many big cases over the years, on matters too arcane to garn=

national attention.=20
He is handling a second major case before FERC. It involves allegations tha=

Houston-based El Paso Corp. manipulated California 's natural gas market la=

year, thereby adding an estimated $3.7 billion to the state's energy costs.=
=20
It was in that case that he grilled the executive.=20
Success in the California settlement negotiations would cap Wagner's 47th=

Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal=20

California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of=20
dollars to keep the state's lights on.=20
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.=20
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet=

power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rat=
es=20
during periods of high demand.=20
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the=20
expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that=20
electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.=20
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said=
=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20

Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was =

"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up no=

heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their=20

Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said tha=

the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they=

=20
exacerbating Monday's shortage.=20

Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less=

under capped prices.=20
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.=20

'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'=20
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith=

"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"=

said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.=20
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue=

Davis seeking cheaper contracts=20
Posted at 10:33 p.m. PDT Wednesday, July 4, 2001=20
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK=20

Mercury News=20


California officials are asking energy companies for better deals on the=20
state's long-term power contracts as a way to settle a dispute over billion=
s=20
of dollars in electricity costs from the past year, Gov. Gray Davis said=20
Wednesday.=20
In closed-door Washington, D.C., settlement talks scheduled to conclude=20
Monday, state officials are demanding that energy companies forgo $8.9=20
billion in bills for electricity that the state argues was overpriced.=20
But Davis, during a San Jose visit Wednesday, said the state would consider=
=20
accepting some of that refund in the form of cheaper long-term contracts, a=
=20
move that could appease critics who say the $43 billion deals cost far too=
=20
much.=20
The governor's comments shed light on the state's bargaining strategy in th=
e=20
negotiations. Few details have emerged from the talks since the judge=20
overseeing them imposed a gag order.=20
``We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could=
=20
get us $8.9 billion,'' Davis said. ``We've said it doesn't have to be all=
=20
cash. You can give it to us in lower contract prices than you otherwise wou=
ld=20
have given to us. You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us=20
money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out to $8.9 billion.=
''=20
It's unclear how those offers have been received by energy suppliers, who=
=20
have insisted their prices were fair given the uncertainty over whether the=
y=20
would ever get paid. Several major companies, including Duke Energy and=20
Enron, say they're owed millions of dollars from the state and its major=20
utilities.=20
Paula Hall-Collins, a spokeswoman for Williams Companies, which signed=20
several contracts with the state in February to deliver power over the next=
=20
10 years, said she could not comment.=20
But one industry official said it was encouraging to see the governor show=
=20
some flexibility and that the concept seems reasonable.=20
``We take that as a positive,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of t=
he=20
Western Power Trading Forum, a trade association. ``If he wants to talk som=
e=20
trade-off in renegotiating the contracts, that doesn't seem to be totally o=
ut=20
of hand. We're not going to turn away any serious offer.''=20
But Ackerman said the state needs to give a little on its refund target.=20
The $8.9 billion, a figure estimated by the state's power grid analysts for=
=20
sales from May 2000 to May 2001, has been widely challenged by industry=20
leaders. Even the judge overseeing the settlement talks said it's probably=
=20
too high.=20
``I don't think it serves the state of California for the state to hold fas=
t=20
to a number, any more than it does for my members to do the same,'' Ackerma=
n=20
said. ``It just doesn't get to a solution. There's got to be some give and=
=20
take, and we certainly haven't heard that until now from the governor.''=20
The state began buying electricity in January for its largest utilities aft=
er=20
they became so saddled with debt from high power prices that energy compani=
es=20
refused to sell to them. The state has spent about $8 billion since then in=
=20
daily and short-term purchases.=20
The Davis administration signed $43 billion worth of electricity contracts=
=20
with 18 energy suppliers for power over the next 10 years and has dozens of=
=20
deals pending. The contracts are aimed at lowering the amount of power the=
=20
state has to buy in daily markets, where prices have soared.=20
Davis has credited the contracts with lowering the state's power costs from=
=20
$100 million a day or more in May to about $33 million a day. His chief=20
energy negotiator, S.?David Freeman, has said he's proud of the contracts.=
=20
But Davis has faced blistering criticism about the deals from Republican=20
lawmakers, state Controller Kathleen Connell and consumer advocates, who sa=
y=20
the contracts will soak consumers with high electricity prices for many=20
years.=20
Davis initially sought contracts at prices around $55 per megawatt-hour, bu=
t=20
the deals signed so far average $70 per megawatt-hour.=20
That was a bargain earlier this year when daily prices averaged more than=
=20
$200 per megawatt-hour. But average daily prices have since fallen to $89=
=20
during peak hours and as low as $56 during low-demand periods.=20
The average daily price in 1999 was about $30 per megawatt-hour.=20
If the state and power suppliers cannot reach an agreement by Monday, they=
=20
can request an additional 10 days. Otherwise, the judge will recommend a=20
settlement and the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will vo=
te=20
on it.=20
So far, the two sides still seem far apart.=20
``It's very, very difficult,'' said Davis, who named the state's negotiator=
s=20
to the Washington talks. ``We'll see on Monday whether or not agreements ar=
e=20
made. My hope is that a settlement will be reached. It's possible one will=

be.''=20
