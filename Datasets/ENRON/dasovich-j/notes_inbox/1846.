On November 20, 2000, the Cogeneration Association of California and the
Energy Producers and Users Coalition filed an application seeking relief
pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 372(f).   This code provision
provides that the Commission and the EOB shall determine if any
policy/action of the ISO unreasonably discourages the connection of existing
or new self generation or cogeneration and, if they determine that
actions/policies of the ISO do that, then they must take efforts to revise
such polices/actions.

CAC/EPUC are basically claiming that policies advanced and/or imposed by the
ISO are (or will) imposing unneeded and unreasonable economic burdens on
customers who would otherwise choose a self-generation alternative.  They
are asking that the Commission, in conjunction with the EOB, to undertake an
immediate investigation of the ISO actions and take remedial actions
necessary to eliminate the ISO's actions which have the effect of
disouraging he development and interconnection of retail customer owned
generation.

Please let me know if you are interested in more details or a copy of the
application.
