Dear Executive,


The Center for Information Technology & Marketplace Transformation (CITM) at 
the Haas School of Business is a world-famous research organization that 
explores the links between ecommerce, technology, and business strategy and 
processes.? For more information about CITM, please see: 

www.haas.berkeley.edu/citm

CITM recently began a new project, "Enabling eBusiness," that studies the 
migration to the Internet of companies across all industries.? Surveys and 
field studies at user and vendor companies and interaction with industry 
organizations and other research institutions will provide insight into, and 
case studies on, such topics as aligning business and IT strategy, best 
practices, build vs. buy, and organization structures.? 

To kick off the Enabling Ebusiness project, CITM held a major conference Dec. 
6, 2000 with experts from industry and academia who focussed on the 
opportunities presented by Ebusiness, strategies for achieving them and for 
overcoming legacies (technologies, processes, people and organizations).? The 
keynote speaker was George Surdu, Director of Information Technology Services 
for the Ford Motor Company, one of the sponsors of CITM. 

The conference was very well received and it is apparent that these issues 
are of interest to many companies.? Therefore, CITM is offering another 
conference on May 22, from 9 - 5 with a reception following in the early 
evening.? Our keynote speaker will be Steve Ellis, EVP of Wells Fargo's 
Wholesale Internet Solutions Group.? Also on the agenda: J_rgen Lutz, 
eProcurement, Bayer AG Leverkusen, and Mark V. Klopp, Managing Director, 
Digital Business Ventures, Eastman Chemical Company.? We expect other 
interesting speakers making for an absorbing and rewarding day.

Conference registration fee:$950 early registration; $1250 after May 7
