THE FOLLOWING IS FROM AN ACTUAL 1950'S HOME ECONOMICS TEXTBOOK INTENDED FOR 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, TEACHING THEM HOW TO PREPARE FOR

MARRIED? LIFE: 
1. Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious 
meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that

you have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs.? Most 
men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a

good meal are part of the warm welcome needed. 

2. Prepare yourself. Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he 
arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your

hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people. 
Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His

boring day may need a lift. 
3. Clear away clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house 
just before your husband arrives, gather up school

books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband 
will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and

it will give you a lift too.

4. Prepare the children. Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and 
faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if

necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like 
to see them playing the part. 

5. Minimize the noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of 
washer, dryer or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to

be quiet.? Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him. 

6. Some DON'TS. Don't greet him with problems or complaints.? Don't complain 
if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared

with what he might have gone through that day. 

7. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest 
he lay down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink

ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.? Speak in 
a low, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax

and unwind. 

8. Listen to him. You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the moment of 
his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.

9. Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner 
or to other places of entertainment instead try to

understand his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and 
relax. 

10. The goal. Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your 
husband can relax. 

? ***********************************
THE UPDATED VERSION FOR THE WOMAN OF 2000:
1. Have dinner ready. Make reservations ahead of time. If your day becomes 
too hectic just leave him a voice mail message regarding

where you'd like to eat and at what time. This lets him know that your day 
has been crappy and gives him an opportunity to change

your mood.

?2. Prepare yourself. A quick stop at the Clinique counter on your way home 
will do wonders for your outlook and will keep you from

becoming irritated every time he opens his mouth. (Don't forget to use his 
credit card.) 

3. Clear away the clutter. Call the housekeeper and tell her that any 
miscellaneous items left on the floor by the children can be

placed? in the Goodwill box in the garage. 

4. Prepare the children. Send the children to their rooms to watch television 
or play Nintendo. After all, both of them are from his

previous marriage. 

5. Minimize the noise. If you happen to be home when he arrives, be in 
bathroom with the door locked. 

6. Some DON'TS. Don't greet him with problems and complaints. Let him speak 
first, and then your complaints will get more attention

and remain fresh in his mind throughout dinner.? Don't complain if he's late 
for dinner, simply remind him that the leftovers are in

the fridge and you left the dishes for him to do. 

7. Make him comfortable. Tell him where he can find a blanket if he's cold.? 
This will really show you care. 

8. Listen to him. But don't ever let him get the last word. 

9. Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner 
or other places of entertainment, go with a friend or

go shopping (use his credit card.) Familiarize him with the phrase Girls' 
Night Out. 

10.The Goal. Try to keep things amicable without reminding him that he only 
thinks the world revolves around him.? Obviously he's

wrong, it revolves around you.
