Jeff & Sandi,

Got a call today from Kurt Lindahl of our Houston Enron Global Markets 
division, who will be here next week to meet with (among others) PG&E reps, 
as well as Sam Wehn of our office.  

He is working with a development team of engineers, looking at different 
sites, and he'd like to meet with both of you for your feedback and 
respective points of view with respect to regulatory and political 
obstacles/issues, to hopefully 
facilitate in the "packaging" of his recommendation(s)/proposal(s).

Please let me know of your availability to meet with him next Friday morning
(May 11).

Thanks,

Joseph
