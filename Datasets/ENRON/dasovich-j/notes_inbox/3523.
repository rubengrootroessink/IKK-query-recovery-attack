I suggest we meet at La Ginestra at 6:30 tomorrow night (its right next door
so we'll be able to run over when it looks like we need to).  We should
leave the city at 6pm and I told Molly that we would pick her up.  Whoever
gets there first get a table for 7 (if Don is coming, Stacy).

Can't wait!!

Cool!!!  It's at 8:30 on Thursday and you can call to reserve tickets if you
want (415-388-2820) but I am pretty sure it won't sell out.  They are a new
band, but a bunch of people we know that are really good.

I can't wait to see you!!  Is there a good place to go to dinner before hand
that you recommend?
