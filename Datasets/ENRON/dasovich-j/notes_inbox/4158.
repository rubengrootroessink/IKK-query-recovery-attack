Jeff - please call me regarding the growing turmoil surrounding the 
allocation of Socal and PG&E backbone capacity. In case you did not know, we 
own 550 MMcf/d on El Paso for a 5 year term in addition to 25 MMcf/d of 
incremental capacity on Kern's emergency open season. We need to be very 
plugged in to discussions/meetings/regulatroy proceedings in California.  
(GIR/Gas Accord etc.)

Do you have adequate resources to handle the gas issues in CA? I imagine that 
you are totally booked just dealing with the power issues.  

Please advise.

Regards,

Stephanie

FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in 
which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?

Best,
Jeff
