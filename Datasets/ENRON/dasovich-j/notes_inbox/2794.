=09=09 NEW YORK (VENTUREWIRE) -- The German media conglomerate Bertelsmann =
has=20
agreed to acquire MyPlay, a Redwood City, Calif.-based developer of digital=
=20
music storage technologies. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed but=
=20
the deal has been reported to be worth about $30 million. MyPlay, which was=
=20
backed by investors including Institutional Venture Partners, Integral=20
Capital Partners, and Vulcan Ventures to the tune of about $23 million, was=
=20
involved in serious acquisition talks with Yahoo! last year. The asking pri=
ce=20
during those discussions was $200 million before they fell apart in July=20
2000. Bertelsmann spokesperson Alexander Adler said the acquisition by=20
Bertelsmann would enable the German media group to launch a unified music=
=20
service, called BeMusic, which would combine its online and offline music=
=20
subsidiaries, including its BMG Music Group, its online retailer CDNow, and=
=20
MyPlay. The acquisition, according to Mr. Adler, will have no effect on=20
Bertelsmann's relationship with Napster. Bertelsmann has been alone among=
=20
major record labels in supporting the embattled music-swapping service and=
=20
has the option to become a major investor in Napster. Mr. Adler said the=20
acquisition of MyPlay was not a reaction to Vivendi Universal's acquisition=
=20
of MP3.com for $372 million last week. According to Mr. Adler, Bertelsmann=
=20
had been in discussions with MP3.com as well as MyPlay and decided to go wi=
th=20
the smaller -- and cheaper -- firm. "We were not interested in acquiring a=
=20
brand," Mr. Adler said, also noting that the price of the MyPlay acquisitio=
n=20
was less than purchases made by Bertelsmann competitors. Mr. Adler is=20
confident that the competition is healthy for the industry but he added tha=
t=20
Bertelsmann has $1 billion in revenue projected for the first year of the=
=20
BeMusic service and 6.5 million users already. Mr. Adler said that the=20
executive team would remain on board to operate MyPlay as a subsidiary of=
=20
Bertelsmann. He indicated that there would be no restructuring associated=
=20
with the acquisition, due in part to the February 200 layoffs of 41% of=20
MyPlay's staff. The company currently has 35 employees.=20
