Jeff -

Given everything going on, I've decided to not come to SF.  I still think 
that you, Sue, Harry and Michael should talk on Monday pm.  Michael has your 
address and will come by around 5pm

Jeff, Sue & Harry --

Michael and I are both in SF on Monday evening.  We were talking about 
getting together some time in the evening to put together a framework of our 
case around the Negative CTC in "bankruptcy" terms.

Does everyone agree and does the time work?

Jim
