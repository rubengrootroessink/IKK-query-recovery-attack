-- Company Provides Information on Consistency, Quality and Use of Energy -=
-

(Kennett Square, PA) May 1, 2001 =01) Enerwise Global Technologies, a major
provider of enterprise-wide energy intelligence and managed energy services
for domestic and international corporations, today announced the completion
of its spin-off from Conectiv, Inc.  Enerwise Global Technologies was forme=
d
with the assets of Conectiv Inc., in conjunction with funding by EnerTech
Capital Partners II L.P. and other leading energy industry venture capital
firms, including CapiTech, Inc., a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec.

Enerwise Global Technologies addresses the energy intelligence needs of
medium to large enterprises in a broad range of commercial and industrial
(C&I) segments for which managing the consumption, reliability, and cost of
energy is mission critical.  By capturing, integrating, analyzing and
monitoring vital energy and operational data for its customer, Enerwise
Global Technologies is able to recommend and implement solutions to improve
facility operations, increase reliability and reduce costs.

"The need for meaningful energy information will continue to rise as energy
supplies remain tight and energy prices prove volatile, and as many
businesses become increasingly aware that the quality and reliability of th=
e
energy they receive can have significant impact on their operations " said
Dom Geraghty, Senior Vice President of Enerwise Global Technologies.  "Our
vision is to transform the way businesses understand and make decisions abo=
ut
their energy consumption, thereby enabling them to manage their
energy-related costs while maintaining their up-time objectives."

Three key elements work in harmony to enable and distinguish Enerwise Globa=
l
Technologies from its competitors:

~ Expedient operational tactics combining the efficiency of the centralized=
,
24x7x365, remote-monitoring Information Command Centers (ICCs), with
convenient and secure customer access to up-to-the-minute intelligence via
the Web.
~ Reliable, robust technologies that can be seamlessly integrated into
existing enterprise systems and have been fully proven; in fact, they are
already in place in hundreds of major corporations.
~ Experienced energy management professionals who truly understand the ener=
gy
challenges that customers face, and who can offer real-world solutions to
help them meet those challenges.

"No other resource offers enterprises a more comprehensive energy
intelligence and management solutions set," said Scott Ungerer, Managing
Director of EnerTech Capital Partners.  "Enerwise Global Technologies is
immediately in a market-leading position as the only organization whose
solutions have been successfully implemented and are working for hundreds o=
f
demanding- and satisfied- customers."

From its headquarters in Kennett Square, PA,  Enerwise Global Technologies
provides energy intelligence and managed energy services for domestic and
international C&I customers, including companies that are leaders of their
industry segments.  Formed with assets contributed by Conectiv Inc., Enerwi=
