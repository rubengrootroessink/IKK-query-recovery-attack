companies while slowing their overall pace of private investment. Senior=20
portfolio manager, Louis Giglio, told VentureWire that the funds, which he=

manages from Minneapolis, will also not invest in any additional VC funds=

this year, opting instead to hold capital in reserve for follow-on rounds i=

Fund (since April 2000) and Strategy Aggressive Fund (since November 2000),=

said that later-stage companies were more attractive this year for=20
investment. "I would rather invest in a concept that is closer to=20
commercialization than not," said Mr. Giglio. "I don't want to fund someone=

for three years and see a lot of red on the income statement. I want to see=

earnings at a reasonable point in time." The two funds will allocate no mor=
