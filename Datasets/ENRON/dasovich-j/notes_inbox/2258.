Hello to the ARM Team,

FYI---the following memo was released by the ISO this afternoon

Tracy Fairchild


 This memo is to alert you to the likelihood that we will be declaring a
> Stage 3 emergency later today and interrupting approx.. 1500 MW of firm
> load for the 5:00 to 8:00 timeframe.  The anticipated emergency is due to
> greatly reduced imports (2700 MW, down from 5300 MW) and the large number
> of unit outages, both planned (4800 MW) and forced (6300, of which 2400
> are NoX constrained), combined with a projected peak of approximately
> 34,000 MW.  We have advised the Governor's office, the EOB, FERC and DOE
> of the situation, and we are working with the State to bring on line some
> of the NoX constrained units, which, due to ramp up, will not be available
> until sometime tomorrow at the earliest. With predictions of colder
> weather for later this week and the urgent need for maintenance on one of
> the nuclear units during the weekend, we are facing a challenging week.
>

Thanks,
