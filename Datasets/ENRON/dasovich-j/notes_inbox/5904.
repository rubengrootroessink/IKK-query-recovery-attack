Hi Evening MBA Students,

Happy New Year to you!  Spring Semester classes will begin Tuesday, January
16, and I wanted to note the following:

Back to School Packages.
We will be sending out the "Back to School" package to your home addresses
on Monday, January 8.  This package includes information on courses, books,
rooms, parking and other important items.  First class assignments, if any,
will be included in the Back to School package or mailed separately.

Textbooks and Readers.
Textbooks and readers will be available to you the first week of classes:
First-year students:  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings from
5:00-6:00 pm and 7:30-8:15 pm in room F621.

Second- and third- year students:  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings
from 5:00-6:00 pm and 7:30-8:15 pm in room C132.

After that, I'll have the books for you in the Evening MBA office.

Parking Passes and Permits.
The parking department only has enough parking passes at the moment to
distribute one package to each student who has requested parking.  We will
contact you as soon as the second and third packages come in.

Fall 00 E203 Students.
If you checked out a calculator for E203 last fall, you will need to return
it to the office before you can pick up your Spring 01 books and readers.

We look forward to seeing you again,
TJ
