Jeff,
I'm working with the California Resturant Association on a member program.  
Their Government Affairs Person, Jot Condi has asked for our help.  Would you 
review his concern and let me know what steps, if any we can take.  Feel free 
to contact Jot directly at 916-431-2724.

Subject:  Enron's Response to IRF Solicitation

I received your letter to discuss options with Enron.  Based on latest
developments it will be important to discuss options as soon as possible.  If
Senate Bill 27X does not pass, or it compromises to favor only accounts under
500 kW, then there is a short window of opportunity to commit to direct access
before AB 1x is enacted.

I will have a contract for review in the next few days, but in the meantime,
please feel free to call me at the following:
