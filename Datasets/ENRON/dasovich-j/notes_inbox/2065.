We're still getting everything through channels here.  Basically, however,
the current thinking seems to be that we are currently expending a lot of
political capital to get through the current electricity crisis, and we are
nervous about expending our chips on gas.  Not that it is not important,
but we also have to stay focused.  Therefore, we are hesitant to take the
lead here.   This does not endanger Doug or my involvement, but it means
that we don't want this to look like an Edison led effort.  Again, we
expect to check with the SF folks (although we haven't had time to yet), so
the matter is not closed, but we don't expect enthusiasm.

There are two other factors which affect our taking the lead.  The first of
these is relative credibility.  I don't think Edison has enough clout in
these matters to make the logical lead.  Either a combined front (I have
even thought that we might want to create a CAC letterhead for this, and
get the others to join in the CAC for this portion of the fight), or else
letting ORA lead would be good.  The PD really topples ORA from its place
on the customer advocacy dais, and builds TURN up as the legitimate
advocate.  It even suggests that AGLET is a serious representative (which,
given their testimony is a real insult).  I think ORA needs to establish
its credibility.  Otherwise, everytime they disagree with TURN, they lose,
just by contrast.

The other factor is SCE's position on the retail provisions.  We have to be
scrupulously not supportive.  And, to the degree that we take the lead,
that portion of the Comprehensive Settlement is not pushed, or else the CS
parties can look divided on some issues, which is not an image we want to
project.

Lastly, Doug heard a rumor that SoCalGas was going to try to hold an
all-party meeting on Monday down here.  Have you heard anything or talked
to them yet?  Certainly now that the Interim Settlement was modified, they
are off the hook about supporting it, and can be a lot bolder about the
advantages of the Comprehensive Settlement over the modified Interim...
