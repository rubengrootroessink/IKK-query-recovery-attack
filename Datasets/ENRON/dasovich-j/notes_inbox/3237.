Bush: Plan spells relief on energy=20
By James Rosen
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 17, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- President Bush gave an upbeat preview Wednesday of the energy=
=20
plan he will formally unveil today, saying it will give Americans relief fr=
om=20
high gasoline and power prices -- and show the world how the United States=
=20
solves tough problems.=20
Bush gave the plan rave reviews after he and his Cabinet received a briefin=

on it from Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy task force he headed=
=20
during nearly four months of closed-door meetings.=20
"My plan helps people in the short term and long term by expediting energy=

development," Bush said as he waved a copy of the blue-covered report. "Thi=
s=20
isn't just a report that's going to gather dust. This is an action plan=20

Bush planned to fly to the Midwest this morning and promote the energy plan=

"We're deeply concerned about the state of California, as we are with the=

"Interestingly enough, this is the first comprehensive energy policy probab=

ever -- certainly in a long time."=20
Bush's robust defense of his reaction to the country's potential energy=20

But Democrats believe that Bush and Cheney are relying too much on energy=

"What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price gouging and=

them, incidentally, located in Texas," Davis said.=20
But Bush was unrelenting. "Price controls do not increase supply, nor do th=

Bush has raised the political stakes by urging Congress to pass his $1.35=

challenge prompted Democratic Rep. Jay Inslee of Washington state to brand=

FERC nominees open to rate caps=20

(Published May 17, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- President Bush's two nominees to the Federal Energy Regulator=

Commission said at their Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday that more=20
needs to be done to remedy California's "dysfunctional" energy market, and=
=20
they didn't rule out controls on wholesale rates.=20
But Patrick Wood III, the chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission,=
=20
and Pennsylvania Utility Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell also said that=20
re-regulating wholesale prices based on the cost of production is a complex=
=20
process that might take too long to be of any help.=20
"It is no small task," said Wood, who is considered Bush's choice to replac=
e=20
Curt Hebert Jr. as commission chairman later this year. Hebert is a firm=20

that during last week's power shortages hit $1,900 a megawatt-hour.=20
"I was encouraged," Feinstein said. "The market is broken in California and=
 I=20
think they understand that. If they know all this and they are pragmatists,=

then we have a chance."=20
The commission is split 2-1 against price controls. If Wood and Brownell=20

Powerful new law for state: The public authority could seize private plants=

But critics say pouring billions of public money into new power plants or=

Threats and accusations are getting increasingly heated as the state, after=

spending more than $7 billion on electricity, continues to struggle with=20
prospects of rising costs and increasing power blackouts this summer.=20
"Calling people pirates and gougers is a nice way of spinning the problem=

away from Sacramento, but we have to work our way through this (energy=20
crisis), and calling people names doesn't help," said Jan Smutny-Jones,=20
executive director of Independent Energy Producers, an association of=20
wholesale generators.=20
The newly approved power authority, expected to be created in about three=

Davis also promised Wednesday to consider, if approved by legislators, a=20

Although many were supportive of PG&E Corp. CEO Robert D. Glynn Jr., choosi=

Governor signs power authority bill=20



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
May 16, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO =01) California will no longer be held captive by energy supplie=
rs=20
charging high prices for power, Gov. Gray Davis said Wednesday as he=20
officially put California into the electricity wholesale business.=20
By signing a bill by Senate Leader John Burton, Davis created the Californi=
a=20
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority =01) a new state agency=
 that=20
can issue up to $5 billion in revenue bonds to build, purchase, lease or=20
operate power plants.=20
Plants financed by the authority will provide cost-based electricity to=20
California consumers, Davis said, which will help stabilize the state's=20
volatile energy market.=20
The power authority is modeled after one in New York, which has 10 power=20
plants, 1,400 miles of transmission lines and produces about 25 percent of=
=20
the state's power. Nebraska also has a power authority, which created a=20
market in which residents pay 22 percent less than the national average,=20
Burton said.=20
An increase in the number of power plant down for repairs this year "is=20
strong evidence that people are manipulating the market by withholding powe=
r=20
to drive up prices," Davis said.=20
"The only way we can fight back against this type of price gouging and=20
manipulation is to build more plants," he said at the bill signing ceremony=
=20
in front of a Sacramento Municipal Utility District power plant.=20
Having a public power authority will "supplement not supplant" private ener=
gy=20
sources, Davis said.=20
"In a deregulated world, the only way you can guarantee reliable affordable=
=20
power is to build it yourself if private companies won't do it," he said.=
=20
The bill gives the power authority the power of eminent domain, but Burton,=
=20
D-San Francisco, said if the state were to seize any power plants he would=
=20
prefer that it would be by using the governor's emergency power, because th=
at=20
process is quicker.=20
"Sooner or later the state has got to let these buccaneers know that we're=
=20
not going to tolerate what they're doing to us," Burton said. "The only thi=
ng=20
these exploiters understand is possibly a little counterterrorism."=20
Few Republicans in the Legislature supported the bill, saying the state=20
shouldn't get further into the power business. They also warned that it cou=
ld=20
discourage private companies from building plants.=20
The bill was sponsored by state treasurer Philip Angelides, who conceded th=
at=20
it won't save California from blackouts this summer but will help stabilize=
=20
the energy markets as more generators are built.=20
"This legislation will help ensure that California is never again held=20
hostage by an unregulated private energy market run amok," Angelides said a=
t=20
a news conference in Los Angeles before speaking at a Town Hall event.=20
The treasurer said the bill is the "beginning of the end for deregulation .=
..=20
which has proven to be a disaster."=20
He repeatedly blamed the crisis on out-of-state power generators.=20
"There is a tremendous drain on California because of generators' prices," =
he=20
said. "And that drain is heading straight to the heart of Texas."=20
Other key lawmakers urged Davis Wednesday to join with the governors of=20
Washington and Oregon to set a limit on the price the states would pay for=
=20
power this summer, creating a "buyers' cartel."=20
The states should set their own price ceiling on electricity in light of=20
federal regulators' refusal to set region-wide caps, said Fred Keeley,=20
D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy.=20
The states would refuse to pay, under any circumstances, more than a=20

?????Still, Leamer said the economy is much less dependent on energy today=

than it was at the time of past oil-price-related downturns.
?????The effect is particularly limited in California, some economists say,=

Davis Turns Up the Heat on Supplier=20
Power: Reliant Energy says escalating rhetoric might be leading toward=20
seizure of a plant.=20

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--After months of broadly vilifying California's energy=20
suppliers, Gov. Gray Davis has launched a new offensive, taking aim at a=20
single firm: Houston-based Reliant Energy, whose executives believe the=20
governor may be building a case to confiscate the company's power plants.
?????Intensifying his assault, Davis on Wednesday called Reliant=20
"obstructionist." He warned that actions taken by Reliant and other=20
independent generators this summer will determine whether he signs a windfa=
ll=20
profits tax bill or, in the extreme, commandeers the electricity produced b=
y=20
a plant or seizes the facility itself.
?????"I've made clear to the generators that they can influence my decision=
,"=20
Davis said in an interview. "We have a very tough summer ahead of us. We ne=
ed=20
their full cooperation. . . . I reserve the right to do what is in the=20
state's best interest. I think it is fair to say that Reliant is not off to=
 a=20
good start."
?????Earlier in the day, after signing a bill creating a power authority in=
=20
California, the governor warned electricity suppliers: "If they don't want =
to=20
see their plants seized, they should make sure their plants are up and=20
running this summer."
?????The increasingly hostile barbs have grabbed Reliant's attention. Some=
=20
executives believe they are being set up by the administration--for what,=
=20
they're not sure. But the company is reviewing contingency plans, ranging=
=20
from what plant operators should do if their facilities are picketed and wh=
o=20
they should call if state officials show up unannounced.
?????"We would hope," Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said, "that=20
draconian measures and political rhetoric and finger-pointing would not be=
=20
pursued. But there is a history of confiscatory actions, including seizure =
of=20
power contracts with other companies."
?????Earlier this year, Davis used his emergency authority to seize long-te=
rm=20
power contracts that Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric=
=20
had signed with power sellers. Those contracts were about to be auctioned b=
y=20
California's power market to reimburse generators owed money by the hobbled=
=20
utilities.
?????By seizing the contracts--estimated to be worth nearly $1 billion--Dav=
is=20
was able to ensure that power would be sold to California at relatively low=
=20
prices, rather than resold on the costlier spot market. Under his emergency=
=20
authority, Davis could use the same tactic to seize power plants, or the=20
power produced by the facilities.
?????But such an act would pose huge risks. Perhaps most troublesome, other=
=20
private companies might react by pulling investments out of California or, =
in=20
the case of out-of-state generators, stop sales here.
?????Still, as the power crisis worsens and public frustration grows, calls=
=20
for the governor to seize power plants have become more intense.
?????"Sooner or later," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton said Wednesday=
,=20
"we've got to let these buccaneers know that we're not going to tolerate wh=
at=20
they're doing to us. The only thing these exploiters would understand is=20
possibly a little counterterrorism."
?????Reliant got involved in California's deregulated market in 1998, buyin=
g=20
five power plants from Edison for $292 million. Combined, the plants are=20
capable of supplying 3,700 megawatts of electricity, enough to serve 2.8=20
million homes.
?????In the first quarter of 2001, Reliant's wholesale energy sales increas=
ed=20
by 171%, producing income of $216 million, compared to a loss of $22 millio=
n=20
for the same period last year.
?????Reliant is not alone in making huge money off California's deregulatio=
n=20
debacle. Also profiting have been Duke Energy, Williams Cos., Mirant Corp.=
=20
and Dynegy Inc.--all based outside California.
?????In the past, Davis has used an assortment of inflammatory terms to=20
broad-brush the generators. He recently called them "the biggest snakes on=
=20
the planet Earth."
?????But Reliant in particular has drawn the governor's wrath for allegedly=
=20
being more recalcitrant than the others in working with the administration.
?????"They just want to bleed us dry," Davis said in his interview with The=
=20
Times. "I'm not saying they're unique in that capacity. But they are unique=
ly=20
obstructionist."
?????Davis said that, among other things, Reliant has opposed court and=20
federal orders that it sell power to the state and recently refused to=20
forgive a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars it is owed by=20
California's utilities.
?????Reliant also informed Davis that it is asking higher prices in part=20
because it added a credit charge, essentially questioning the state's=20
credit-worthiness.
?????Last Thursday, the governor decided to go public--to "name names," in=
=20
the words of his chief political strategist, Garry South.
?????"The reason these generators have gotten away with murder is because=
=20
people in California don't know who they are," South said. "They aren't=20
household names. . . . People are not familiar with their names, their logo=
,=20
or what they do."
?????Breaching confidentiality surrounding the state's power purchases, Dav=
is=20
announced at a press conference that the state paid $2,000 per megawatt-hou=
r=20
to avert blackouts last week, and named Reliant as the seller.
?????The price--actually $1,900 per megawatt-hour--was five times recent=20
market prices.
?????The governor continued his attack on ABC's Sunday morning news show,=
=20
"This Week." He again cited the amount Reliant had charged but this time pu=
t=20
a partisan spin on it.
?????"That is obscene," Davis said of the price. "No one can defend that. T=

=20
and Vice President Cheney, and they can't just sit back there and say, 'Hey=
,=20
it ain't our problem.' "
?????Reliant is a major political player nationally, particularly in the=20
Republican Party, giving more than $250,000 to various national GOP=20
committees last year. Steve Letbetter, Reliant's chief executive, was one o=
f=20
President Bush's so-called "pioneers"--donors who committed that they would=
=20
raise at least $100,000 for his presidential campaign.
?????Like most independent power generators, Reliant has become a more=20

=20
last year--including $10,000 to Davis last May--and spending $106,000 on=20
lobbying, plus $40,000 so far this year.
?????Reliant spokesman Wheatley said that despite the governor's invective,=

his company is committed to seeking solutions to California's problems and=

that it has "operated legally and ethically."
?????"Regardless of what happens," Wheatley said, "we're going to make ever=

that have been made."=20
?????In fact, Reliant executives wonder whether the state is playing fairly=

itself, possibly paying the record $1,900 a megawatt hour to give the=20

?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said he never expected the state to=

pay that amount. He said the company bid exceptionally high in the hopes th=

it would not have to run one of its so-called peaker plants, which the=20

Gov. Gray Davis asked the commission to "stay its hand" on matters relating=

An industry group predicted this week that the state will face 260 hours of=

?????But the move was greeted angrily by Davis, who has been holding his ow=

the sale of QF power "on the outrageously expensive spot market.
?????"I want to send a simple message to FERC: Read the Hippocratic oath:=

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Angry PG&E Corp. shareholders vented their frustration=

during the company's annual meeting Wednesday, blaming management for a=20
bankruptcy filing that could wipe out their investments.
?????Dozens of retired company employees and other stockholders cheered at=

calls for the resignation of Chief Executive Robert Glynn at the contentiou=

meeting in a Nob Hill auditorium as police barriers kept activists at a=20

from more than $30 in September.

?????But Glynn was careful to avoid seeming arrogant, professing=20
disappointment with the past year's performance and treating most of his=20

?????"No one wanted this to happen," Glynn said of the bankruptcy filing.

(05-17) 06:00 PST -- A federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco has ordere=
d=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay $41.2 million in overdue property taxes=
=20
to 49 counties in the state.=20
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali on Wednesday turned down the utility's=

proposal to pay the taxes only to counties that agreed to forgo late paymen=
t=20
fees and penalties.=20
The judge told PG&E lawyers, "Somebody is going to have to tell me why I ha=
ve=20
to hold California counties hostage for debts that you owe."=20
He instructed to the utility to pay the taxes -- which were due on April 10=
=20
-- in full within five days. The judge said PG&E and the counties could=20
negotiate later about whether the utility must pay penalties, which include=
 a=20
10 percent delinquent penalty plus 1.5 percent per month in interest.=20
The taxes accrued between Jan. 1 and April 5, the day before PG&E filed its=
=20
petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection. Because the filing of=
=20
the petition suspended previous debts, PG&E needed court authorization to p=
ay=20
them.=20
A group of 16 counties -- including Alameda, San Francisco, Santa Clara and=
=20
Sonoma counties in the Bay area -- opposed PG&E's plan to pay only counties=
=20
that waived the penalties.=20
San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne said after the hearing, "The rulin=

"This is a great day for the students of California ... and for the people =

The funeral was for two resolutions adopted by the regents in 1995, which t=

More blackouts but no ransom payments for energy gougers -- that's a deal=
=20
looking increasingly attractive to California lawmakers and consumer=20
advocates.=20
The idea, which has attracted the support of some key lawmakers and the=20
cautious interest of Gov. Gray Davis, is for the state to set a firm ceilin=
g=20
on what it will pay power producers for electricity this summer -- and not=
=20
one dime more.=20
The trade-off would be certain blackouts, possibly more than if the state=
=20
continues to pay any price electricity sellers demand.=20
Some advocates of the idea think that California could minimize the number =
of=20
blackout hours and gain a measure of control over the energy crisis by=20
scheduling service interruptions.=20
"We need to stop this game of electricity chicken," said Michael Shames,=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, which first proposed the=
=20
idea. "We are likely to see blackouts this summer; we should use them to ou=
r=20
advantage rather than be victimized by them."=20
The plan calls for creating a "buyers' cartel" of California, Oregon and=20
Washington. Essentially, the states would decide at what price they were=20
willing to buy power and refuse to purchase once it tops that level.=20
The state has spent $6 billion on energy purchases since January, and at on=
e=20
point during last week's power shortage was spending $1,900 per megawatt ho=
ur=20
-- more than 10 times what Davis has planned on for this summer. That kind =
of=20
spending cannot go on, Democratic Assemblyman Fred Keeley of Boulder Creek=
=20
said yesterday.=20
"The question is, can we sustain the level of spending we have and have the=
=20
state maintain economic stability? I believe the answer is no," said Keeley=
,=20
the lower house's main figure on energy policy and author of the bill that=
=20
put the state in the power-buying business.=20
"To get this problem solved, we have to think in bold terms," said Keeley,=
=20
who introduced a resolution along with fellow Democratic Assemblyman Paul=
=20
Koretz of West Hollywood that urged Davis to form a cartel.=20
THREE STATES ARE BETTER THAN ONE
Davis said last week that "my bias would be to keep the lights on at any=20
price." But yesterday, the governor said a temporary price limit is=20
"certainly a matter we've talked about and considered at some length. The=
=20
next step will be to see how the governors of Oregon and Washington respond=
=20
to it."=20
A spokesman for Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the matter is being=20
considered. Calls to the office of Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber were not=20
returned.=20
The idea has appeal among some consumers who believe, as many state officia=
ls=20
do, that California is being gouged for electricity.=20
"I can see if our bills were $20 or $30 more, but this is ridiculous," said=
=20
Kimberly Chambers, an 18-year-old fashion design student from Oakland.=20
"Whatever it takes, I don't think we should have to pay for more."=20
But Yunah Kim, 36, who moved to the Bay Area from New York a month ago, sai=
d=20
blackouts should not even be considered.=20
"The infrastructure of government is coming apart, and it's the basic servi=
ce=20
government is able to provide," she said. "Businesses are not going to put =
up=20
with that. It's very shortsighted. We just have to pay until there's a=20
solution."=20
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institu=
te=20
in Berkeley, said blackouts might be worse than supporters of price limits=
=20
believe.=20
"I think they (power companies) would call our bluff," and sell their=20
electricity elsewhere, Borenstein said. "I don't think the state has the=20
ability to credibly commit to paying no more than 'X.' That would be a very=
=20
controversial decision."=20
Legislation is already in the works to give Davis the ability to enter into=
 a=20
West Coast buyers cartel. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Dede Alpert, D-=20
Coronado, would allow the Independent System Operator to refuse to buy powe=
r=20
if it is too expensive.=20
The maximum the state would pay would be set by a formula, based on such=20
things as the cost of natural gas. A reasonable profit for power producers=
=20
would be built in, supporters said.=20
LOOKING FOR SOME CONTROL
Alpert said everyone wants to avoid blackouts, but that seems unlikely.=20
"Everybody I talked to -- once you establish that there will be blackouts -=
-=20
both businesses and residents say, let's have control," Alpert said.=20
The California Manufacturers and Technology Association, which commissioned=
 a=20
recent report that said unplanned blackouts could cost the state economy $2=
1.=20
8 billion and 135,000 jobs, is considering whether scheduled interruptions=
=20
would be less harmful.=20
"The problem if we do (scheduled blackouts) is that we may have an inordina=

amount of blackouts," said Gino DeCaro, a spokesman for the group.=20
NO EASY TASK
The ISO, which runs the state's power grid, is scheduled to issue a report=

tomorrow on how scheduled blackouts might work.=20
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, said that planning blackouts is not as=

"The difficulty is a pragmatic one -- the circuits are not wired to deal wi=

San Francisco -- San Francisco International Airport officials angrily=20
accused a Texas energy firm yesterday of an 11th-hour attempt to price goug=
e=20
the airport in a deal for a 51-megawatt "peaker" plant needed to avoid summ=
er=20
blackouts.=20
Instead, airport officials said they will work with the city-owned Hetch=20
Hetchy Water and Power agency to fast-track development of its own gas-fire=
d=20
peaker plant, said airport spokesman Ron Wilson. The goal will be to build =
a=20
permanent 571-megawatt plant that could power 571,000 homes.=20
An irate Wilson said the airport broke off negotiations with El Paso Mercha=
nt=20
Energy Co. after the Houston firm allegedly jacked up the cost of the deal.=
=20
An original agreement to supply power to the airport was approved by the=20
airport commission March 20. The day before it was to be voted on, El Paso=
=20
indicated that it was going to need more money -- and the airport said the=
=20
numbers being discussed were untenable.=20
"They wanted to get into our pockets so deep that we're not even dealing wi=
th=20
them anymore," Wilson said. The terms of the rejected agreement were not=20
immediately available yesterday.=20
"DOLLAR SIGNS FLASHING"=20
"The dollar signs are flashing in their eyes and they don't care whether=20
you've got power or not as long as they can make their money," Wilson said.=
=20
An official of the Texas firm's parent company, El Paso Corp., expressed=20
surprise at the San Francisco airport's decision to break off negotiations=
=20
and denied any charges that the supplier tried to shake down the airport.=
=20
"As far as we're concerned, we're still negotiating on the project with the=
m=20
and we'd love to do it," said Norma Dunn, an El Paso senior vice president.=
=20
"All of the talk of changing the deal, of course, is not true. We're still=
=20

California regulators are also accusing El Paso Merchant Energy of trying t=
o=20
drive up natural gas prices by restricting access to the company pipeline=
=20
into Southern California.=20
The SFO plant was scheduled to go online in August.=20
Airport officials said yesterday that the airport now plans to begin=20
assembling 10 one-megawatt plants that could be running by June 1 to help=
=20
keep airport terminals cool when the summer power crunch arrives.=20
SEVERAL SCENARIOS
Because the California Energy Commission has already licensed the El Paso=
=20
peaker plant, SFO could quickly take over the project under several=20
scenarios, said Claudia Chandler, the CEC's assistant executive director.=
=20
The fastest way is for El Paso to voluntarily transfer the plant license to=
=20
SFO, which could have the peaker plant running by late July, she said.=20
If El Paso won't cooperate, SFO could seek its own license under a 21-day=
=20
approval process that Gov. Gray Davis ordered in February to speed=20
development of the temporary plants.=20
Given the 21-day approval, SFO could have the plant running by September. T=
o=20
speed approval, Chandler said, the airport would have to keep the location,=
=20
size and type of plant similar to the El Paso proposal.=20
If there are substantial changes, SFO could seek a seven-day license=20
amendment.=20
"Even if SFO was unsuccessful in negotiating with El Paso to transfer the=
=20
license, if they filed their application right now . . . that puppy would g=
o=20
through the licensing process quite rapidly," Chandler said. 'We're very=20

San Francisco -- Bay Area governments, strapped by rising energy costs,=20
received a bit of a boost yesterday when a federal bankruptcy judge ordered=
=20
the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay their outstanding property taxes, b=
ut=20
the overall energy outlook still appears bleak.=20
Rising energy bills in San Francisco, for example, forced a Board of=20
Supervisors panel yesterday to dip $4 million into the city's reserves, set=
=20
aside for everything from hospital laundry service to heat at the jails.=20
A Bankruptcy Court judge in San Francisco ordered PG&E to pay $41 million i=
n=20
overdue property taxes the utility owes California counties.=20
The utility's taxes were due April 10. It's still unclear whether PG&E will=
=20
have to pay roughly $8 million in penalty fees to 49 counties.=20
"Money like that is welcome," said Napa County Treasurer-Tax Collector Marc=
ia=20
Humphrey, whose county is owed $262,364 in property taxes and another $26,0=
00=20
in penalties.=20
While yesterday's decision helps, Bay Area cities and counties are struggli=
ng=20
to balance higher energy costs with the other demands on their budgets.=20
For example, Alameda County spent $1.4 million on natural gas during the la=
st=20
fiscal year and expects to spend $2.3 million during the current fiscal yea=
r,=20
which ends June 30. Next year, the natural gas budget will jump to $2.7=20
million, said Matthew Muniz, energy program manager for Alameda County.=20
Alameda County had budgeted $6.8 million for electricity costs, Muniz said,=
=20
but that may balloon to $12.3 million in the worst case scenario. The=20
additional money has been set aside in a contingency fund so services=20
shouldn't be affected.=20
Santa Clara County faces a similar situation.=20
"The (power) budget is going to be bigger this year, that's for sure. But h=
ow=20
much bigger, we don't know yet," said Kevin Carruth, Santa Clara County's=
=20
director of the General Services Agency.=20
In San Francisco, operations supported by the general fund -- among them=20
recreation centers, the hospital and health clinics, police stations,=20
firehouses, the animal shelter and the jails -- originally were allocated=
=20
$10. 5 million for energy costs. Now the bills are projected to jump to=20
nearly $17 million -- a 61 percent increase.=20
Some departments plan to absorb all or part of the costs; others needed a=
=20
special handout, totaling $4 million, which the Board of Supervisors Financ=
e=20
Committee approved yesterday. Operations that don't rely on the general fun=
d,=20
such as Muni and the airport, are expected to overspend their power budgets=
=20
by another $5 million, bringing the citywide energy deficit to $11 million.=
=20
"It's a strain on the budget, but it's not a budget buster," said City=20
Controller Ed Harrington.=20
As power costs have jumped, the city has fattened its coffers with an extra=

Utilities Commission may mean even more money for San Francisco. The city's=
=20
Hetch Hetchy power agency, which generates and sells electricity, will be=

able to charge more because its rates are tied to those charged by PG&E.=20
Meanwhile, government leaders are looking for creative ways to combat the=

San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano yesterday presente=
d=20
an ambitious proposal to install a network of energy-producing panels on=20

Nuclear, fossil fuels at heart of Bush plan=20
SWEETENER: $6.3 billion in tax credits for solar and renewable power=20

N233180.DTL&type=3Dnews=20
Washington -- The Bush administration, warning that the nation faces its mo=
st=20
serious energy crisis since the 1973 oil embargo, last night released=20
highlights of a long-awaited national energy plan that relies on increasing=
=20
supplies of energy.=20
As expected, the plan proposes to increase production of fossil fuels and=
=20
nuclear power, in many cases by easing regulatory barriers, while sweetenin=
g=20
the deal with $6.3 billion in new tax credits for "green energy" fuels such=
=20
as solar and biomass.=20
While declaring that years of "neglect" have created the problem, the=20
administration's report on the plan insists that technology, not austerity,=
=20
offers a way out.=20
"Our prosperity and way of life are sustained by energy use," the report=20
says.=20
Speaking briefly to reporters, President Bush called the plan "a very=20
optimistic look at America," but one that is "tough, in that it lays out th=
e=20
problems."=20
The 163-page plan cites California's blackouts in its second paragraph,=20
saying they "demonstrate the problem of neglecting energy supply." But as t=
o=20
immediate remedies, the plan says, "unfortunately, there are no short-term=
=20
solutions to long-term neglect."=20
"We're going to solve this problem," Bush said early yesterday before the=
=20
report's release. "This isn't just a report that's going to gather dust."=
=20
Reacting to charges that he is offering no immediate relief on gasoline=20
prices and is captive to the energy industry, Bush also promised that his=
=20
administration would "make sure that nobody in American gets illegally=20
overcharged" for gasoline and that federal electricity regulators would=20
monitor prices "to make sure they are fair and reasonable."=20
Bush also said he has worked with California officials to expedite power=20
plant permitting and is "deeply concerned" about the state.=20
"The quicker supply gets on, the easier it's going to be for the consumers =
in=20
the state of California," Bush said.=20
White House officials said Bush will issue two executive orders next week=
=20
that would direct federal agencies to speed permitting of energy facilities=
=20
and require studies of the energy impact of regulatory actions.=20
As the administration has said in interviews and statements the past month,=
=20
the report focuses on increasing supplies of traditional fossil fuels and=
=20
nuclear power, with a heavy stress on updating the nation's electricity gri=
d=20
and other energy infrastructure.=20
A senior administration described the grid as a relic of the 1950s that=20
balkanizes the country into isolated power islands, preventing transmission=
=20
from areas of ample supply to areas of shortages.=20
In an attempt to mitigate rising gasoline prices, the report also orders an=
=20
Environmental Protection Agency review of "boutique" gasoline formulas that=
=20
various states require to control air pollution. The aim is to standardize=
=20
fuel blends so that regions are less dependent on single refineries.=20
In a pre-emptive strike, Democrats attacked the plan as ineffective hours=
=20
before the highlights were released.=20
"The president seems almost totally indifferent" to California's blackouts,=
=20
said House minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.=20
The report calls for easing regulations that inhibit new electricity=20
transmission lines and gas pipelines, including calling for federal=20
condemnation of private property to build power lines.=20
It stresses increased use of coal as the nation's "most abundant fuel sourc=
e"=20
and recommends revisiting nuclear power, encouraging expansion of existing=
=20
plants and easier licensing for new nuclear technologies.=20
DRILLING ON PUBLIC LANDS
And it calls for a thorough review of all public lands to open areas for=20
potential oil and gas exploration, including a recommendation that 8 percen=
t=20
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil and gas exploration=
.=20
Administration officials said there are no plans to challenge the current=
=20
moratoriums on new oil leasing off the coasts of California or Florida.=20
But the policy also makes a pitch for renewable fuels and conservation. The=
=20
report calls for applying new technologies to conservation, including a $4=
=20
billion tax credit for hybrid automobiles that run on both gasoline and=20
electricity, including fuel cells.=20
It would expand tax credits for biomass, and create a 15 percent tax credit=
,=20
up to $2,000, for consumers who install solar energy panels in their homes.=
=20
Yet while renewables "provide hope for America's future," the report says,=
=20
they currently meet just 2 percent of U.S. energy needs.=20
"The day they fulfill the bulk of our needs is still years away," the repor=
t=20
said. "Until that day comes, we must continue meeting the nation's energy=
=20
requirements by the means available to us."=20
The plan also insists that technology can help Americans have more energy a=
nd=20
a cleaner environment at the same time.=20
Americans want to conserve energy, the report says, but the "best way of=20
meeting this goal is to increase energy efficiency by applying new=20
technology."=20
FUEL-EFFICIENCY STANDARDS
The plan dodges any recommendation on raising auto fuel-efficiency standard=
s,=20
a glaring omission for environmentalists. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D- Calif.=
,=20
and Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, want higher standards for light trucks, includi=
ng=20
SUVs, saying that could cut oil imports by 10 percent.=20
However, a senior administration official also said that Energy Secretary=
=20
Spencer Abraham has been directed to revisit proposed cuts in research into=
=20
solar, wind, biomass and other renewable fuels. Abraham slashed the program=
s=20
in Bush's budget, and the official said much of that spending may be=20
restored.=20
Bush plans to showcase the full report in a speech in St. Paul, Minn. today=
,=20
at a high-tech utility using efficient new "heat and power" systems and=20
biomass fuels as a backdrop.=20
Of the plan's 105 recommendations, the administration touts 42 of them as=
=20

=20
while saying 35 focus on increasing energy supply and modernizing the=20

Smeloff said the existing PUC, which generates power through the Hetch Hetc=

Washington -- As President Bush prepares to release his energy plan today,=
=20
the solar, biomass and other "green" energy industries are cautiously=20
optimistic about what it will contain.=20
Despite the advance thrashing Bush has taken for his pro-nuclear, pro-=20
drilling approach, producers of renewable fuels are expecting a host of tax=
=20
credits to make their products more competitive with fossil fuels.=20
Still, alternative-fuel lobbyists briefed on the report by Vice President=
=20
Dick Cheney said the plan will be quite vague. They were told to expect no=
=20
numeric goals on how much of U.S. energy needs should be supplied by=20
renewables or any other source, and few specific legislative guidelines.=20
"I expect the biggest thing this plan will do is give representatives who=

ne=20
Hamilton, co-director of the American Bioenergy Association.=20
Indeed, despite nearly four months' work by a top-level multiagency task=20
force headed by Cheney, the report is expected to leave most of the messy=

As a result, it may ignite a free-for-all on Capitol Hill, sending lobbyist=

Among its few specifics, the report is expected to call for bigger tax=20

who install solar energy panels in their homes.=20
"If we could get tax credits -- and the Cheney plan is going to have tax=20
credits to expand biomass to use crop residues -- it will become cost=20
effective," Hamilton said.=20
The administration has often said that U.S. energy needs would require larg=
e=20
investments in new power plants -- 1,300 of them over the next 20 years - -=
=20
and more fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas, along with a=20

Cheney told renewable-fuels lobbyists that almost all the report's financia=

But reliance on fossil fuels and nuclear power will still be the thrust of=

the report, giving short-shrift to conservation and renewables, advocates=

"There are going to be some things we're going to support," said Carol=20
Werner, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute,=
 a=20
nonprofit policy group. "We're just very concerned that the balance is goin=

Ironically, while Bush is best known as an oil industry veteran, his Texas=

ranch house has incorporated state-of-the art energy-efficiency features,=

"He's done a great job with their house," Werner said. The question, green-=

San Francisco -- PG&E Corp. Chairman Robert Glynn, who has become one of th=

He and others appeared encouraged by PG&E's repeated declarations in recent=

"Chapter 11 is not a destination," Glynn told the roughly 500, mostly elder=

More applause.=20

No one in the auditorium held this against the company. Nor was there much=

Similarly, few shareholders said they were perturbed by the company's=20

Bush's national energy bluepring won't help California=20

Mercury News Washington Bureau=20


WASHINGTON -- President Bush will unveil a national energy plan today that=
=20
offers little help for California this summer but tries to shield the rest =
of=20
the nation from the same debilitating blackouts in the future with more oil=
=20
and natural-gas drilling and greater use of coal and nuclear power.=20
In previewing the plan Wednesday, Bush and White House officials emphasized=
=20
that conservation and improving energy efficiency through high technology a=
re=20
significant parts in meeting the nation's growing energy needs and reducing=
=20
dependence on foreign oil. Of the plan's 105 proposals -- most already made=
=20
public -- 42 deal with conservation, development of alternative fuels and=
=20
environmental protection.=20
A senior administration official said Wednesday that the only item in the=
=20
plan that could help California this summer is a planned presidential order=
=20
to have federal agencies expedite permit approvals for new power plants=20
nationwide. But Bush already ordered those quicker reviews for California=
=20
earlier this year. The other specific California proposal would direct the=
=20
secretary of energy to look into helping the state improve the current=20
transmission bottleneck between Northern and Southern California.=20
``Unfortunately, there are no short-term solutions to long-term neglect,''=
=20
the Bush plan says of California's crisis.=20
More broadly, the White House believes the proposals to increase supply and=
=20
improve electricity and natural-gas distribution are the keys to helping=20
California and the rest of the country deal with energy problems. The=20
163-page proposal says the United States is facing ``the most serious energ=
y=20
shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970s.''=20
Bush on Wednesday directed two federal regulatory agencies to monitor=20
electricity prices in the state and elsewhere and ``make sure that nobody i=
n=20
America gets illegally charged.''=20
But the state's problem is largely its own to solve, Bush administration=20
officials have repeatedly said.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis has been pleading with federal regulators to=20
temporarily cap the price of wholesale electricity throughout the West to=
=20
give the state time to get new power plants on line. But Bush on Wednesday=
=20
reiterated his opposition to those controls.=20
That angered Davis and other California Democrats.=20
``Without just and reasonable prices for power, the crisis here in Californ=
ia=20
and the West inevitably will spill over and damage the already-sluggish=20
national economy,'' Davis said. ``Mr. President, runaway energy prices are=
=20
not just a California problem. With all due respect, I once again urge you =
to=20
stand up to your friends in the energy business and exercise the federal=20
government's responsibility to ensure energy prices are just and=20
reasonable.''=20
Long-term proposals=20
Instead of price controls for California or elsewhere, the White House is=
=20
focusing on long-term energy proposals that may not even get passed by=20
Congress, let alone be producing results, by the height of California's=20
summer.=20
For example, drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which Bu=
sh=20
is asking Congress to allow, is not expected to produce any oil for at leas=
t=20
five to 10 years. The supply is estimated at 6 billion barrels, enough to=
=20
satisfy total U.S. demand for only nine months.=20
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have said several times since taking=20
office that the administration believes that the main way to solve the=20
problem is to increase the nation's energy supplies.=20
That stance, backed by most Republicans and the energy industry that Bush a=
nd=20
Cheney both once worked for, puts the administration at odds with most=20
Democrats and the environmental movement. The plan's release officially=20
ignites one of the largest political battles in years.=20
``It provides over 100 proposals to diversify and increase the supply of=20
energy, innovative proposals to encourage conservation and ways to make sur=
e=20
that we get energy from producer to consumer,'' Bush said Wednesday after=
=20
receiving the plan from the high-level administration task force headed by=
=20
Cheney that drafted it over the past three months.=20
But Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said the=20
administration's conservation proposals don't change the fact that the Whit=
e=20
House plan overall is bad for the environment and the nation.=20
``There's a Texas saying that the president apparently is very fond of, whi=
ch=20
goes, `You can put your boots in the oven, but it doesn't make them=20
biscuits,'?'' Pope said. ``When they start claiming this plan is about clea=
n=20
energy, about progressive technology, about energy efficiency, they're=20
putting their boots in the oven. I'd rather bake biscuits.''=20
Highlights of plans=20
Among the highlights released by the White House last night are:=20
?Require that all major federal regulatory actions take into account the=20
impact on energy supplies, distribution and use, including decisions made=
=20
about federal lands.=20
?Encourage the expansion of nuclear-power plants, and study whether=20
reprocessed nuclear waste can be used to generate power. The technology,=20
abandoned in the United States 30 years ago but used elsewhere, produces=20
weapons-grade plutonium that can lead to national security risks.=20
?Spend $3 billion over 10 years on programs to assist low-income people wit=
h=20
heating and electric bills as well as to prepare their homes for cold=20
weather.=20
?Spend an additional $2 billion over 10 years on research into burning coal=
=20
more cleanly.=20
?Spend $4 billion over 10 years on tax credits for consumers who purchase=
=20
hybrid electric-gasoline vehicles or vehicles powered by new hydrogen fuel=
=20
cells.=20
``It's tough in that it lays out the problems,'' Bush continued. ``It's a=
=20
direct assessment of neglect, but this great nation of ours, because of our=
=20
technology, our attitude, our adherence to free enterprise, our willingness=
=20
to conserve, we're going to solve this problem.''=20
The vast majority of the proposals -- 85 -- can be acted on by Bush and=20
federal agencies, and 20 require congressional approval.=20
While serving as the poster child for a potential national energy crisis,=
=20
California gets little assistance in the Bush plan as it faces a summer of=
=20
soaring prices and predictions of extensive rolling blackouts. Bush noted t=
he=20
administration had worked with Davis to expedite federal review of state=20
power plant proposals.=20
``So the quicker supply gets on, the easier it's going to be for the=20
consumers of the state of California. We're deeply concerned about the stat=
e=20
of California, as we are with the rest of the nation,'' said Bush, who will=
=20
be traveling to Southern California later this month in his first trip to t=
he=20
state since last fall. ``But we haven't had an energy policy. Interestingly=
=20
enough, this is the first comprehensive energy policy probably ever,=20
certainly in a long time.''=20
Former President Jimmy Carter had the last major energy program during his=
=20
administration in the midst of the energy crisis of the late 1970s. But=20
unlike Carter's proposals, which in part sought government mandates to=20
increase supply and urged Americans to conserve, Bush emphasizes free-marke=
t=20
solutions.=20
No lifestyle changes=20
The plan's message for Americans is that high-tech advances in energy=20
efficiency, coupled with increased energy supplies, will allow them to avoi=
d=20
sacrificing their way of life to solve the energy problem.=20
The plan's conservation proposals come after Cheney infuriated=20
environmentalists when he belittled conservation in a major energy speech=
=20
last month. ``Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not =
a=20
sufficient basis for a sound comprehensive energy policy,'' Cheney said.=20
Democrats and environmental groups have charged that Bush's plan simply doe=
s=20
the bidding of large oil and energy companies. Bush received $2.8 million i=
n=20
campaign contributions during his presidential bid from the energy and=20
natural-resources industry, according to the Center for Responsive Politics=
.=20
``For big oil and other suppliers, the Bush energy plan is a dream come=20
true,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``But clearly among those most=
=20
left out by the plan are the people and businesses of California who have=
=20
been under siege by electricity and natural-gas marketers bent on gouging=
=20
every cent they can from a broken energy market that the Bush administratio=
n=20
has refused to try to fix.''=20
But Bush said he's optimistic his plan will solve the nation's energy=20
problems. ``I think this is a country that is going to show the rest of the=

part of his energy plan. Both want to promote a kind of utility plant that=
=20
produces both electricity and heat or air conditioning and operates twice a=
s=20
efficiently as existing power plants.=20
Bush will spotlight the process, called combined heating and power, or=20
cogeneration, today in St. Paul, Minn., when he unveils his energy policy a=
t=20
the city's downtown heating-and-cooling plant, which soon will be making=20
electricity, too.=20
Two-thirds of the potential energy in the coal, oil or natural gas burned i=
n=20
conventional electric power plants escapes as waste heat or pollution. In a=
=20
cogeneration plant, the waste heat is used to warm buildings or run air=20
conditioners.=20
``We use two fires when we could use one,'' said Tom Casten, president of=
=20
Private Power LLC, a Chicago-area combined heat company, and the chair of t=
he=20
International Cogeneration Alliance, based in Brussels, Belgium.=20
U.S. cogeneration has been growing in recent years, but it isn't as popular=
=20
as it is in Europe, Casten said. The United States gets 7 to 9 percent of i=
ts=20
power from cogeneration plants, he said. Mainly, heavy industries, college=
=20
campuses and downtown sections of older cities such as New York and=20
Philadelphia use it.=20
Denmark gets 59 percent of its electricity from cogeneration; the Netherlan=
ds=20
gets 42 percent. Finland hasn't built a new central power plant in 20 years=
=20
and China in the past decade hooked up a system to heat 55 million families=
=20
through cogeneration plants, Casten said.=20
``There's an incredible amount we can do which we're not doing,'' Casten=20
said. ``If we operated at the efficiency of the Netherlands or Finland we'd=
=20
save $77 billion a year.''=20
To move in that direction, the Bush administration's new energy policy will=
=20
include two provisions. One would speed up depreciation under the tax code=
=20
for cogeneration equipment. The other would rewrite environmental regulatio=
ns=20
in ways that would make cogeneration easier.=20
The Bush plan also will try to improve relations between cogeneration=20
companies and conventional power companies. They are split over two issues:=
=20
how conventional utility companies pay for electrical power from cogenerato=
rs=20
and how they get it.=20
Some environmental groups are grudgingly on board. ``They're making all the=

HERE'S the experiment into which California residents and businesses have=

On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission bowed to the reality=
=20
of the electricity shortage. People will have to pay more. Industry will pa=

a lot more. One beneficial side effect should be that they use less power.=
=20
Until now, consumers have been buffered from high electricity prices.=20
Starting June 1, that's over, except for residents who are especially=20
thrifty.=20
The PUC imposed an overall rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt hour in=20
March, but it did not decide until Tuesday how to apportion the pain among=
=20
residents, farmers, businesses and industry.=20
The allocation of pain left no one happy. The only thing certain in cases=

The PUC ``caves in to industry lobbying,'' said the consumer group TURN. Th=

Discounting the hyperbole, industry has the more compelling grievance, even=
=20
though industrial rates have declined relative to residential rates over th=
e=20
past two decades, from a time when they were almost the same.=20
Electricity costs less per unit to deliver to industries than to residences=
.=20
In the PUC's rate hike, industry should have been asked to pay only the 3=
=20
cents a kilowatt hour instead of roughly 3.5 cents. That still would have=
=20
given it a much larger percentage increase than residences.=20
Residents will hardly welcome higher bills. They will rightly suspect that=
=20
generators of electricity are taking advantage of the shortage to squeeze=
=20
consumers. That is a claim to be pursued in Sacramento, Washington and the=
=20
courts.=20
The PUC had no choice but to raise rates, given what the state has been=20
paying to buy electricity. And despite what hysterical protesters at the PU=
C=20
meetings have said, residents can keep their bills manageable with a litle=
=20
sacrifice.=20
Electricity usage that falls below 130 percent of the so-called baseline=20
level is exempt from the rate increase. While 130 percent of baseline is le=
ss=20
electricity than many households need, those who use up to 200 percent of=
=20
baseline, a more achievable goal, will see their bills rise only 7 percent,=
=20
from $76 to $81 for average households in the Bay Area.=20
The PUC correctly structured the rate schedule to be punitive toward those=
=20
households that use the most electricity. For those who use 300 percent of=
=20
baseline or more, the bills rise 37 percent.=20
If there is any consolation here, it is this: California consistently ranks=
=20
among the states using the least amount of electricity per capita. While=20
higher rates will harm some businesses and residents, the state economy as =
a=20
whole is not dependent on an abundance of cheap power.=20
The rate hike will cost users of electricity $5.7 billion, which the state'=

Calif. Enters Wholesale Business



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer




SACRAMENTO (AP) _ Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill Wednesday
creating a state agency that will be able to borrow up to $5
billion to build, buy, lease or operate power plants.


California will no longer be held captive by energy suppliers
charging high prices for power, Davis pledged, as he officially put
the state into the electricity wholesale business.


Plants financed by the California Consumer Power and
Conservation Financing Authority will provide cost-based
electricity to California consumers, Davis said, which will help
stabilize the state's volatile energy market.


The power authority is modeled after one in New York, which has
10 power plants, 1,400 miles of transmission lines and produces
about 25 percent of the state's power. Nebraska also has a power
authority, which created a market in which residents pay 22 percent
less than the national average.


An increase in power plants down for repairs this year ``is
strong evidence that people are manipulating the market by
withholding power to drive up prices,'' Davis said.


``The only way we can fight back against this type of price
gouging and manipulation is to build more plants,'' he said.


Having a public power authority will ``supplement not supplant''
private energy sources, Davis said.


``In a deregulated world, the only way you can guarantee
reliable affordable power is to build it yourself if private
companies won't do it,'' he said.


Few Republicans in the Legislature supported the bill, saying
the state shouldn't get further into the power business. They also
warned that it could discourage private companies from building
plants.


The bill was created by Senate Leader John Burton and sponsored
by state treasurer Philip Angelides. Angelides conceded that it
won't save California from blackouts this summer but will help
stabilize the energy markets as more generators are built.


Angelides added that the bill is the ``beginning of the end for
deregulation ... which has proven to be a disaster.''


He repeatedly blamed the crisis on out-of-state power
generators: ``There is a tremendous drain on California because of
generators' prices. And that drain is heading straight to the heart
of Texas.''


Other key lawmakers urged Davis Wednesday to join with the
governors of Washington and Oregon to set a limit on the price the
states would pay for power this summer, creating a ``buyers'
cartel.''


The states would refuse to pay more than a predetermined price
that would give electricity generators a ``reasonable'' profit
under a resolution sponsored by nine Assembly Democrats.


If generators refused to lower their prices, that would mean
almost certain blackouts in California this summer, said
Assemblyman Paul Koretz, the measure's author.


But those will happen anyway, by all accounts, and the price cap
would let the state better predict and manage the outages, he said.


The resolution proposes that caps be installed for two years,
until enough power plants can be built to allow the market to
function naturally.


The state has been buying power for the customers of three major
utilities since mid-January. The utilities' credit was cut off
after they amassed debts of more than $14 billion dollars due to
high wholesale electricity prices that they were unable to pass on
to customers.

GOP Promises Energy Package Push



By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer




WASHINGTON (AP) _ Awaiting an energy blueprint from the White
House, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott promised to move quickly
on legislation, hoping Congress can complete action before the end
of summer.


But Lott said Wednesday that some of President Bush's expected
recommendations, such as expanded drilling on federal land and
taking private land for power lines, ``will be hotly debated'' on
Capitol Hill.


Democrats launched a pre-emptive strike Wednesday, saying the
Bush energy package will do little to address soaring gasoline
prices, the West Coast power crisis and the need to get Americans
to use less energy.


``The president seems almost totally indifferent'' to soaring
electricity problems and blackouts in the West, said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.


White House press secretary Ari Fleischer insisted that the
president's energy task force, while focusing on long-term energy
problems, also will have measures that ``will help in the short
term.''


The ``comprehensive approach'' to be outlined by the president's
105 specific energy proposals ``will help consumers'' this summer,
said Fleischer, who didn't provide details.


Other government sources said the task force recommendations
will direct Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie
Whitman to look into ways to give refiners more leeway in blending
gasoline to spur supply and ease distribution.


The task force will ask the EPA to try to get states to abandon
requirements for ``boutique'' gasoline blends as part of their air
pollution control strategies.


The industry has blamed the requirement for many different
blends for some of the refinery and distribution problems, a claim
disputed by environmentalists.


The task force also will call for increased funding of the
federal programs to help low-income families pay for cooling and
heating costs, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.


Both Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree those funds
should be beefed up.


Lott, R-Miss., speaking to reporters, said he hoped to bring an
energy bill to the Senate floor next month and have it to the
president by July 4 ``or certainly this summer.''


As for Democratic criticism that the GOP approach tilts too
heavily toward production, Lott said, ``I don't believe we can
conserve ourselves into (meeting) the energy needs we'll have in
the future.''


``The president has no program for the short term, telling
people that they're on their own. And the only long-term solution
is to waive environmental protections,'' Gephardt countered at a
news conference.


Among the recommendations that will be made by the president's
energy task force is a call for more transmission lines and power
plants to address future electricity needs and changes in air
pollution rules to improve the production and distribution of
gasoline, according to government sources.


Against strong opposition from environmentalists, the task force
also will call for lifting the ban on oil drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Specifically, Bush will call
for opening 8 percent of the pristine territory to oil drilling,
Fleischer said Wednesday.


But none of these proposals will provide much help this summer,
officials acknowledge.


Meanwhile industry experts predicted more severe power problems
in California, including frequent rolling blackouts; possible power
disruptions in the Northeast; and tight electricity supplies in the
Pacific Northwest because of the region's severe drought.


The North American Electric Reliability Council, an
industry-sponsored watchdog organization, said in a report Tuesday
that California's power problems this summer are likely to be worse
than even state officials have predicted, with 260 hours of rolling
blackouts _ an average of 20 hours a week _ likely because of a
power shortfall that could be as much as 5,000 megawatts during
peak demand periods.


A megawatt is enough power to serve 1,000 homes.


While most of the country will have enough electricity, the
council's report also warned of potential problems in the
Northeast, with possible power disruptions if there is a persistent
heat wave, and in the Pacific Northwest as well as possibly in
Texas. The New York City area could have blackouts if there are
transmission problems on lines into the region, the report said.


While Texas has plenty of electricity, it ``should be closely
watched'' because the state is shifting into a retail competitive
market in June and consolidating some grid management activities,
David Cook, the reliability council's general counsel, said.


``There is no magic bullet, no single thing to be done that will
solve the challenges we face'' in trying to assure electricity
reliability, Cook said in testimony before the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee.


In the Pacific Northwest, there is expected to be enough power
to meet summer demand despite low hydroelectric generation as a
result of a severe drought. But, the report said, if the region's
drought continues, there could be rolling blackouts next winter.






Covanta Energy to Provide California With 500 Megawatts of New Power



FAIRFIELD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 16, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -



California Energy Commission Grants Approval to Three Mountain


Power Facility


Covanta Energy Corporation (NYSE: COV) announced that the
California Energy Commission (CEC) today unanimously approved the
Company's "Application for Certification" for its proposed
500-megawatt Three Mountain Power project. The decision, which was
announced at a CEC business meeting in Sacramento, California, grants
Covanta a license to construct and operate the natural gas-fired,
combined cycle facility to be located in Burney, approximately 45
miles northeast of Redding, California. Project construction is
expected to begin in the fall of 2001, with commercial operations
expected to commence in late 2003 or early 2004.


"Three Mountain Power will be a vital addition to California's
energy supply, adding 500 megawatts of environmentally friendly,
dependable power to the grid," said Scott Mackin, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Covanta Energy. "Given the urgent need for power,
we're pleased that CEC has approved this project. With its
state-of-the-art technology, Three Mountain Power will be among the
cleanest and most efficient power plants of its kind in the nation, if
not the world."


The Three Mountain Power project will also bring significant
economic benefits to the Burney region. An average of 200 construction
workers will build the project over two years, with an estimated
construction payroll of $25 million. Three Mountain Power will also
create between 20 and 25 new permanent jobs, with an annual payroll of
over $1 million. To allow local residents to train and potentially
compete for these jobs, Three Mountain Power is sponsoring Lassen
Community College's power plant operator training class in the
community. Once operational, the facility is expected to pay $2.5
million annually in property taxes.


Covanta Energy Corporation is an internationally recognized
designer, developer, owner and operator of power generation projects

"The new regulations tend to favor combined-cycle natural gas facilities,"=

said Bryan Riley, Eastern regional vice president with NRG Energy. "We=20

Not a surprising position, perhaps, given that Minneapolis-based NRG Energy=

"The standard in Massachusetts for CO2 (carbon dioxide) is, at least with=

The Providence, R.I., Journal-Bulletin quoted Massachusetts officials as=20

electricity. Even so, enough energy would be available to meet the state's=

Indeed, according to Boulder, Colo.-based RDI's NEWGen database, more than=

(NPCC) region, which includes New York, New England and eastern Canada.=20
Almost all the new capacity will be natural gas-fired.=20

Worm in the Big Apple
But those responsible for regulating the state's power supplies point to a=
=20
dilemma facing New York City.=20

In testimony before a state oversight panel in March, Public Utility=20
Commission Chair Maureen O. Helmer said at least 80% of New York City's=20
projected peak load must be met by generation located within the city. She=
=20
said the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) projected peak load for=
=20
the city of 10,535 MW, meaning roughly 8,428 MW would have to be generated =
in=20
the city, due to its import constraints.=20

But the same ISO report found only 8,031 MW of in-city generating capacity =
as=20
of Feb. 15. If correct, that adds up to a 397-MW shortfall, under normal=20
weather conditions. Under extreme weather conditions, New York City's peak=
=20
load could reach 11,125 MW, the ISO said. That would raise the correspondin=
g=20
in-city capacity requirement to 8,900 MW.=20

"Thus," Helmer said, "the in-city generating deficiency would increase to 8=
69=20
MW rather than 397 MW." Given the transmission constraints and the=20
possibility of much hotter than normal weather, "397 MW must be viewed as a=
=20
floor, not a ceiling," she said.=20

Bottom line: Approve new capacity and install it quickly. The New York Powe=
r=20
Authority plans to add 450 MW of capacity within New York City before the=
=20
start of the summer peak demand season. Helmer said this amount would meet=
=20
minimum requirements and would help avoid calling on older, dirtier=20
generating plants.=20

Tougher rules
Policy makers in Massachusetts and Connecticut are waging an environmental=

war of their own by imposing highly restrictive rules.=20

The Connecticut rules=01*described by one source as the "toughest air emiss=

20%-30% reduction) from 61 large emission units statewide, including power=

In April, Massachusetts imposed new rules of its own, targeting power plant=

The Massachusetts rules are aimed squarely at six power plants (the so-call=

As an alternative, state officials gave power plant owners until 2008 to=20

"We would utilize the rules under the second strategy and re-permit the=20

"After 10 years of the states and the feds saying there's a place for=20

Alex Farrell, research engineer in the Department of Engineering and Public=

A power plant operator might invest $100 million on scrubber technology for=

Using a regional averaging and emission trading approach, overachieving at =

When Athens was first proposed, three-quarters of the state's fossil-fired=

Last year the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission ruled that=20

Mr. Brown, a 47-year-old supervisor for United Parcel Service, and his wife=

Ms. Nash, 52, moved here two years ago. Ms. Nash, a native of rural Georgia=

activity. Along a 10-mile stretch of curving county road on the way to the=

anything like that."=20
They settled on a one-story, 1,200-square-foot home on 10 acres of wooded=
=20
hillside in the Homestead Ranches subdivision. Ms. Nash says she made clear=
=20
to her real-estate agent that she didn't want to be near drilling but adds=
=20
that she didn't know about the separate ownership of mineral rights, and it=
=20
never was discussed.=20
She soon found out. While Ms. Nash was unpacking, a neighbor dropped by to=

say hello. "You know you're in the window?" Ms. Nash remembers the neighbor=

saying after handing over a batch of cookies. Part of the property, it turn=

Ms. Nash.=20
The couple considered trying to sue the real-estate agent but decided the=
=20
cost would be too high. However, when negotiations with Huber over where to=
=20
drill broke down, they joined other surface-rights owners in a suit against=
=20
Huber and a unit of BP. The suit asks a state court for a judgment to clari=

companies.=20
Huber won't discuss this well site, citing the litigation, but its project=
=20
engineer for the area, Scott Zimmerman, says the company has come to terms=
=20
with other surface owners. "Most of them realize there is a mineral estate,=
=20

he adds, "We have the rights to develop the minerals."=20
Indeed, Colorado law allows operators to drill over property owners'=20
objections after posting a bond of as little as $5,000 per well against=20
possible surface damage. State regulators say about a third of the drilling=
=20
permits they grant each year are on sites where the surface rights and=20

Drilling issues are a different matter. Last month, the state enacted a law=

IN ENERGY PLAN, BUSH URGES NEW DRILLING, CONSERVATION AND NUCLEAR POWER=20

WASHINGTON, May 16 -- President Bush's long-awaited energy plan proposes=20
loosening regulations on oil and gas exploration, conservation-minded effor=
ts=20
like a review of gas mileage standards and a $4 billion tax credit for a ne=
w=20
generation of highly fuel efficient cars, and urges a reconsideration of a=
=20
quarter-century ban on the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.=20
With a declaration that the energy problems threaten the nation's economy a=
nd=20
security, the Bush plan also orders a sweeping review of public lands to=20
determine whether more energy resources can be extracted.=20
''America in the year 2001 faces the most serious energy shortage since the=
=20
oil embargoes of the 1970's,'' the administration's energy report states.=
=20
Without action, it continues, projected energy shortfalls in coming years=
=20
''will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our=20
national security.'' [Excerpts, Page A21.]=20
The proposals are among 105 initiatives outlined in the administration's=20
energy report, said a senior government official who briefed reporters on i=
ts=20
contents tonight. The White House released an eight-page overview of the=20
document, which will be distributed in full on Thursday.=20
The official said Mr. Bush would also issue two executive orders later this=
=20
week directing all federal agencies to consider the effects of all new=20
regulations on energy production and to expedite permits for all energy=20
projects ''while remaining mindful of protecting the environment.''=20
The overview released tonight states that federal regulation of the nation'=
s=20
energy producers has unduly inhibited production and increased prices.=20
''Regulation is needed in such a complex field, but it has become overly=20
burdensome,'' the report says. ''Regulatory hurdles, delays in issuing=20
permits and economic uncertainty are limiting investment in new facilities,=
=20
making our energy markets more vulnerable to transmission bottlenecks, pric=
e=20
spikes and supply disruptions.''=20
Mr. Bush will also order Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, an outspoken=20
proponent of seeking new sources of energy on federal lands, to ''look at a=
ny=20
impediments'' that discourage exploration for oil and gas.=20
The report repeats Mr. Bush's commitment to explore in the Arctic National=
=20
Wildlife Refuge -- a proposal that seems unlikely to survive in Congress --=
=20
and also urges a review that will include other places in Alaska, the Rocky=
=20
Mountains and along the Gulf Coast.=20
The report also urges the revision or reinterpretation of a major clause of=
=20
the Clean Air Act that requires long government review of any modifications=
=20
of power plants that affect their emissions.=20
The senior government official, who was deeply involved in the development =
of=20
the plan, argued tonight that the ''new source reviews'' by the Environment=
al=20
Protection Agency are a ''time-consuming process'' that often ''discourage=
=20
fuel efficiency.''=20
The Justice Department will also be ordered to review several=20
multi-million-dollar lawsuits brought by the Clinton administration against=
=20
utilities accused of ignoring the law.=20
One official of an environmental group said the report was about what he ha=
d=20
expected, and he predicted that conservation organizations would be highly=
=20
critical of it.=20
''This has just a lot of opportunity for mischief from the energy producers=
=20
and no real solid commitments for the green components,'' the official, Dav=
id=20
G. Hawkins, senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.=
=20
Mr. Hawkins said he was ''astounded'' that the policy would recommend a=20
review of legal actions now under way on utility emissions, calling it=20
''political interference with law enforcement.''=20
Mr. Bush is to announce his plan on Thursday morning at an innovative energ=
y=20
plant in St. Paul. But even before he begins his campaign for a national=20
energy policy, he has touched off a heated political argument between=20
Democrats and Republicans over how to balance environmental concerns agains=
t=20
growing energy needs, and whether to impose temporary price caps in places=
=20
like California, where a deregulation program and soaring demand has sent=
=20
prices rocketing.=20
Democrats have urged the use of such controls, while Mr. Bush will argue=20
''vociferously'' on Thursday, one aide said, that the controls would only=
=20
discourage the production of more electricity.=20
Mr. Bush's report adopts a tone that is by turns admonishing and encouragin=
g.=20
''The complacency of the past decade must now give way to swift, but=20
well-considered, action,'' it says in its introduction, echoing themes that=
=20
Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the task force, have=20
sounded in recent weeks.=20
''Present trends are not encouraging, but they are not immutable,'' the=20
report says.=20
Then, in a clear effort to separate Mr. Bush's approach from President Jimm=
y=20
Carter's politically disastrous calls for household austerity during the=20
energy crises of the late 1970's, it adds: ''Our country has met many great=
=20
tests. Some have imposed extreme hardship and sacrifice. Others have demand=
ed=20
only resolve, ingenuity and clarity of purpose. Such is the case with energ=
y=20
today.''=20
The decision to offer a relatively hefty tax credit for ''hybrid'' cars,=20
which use a combination of gasoline and battery power, is bound to help bot=
h=20
Detroit and two Japanese automakers -- Honda and Toyota -- which are alread=
y=20
marketing such vehicles in the United States.=20
They will be less enthusiastic, however, about orders by Mr. Bush for the=
=20
government to review the federal standards for automotive fuel efficiency,=
=20
though the report makes no commitment that those standards will be raised.=
=20
The plan also calls for a new evaluation of nuclear reprocessing, a=20
technology that takes advantage of the fact that as reactors consume uraniu=
m,=20
they also produce plutonium. If the plutonium is chemically scavenged from=
=20
the fuel, it can be used to run reactors.=20
But the technology has drawbacks. The work is dirty, with the threat of=20
radioactive releases, and it is expensive.=20
For the last decade at least, it has been far cheaper to fuel reactors with=
=20
new uranium than to recover plutonium. And while uranium fuel used in power=
=20
reactors cannot be used to make a bomb, plutonium can, raising the threat o=
f=20
world commerce in a material that could be diverted by countries -- or=20
terrorist groups -- that want a bomb.=20
Britain, France and Japan currently reprocess fuel, although the British ar=
e=20
considering ending the practice because it is so expensive.=20
But reprocessing can reduce the volume of plutonium requiring disposal, whi=
ch=20
is important because plutonium is so long-lived and difficult to store=20
safely.=20
Some opponents of the technology said today that they believed it had been=
=20
included in the Bush plan as a sop to Nevada, where the Energy Department i=
s=20
trying to build a waste repository. But reprocessing would not eliminate th=
e=20
need for such a repository.=20
The plan also calls for cooperation with Canada on building a pipeline that=
=20
could bring more natural gas into the United States.=20
The report mixes several existing initiatives with new ones, particularly i=
n=20
the area of conservation. For example, of $10 billion in proposed tax credi=
ts=20
over the next 10 years, $5 billion in credits are already in the budget or=
=20
the result of extending existing ones.=20
Other programs get modest increases. The administration recommends $300=20
million in new money for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program and=
=20
calls for funneling some oil and gas royalty payments, which companies pay=
=20
the federal government for extracting resources on public land, to the=20
program for the poor.=20
Similarly, in an effort directed toward environmentalists, it would commit=
=20
royalties from any energy extracted in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve=
=20
for land conservation.=20
There are no credits or other tax breaks for oil or gas producers, or=20
electric utilities -- a reflection of the sensitivity of the White House to=
=20
criticism that Mr. Cheney and other top officials spent their private-secto=
r=20
years in the energy industry. But the tone of deregulation, reassessment of=
=20
the merits of the Clean Air Act and the emphasis on opening of federal land=
s=20
to more energy production -- everything from wind power to oil and gas=20
drilling -- provides those industries with effective subsidies totaling in=
=20
the billions of dollars.=20
Much of the report simply urges companies to build, build and build some=20
more, including 38,000 miles of new gas pipelines, 255,000 miles of=20
distribution pipelines and a new power plant every few days for the next 20=
=20
years. But for every such proposal, Mr. Bush's team carefully inserted=20
proposals for expanding the use of renewable fuels, from geo-thermal energy=
=20
sources to the methane produced in landfills.=20
The nuclear power industry gets one major concession: a tax break that woul=
d=20
eliminate the double taxation of money put aside for decommissioning plants=
.=20
Those taxes have been a deterrent to buying and selling nuclear plants. It=
=20
commits $2 billion over 10 years to a clean-coal technology program in the=
=20
Department of Energy.=20
It urges the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to speed the licensing of=
=20
hydroelectric power plants, and seeks ''market-based incentives'' to reduce=
=20
pollutants that cause global climate change.=20
But this winter Mr. Bush rejected any American participation in the Kyoto=
