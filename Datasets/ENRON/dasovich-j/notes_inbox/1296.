Currently, I am interested in the following proceedings:

Hearings for PG&E and SCE to end the rate freeze;
Hearings on QF pricing converting SRAC to PX;
Hearings on SDG&E's 2001 rates (esp. CTC rates) and 2002 rates; and
The application of SDG&E filed October 24, 2000 addressing the rate caps.

What other proceedings should we be aware of?

Roger
