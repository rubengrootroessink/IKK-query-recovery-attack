California

your reference and requires response by December 15, 2000.  The California 
State
Auditor's Office had advised that it will respect the legal confidentiality of
these records and will not publicly release them when legal restrictions
prohibit such release (see California Government Code Sections 8545 and 8545.1

or confidentiality, the California Power Exchange will forward your written
assertion of that claim to the California State Auditor, provided that it is
timely received.  Your written statement and its legal basis should be 
directed
to the State as follows:

     Sharon L. Smagala, CPA
     Bureau of State Audits
