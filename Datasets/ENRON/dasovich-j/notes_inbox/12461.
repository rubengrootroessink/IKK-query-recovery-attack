Barbara and Bill,

Hope your travels have (or will) return you safely.  I prepared the
following based upon our discussion last Sunday involving our collective
review of the contracts.  I provided these to the group today, with the
understanding they were darft due to the fact that neither of you have had
an opportunity to reivew.  The plan is that tomorrow, the Speaker will be
attending a portion of our meeting, and we'll present to him our findings
on the agreements.

Thanks

Gary
