New investment for Green Mountain
This week Green  Mountain Energy Company announced that it has received a=

$53.5 million  investment from Nuon, the largest utility company in the=20
Netherlands. Nuon joins  BP Amoco with significant stakes in Green Mountain=

Green Mountain Energy=01,s Board  of Directors.

Hopefully the new investment and board membership are preludes to more =20

PennFuture was first contacted. The plant will likely now remain  open as=

Allegheny Energy joining PJM?
Allegheny Energy,  operating in Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and West=20
Virginia, must by October  15th inform? FERC and the Pennsylvania Public=20
Utility Commission (PUC)  about which Regional Transmission Organization or=

PJM. Last month, on the verge of briefing the PUC about  its ISO plans,=20

Hopefully,  Allegheny Energy also understands the determination to ensure=

that PJM expands  to include western Pennsylvania.

Trouble blowing in the wind

treatment for a proposed wind  farm in Fayette County that is accorded to a=

Garrett wind farm is located within  PJM and its need for scheduling=20
treatment that reflects the intermittent nature  of wind power has been=20
accommodated by GPU and PJM. Allegheny Energy refused to  provide the same=
=20
treatment given to the Garrett facility and, as a result, has  certainly=20
delayed the project and put at risk the income to farmers, local tax =20
revenues, good jobs and clean energy which the nearly 15 megawatt wind farm=
 =20
would create. The primary reasons Allegheny Energy gave for its refusal wer=

that its control area is too small and that it lacks a liquid spot market.=

Guess  what? Both problems would vanish if Allegheny Energy joins PJM. The=

Duquesne POLR II collaborative to begin October 14
The  recent decision by the Pennsylvania PUC to send the Duquesne POLR II=
=20
proceeding  to a collaborative commences with the first session October 14t=
h.=20
The  collaborative is expected to wrap up in November. At stake is the most=
=20
ambitious  and successful retail choice transition of any EGS in the U.S.=
=20
(see E3, Vol. 2,  No. 18, Sept. 11). The Duquesne plan would increase prese=
nt=20
shopping credits by  31% on a system average basis as well as provide a 17%=
=20
system average and 21%  residential rate cut for customers, whether or not=
=20
they are shopping. Between  the rate cut and savings from shopping,=20
residential customers may be able to  reduce their rates by 36% when compar=
ed=20
to those in effect prior to competition.  Among a host of other issues,=20
parties to the collaborative are now raising the  issue of Duquesne's=20
membership in PJM. Presumably, if Duquesne's transmission  assets are moved=
=20
into PJM, then Orion's generation bundle will also be in PJM.  If Allegheny=
=20
and First Energy were to join PJM, Duquesne's membership in PJM  would brin=

GPU=01)First Energy merger
In another ISO-related  decision, First Energy, part of the flawed Alliance=
=20
"ISO" filing, will file  their merger plans with FERC and the Pennsylvania=
=20
PUC this month. First Energy,  as a possible Alliance member, is not slated=
=20
to join a fully functioning ISO for  some time. The GPU merger gives First=
=20
Energy a chance to join PJM. This would  expand PJM=01,s geographic coverag=
e to=20
Toledo, Ohio. Whatever the reason for First  Energy=01,s delay in joining P=
JM,=20
it is not for lack of cash flow or merger  synergies. First Energy=01,s=20
presentation to Wall Street on the GPU merger notes  that in their previous=
=20
merger, 1997's Ohio Edison-Centerior union, First Energy  promised synergie=
s=20
of $1 billion and states that it has already delivered $700  million, with=
=20
$350 million/year in annual recurring savings. The presentation  tells only=
=20
half the story: First Energy's promise to the Ohio PUC in that merger  was =
to=20
join a functioning ISO. That promise now can be kept with First Energy =20
joining PJM.

Little known fact about PECO shopping credits
A recent  analysis of seven churches in the PECO service territory showed=
=20
that, because of  usage variations and the demand factor charge, shopping=
=20
credits ranged from 5.33  to 10.69 cents/kWh. Looks like a good opportunity=
=20
for savings in green  power.

ICAP update
As high as $350 mW/day, this past summer=01,s  ICAP prices were due=20
substantially to de-listing of capacity resources for sale  into neighborin=
g=20
power pools. The de-listing of capacity resources can explain  why ICAP=20
prices skyrocketed this summer, when daily energy prices were lower  than=
=20
expected, as were year-ahead energy prices in the forward market. The  impa=
ct=20
of de-listing on prices and reliability was discussed in a recent PJM  Futu=
re=20
Adequacy Working Group (FAWG) meeting, where it was revealed that  de-listi=
ng=20
could have presented a problem had demand in PJM been consistently  high.=
=20
Despite the FAWG acronym, even with a north-Jersey accent there is no  clou=
d=20
in this group's direction: Most forward-looking participants expect that  t=
he=20
de-listing market maneuver will be limited by a requirement that ICAP be bi=
d =20
once or twice a year (with a daily market for changes in ICAP=20
responsibility).  This way, if a generation owner decides to de-list his=20
resource to chase higher  energy prices in other markets, the owner foregoe=
s=20
ICAP for a full year or most  of the year (if the commitment period is=20
semi-annual as opposed to annual).  Beyond this fix for next summer, we=20
predict that the FAWG will embrace the  elimination of ICAP for 2002.=20
