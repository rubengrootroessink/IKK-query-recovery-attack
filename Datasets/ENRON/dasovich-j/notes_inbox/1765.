Hi Jeff-

I attended the Energy conference in Berkeley this week and was hoping to
meet you.  It was quite educational although I was only able to attend
the second half.

As we discussed last week, I was hoping you could help me in gathering
information for the energy briefing paper to be distributed at the
upcoming Air/Energy conference.  The paper is to be an informational
background piece primarily for legislators who may not be familar with
the issues.  The focus will be on increasing energy supply and impacts
on and conflict with existing air regulations.  Based on the conference
agenda, please include any information you feel would be appropriate for
the discussions.

Thank you for your help.

Jean
