Wanted to let you know that AB995 which extends the customer credit 
subaccount (collection of nonbypassable system benefit charge to go through 
1/1/12) was passed by both the CA Assembly and Senate, and was signed into 
law by the Governor on 9/30.  Attached below is a link to the bill (click on 
enrolled version).   

The following is a brief summary:
(1) Allots up to $81 million dollars to provide customer credits for 
purchases of renewable energy, to promote purchase of renewables, develop 
consumer market for renewable energy;
(2) 14% of the money, up to 75.6 million, shall be used to provide customer 
credits;
(3) The customer credit shall not exceed 1.5 cents per KWh;  
(4) cap of $1,000 remains for larger customers UNLESS the funds for the 
preceding calendar year remain at 1.5 cents per KWh.  In this case, the $1000 
cap will be lifted for the present calendar year, taking into account that no 
more than $15 million of the total customer incentive funds are awarded to 
the larger classes of customers (other than residential and small commercial 
customers).

The exact amount and allotment per year of the customer credit are to be 
determined.
