=09=09Prices spike as Calif. bungles deregulation=20
=09=09When Californians bought into the idea of deregulated electricity in =
1996,=20
they did so on the promise they'd get reliable power at cheap prices.=20
Instead, they're facing power shortages and whopping bills.
=09=09The state's public utilities commission is scheduled to decide Thursd=
ay=20
whether to let two big utilities raise rates by up to 30%, ending a price=
=20
freeze that was supposed to last until 2002. Financially strapped utilities=
,=20
meanwhile, are threatening blackouts.=20
=09=09With electricity deregulation underway in 23 other states, households=
=20
nationwide should be wondering whether they'll be next to face=20
California-style chaos. It is a red flag that electricity deregulation, whi=
ch=20
continues to hold promise for lower rates, must be approached cautiously an=
d=20
gradually.
=09=09California made a series of remarkably large blunders, many encourage=
d by=20
utilities, that set the state on a dangerous path to deregulation without t=
he=20
competition needed to hold down prices. Unless the state corrects those=20
errors, matters will get worse when full deregulation comes in two years.=
=20
Much of the state could be served by power monopolies free to hike prices.=
=20
=09=09The good news is that other deregulating states have planned better, =
though=20
the process in those states is less advanced than in California.
=09=09Among California's failings:=20
=09=09Utilities were barred from raising rates to consumers but had to cope=
 with=20
market prices from power plants. When deregulation began, the utilities=20
heartily backed the arrangement, because the frozen prices were far higher=
=20
than the market prices they paid. Now, with a national energy shortage=20
pushing prices higher, they're worried about bankruptcy, threatening=20
blackouts and pleading for relief. Some seek re-regulation to protect=20
themselves from their own ineptitude.
=09=09The state failed to bring enough new supply online before deregulatin=
g. No=20
major plants were built in the previous decade, contributing to a supply=20
crunch in a state where electricity demand has been growing 4%-6% per year.=
=20
By contrast, Texas, which is rolling out its deregulation more slowly, has=
=20
since 1996 built 23 new plants that have added 15% more power-generation.
=09=09California tried to manipulate prices and blew it. The state required=
=20
utilities to buy all of their power from a "power exchange" in short-term=
=20
blocks. This prevented utilities from entering long-term contracts or=20
adopting hedging strategies that could keep prices stable. After prices=20
spiked, the government worsened the situation by trying to cap prices=20
utilities could pay for power. Not surprisingly, power suppliers then sold=
=20
their electricity to other states without price caps, where they could get =
a=20
better return. Result: power shortages rectified only by an emergency feder=
al=20
order that some out-of-state plants in the West sell California electricity=
.=20
Price controls were lifted.=20
=09=09Other states have avoided this problem. New York, for instance, encou=
raged=20
its utilities to enter into "transition contracts" under which plants have =
an=20
obligation to sell them power. Similarly, Texas has long-term contracts,=20
under which the utilities buy power for long periods at set prices, allowin=
g=20
them to hedge against short-term changes in price.
=09=09The price of all this bungling will be huge for Californians, but hou=
seholds=20
outside California may pay as well. The Western plants that the federal=20
government has forced to supply California's thirst could in time have=20
difficulty supplying their traditional customers, driving up their prices. =
In=20
the extreme, the financial instability of California utilities Pacific Gas=
=20
and Electric and Southern California Edison could roil markets and add to=
=20
recession pressures.
=09=09At a minimum, most Californians will soon face significant financial =
pain =01*=20
unwarranted on their part =01* to pay for the botched deregulation either=
=20
through taxes or higher rates. If this bailout isn't accompanied by new=20
rules, the 2002 ending of price caps may bring the worst of all worlds:=20
monopoly markets without price controls.
=09=09Long term, the best hope for controlling prices is competition, but=
=20
California has yet to come up with a convincing plan to make sure that=20
exists. In fact, in the San Diego area, where controls were briefly lifted=
=20
without significant new competition, prices more than doubled.=20
=09=09Some advocacy groups and politicians are calling for more radical sol=
utions,=20
such as a state buyout of the utilities or simple refusal to pay the=20
utilities on the grounds they must be hiding money somewhere. The utilities=
,=20
having tasted their own medicine, now say they'd support re-regulation.
=09=09But none of these fixes would save California's consumers from the di=
m-bulb=20
management that has put the state at risk of power outages and financial=20
catastrophe.
=09=09California Gov. Gray Davis' said recently that "if deregulation fails=
 in=20
California, it is dead in America." To the contrary, as California does its=
=20
repair work, the rest of the county will be taking notes on how not to=20
deregulate as carelessly as California did.

=09=09Learn from California mistake=20
=09=09By Harvey Rosenfield and Douglas Heller=20
=09=09The myth of electricity deregulation has met reality in California, a=
nd the=20
result is a $40 billion debacle.
=09=09Awash in energy-industry campaign contributions, California lawmakers=
 freed=20
the state's utility companies of price controls in 1996. Consumers were=20
ordered to pay off the utilities' debts, after which competition was suppos=
ed=20
to kick in, guaranteeing a 20% rate cut by 2002.=20
=09=09Deregulation proved a bonanza for the utilities. They sold some of th=
eir=20
power plants and collected $19 billion in ratepayer subsidies. They used th=
e=20
money to purchase plants in other countries, reward their executives with=
=20
huge pay raises, buy back stock and increase dividends. Profits reached=20
record levels this year.
=09=09Envious, the handful of unregulated companies that control nearly hal=
f of the=20
state's electricity generation decided to cash in, too. This cartel began t=
o=20
withhold power, causing shortages that boosted the wholesale price of=20
electricity that utility companies must buy by 3,900%. But, ironically,=20
because of the way they wrote the deregulation law, the utilities are=20
forbidden to pass the higher costs on to most consumers until 2002.=20
=09=09Now the companies want to rewrite the law. When public officials resi=
sted the=20
utilities' demands for immediate rate hikes, the utilities threatened=20
blackouts and bankruptcy. When that economic extortion failed, Wall Street=
=20
issued an ultimatum: Order a 20% rate hike within 48 hours, as a first=20
installment of an $11 billion ratepayer bailout, or Wall Street would itsel=
f=20
force the utilities into bankruptcy.=20
=09=09California has learned the hard way that electricity is too vital to =
be left=20
in the hands of unregulated corporations whose sole interest is maximizing=
=20
profits. Facing a ratepayer revolt, state officials have re-imposed=20
regulation. To make electricity reliable and affordable once more, they are=
=20
considering establishing a non-profit, publicly owned power system for the=
=20
state. But, in the meantime, the deregulation disaster could end up costing=
=20
each Californian $12,500.
=09=09Meanwhile, elsewhere in the nation, corporate-funded ideologues and a=
cademics=20
continue to promote electricity deregulation, much as they promoted looseni=
ng=20
controls on savings and loans in the 1980s.=20
