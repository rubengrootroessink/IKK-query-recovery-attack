Dear fellow students,

some time ago, we asked you to help us by answering some questions around the 
wonderful topic of PARKING!? A lot of you responded to our survey and we 
would like to thank you for that.

After we deeply analyzed your responses, it's now time to announce the winner 
of the bottle of wine we raffled off.? It is...

Matt Campbell


Again, thank you very much for your participation,

Andrew, Nicola, Nitin, and Sven
