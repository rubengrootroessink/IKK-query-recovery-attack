SARA BECKMAN RECEIVES UC BERKELEY'S DISTINGUISHED TEACHING AWARD
 Sara Beckman, senior lecturer at the Haas School, is one of four recipients 
of this year's Distinguished Teaching Award, UC Berkeley's highest prize for 
teaching. ? 

The recipients will be honored in a ceremony on Wednesday, April 25, at 5:00 
p.m. in Zellerbach Playhouse. The entire UC Berkeley community is invited to 
attend. 

Beckman has been with the Haas School of Business since 1988 and has taught 
courses in three of the Haas School's four degree programs -- undergraduate, 
full-time MBA, and Evening MBA -- and in executive development. Beckman 
currently teaches Operations Management and New Product Development in the 
MBA program.

In 1995, Beckman and engineering Professor Alice Agogino introduced the 
course Managing the New Product Development Process (BA290A/ME290P) to be 
taught jointly to business and engineering students. This course has been the 
most popular course at the Haas School for at least the past two years. 
Beckman continues to co-teach the course with Professor Agogino; the course 
is cross-listed with the College of Engineering. In the last two years, it 
has also involved Leslie Spear from the California College of Arts and 
Crafts. The highlight of this course is the New Product Tradeshow, which 
takes place at the end of the semester and allows the students to display 
their prototypes to the public. 

Beckman has received excellent course evaluations from the students in all of 
her courses. She has been a member of Club 6 for every semester she has 
taught at Haas. Club 6 membership requires a median student evaluation rating 
of at least 6 on a scale of 1 to 7. 

Beckman earned her undergraduate degree in industrial engineering with 
distinction at Stanford University. She also earned two Master's degrees -- 
in industrial engineering/engineering management and in statistics -- and a 
doctoral degree at Stanford University. Before coming to Haas, Beckman worked 
at Booz, Allen & Hamilton and managed several technology initiatives and 
programs at Hewlett Packard. From 1991 to 1997, Beckman took leadership of 
the Management of Technology (MOT) program.? In 1998, she became co-director 
with Marketing Chair Russell Winer of the reorganized and expanded Fisher 
Center for the Strategic Use of Information Technology (FCSUIT). FCSUIT's 
objective is to integrate the Haas School's various efforts in e-business. 

Previous winners of the Distinguished Teaching Award at Haas include Richard 
Lyons, Andrew Shogan, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, and M. Frances Van Loo.

Beckman is joined this year by three other recipients: Carolyn Bertozzi, 
assistant professor of chemistry; Seda Chavdarian, lecturer in the French 
Department; and Ronald Gronsky, professor of material science and engineering.

The Distinguished Teaching Award is given by the Committee on Teaching, a 
committee of the Berkeley division of the Academic Senate.? A reception in 
the Alumni House's Toll Room follows the ceremony.

UNDERGRADS CREATE SOLUTIONS AT THE E-BUSINESS CASE COMPETITION The second 
annual E-Business Case Competition wrapped up last week with a final 
competition on Monday night. Undergraduate students from across the Berkeley 
campus formed teams and came up with solutions to an Internet strategy 
problem for Cisco Systems. 

"The second annual E-Business Case Competition once again provided a venue 
for showcasing the incredible talents of Haas and UC Berkeley undergraduates 
in addressing a real-world business issue in a pressure-packed setting," says 
Dan Himelstein, undergraduate program director. "Not only was it a great 
night for everybody involved in putting together and participating in this 
competition to hold their heads high, it was also a lot of fun."

The members of the winning team were David Chan, industrial engineering and 
operations research; Christine Cho, business administration; Lisa Mou, 
economics; and Amyn Saleh, industrial engineering and operations research. 

The team's solution addressed how Cisco Systems can use the Internet to help 
its channel partners focus on their core competencies and create a 
competitive advantage using a "triangular channel solution" that revolved 
around the development of a comprehensive and interactive "myCisco" web site 
for use by Cisco, its channel partners/resellers, and end users. The site 
would provide a set of integrated electronic marketplace online applications 
that would deliver better information and better product and service 
solutions in a more efficient, effective, and profitable manner.

Each member of the winning team received a $100 gift certificate from Cisco, 
$1000 for the team to share from the Schlinger Family Foundation, t-shirts 
donated by Deloitte Consulting, and a crystal commemorative plaque. The other 
finalist teams received $350 for the team to share from the Schlinger Family 
Foundation, t-shirts donated by Deloitte Consulting, and a crystal plaque to 
each member of the team.

Representatives from the Schlinger Family Foundation, Cisco Systems, and 
Deloitte Consulting came to hear the final presentations and meet the 
participating students. 

UC BERKELEY TEAMS TAKE PART IN TWO REAL ESTATE CHALLENGES
Two teams of UC Berkeley graduate students have been working feverishly on 
plans to present at National Association of Industrial and Office Properties 
(NAIOP) Challenge and the Bank of America Low-Income Housing Challenge 
competitions this spring.

 NAIOP Real Estate Development Challenge The NAIOP Real Estate Development 
Challenge is a competition between graduate students at UC Berkeley and 
Stanford that is sponsored by the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the 
National Association of Industrial and Office Properties. Teams of five 
students are given an actual site, for which they must propose the best use, 
design, financing, and marketing of a commercial real estate project. 

UC Berkeley's 2001 NAIOP Team includes Aimee Einstein, MBA 02; Jonathan 
Fearn, Masters of City Planning 01; Chiendao Glasgow, Masters of Architecture 
01;Maria Iniguez, MBA 01; and Sara Williams, MBA 02. UC Berkeley's team won 
the competition last year bringing the decade-long battle with Stanford to a 
tie, five wins for each university. 

Proposals are judged by a nine-member jury of real estate professionals in 
the areas of development, finance, property management, brokerage, and local 
government. This year's site is on Mare Island, a former naval base in 
Vallejo, California. Final proposals are presented at an annual luncheon in 
May, with hundreds of NAIOP members in attendance. The winning team gets to 
keep the prized Golden Shovel (a close cousin of the Big Game Axe) for one 
year. 

Final presentations take place Thursday, May 3, beginning at 11:30 a.m., at 
the Olympic Club in San Francisco. Tickets are $30 for UC Berkeley faculty 
and students to attend the lunch and the presentation (this is a discounted 
price offered to faculty and students). There is no charge if you are just 
attending the presentation. 

 Bank of America Low Income Housing Challenge Sponsored by Bank of America, 
the BofA Low-Income Housing Challenge is a competition among several west 
coast graduate schools, where teams must create a low-income housing 
proposal. Each team must identify a viable site, gain community support, and 
then design, finance, and market an affordable housing project. A panel of 
professionals judges the projects. 

This year's team consists of Paul Correa, Masters of City Planning (MCP) 01; 
Alexandra Galovich, MBA 02; Shinichiro Ikeda, MCP 01; Christia Mulvey, MCP 
01; Bao-Tran Truong, MCP 01; and Madeleine Zayas-Mart, MCP/Masters of 
Architecture 02. Final presentations will be held May 4 at 9:30 a.m. at the 
Federal Reserve Building in San Francisco (location to be confirmed). Limited 
seating is available. Please contact Alex Galovich at 
galovich@haas.berkeley.edu for more information.
