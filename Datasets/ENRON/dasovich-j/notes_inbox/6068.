Jeff,

Dan is one of those guys whose talent oozes from them.  He makes songwriting
look easy, though I suspect it isn't as easy as it seems.  Obviously, his
imagination is limitless, and there's plenty to be said for his craft.  If I
wanted to criticize him, I might suggest he rein (reign?) in his act just a
little bit, in order to emphasize the songs over the personailty.  His real
personality, by the way, is mellow and understated and very unlike his stage
persona.  Go figure!

PS  By the way, why did you try to steal my cell phone on Friday morning?
If you have no idea what I'm talking about, ask Prentice.
