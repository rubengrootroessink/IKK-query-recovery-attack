Hi Will,

Thanks for e-mail!!

Is there anyway I can tell you how many tickets I need and leave a check in
your box on Monday or mail it to you today.  I had a mid-term last night and
forgot to bring my check book and won't be back on campus until Monday.

Let me know what would be easier for you!

thanks,
Jackie

Just a quick reminder, Friday is the last day to purchase your discount ski
tickets.  We need to buy 50 to make this thing happen.  Please get your
checks in ASAP.  Thanks





Redwoods@Haas is organizing discounted ski tickets at Squaw Valley and
Alpine Meadows.

This is a great way to save some money if you plan on skiing this year.
Both Squaw and Alpine are PREMIERE North Lake Tahoe ski resorts.

Squaw Valley Tickets cost $45 each and include night skiing. (Regular Price
$54)
Make checks payable to Will Birdsey and leave them in my MBA02 mailbox.
Deadline Friday, October 27th!

Alpine Meadows Tickets cost $42 each.  (Regular Price $52)
Make checks payable to Matt Hawe and leave them in his MBA02 mailbox.
Deadline Friday, October 27th!

* Tickets are good all ski season (including holidays and weekends)

* Buy as many (or as few) tickets as you want

See you on the slopes!
