Good morning,

core of the debate is a proposal to require western generators to commit 80=

of their output to long-term bilateral contracts.
? Apparently, talks stalled because of conflicting information related to t=
he=20
amount of power already under contract. In addition there appears to be=20
questions over the 80% benchmark and the length of the contracts.
? The current willingness of House Republicans to consider a compromise=20
amendment is apparently linked to the impending power shift in the Senate t=

the Democratic caucus. The House Committee Chair, Rep. Tauzin, hopes to bri=

the bill to a vote soon after June 11.
? Separately, some key California Assembly Democrats are proposing another=

plan to rescue Edison and PG&E. Under the plan, the state=01,s largest=20
commercial ratepayers would assume responsibility for most of the state=01,=

The level of support for the proposal is still unclear.
? We believe that the next few weeks will be critical in determining whethe=

California can reach a political solution to avert another utility=20
bankruptcy. At present, a single viable solution has not yet appeared. =20
Consequently, we recommend that only investors with high risk tolerance=20
should consider investing in the California utilities.

Please call us with any questions.
