Okay gang,

Here is the final version.  Some issues you may want to look at:

#2

I kept my interpretation of the extraordinary nature of the inventory
write-down.  I put in a lot of language that we would need to look at the
history of the industry to see how unusual and infrequent a change of that
nature would be.  If you all disagree I will change it to not be an
extraordinary item.

#3

I removed the sale of property from Jeff's spreadsheet.  On page 354 of the
book it says that "other gains or losses from sale or abandonment of
property, plant, and equipment used in a business" is never an
extraordinary item.

#4
Since there was not a consensus on how to deal with the litigation
costs.  I put in a few sentences that handle both circumstances.  Please
look at it and ensure that it makes sense.

Anyway, here it is.  Send me any last minute changes to this email address
by noon and I will print it out at lunch for class tomorrow.

Dylan
