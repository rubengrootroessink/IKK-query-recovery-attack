PROF. RAGHUBIR APPLIES MARKETING RESEARCH TO AIDS PREVENTION EFFORTS
 Individuals' instinctive need to feel good about themselves adversely 
affects their ability to respond to many AIDS prevention campaigns and their 
willingness to change their behavior  or seek treatment, according to Priya 
Raghubir, Haas assistant professor in marketing, and Geeta Menon, associate 
professor of marketing at New York University.

Raghubir and Menon applied the principles of marketing research to provide 
critical insight into how public health officials and social marketers can 
design more effective AIDS prevention campaigns.

"As the epidemic is experiencing a rebound, efforts to increase awareness of 
AIDS and risky behaviors now are as important as ever," said Raghubir, noting 
the United States is reporting an average of 40,000 new cases of HIV 
infection each year. "It is critical that public health officials are able to 
craft surveys and educational campaigns that overcome bias and denial, help 
audiences see themselves as at risk, and prompt a positive response."

The researchers found that the "self positivity" bias, a phenomenon that 
creates a need in individuals to feel good about themselves, deters target 
audiences of AIDS awareness campaigns from identifying with the material in 
the ads and therefore prevents them from processing the information 
effectively.

Specifically, this bias causes individuals to perceive that they are less 
likely than others to contract the virus or the disease. Furthermore, the 
less similar the person or situation depicted in the ad is to the individuals 
reading it, the lower the individuals perceive their risk of contracting the 
virus. 

Prevention campaigns are designed based on the results of surveys distributed 
to identify public awareness and levels of risky behavior. Raghubir and Menon 
discovered that the same biases that plague prevention campaigns can be found 
in the surveys on which the ads are based.

For example, the need to conform to social norms leads survey subjects to 
overstate their socially desirable behaviors (e.g., use of condoms) and to 
underreport their socially undesirable behaviors (e.g., sharing needles).

Surveys generally remind individuals of unsafe behaviors they may have 
practiced. However, subjects may find it difficult to remember whether or how 
often they have engaged in these behaviors -- either because the survey 
mentioned several such behaviors or because the individuals have not engaged 
in such behaviors often or recently. Difficulty in accessing this information 
leads to skewed survey responses.

Based on these findings, the authors developed new guidelines for social 
marketers and public health officials to increase the effectiveness of AIDS 
prevention campaigns. 

HAAS PROGRAM ATTRACTS NON-BUSINESS STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE US The Haas 
School has enrolled a group of 64 undergraduates from institutions around the 
globe to participate in the Business for Arts, Sciences, and Engineering 
(BASE) program, run by the Undergraduate Program Office. This summer's 
program started on July 9 and will run through August 17. 

BASE is an intensive, six-week educational experience geared towards 
non-business majors. Now in its fourth year, the goal of BASE is to give 
non-business students an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of business 
with a stimulating mix of theory and practice. Many of the students attending 
BASE are from Cal and the other UC campuses, but more than half of the 
students come from schools outside the UC system. Stanford, Dartmouth, Brown, 
and the University of Toronto are among the 24 schools with students in the 
program. 

BASE students enroll in three courses: Finance and Financial Accounting (BA 
120) taught by Vic Stanton, Marketing (BA 160) taught by Trudy Kehret-Ward, 
and Human Resource Management (BA 150) taught by Holly Schroth. Outside the 
classroom, the program focuses on practical applications of knowledge -- the 
students take field trips to Goldman Sachs, Cisco, and Accenture. There are 
also career workshops and mock interviews to prepare students for the job 
market.?  ? For more information, please refer to the program's web site at 
http://haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/BASE_.html.

CED CREATES CUSTOM PROGRAMS FOR LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LAB
 The Center for Executive Development at the Haas School delivered its first 
one-day custom executive program on High-Tech Marketing and Opportunity 
Recognition for Los Alamos National Laboratories on Monday, June 18.

"This course is part of the Management of Technology (MOT) Program's overall 
effort to make Haas an integral partner in new business development based on 
technologies developed at the Los Alamos Lab," says Drew Isaacs, executive 
director of MOT. Other successful aspects of this collaboration include MOT 
summer internships at the lab for Haas students, and a planned series of 
courses on business fundamentals for later this year and early next year.

This executive program was designed to provide engineers and scientists with 
a strategic overview of the business skills needed for successful high-tech 
entrepreneurship and new venture creation. The program was held in Los 
Alamos, New Mexico. The course, limited to 25 participants, was 
oversubscribed and is likely to be repeated later this year.

For information on custom executive programs at Haas, contact the Center for 
Executive Development at 510-642-4735, e-mail execdev@haas.berkeley.edu or
