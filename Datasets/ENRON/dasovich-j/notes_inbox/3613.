I think that we should be careful.  Private label activity can occur with a 
city today in California if the Muncipal government agrees.  I would not want 
to try and "thread the needle" on a very specific muni language right now in 
CA - too much activity.

Thanks for the note.  We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it 
could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the 
electricity crisis in municipalization).  If spun right, could provide an 
interesting opportunity, however.

Best,
Jeff

Gentlemen, 

California State Senator Nell Soto (D-Ontario Dist.32) has authored SB 23 X 
which is intended to streamline the formation of public power districts in 
California.  

Here is an opportunity for Enron to get involved and flex some muscle and win 
on several fronts.  I think Enron is uniquely qualified to work with 
municipalities to provide private labeled products or services that will 
create a winning situation for all parties involved (including the IOUs).  

I am extremely interested in working on such an effort and would very much 
enjoy sharing my ideas in more detail at any time.  Please feel free to 
contact me.

Thanks all,
