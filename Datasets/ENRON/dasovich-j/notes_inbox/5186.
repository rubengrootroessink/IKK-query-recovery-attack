Jeff,
We've got the entire breakdown on "who got what" in the open season.  The=
=20
following is incomplete, but represents the bulk of what was subscribed....

Burlington-  7,000
CEG Energy Options-  37,800
Coral-  15,000
Duke-  212,000
Dynegy- 56,500
El Paso Merchant- 277,000
ENA-  254,000
MGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000
Oxy-  19,000
PG&E (et al.)- 151,000
SMUD-  10,000
Sempra Trading-  6,500
SoCal- 19,000
Texaco-  58,500
Williams- 11,500

Here's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to=

be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to=
=20
gauge shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming a=
t=20
this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.

I'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than wha=
t=20
we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they=
=20
were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124=20
MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/=
d=20
expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 -=
=20
800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would=20
involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but=
=20
would be an incrementally priced project.

Merchant may relinquish capacity



From today's Gas Daily, in case you haven't seen it yet.......

 El Paso Merchant Energy will be passing up on its right of first refusal f=
or=20
up to 1.22 billion
cfd of capacity on El Paso Natural Gas, sources said yesterday. El Paso wou=
ld=20
not comment
on the report but said the company would issue a statement soon.
 The capacity, from the San Juan Basin to California, was open for bids unt=
il=20
Feb. 12, and
El Paso Merchant Energy held a right of first refusal at six receipt points=
=20
until May 31. El Paso
Merchant paid $38.5 million for the capacity, which was previously held by=
=20
Dynegy Energy
Marketing.
 The capacity has been the source of controversy in the wake of California=
=01,s=20
ongoing energy
crisis, with companies concerned that an affiliated company held the pipeli=
ne=20
capacity.
The California Public Utilities Commission alleged in a FERC complaint that=
=20
the agreement
between the companies was "rigged" (GD 1/11).
 "There has been a lot of pressure," said Gordon Howald, an analyst with=20
Credit Lyonnais
Securities. "Everyone is blaming them for what=01,s going on in California,=
=20
though I believe
FERC did clear them."
 Howald said that giving up that capacity and allowing the "market to decid=
e=20
the value"
would help El Paso on two fronts.
 "It probably makes sense considering the pressure they=01,ve been under fr=
om=20
regulators,"
Howald said. And "their pipeline operations could essentially garner some=
=20
higher profitability
if they are able to increase the value of that capacity in an open season."=
