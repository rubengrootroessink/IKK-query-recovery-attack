Then I am assuming you do not want to file comments on the proposed decision

Mike:  I'll be covering all of this stuff for myself, so unless we agree in
advance to you spending your time, I won't be expecting any bills.  If
Paul's covering your time for the call, I think it would be great for you
to participate.  The reaction's been pretty good thus far.

Best,
Jeff
