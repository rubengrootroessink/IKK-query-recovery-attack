Subject: AB1890 says DA customers cannot pay more as follows:

The following 4 excerpts from AB1890 make a pretty compelling case that:
1) The DA customers should not pay more than bundled rates and
2) This should be accomplised through forcing utilties to participate in th=
e=20
Px
3) Px should reflect market value


367 e 2, page 33 says=20
"(2) Individual customers shall not experience rate increases as a result o=
f=20
the allocation of transition costs. However, customers who elect to purchas=
e=20
energy from suppliers other than the Power Exchange through a direct=20
transaction, may incur increases in the total price they pay for electricit=
y=20
to the extent the price for the
energy exceeds the Power Exchange price."
 Says that DA customers cannot pay more than bundled if they buy from=20
supplier at market prices.

365. confirms that the legislation intended that the utility be forced to=
=20
sell to the Px as follows:
"The actions of the commission pursuant to this chapter shallbe consistent=

with the findings and declarations contained in Section330. In addition, th=
e=20
commission
shall do all of the following:
(a) Facilitate the efforts of the state=01,s electrical corporations to dev=
elop=20
and obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=
=20
the creation and operation of an Independent System Operator and an=20
independent Power Exchange, for the determination of which transmission and
distribution facilities are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the=20
commission, and for approval, to the extent necessary, of the cost

The commission shall also participate fully in all proceedings before the=

all market participants.
 Says they intend that  utilities buy and sell from the Px

390 c page 49 confirms that Px is market based as follows:=20
"(c) The short-run avoided cost energy payments paid to nonutility power=20
generators by electrical corporations shall be based on the
clearing price paid by the independent Power Exchange....."

chapter, the following costs may be recoverable pursuant to this section:"
 Supports that the legislation intended utility generation to be sold to Px
