Verizon Wireless=0F' Reauction Bids Create Buzz As Analysts Praise Carriers=
=0F'=20
Activities in Sale

The buzz on Wall Street last week in the wake of the FCC=0F's reauction of =
422 =0F"
C=0F" and =0F"F=0F" block PCS (personal commu-nications service) licenses f=
ocused on=20
the aggressiveness of Verizon Wireless, the nation=0F's largest wireless ca=
rrier.

Industry observers also talked up the prices paid for three 10- megahertz=
=20
licenses in New York City.

Verizon Wireless agreed to shell out more than $4 billion=0F-or nearly a qu=
arter=20
of the entire $16.8 billion the auction netted=0F-for just two New York Cit=
y=20
licenses (TR, Jan. 29).  The additional 20 MHz of spectrum will give it 45=
=20
MHz in the nation=0F's largest market.

Alaska Native Wireless LLC, which is 39.9%-owned by AT&T Wireless Services,=
=20
Inc., won the third New York City license with a $1.4 billion bid.

Verizon Wireless topped all bidding at the sale, which ended Jan. 26,=20
offering more than $8.7 billion for 113 licenses covering 150 million =0F"p=
ops=0F"=20
(potential customers).

=0F"It is very interesting that the company with one of the strongest spect=
rum=20
positions before the auction. . .has felt the need to be so aggressive,=0F"=
=20
Lehman Brothers, Inc., analyst John M. Bensche said in a note to investors=
=20
last week.  =0F"We commend Verizon for its boldness in the auction, where i=
t=20
garnered spectrum over almost twice as many =0F`pops=0F' as the next-closes=
t=20
bidder.=0F"

Mr. Bensche noted that Verizon Wireless and its founding companies =0F"had =
been=20
quite conservative in their acquisition philosophy. . .This prior=20
conservatism makes the aggressive bidding all the more remarkable, and we=
=20
wonder how much of the =0F`new=0F' philosophy was transplanted into the ven=
ture by=20
Vodafone, the world leader in spectrum bullishness.=0F"

Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications, Inc., and=20
Vodafone AirTouch plc.

=0F"Verizon, with its voracious appetite, was the clear upset victor,=0F" s=
aid=20
Michael I. Rollins, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  He had=20
predicted before the auction that the carrier would bid $3 billion to $5=20
billion on licenses.

=0F"Although we understand that spectrum is an attractive resource, we were=
 a=20
bit surprised at how aggressive the company was relative to others in the=
=20
auctions,=0F" Cynthia M. Motz, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Co=
rp.,=20
agreed in a note to investors.  She had expected Verizon Wireless to bid le=
ss=20
than $1.3 billion in the reauction.

=0F"Based on their auction wins, we believe Verizon is unlikely to be an av=
id=20
participant in subsequent auctions,=0F" including the 700 megahertz band sa=
le,=20
Ms. Motz added.

The FCC=0F's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau last week postponed the 700=
 MHz=20
band auction from March 6 to Sept. 12 (see separate story).

Verizon Wireless officials have declined to comment on the reauction result=
s,=20
citing the FCC=0F's anti-collusion rules.  But Dennis F. Strigl, the carrie=
r=0F's=20
president and chief executive officer, acknowledged at the Comnet Conferenc=
e=20
& Expo in Washington last week (see separate story) that the overall prices=
=20
paid at the sale were =0F"extremely high.=0F"

Analysts speculated why Verizon Wireless had agreed to pay so much for the=
=20
New York City spectrum.  It could be that the carrier wanted to ensure=20
dominance in the wireless data market, or to guarantee that competitors=0F-=
such=20
as Cingular Wireless LLC=0F-didn=0F't land the valuable frequencies, they t=
heorized.

Or perhaps Verizon Wireless is closer than analysts believe to being tapped=
=20
out regarding its available spectrum in New York, they speculated.

=0F"The company has been quite mum about exactly why it felt the need to bu=
lk up=20
so much,=0F" Mr. Bensche said.  =0F"Of course, it will be incumbent upon ma=
nagement=20
to be much more forthcoming about their view of the revenue and EBITDA=20
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) potential=
=20
around wireless data than they have been in the past as they seek to explai=
n=20
the $8.8 billion increase in the debt load.=0F"

Indeed, Credit Suisse First Boston last week downgraded Verizon=20
Communications=0F' stock from a strong buy to a buy, in part because of its=
 need=20
to raise cash to pay for the spectrum and the costs of building its wireles=
s=20
network.  The parent company has said it will lend the wireless unit the=20
money to pay for the licenses.  Standard & Poor=0F's revised its outlook on=
=20
Verizon Communications to stable from positive, citing the auction debt as=
=20
one reason.

Whatever Verizon Wireless=0F' reasons for snatching up the New York City=20
spectrum, analysts concede that licenses there are valuable for any carrier=
. =20
=0F"In order to provide nationwide coverage in the United States, New York =
is=20
mandatory,=0F" noted Knox Bricken, an analyst at the Yankee Group.

Overall, Mr. Bensche said, the C and F block reauction proceeds equate to=
=20
$4.18 per =0F"megahertz pop,=0F" just behind third-generation (3G) auctions=
 in the=20
United Kingdom ($4.29 per MHz pop) and Germany ($4.68 per MHz pop) last yea=
r,=20
which raised more than $80 billion (TR, May 1, and Aug. 21 and 28, 2000). =
=20
Verizon Wireless=0F' bidding worked out to $5.79 per MHz pop, Mr. Bensche s=
aid.

=0F"We believe that biding was rational, and that an average of $4.18/pop/M=
Hz=20
was a reasonable amount for carriers to pay for the spectrum available,=0F"=
 Mr.=20
Rollins said.

Analysts Scrutinize Other Strategies

Here=0F's a look at analysts=0F' take on how the other largest carriers did=
 at the=20
auction:

AT&T WIRELESS:  It didn=0F't win any licenses separately but will benefit f=
rom=20
those won by its =0F"designated entity=0F" (DE), or small-business, partner=
 Alaska=20
Native Wireless, which bid $2.8 billion for 44 licenses.

Through that alliance, analysts note, AT&T Wireless gained spectrum in Los=
=20
Angeles and New York, bringing its holdings to 45 MHz in those markets.  It=
=20
also added licenses in other major markets.

AT&T Wireless told analysts last week that the additional spectrum would=20
allow it to roll out a 3G system in 16 additional markets.  In all, the=20
carrier says, it will be able to deploy the 3G universal mobile=20
telecommunications system (UMTS) technology in 88 of the top 100 markets.

In addition, Mr. Bensche noted that DE affiliates or subsidiaries of two=20
other carriers with close ties to AT&T Wireless=0F-Triton PCS Holdings, Inc=
.,=20
and Dobson Communications Corp.=0F-also won a total of 28 licenses at the=
=20
auction.

CINGULAR WIRELESS:  The carrier has 85% equity in DE Salmon PCS LLC, the=20
number-three bidder at the reauction with $2.3 billion in bids on 79=20
licenses.  Analysts say Salmon won licenses in a number of markets where=20
Cingular needs to fill in holes in its footprint, including Minneapolis;=20
Denver; Portland, Ore.; Norfolk, Va.; Pittsburgh; and Richmond, Va. =20

It also won licenses that could shore up Cingular=0F's spectrum position in=
=20
other key markets, including Los Angeles, Dallas, and Boston.

But it failed to win any spectrum in New York City=0F-a key market.  Cingul=
ar=20
already has a 10 MHz block of spectrum in the Big Apple, thanks to a swap o=
f=20
licenses with VoiceStream Wireless Corp. announced before the auction (TR,=
=20
Nov. 6, 2000).

Mr. Bensche said Cingular =0F"should be comfortable=0F" with that block unt=
il it=20
can acquire more spectrum in New York City in the 700 MHz band auction.  He=
=20
called Cingular-backed Salmon=0F's decision not to remain in bidding for Ne=
w=20
York City spectrum =0F"an act of bravery on behalf of [Cingular] shareholde=
rs.=0F"

Ms. Motz also commended Cingular for its =0F"disciplined=0F" bidding via Sa=
lmon.  =0F"
While the pressure was on for Cingular to win a New York license, it was no=
t=20
enough for the company to be pressured into paying more than it was willing=
,=0F"=20
she said. =20

Salmon officials have said they intend to use the licenses for their own=20
network, although they would have the right to use Cingular=0F's name and m=
ight=20
establish roaming and operations agreements with the large carrier.

VoiceStream:  A VoiceStream subsidiary, Voice-Stream PCS BTA, bid $482=20
million for 19 licenses.  Its DE affiliate, Cook Inlet/VS GSM V P, offered=
=20
$506 million for 22 licenses. =20

The companies filled important VoiceStream footprint holes in the Carolinas=
,=20
including Charlotte and Greensboro in North Carolina and Charleston and=20
Columbia in South Carolina, analysts said.

VoiceStream also picked up licenses in Texas, the Pacific Northwest, and th=
e=20
Midwest.  Its auction success, combined with its planned merger with=20
Powertel, Inc., and recent spectrum swap with Cingular, has helped it build=
 a=20
nationwide footprint, Mr. Bensche said.

Ms. Motz said Cingular=0F's and VoiceStream=0F's auction results =0F"could =
suggest=20
that the two intend to work closely together on favorable roaming=20
arrangements in the near future (since each has what the other needs alread=
y=20
built out).=0F"

SPRINT PCS:  SprintCom, Inc., a Sprint PCS subsidiary,  dropped out of the=
=20
reauction.  But SVC BidCo L.P., a DE that is 80%-owned by Sprint PCS, won=
=20
five licenses for $281 million.  The licenses are in areas where analysts s=
ay=20
Sprint PCS had only 10 MHz of spectrum=0F-Tampa and Orlando in Florida,=20
Cincinnati and Dayton in Ohio, and Norfolk, Va.

Analysts note that Sprint PCS also secured additional spectrum in a swap wi=
th=20
AT&T Wireless announced before the auction.  They say that because it has=
=20
such a strong spectrum position (30 MHz of spectrum in the majority of its=
=20
markets), they aren=0F't surprised it wasn=0F't more aggressive in the sale=
.

NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC.:  Nextel Spectrum Acquisition Corp., a Nextel=
=20
subsidiary, dropped out of the reauction when bidding got too high, as did=
=20
Connectbid LLC, a Nextel DE bidding partner controlled by cellular industry=
=20
pioneer Craig McCaw.  Analysts were not surprised.  They said the auction d=
id=20
not afford Nextel a chance to secure a full national footprint.

=0F"The prospect of holding only 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in a handful of mar=
kets=20
at high prices is not an ideal remedy to Nextel=0F's current spectrum need,=
=0F" Mr.=20
Bensche said. =20

=0F"With an average of 16 MHz of spectrum in the 800 MHz band to operate it=
s=20
iDEN system, it would suit Nextel more to acquire a contiguous 10 MHz on a=
=20
nationwide basis rather than a piecemeal collection of properties,=0F"  he =
said.

Analysts expect Nextel to continue acquiring 800 MHz and 900 MHz band=20
spectrum and say it also could pursue licenses at the 700 MHz band auction.=
  =0F"
Whatever the strategy, the completion of the auction puts Nextel=0F's=20
competition in a much stronger position to better compete in both the voice=
=20
and data markets, leaving Nextel at a disadvantage for future services,=0F"=
 Mr.=20
Bensche said.

Meanwhile last week, Dana Frix, an attorney for San Antonio=0F-based Allegh=
eny=20
Communications, Inc., told TRthat company officials still were considering=
=20
their options for contesting the auction results.

Allegheny, which dropped out of the reauction before it was over when the=
=20
prices got too high, says the DE rules permitted large carriers to=20
participate through =0F"shell entities=0F" for licenses reserved for=20
entrepreneurs.  Allegheny failed to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals in=
=20
Washington to block the reauction the day before it began in December 2000=
=20
(TR, Dec. 18, 2000).

The 35 winning bidders in the reauction have until Feb. 12 to submit down=
=20
payments, the FCC said in a public notice released last week.  The bidders=
=20
also must submit their =0F"long-form=0F" 601 applications, as well as form =
602,=20
which includes ownership information, by that date.  The FCC has said it=20
would review ownership arrangements of winning auction bidders closely befo=
re=20
granting licenses.

Of the 422 licenses on the block in the reauction, 170 were reserved for=20
qualified DEs and 252 were open to all bidders.  Mr. Bensche noted that the=
=20
liberal capitalization rules for DEs allowed large companies to jump back a=
nd=20
forth between bidding on =0F"open=0F" and =0F"closed=0F" licenses, using bi=
dding credits=20
for the open licenses through the DEs.

=0F"In reality, this drove up the prices in the closed blocks to the same l=
evels=20
as the open licenses being chased by the designated entities,=0F" Mr. Bensc=
he=20
concluded.  =0F"In fact, analyzing all of the markets in which at the close=
 of=20
the auction one of the open licenses was won by a bidder with bidding=20
credits, we come to the conclusion that the closed blocks went for 9% more=
=20
than the open blocks!=0F"

Meanwhile, last week bankrupt NextWave Telecom, Inc., whose reclaimed=20
licenses were snatched up at the reauction, filed its reply brief with the=
=20
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington in its case against the FCC.

In its brief, NextWave repeated its argument that the cancellation of its=
=20
licenses was prohibited by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Oral arguments are=20
scheduled for March 15 in NextWave Personal Communications, Inc., v. FCC=20
(case nos. 00-1402 and 1403).

U.S. Carriers See Progress in Opening Markets But Ask USTR To Keep Pressure=
=20
on Laggards

Countries around the world are making progress in complying with open-trade=
=20
agreements affecting telecom services, but much more work needs to be done,=
=20
U.S. carriers have told the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The carriers=0F' statements about global telecom markets had familiar theme=
s. =20
They raised issues similar to those that have dominated debates on opening=
=20
U.S. service markets to competition=0F-disputes over pricing unbundled netw=
ork=20
elements and policies on collocating competitors=0F' equipment in incumbent=
s=0F'=20
facilities.

USTR recently asked for comments on the effectiveness of the World Trade=20
Organization=0F's basic telecom trade agreement, the telecom trade provisio=
ns of=20
the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other telecom trade pacts.  It=
=20
plans to complete its annual review of the agreements by March 31.

Germany

Germany was a primary target of competitors=0F' complaints about the progre=
ss of=20
market-opening efforts.  The Competitive Telecommunications Association sai=
d=20
the market conditions for competitors had =0F"worsened=0F" in Germany over =
the last=20
year.

=0F"The intermingling of interests between the German federal government an=
d=20
Deutsche Telekom [AG], which the German federal government controls in=20
numerous overt and subtle ways, remains a serious problem,=0F" CompTel said=
.

CompTel objected to =0F"exorbitant=0F" licensing fees that require an =0F"u=
p-front=20
payment of administrative costs projected over a 30-year period.=0F"  It ch=
arged=20
that Deutsche Telekom had delayed delivering services to competitors=0F'=20
customers and imposed onerous conditions on collocating equipment in its=20
central offices.

Covad Communications Group, Inc., also complained of market conditions in=
=20
Germany, specifically the rates for unbundled local loops.  It said Deutsch=
e=20
Telekom had proposed charging 34 deutsche marks ($16.25) per month for a=20
local loop, an increase of 33%.  Deutsche Telekom=0F's online service unit=
=20
offers ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) service for 49 deutsche=20
marks ($23.42) per month.

=0F"In order to provide a comparable ADSL retail product in a sustainable=
=20
competitive market, a new entrant would have to charge an end user 49=20
deutsche marks, while paying Deutsche Telekom 34 deutsche marks per month f=
or=20
a loop (in addition to apportioned payments for collocation, transport, and=
=20
OSS, as well as amortizing the increased nonrecurring loop charge of 357=20
deutsche marks [$170.69]),=0F" Covad said.

In addition, the competitor would have to amortize its own investments in=
=20
equipment and network infrastructure, as well as salaries and marketing=20
costs, it said.

Mexico

As USTR decided last week to wait on pursuing a complaint against Mexico at=
=20
the World Trade Organization (see separate story), U.S. carriers continued =
to=20
raise concerns about market conditions in Mexico.

WorldCom, Inc., said Mexico =0F"unquestionably presents the most serious an=
d=20
pressing concerns.=0F"  USTR=0F's =0F"persistent efforts to improve competi=
tive=20
conditions in Mexico have resulted in some progress,=0F" it said, but it ci=
ted=20
some remaining problems:

(1)  The rule that gives the incumbent, Telefonos de Mexico SA de CV=20
(Telmex), sole authority to negotiate accounting rates with foreign=20
carriers.  Competitive carriers can=0F't offer =0F"market-based rates=0F" f=
or=20
international calls because Telmex has resisted reducing the =0F"huge subsi=
dies=0F"=20
it receives from U.S. carriers and customers, WorldCom said.

(2)  The Mexican regulatory agency, the Comision Federal de=20
Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel), has refused to implement =0F"flexible and=20
cost-oriented international termination rates=0F" as an alternative to the=
=20
current system.

(3)  Cofetel has failed to regulate Telmex as a =0F"dominant=0F" carrier.

(4)  Cofetel=0F's decision-making process lacks =0F"transparency,=0F" and T=
elmex=0F's=20
competitors don=0F't have adequate input into the regulatory process.

CompTel said that =0F"despite promises of real change, no real advances hav=
e=20
been made=0F" in Mexico.  Telmex, it added, is failing to meet its obligati=
on to=20
provide timely, nondiscriminatory, and cost-based interconnection.

CompTel viewed the decision to cut the rate for =0F"on-net interconnection=
=0F" to=20
1.25 cents per minute as a =0F"positive step.=0F"  Telmex has challenged th=
e rate=20
in court.  Telmex charges carriers a =0F"resale=0F" tariff rate of more tha=
n 9=20
cents per minute to terminate traffic in cities where the competitive carri=
er=20
doesn=0F't have a network, CompTel said.

Spain

Spain=0F's Ministry of Science and Technology has completed an initial revi=
ew of=20
Telefonica S.A.=0F's =0F"reference interconnection offer,=0F" Covad reporte=
d.  It said=20
it had several concerns with the terms of the offer.

Telefonica =0F"offers only discriminatory collocation,=0F" it said, explain=
ing that=20
Telefonica requires competitors to install equipment in separate caged=20
collocation spaces and restricts the types of equipment that can be=20
installed.  Covad also complained about Telefonica=0F's slow provisioning=
=20
intervals for unbundled loops and lack of information on the condition or=
=20
availability of loops.

United Kingdom

Although the U.K.=0F's Office of Telecommunications has completed a series =
of=20
proceedings to open markets, the telecom environment there is =0F"neither=
=20
stable, predictable, nor nondiscriminatory,=0F" Covad said.

British Telecommunications plc has refused to offer cageless collocation an=
d=20
has limited the central offices that new entrants can access, it said.  Cov=
ad=20
said other new entrants had accused British Telecom of allocating=20
insufficient resources to provisioning unbundled loops.

France=20

Covad criticized France Telecom S.A.=0F's =0F"highly problematic=0F" practi=

=20
license application.

Covad also faulted France Telecom=0F's =0F"discriminatory=0F" collocation p=

Covad concluded.

Peru=20

BellSouth Corp. focused on Peru, commending USTR=0F's role in opening the=
=20
country=0F's telecom markets to competition.  But it expressed concern abou=
t new=20
regulations under consideration in Peru.

Peruvian regulators plan to reduce the interconnection rate for wireless=20
carriers connecting with Telefonica del Peru=0F's wireline network, BellSou=
th=20
said.  It voiced concern that new rates would be challenged and not put int=
o=20
effect.  It also complained about the regulators=0F' decision that the new=
=20
interconnection rates wouldn=0F't apply to fixed-to-mobile calls.

Because the amount of fixed-to-mobile traffic exceeds the amount of=20
mobile-to-fixed traffic, mobile carriers would be =0F"significantly harmed=

the changes went into effect, BellSouth said.  It said the new arrangement=
=20
was =0F"inconsistent with Peru=0F's WTO commitments to prevent anticompetit=

AT&T Corp. raised similar concerns about Peru.  =0F"Continued USTR involvem=

South Africa

AT&T objected to constraints on providers of value-added network services=
=20
(VANS) in South Africa.  Telkom South Africa Ltd., the incumbent telecom=20
operator, =0F"continues to deny new telecommunications facilities to AT&T a=
nd=20
many other VANS suppliers,=0F" AT&T said.

It said the South African regulatory agency, the Independent Communication=
=20
Authority of South Africa, had proposed to require that at least 15% of=20
ownership and control of a VANS license be held by =0F"historically=20

Africa=0F's WTO commitments to provide market access and national treatment=
 to=20
foreign VANS suppliers,=0F" AT&T said.

Japan

To comply with the WTO=0F's basic telecommunications service agreement, Jap=

USTR Delays Plea for WTO Probe Of Mexico, Keeps Options Open

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative still may ask the World Trade=

USTR declined last week to ask the WTO to convene a =0F"dispute-settlement=

Panels To Add Members

With the makeup of the House and Senate telecom subcommittees beginning to=
=20
take shape, lawmakers from both panels are preparing to launch the first=20
major telecom and Internet-related initiatives of the 107th Congress.

Leading the way in the Senate is communications subcommittee Chairman Conra=
d=20
Burns (R., Mont.), who plans to unveil his =0F"tech seven=0F" package of te=

told TRlast week.

Sen. Burns=0F' digital dozen enjoyed considerable success last in the last=

Congress, as nearly half of the bills became part of new telecom laws.  Tho=
se=20
successes include measures to privatize the international satellite=20
consortium Intelsat, designate =0F"911=0F" as the universal emergency telep=
hone=20

loan guarantee plan.

Almost certain to be included in this year=0F's package are bills to expand=

reporting requirements for small incumbent local exchange carriers, and to=

The other =0F"top priorities=0F" on Sen. Burns=0F' agenda are bills to bols=

the subcommittee=0F's oversight capacity.

Meanwhile, Sen. Burns=0F' subcommittee has grown by three seats since the=

previous Congress.  In handing out subcommittee assignments last week,=20
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chairman John McCain (R.,=

Ariz.) gave the Democrats two extra seats on the panel and the Republicans=
=20
one more.  Both parties now have 10 members on the panel.

The new Democratic members are Barbara Boxer (Calif.) and John D. Edwards=

(N.C.).  Sen. Edwards has said he would reintroduce a bill to give consumer=
s=20
more control over how their telecom service providers could use their calli=
ng=20
records for marketing (TR,Nov. 8, 1999).

In a statement on the Senate floor last week, Sen. Edwards said, =0F"During=

Senate Republicans had five seats to fill on the communications=20
subcommittee.  The GOP picked up one seat from Sen. McCain=0F's decision to=

Tauzin Expands Telecom Panel

Meanwhile, efforts to organize the House telecommunications subcommittee we=

Democratic leadership was pushing to add one more Democrat to the Commerce=

=0F-26=20
in the Republicans=0F' favor.  House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R., Ill.),=

however, has proposed adding one more GOP and one more Democratic seat.

Final determinations on committee matters, including the jurisdiction and=

Despite the delay, Commerce Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.) said his=
=20
subcommittee assignments and selections for subcommittee chairmen had been=
=20
ratified by the Commerce Committee=0F's Republican members.

Rep. Tauzin has proposed adding two more GOP seats to the telecommunication=

Powell To Lead with Review Of FCC Operational Changes

With a Republican administration in place for the first time since the=20
passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, GOP insiders appearing at la=

for overhauling the FCC.

Key congressional and FCC staffers predicted that federal policy-makers wou=

Mr. Tenhula suggested that Chairman Powell also would reexamine whether=20

Early Talks with WRC-03 Nations Seen As Key for U.S. Success

It=0F's important for U.S. officials to consult with other nations as they=

prepare for the International Telecommunication Union=0F's 2003 World=20
Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-03), FCC officials and industry=20
representatives agree.

=0F"One of the best ways of achieving a tremendous amount at WRC is. . .[by=

Ms. Ness added.  She noted that WRC-03 would be the fourth such conference=

Mr. Abelson said the advisory committee would be important because it would=

help the FCC develop WRC-03 proposals it can present to other federal=20

Those proposals eventually would be the subject of consultations with=20
regulators from other countries leading up to WRC-03.

Peter A. Tenhula, senior legal adviser to Chairman Michael K. Powell, agree=
d=20
that early planning was essential for a successful WRC-03.

Full Slate of Issues

Among the issues the advisory committee wants addressed at WRC-03 are (1)=
=20
spectrum for third-generation (3G) services, also known as International=20
Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000); (2) terrestrial wireless=20
interactive multimedia services; (3) spectrum sharing in the 40 gigahertz=

=20
disaster relief; (6) interregional sharing issues for broadcasting satellit=
e=20
services; (7) high-frequency broadcasting service; and (8) regulatory=20
procedures governing satellite networks.

Much of the advisory panel=0F's work will be done by seven informal working=

groups focusing on specific issues, said Brian Fontes, chairman of the=20
advisory committee and vice president-federal regulation at Cingular Wirele=

at the 1995 WRC.  Jennifer Warren, senior director-telecom trade and=20

Many of the issues the panel will explore are contentious, Mr. Fontes said.=

But after all the issues have been debated, Mr. Fontes said, it=0F's import=

Julie Garcia, director of the FCC=0F's WRC-03 preparation team, said the ag=

Bureau OKs Satellite Operators For Intersatellite Communications

The FCC=0F's International Bureau has modified the licenses of 10 operators=
 of=20
geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite systems, enabling them to provide fixed=
=20
satellite services in parts of the Ka-band.  The license modifications allo=
w=20
them to operate intersatellite service links (ISLs) using that spectrum.

The bureau said that it could permit the operators to provide ISL services =
as=20
a result of decisions made at the 1997 World Radiocommunication Conference=
=20
(WRC-97) and in light of the operators=0F' studies on sharing the ISL spect=
rum. =20
WRC-97 resolved technical issues regarding GSO satellite transmissions and=
=20
assigned the 65=0F-71 gigahertz band for ISL use by fixed satellite service=
=20
(FSS) providers.  The FCC subsequently reserved that spectrum for=20
nongovernment use.

The bureau granted the ISL license modifications to PanAmSat Corp., Teledes=

GE American Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc.  In a series of =0F"or=

a=20
frequency.  In some cases it also set system build-out =0F"milestones=0F" t=
hat=20
operators must meet to retain the modified licenses.

Section 25.145(f) of the FCC=0F's rules states that a Ka-band GSO FSS licen=

(2) begin construction of the remainder within two years, (3) launch at lea=

The bureau also issued a Jan. 30 order modifying VisionStar, Inc.=0F's lice=

to launch and operate a satellite system in GSO to provide FSSs.  The burea=

gave VisionStar 500 MHz of additional downlink operating frequencies for=20

VoiceStream and Powertel, Inc.

Among other things, the agreement stipulates that DT shall not disclose=20

Don=0F't Exempt Foreign Agencies From Ex Parte Rules, Carriers Say

Only two carriers weighed in on the FCC=0F's proposal to exempt foreign=20

FCC Delays 700 MHz Auction Again at Request of Industry

Major wireless carriers are praising the FCC=0F's decision to postpone, for=
 the=20
fourth time, an auction of spectrum licenses in the 700 megahertz band.  Bu=
t=20
a group representing rural carriers and a major TV broadcaster say the acti=
on=20
wasn=0F't necessary.

The decision to postpone the auction from March 6 until Sept. 12 was needed=
 =0F"
to provide additional time for bidder preparation and planning=0F" and for =
other=20
auction administrative reasons, the FCC=0F's Wireless Telecommunications Bu=
reau=20
said in a public notice released Jan. 31.

The action came after Verizon Wireless and other large carriers cited a hos=
t=20
of concerns they said could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the=20
frequencies.  In a Jan. 18 letter to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau=
,=20
Verizon Wireless said carriers needed time to assess their spectrum needs a=
nd=20
form alliances between the reauction of =0F"C=0F" and =0F"F=0F" block PCS (=
personal=20
communications service) licenses and the 700 MHz band sale (TR,Jan. 22).  T=
he=20
PCS reauction ended Jan. 26 (TR,Jan. 29; and separate story).

Large carriers had supported in comments Verizon Wireless=0F' request for a=
=20
postponement; some asked for the auction to be postponed even longer than t=
he=20
six months Verizon Wireless had requested (TR,Jan. 29).

Other reasons the industry cited in urging a delay included concerns that (=
1)=20
TV broadcasters occupy large chunks of the spectrum to be licensed and=20
additional time is needed to negotiate band-clearing agreements with them;=
=20
(2) companies need more time to prepare for package-bidding rules that will=
=20
be used for the first time in the auction; and (3) a high-level effort to=
=20
identify and allocate frequencies for third-generation (3G) services will=
=20
affect carriers=0F' interest in the 700 MHz band.

Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth opposed the postponement, noting tha=
t=20
the FCC already had missed a Sept. 30, 2000, statutory deadline for=20
depositing proceeds from the auction into the U.S. Treasury.  =0F"I am=20
disappointed that the Commission has decided to postpone this auction once=
=20
again,=0F" he said in a statement.  =0F"With each succeeding delay, the cre=
dibility=20
of our spectrum and auction-management policies becomes more suspect.=0F"

Commissioner Gloria Tristani, who dissented from the FCC=0F's decision last=
 year=20
to postpone the auction to this March, said she did not oppose the latest=
=20
delay.  She cited the short time frame between the C and F block auction an=
d=20
the 700 MHz band sale.

=0F"At this point, the scheduling problems before us are of a different nat=
ure=20
and largely of this agency=0F's own making,=0F" she said.  =0F"The challeng=
es posed by=20
the early auction of 700 MHz spectrum need not be burdened further by=20
unfortunate administrative miscalculations.  The bureau asserts that this=
=20
delay is necessary to address these administrative matters.=0F"

Large Carriers Welcome Delay

Verizon Wireless President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis F. Strigl=20
praised the FCC=0F's decision.  =0F"I think the FCC made exactly the right =
move,=0F"=20
Mr. Strigl said after a keynote address at the Comnet Conference & Expo in=
=20
Washington last week (see separate story).  He said the presence of TV=20
broadcasters in the band =0F"will have a significant impact on the value of=
 this=20
spectrum.=0F"  He added, =0F"At this point, I can=0F't tell you that the ne=
w spectrum=20
has high value.=0F"

Broadcasters are expected to vacate the spectrum (channels 60=0F-69) as par=
t of=20
their transition to digital TV, but they don=0F't need to do so until 2006 =
at=20
the earliest.  The uncertainty over when the frequencies will be available=
=20
has created anxiety among wireless carriers considering bidding in the=20
auction.

Thomas E. Wheeler, president and CEO of the Cellular Telecommunications &=
=20
Internet Association, also praised the FCC=0F's decision.  =0F"We need to t=
ake a=20
quick breath before plunging into the next round of spectrum bidding so tha=
t=20
carriers can assess their spectrum needs and develop bidding strategies,=0F=
" he=20
said.

But several TV broadcasters and a group representing rural carriers opposed=
=20
any further delay.  They said that carriers had had plenty of time to prepa=
re=20
for the auction and that further delay would be unfair.

=0F"There didn=0F't seem to be any justification for another delay,=0F" sai=
d Nancy=20
Udell, vice president-media relations for Paxson Communications Corp., the=

largest incumbent broadcaster in the spectrum to be auctioned.  But =0F"sin=

the FCC has spoken, we=0F're ready to participate=0F" in any band-clearing=
=20
negotiations, she added.

Brent Weingardt, an attorney for the Rural Telecommunications Group (RTG),=
=20
also criticized the postponement.  =0F"There=0F's little pretense that the=
=20
Commission only views auctions in terms of how much revenue they can=20
generate. . .and they=0F're willing to assist larger companies, who are the=
 only=20
ones that are going to be able to compete in that auction,=0F" he said.  =
=0F"We don=0F'

Mr. Weingardt said he didn=0F't expect RTG members to participate in the au=

but said his group opposed a further delay on =0F"principle.=0F"

Analysts Assess Effect

Wall Street analysts saw the auction delay as either positive or neutral fo=
r=20
carriers.  =0F"The additional six months until the start of the auction giv=
es=20
both the FCC and the potential bidders quite a bit of time to ready=20
themselves,=0F" said John M. Bensche, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, Inc., =

note to investors.  =0F"By September, the industry will hopefully have=20
appropriately addressed the various issues that remain surrounding the 700=
=20
MHz band and the auction can commence without further delay.=0F"

Michael I. Rollins, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., said the=20
delay, which he characterized as =0F"widely anticipated,=0F" was =0F"neutra=
l=0F" for=20
carriers because many had indicated little interest in the 700 MHz auction,=
=20
focusing instead on the C and F block sale.

Cynthia M. Motz, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., echoed th=
at=20
view.  She doesn=0F't expect the bidding for 700 MHz licenses to be nearly =
as=20
fierce as it was in the C and F block reauction and doubts that large=20

QUALCOMM Creates Platform To Spur Wireless Internet Apps

QUALCOMM, Inc., has developed an open software platform to help spur the=20

the delivery of data services to consumers, QUALCOMM said.

The BREW platform was developed for devices that use CDMA (code-division=20
multiple-access) technology but eventually will be available for use with=
=20
other technologies, a company spokesman said.  Consumers will be able to=20
update their BREW-enabled handsets by deleting old software and downloading=

said Paul E. Jacobs, QUALCOMM=0F's executive vice president.

QUALCOMM has signed memoranda of under-standing with several wireless=20
carriers, manufacturers, and developers to use the platform, including=20
Verizon Wireless and Leap Wireless International, Inc., in the U.S., Korea=
=20
Telecom in Korea, and Pegaso PCS in Mexico.

QUALCOMM says BREW-enabled products are expected to be commercially availab=
le=20
in some regions in the third quarter of this year.  An investors note from=

Brazil Looks for Bidders

In Brazil, telecom regulator Anatel announced that it was suspending its=20

It said there were seven bidders each lined up for those rounds.

The decision to suspend the first auction round came after a Brazilian judg=

Aerial v. Underground Facilities Is Topic of City-CLEC Debate

Municipalities and competitive local exchange carriers sparred last week ov=
er=20
whether the FCC should preempt several Ohio cities=0F' authority over the=
=20
placement of telecommunications facilities.

Their debate centered on one question:  Does requiring a competitive local=
=20
exchange carrier (CLEC) to place its fiber lines underground, rather than o=
n=20
aerial facilities where the incumbent=0F's facilities are located, constitu=
te =0F"
discrimination=0F" under section 253 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996?

Predictably, the two sides split on the issue.  CLECs said that subjecting=
=20
them to different requirements from those faced by incumbent local exchange=
=20
carriers constituted discrimination and created a =0F"barrier to market ent=
ry=0F"=20
by increasing CLECs=0F' costs.  Section 253(a) bars state and local governm=
ent=20
actions that prevent or have the effect of preventing any entity from=20
providing any interstate or intrastate telecom service.

Municipalities insisted that directing where telecommunications facilities=
=20
should be placed was within the scope of authority reserved to local=20
governments under section 253 of the Act.  According to section 253(c),=20
nothing in section 253 affects =0F"the authority of a state or local govern=
ment=20

compensation from telecommunications providers, on a competitively neutral=

and nondiscriminatory basis.=0F" =20

Both sides presented their views in comments filed last week in Cable=20
Services docket 00-255.  In that proceeding, City Signal Communications,=20
Inc., had asked the FCC to preempt the underground telecom line requirement=
s=20
of Cleveland Heights, Wickliffe, and Pepper Pike, Ohio.  It said the=20
municipalities=0F' rules prohibiting new telecommunication facilities from =

by increasing costs for new service market entrants.

AT&T Corp. said any disparity in cities=0F' treatment of incumbent telcos a=

The Ohio cities had cited the =0F"visual blight=0F" caused by additional ae=

CLECs Tout Effect on Economy But Seek Help from Congress

Competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) have played a major role in=20
fueling the economic growth of the last decade, according to a new study by=
=20
the Association for Local Telecommunications Services (ALTS).

Still, Congress should consider legislation to help CLECs overcome the=20
impediments to competition imposed by incumbent local exchange carriers=20
(ILECs), building owners, municipalities, and the financial markets, ALTS=
=20
said.

The report, Local Competition Policy & The New Economy,was written by ALTS=
=20
Director-public policy research David A. Wolcott.  He links the growth of t=
he=20
Internet to partnerships between CLECs and Internet service providers=20
(ISPs).  CLECs, he says, deliver about 60% of the local dial-up traffic to=
=20
ISPs in the U.S.  =0F"It is a symbiotic relationship that has led to increa=
sed=20
competition in the two industries and has greatly impacted the virtual=20
explosion of the Internet in the United States,=0F" Mr. Wolcott writes.

Broadband technology is one of the =0F"drivers that have fueled the explosi=
ve=20
economic growth of the last decade,=0F" he writes.  =0F"Federal Reserve Cha=
irman=20
Alan Greenspan, while not singling out the [Telecommunications Act of 1996]=
=20
or any other legislative initiative, has attributed much of the recent=20
productivity growth and deepening of capital markets to the communications=
=20
and information technology industries.=0F"

The study, however, raises a familiar list of complaints about actions of=
=20
ILECs, building owners, and municipalities that it says =0F"frustrate the=
=20
emergence of full and effective competition.=0F"  It offers a list of=20
initiatives that Congress should consider so CLECs can continue fueling=20
economic growth.  Among the legislative initiatives the association advocat=
es=20
to address its complaints about ILECs are the following:

(1) Separate ILECs into wholesale and retail units;

(2) Allow the FCC to impose steeper penalties for violating pro-competitive=
=20
directives;

(3) Require that =0F"all combinations of network elements and full function=
ality=20
of the loop be provided to competitors=0F";=20

(4) Extend collocation requirements to include =0F"multifunctional=0F" equi=
pment;

(5) Affirm the FCC=0F's pricing methodology for unbundled network elements;=
 and=20

(6) Permit interconnection among CLECs collocated in ILEC facilities.

The ALTS study also targets building owners, with whom CLECs have been=20
feuding over the need for mandatory building access.  It asks Congress to=
=20
require building owners to =0F"provide nondiscriminatory access to their=20
buildings while at the same time protecting the security of the building an=
d=20
ensuring that competitors pay for the costs of installing equipment.=0F"

ALTS also takes aim at municipalities, which it says have caused =0F"excess=
ive=20
delay=0F" by not promptly approving applications to use public rights-of-wa=
y. =20
It asks Congress to do the following:

(1) Ensure =0F"expeditious intervals=0F" for approving applications for acc=
ess to=20
rights-of-way;

(2) Require franchise fees to be based on the actual costs of managing the=
=20
rights-of-way, not on a percentage of carriers=0F' revenues;

(3) Bar cities from imposing =0F"unreasonable=0F" telecom and universal ser=
vice=20
requirements on telecom carriers;

(4) Ensure that carriers have a private right of action in the courts to=20
enforce the rights-of-way provisions in section 253 of the 1996 Act; and

(5) Establish a process for obtaining rights-of-way across areas under=20
federal jurisdiction at cost-based rates and without =0F"unnecessary=20
restrictions.=0F"

The study acknowledges that CLECs face =0F"financial impediments=0F" to ful=
filling=20
the competitive goals of the 1996 Act.  =0F"The current year will undoubted=
ly be=20
a critical time for CLECs,=0F" it says, noting that some financial analysts=
=20
predict half of all CLECs will file for bankruptcy protection or face=20
consolidation.

To help CLECs overcome their financial hurdles, Congress should consider=20
establishing programs to extend credit to eligible carriers to finance the=
=20
deployment of broadband services in rural areas, the study says.

ALTS points to the proposed Broadband Internet Access Act of 2001, introduc=

Court Upholds FCC Rules Giving ILECs Road to Pricing Flexibility

A federal appeals court says it=0F's reasonable to use the number of carrie=
rs=20
collocating equipment in an incumbent=0F's wire centers as =0F"proxy=0F" me=
asures for=20
determining the levels of local competition.  The FCC uses that proxy to=20
determine whether an incumbent local exchange carrier should be freed from=
=20
some pricing regulations.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington last wee=
k=20
rejected WorldCom, Inc.=0F's argument that the FCC=0F's criteria for granti=
ng ILECs=20
pricing flexibility didn=0F't measure competition accurately and were unlaw=
fully=20
arbitrary.

The case centered on the FCC=0F's 1999 pricing-flexibility order in Common=
=20
Carrier docket 96-262.  The order allowed ILECs regulated under its price-c=
ap=20
regime to gain greater flexibility in setting rates for interstate services=
=20
if they met certain competitive =0F"triggers=0F" (TR, Aug. 9, 1999).

For example, ILECs can win relief from some pricing rules if the FCC finds=
=20
that unaffiliated carriers have collocated facilities in a certain percenta=
ge=20
of the ILEC=0F's wire centers and that at least one collocator is=20
facilities-based.

In its Feb. 2 ruling in MCI WorldCom, Inc., et al. v. FCC (case no. 99-1395=
),=20
the court found that the FCC =0F"made a reasonable policy determination=0F"=
 that=20
the number of collocating comptitors was a reasonable proxy for the level o=
f=20
competition in a particular market.  Judge David B. Sentelle wrote the=20
opinion; he was joined by Judge A. Raymond Randolph and Chief Judge Harry T=
.=20
Edwards.=20

The judges didn=0F't specifically endorse the use of collocation as a proxy=
,=20
even allowing that =0F"it may well be that collocation is a poor measure of=
=20
market share.=0F"  But they noted that the FCC had not relied on market sha=
re as=20
=0F"the be-all and end-all=0F" of competition.  They agreed with the FCC th=
at =0F"the=20
presence of sunk investment, and the resulting potential for entry into the=
=20
market, can limit anticompetitive behavior by LECs.=0F"

In oral arguments last December, the judges expressed frustration bordering=
=20
on exasperation at WorldCom=0F's inability to present an alternative means =
of=20
measuring competition (TR, Dec. 4, 2000).  AT&T Corp. and Time Warner=20
Telecom, Inc., also were petitioners in the consolidated case.

The judges concluded that because they found the FCC=0F's proxy model =0F"
reasonable,=0F" there was no basis on which to require the FCC =0F"to condu=
ct a=20
more searching analysis of competition before granting pricing flexibility.=
=0F" =20
They cited a 1980 case before the circuit court in Washington, D.C., U.S. v=
.=20
FCC.=20

=0F"Someone must decide when enough data is enough.  In the first instance,=
 that=20
decision must be made by the Commission. . .To allow others to force the=20
Commission to conduct further evidentiary inquiry would be to arm intereste=
d=20
parties with a potent instrument for delay,=0F" the judges quoted.

The judges rejected WorldCom=0F's claim that the pricing-flexibility order=
=20
violated FCC precedent because much of the relief it provided to ILECs was=
=20
typical of that given to carriers that are regulated as =0F"nondominant.=0F=
" =20
WorldCom argued that the FCC should be precluded from granting such relief=
=20
without conducting the same kind of competition analysis that it does when=
=20
determining if a carrier should be considered nondominant. =20

The appeals court disagreed, saying the pricing flexibility order did not=
=20
grant LECs =0F"all the regulatory relief afforded nondominant carriers.=0F"=
  It=20
noted that carriers that obtain regulatory relief under the=20
pricing-flexibility order still must file tariffs, a requirement that is =
=0F"not=20
insignificant.=0F"

The appeals court also dismissed WorldCom=0F's argument that the FCC was=20
arbitrary and capricious in authorizing regulatory relief by metropolitan=
=20
statistical area (MSA).  It said the FCC had considered other options when=
=20
devising its rules and called WorldCom=0F's objections =0F"at bottom. . .a=

difference in policy preferences. . .[and] not a sufficient basis on which =

The judges relied on similar reasoning in dismissing WorldCom=0F's objectio=

the triggers the FCC established.  The court called these objections =0F"no=
 more=20

Utah Bill Takes Aim at Cities Entering Telecom Business

Utah state Rep. Greg Curtis (R.) plans to introduce a bill to regulate=20
efforts by municipalities such as Provo that are getting into the=20
telecommunications business, a legislative staff member has told TR.

The city of Provo recently bought a local cable TV company, Provo Cable, an=
d=20
is competing against an AT&T Broadband cable TV system.  Rep. Curtis=0F' bi=
ll=20
would authorize state regulation of such government-owned telecom businesse=
s.

Provo is building a high-speed broadband system to bring advanced telecom=
=20
services to every resident of the city, Michael Mower, Provo=0F's=20
director-community and governmental relations, told TR.

Mr. Mower said AT&T=0F's cable TV system provides services only to select=
=20
businesses and portions of the city.

The legislative staff member said lawmakers were concerned about Provo=0F's=
=20
owning its own telecom company because the state constitution bars the stat=
e=20
from regulating cities.

That would mean that the Utah Public Service Commission wouldn=0F't be able=
 to=20
regulate a municipal telecom company.  The text of Rep. Curtis=0F' bill was=
n=0F't=20
available as of TR=0F's news deadline.

Mr. Mower hopes legislators understand that the process of leveling the=20

The Virginia State Corporation Commission has enjoined Verizon Virginia,=20

Cavalier asked the SCC for help last September, claiming that Verizon =0F"

after the disconnections were reported to Verizon.

The Virginia commission found that although the number of premature=20

=0F's=20
disconnections were intentional.  =0F"Nevertheless,=0F" the SCC said, =0F"w=

The SCC directed the companies to file monthly reports, beginning Feb. 12,=

Wireless Industry Says Agreement Could Streamline Antenna Siting

The FCC, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and a=20
telecommunications working group that includes historic preservation=20
officers, federal officials, and industry representatives have formulated a=
=20
programmatic agreement designed to streamline the review of antenna=20
collocations under the National Historic Preservation Act (TR, Nov. 27, 200=
0;=20
Jan. 8, notes, and Jan. 29).

The agreement comes on the heels of the advisory council=0F's decision in=
=20
November 2000 to revise rules that the industry maintains make it difficult=
=20
to site antenna towers.  The new regulations were adopted after a court=20
challenge alleged voting irregularities in the council=0F's 1999 adoption o=
f the=20
original rules, which implemented section 106 of the National Historic=20
Preservation Act (TR, Aug. 14 and 28; and Sept. 11, 2000).

Like many industry officials, Robert L. Hoggarth, senior vice=20
president-government relations for the Personal Communications Industry=20
Association, has problems with the ACHP=0F's rules.  But he says he hopes t=
he=20
programmatic agreement on collocations=0F-and perhaps other issues=0F-can h=
elp=20
speed the antenna-siting process.  Mr. Hoggarth discussed the agreement wit=
h=20
TR.  An edited excerpt of the conversation follows.

TR:  What=0F's your complaint with the process used to adopt the rules that=
 the=20
ACHP approved last November?

Hoggarth:  The new rules, in our view, were originally promulgated=0F-or at=
=20
least an attempt was made to promulgate them=0F-back in 1999.  The current=
=20
version that the ACHP passed in the fall was essentially the same rules tha=
t=20
they attempted to adopt in early 1999.

TR: So in your view, the rules that were approved last November and took=20
effect in January are pretty much the same as those adopted in 1999?

Hoggarth:  The original revisions that took place in early 1999 never legal=
ly=20
went into effect because they were incorrectly promulgated.  This latest=20
effort on the part of ACHP was an attempt to cure the early illegalities. =
=20
The shortened rulemaking process was, in many respects, a way to rubber-sta=
mp=20
the original rules.  While it did provide an opportunity for the industry t=
o=20
suggest changes, not many of those were accepted by the ACHP.

TR:  What problems does the wireless industry have with the rules themselve=
s?

Hoggarth:  The key to the wireless industry is speed to market.  And the=20
latest applications of the advisory council rules by state authorities and =
by=20
the federal government have created additional potential for real delays fo=
r=20
the industry in the processing of new antenna-site requests.

TR: Why have the rules hurt the antenna-siting process?  Is the wireless=20
industry asking to be treated differently from other industries?

Hoggarth:  No.  What=0F's happened is the new process has upped the ante wi=
th=20
respect to the level of review by state and local authorities.  The challen=
ge=20
that the industry has found is that in implementing those rules, many state=
=20
historic preservation officers and many other stakeholders have used it as =
an=20
opportunity to almost step in and take an approval role, as opposed to an=
=20
advisory role. . .It=0F's the FCC that approves the antenna sites as oppose=
d to=20
the state historic preservation officers or the ACHP.

TR: So you see the ACHP as trying to have a greater role than it=0F's allow=
ed=20
under the law?

Hoggarth:  Correct.  Our goal is to make sure that historic preservation=20
issues are addressed and that they=0F're looked at in a responsible way. =
=20
Resources should be devoted to those sites that are going to present real=
=20
challenges for cultural and historic preservation, as opposed to the creati=
on=20
of an additional bureaucracy that does nothing but cause more pressure and=
=20
work for state and local authorities, significantly increase the processing=
=20
cost for carriers and tower companies, and delay the approval of those=20
facilities.

TR:A telecom working group has drafted a programmatic agreement to streamli=
ne=20
the antenna collocation process.  What=0F's the purpose of such an agreemen=
t?

Hoggarth:  The efforts to come up with a collocation agreement, as well as=
=20
previous efforts of the telecommunications working group, were attempts to=
=20
address the overall industry concern about the ACHP rules and processes.

Our goal was to bite off manageable chunks of the problem so we could resol=
ve=20
some things in the very short term and provide immediate benefits to the=20
historic preservation community and the industry.  This is a billion-dollar=
=20
issue overall, with respect to compliance, speed of service delays, and=20
additional obligations, both at the state and local levels.

And collocation is one way to take a significant chunk out of that=20
billion-dollar burden.  Since last summer there have been active negotiatio=
ns=20
on issues such as delegation and collocation, in an effort to resolve some=
=20
short-term, immediate goals.  A group within the telecommunications working=
=20
group established by the ACHP reached consensus on a collocation proposal.

But what arose in the late fall was significant concern on the ACHP=0F's si=
de as=20
to how to implement any agreement reached by the telecommunications working=
=20
group.  As a result, the ACHP authorized negotiations between the ACHP and=
=20
the FCC to reach a programmatic agreement with respect to the collocation o=
f=20
new antenna facilities on existing structures and buildings.

A general consensus was reached in the fall as to what that would look like=
. =20
The latest efforts, with respect to the programmatic agreement, focus on th=
e=20
real desire=0F-on the part of both industry and government=0F-to have a spe=
cific=20
agreement that has some teeth to it, that has some consistency to it, that=
=20
everyone can be willing to abide by. . .

The negotiations have become very complicated.  We at PCIA and the tower=20
industry have been working with the ACHP, the FCC, and the state historic=
=20
preservation officer community to reach agreements on language that satisfi=
es=20
the goals of preserving historic properties in a responsible manner.

TR:  So the devil is in the details, it seems.  PCIA asked the FCC to amend=
=20
the draft agreement it sought comment on last month.  So did the Cellular=
=20
Telecommunications & Internet Association.

Hoggarth:  Certainly from our industry=0F's perspective, the draft agreemen=
t=20
that was put on public notice is not our ideal.  It=0F's simply a matter no=
w of=20
word-smithing, and we want to make sure that the appropriate administrative=
=20
rules are observed.

TR:  Ideally how would a programmatic agreement streamline the collocation=
=20
process?

Hoggarth:  What it would do is allow the industry to put antennas on existi=
ng=20
facilities without individual review, thereby minimizing the impact on the=
=20
environment by limiting the number of new towers that go up.

The programmatic agreement will have very specific parameters in which the=
=20
historic preservation community will be assured that new facilities will go=
=20
through a process of review.  There=0F'll be assurance that the existing=20
structure on which the collocation is taking place already has undergone a=
=20
measure of review, or that any significant site changes created by=20
collocation will be appropriately reviewed by local authorities.

TR:Under this streamlined approach, what percentage of antennas no longer=
=20
would have to undergo review by historic preservation officials?

Hoggarth:  Our hope is that, as a result of the programmatic agreement, we=
=20
would eliminate 80% to 85% of the reviews by state and federal authorities.

The present system anticipates significant review of literally every new=20
antenna that=0F's sited in a community.  And with collocation, that=0F's si=
mply not=20
necessary.

TR:  Is there a sense for how many antennas that 80% to 85% represents?

Hoggarth:  No, it=0F's hard to say.  What we=0F're trying to do is create a=
 system=20
that not only ensures that current sites remain in place and aren=0F't subj=
ect=20
to review, but also that going forward a large number of new sites will be=
=20
collocations.

TR:  Where has the opposition come from to the collocation agreement?

Hoggarth:  The concerns expressed by the historic preservation community=20
center around language that ensures that there are no significant loopholes=
,=20
and we certainly agree with that.

TR:  Isn=0F't it also correct that some historic preservation officers have=
 been=20
concerned that they won=0F't have the same review authority on collocations=
 that=20
they currently have?

Hoggarth:  I think the concern is a combination of that, plus just a=20
lack-of-control issue, which says, =0F"My goodness, I don=0F't have the opp=
ortunity=20
to review what sort of sites are going to go up.=0F"

The reality is that the wireless industry is expanding so significantly and=
=20
so greatly that historic preservation officers simply don=0F't have the tim=
e to=20
review every new project. =20

They simply don=0F't need to review every one of them, given the lack of ad=
verse=20
impacts from so many of these collocations.

TR: In addition to collocation, what are some of the wireless industry=0F's=
=20
other regulatory concerns that are being discussed by the telecom working=
=20
group?

Hoggarth:  They involve such things as the time periods in which reviews ar=
e=20
required.  They involve the role of the FCC and the role of the industry in=
=20
terms of application reviews, the use of authorized consultants to conduct=
=20
the reviews, and the role of the ACHP v. the role of the state historic=20
preservation officers.  Literally all aspects of the advisory council=0F's =
rules=20
are touched on.

TR:  ACHP officials have said they=0F'd like to vote at their meeting in Ma=
rch=20
on a broader programmatic agreement that includes many of these issues in=
=20
addition to collocation.  Do you think that=0F's still realistic?

Hoggarth:  There are various expectations that folks are bringing to the=20
table.  The reality is that we thought collocation was something that could=
=20
be resolved in a 60-day time frame, and it=0F's now taken four months.  And=
 that=0F'
s just one issue that we thought we had broad consensus on within the=20
telecommunications working group.

As a result, it=0F's just a practical view that a broader programmatic agre=
ement=20
is going to take a lot of hard work.  I can=0F't give you any predictions o=
n=20
time, because if we=0F're fortunate and if things break the right way, we m=
ight=20
be able to accomplish things sooner rather than later.

But I=0F'm optimistic.  It=0F's going to take a tremendous amount of work o=
ver the=20
next year to actually bring something to fruition.

We continue to work on individual issues with the ACHP.  We=0F've establish=
ed=20
very positive working relationships with the NCSHPO organization, and we ar=
e=20
building relationships with various tribal representatives as well, so that=
=20
we can really address all aspects of cultural and historical preservation.
