MASTERS OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING DEGREE OFFERED BY THE HAAS SCHOOL=20
 As many in the Haas community have heard, the Haas School has established =
a=20
new one-year Masters of Financial Engineering (MFE) degree program aimed at=
=20
preparing candidates with superior analytical skills for a growing niche of=
=20
quantitative finance careers. Berkeley's MFE is the first such degree progr=
am=20
in the US offered entirely under the auspices of a business school.=20

Taught by finance faculty from UC Berkeley's Haas School and UCLA's Anderso=
n=20
School of Management, the MFE Program will prepare students for jobs as ris=
k=20
managers, investment bankers, asset managers, derivatives traders, and=20
developers of specialized securities at the world's leading commercial and=
=20
investment banks, insurance companies, and corporate and public treasury=20
departments.=20

"Haas is training a new generation of financial engineers who will be in=20
strong demand in the modern finance marketplace," said Haas School Dean Lau=
ra=20
Tyson. "The program will also offer students the distinct advantage of bein=
g=20
part of a world-class business school with its first-rate career services,=
=20
practical internships, and alumni network."

The inaugural MFE class, the Class of '02, will begin taking courses at the=
=20
Haas School on the Berkeley campus in April 2001 and will graduate in March=
=20
2002. Forty-five MFE students have been admitted into the first class.? It =
is=20
the first US program to offer its students a three-month internship at a to=

technical backgrounds, such as nuclear physicists, mathematicians, and=20
engineers who are in narrow jobs and are keen to transition to a brand new=
=20
career where opportunities are abundant and continue to grow," says MFE=20
Executive Director John O'Brien. O'Brien came to Haas after having served a=
s=20
managing director at Credit Suisse Asset Management (CSAM), a multi-billion=
=20
dollar asset management company.=20

Students will have the option of earning both an MBA and MFE degree=20
concurrently from the Haas School over two years. The MFE program will be a=
