CONGRATULATIONS GRADUATES!

The commencement ceremony will be held on Sunday, May 20 in the Greek
Theatre.  Graduates should arrive at 8:15 a.m.  (The ceremony begins at
9:00 a.m.)  The ceremony will be followed by a champagne reception at the
Kleeberger Sports Lawn, across the street from Haas.

You'll find commencement information at the Haas Alumni Network at:
http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/alumni/newgrads/evmba.html

ARRIVING/PREPARATION FOR CEREMONY:
The Greek Theater is just north of Haas, or left of us if you were to walk
OUT of the Haas building. It is on the east side of Gayley/Piedmont. You
should arrive back stage (by entering from the street side) by 8:15 a.m.
Once back stage, please go to the MBA table (you'll see the Evening MBA
staff there), and print your name on an index card as you would like it
read by Diane. You will keep the card with you and pass it to her on stage.
After you arrive, PLEASE stay backstage and assemble at the end of the area
closest toward Haas (south).

PARKING:
Anyone can park on campus on Sundays.  Some lots will have attendant
parking.  Otherwise just buy a $5 daily parking ticket from one of the
machines and display it on your dashboard.  If you do so, you can park
pretty much anywhere on campus ("C,"  "F" or "S" lots) *except* in any VIP
or otherwise reserved parking spaces. You can use your permit for your
car.  There is parking on the street, in Kleeberger, Foothill (up Hearst
past Gayley/Piedmont and to your right), or at the corner of Hearst and 
Gayley.

A bit of personal parking advice: traffic gets very thick near the Haas
School on Commencement day.  Remember that there will be another
department having its ceremony in the Greek Theatre after us, so
it will be especially congested on the way out.  Park strategically, i.e. a
little bit down the hill and in the direction you eventually want to drive.

RECEPTION:
The reception will be held across the street from Haas on Kleeberger field.
If you have not picked up your two free tickets from us, please do so
before graduation. If you must, you can get them from us backstage, before
the ceremony--while supplies last. Otherwise, all tickets at the door will
be $5. You are admitted free in your cap and gown.

RETURNING REGALIA:
You will need to return your gown and hood in order to avoid being charged
for them.  When you pick up your regalia in the Evening MBA office, we will
give you a yellow card receipt.  REMEMBER to BRING the receipt with
you.  After the reception, please tie the hood around the gown and attach
the receipt (we'll bring staplers) and deposit it in a box located near the
reception. You can keep the cap and tassel.

WEATHER:
Remember that the ceremony will be held RAIN OR SHINE.  There is no indoor
facility on this campus large enough to accommodate Haas, and even if there
were, it would not be available on short notice if it's raining. The
ceremony is fairly long.  Remember that MBAs, PhDs, and Undergraduates all
take part.  Graduates and guests will be out in the elements for about two
and a half hours.

Both rain and shine each present challenges, especially for older or less
physically vigorous guests.  Here are some tips, based on our past
experiences in the Greek Theatre:

RAIN  - As you all know, the weather is unpredictable.  If rain seems at
all likely you should:

1)  Bring an umbrella

2)  Wear clothing that you are not very fond of, as the dye in the gown can
run if it becomes wet.

3)  Wear rain shoes.

4)  Make sure your guests also have appropriate rain gear.

SHINE -  If we are lucky, it will be sunny.  On a sunny day, the Greek
Theatre can be very hot, even when the air temperature is moderate.  If
it's sunny, you should:

1)  Bring plenty of water to drink - there is a vendor selling drinks at
the Greek Theatre, but the lines can be very long and graduates won't be
able to leave during the Ceremony.

2)  Advise your guests to bring hats, sunblock, water, etc.

3)  Remind your out of town guests to dress in layers -- a sunny day
here usually means foggy for part of the ceremony and sunny for the rest.

EITHER WAY:  Graduates will be seated on folding chairs, down close to the
stage. But your guests will be sitting on concrete for the duration.  They
might consider bringing cushions.

Look forward to seeing all of you there, RAIN or SHINE.

If you have any questions, please give us a call us at 510-642-1406.
