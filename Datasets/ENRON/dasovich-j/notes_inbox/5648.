companies whose shares may move in U.S. markets Thursday, Jan. 25.
U.S. Equity Preview includes news that occurred after markets
closed Wednesday. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the

It closed at $70.13 yesterday. The maker of fiber-optic cables
said orders may be lower than expected in the first half of 2001
because several customers said they may order less equipment than
they previously thought.

hours trading. It closed at $20.94 in regular trading. The maker
of computer networking equipment said fourth-quarter profit

trading. It closed at $108.44 in regular trading. The maker of

$9.94. Edison rose 63 cents to $9.38.
