Fellow students,
The Evening MBA board is planning on organizing a golf tournament in the
Fall of this year.  The event will be designed to be a recruiting,
networking and social event.  It will consist of a shotgun scramble format
(thus not requiring serious golf skills), and will be followed by an awards
dinner.  We are currently looking for suggestions on courses in the Bay Area
to hold this first annual event.  If you have a favorite course, or better
yet, membership in more exclusive clubs that would allow us to use the
facilities, please reply back to me, Cindy (best@haas.berkeley.edu), with
your suggestions/recommendations.  Please keep in mind that the course will
need adequate club facilities to hold a large dinner afterwards, and must
allow shotgun starts.  Thank you.

Cindy Best & Tony Tai
