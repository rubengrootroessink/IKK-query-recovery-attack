To All:

Please read the attached SAVE THE DATE invitation to our SVMG/City of
Cupertino Energy Efficiency Conference in partnership with NRDC.

California has succeeded well in avoiding blackouts with unprecedented
energy efficiency and conservation.  But it is still too early to pop the
champagne corks.  It is imperative that we lock in our efficiency gains to
be effective stewards of our resources and minimize high energy costs well
into the future.  Let us help you do that!

I hope that you can attend.

Best,

Carl
