In addition, Becky, do your people have views on a realistic flowchart for
interconnection applications?  The utilities are struggling to come up with
a flowchart that would identify the review steps, time requirements, fees,
etc. for different kinds of interconnection applications, including net
metering.  The PUCO staff has asked the non-utility participants to come up
with their own flowchart before our next workshop meeting on August 30.  Can
your people do that?  Is there any more information that I can provide?

Here are the Technical Requirements proposed by the utilities at the August
23 PUCO Workshop on Interconnection.  Please have your technical people
review these and share with us any issues or problems that marketers would
have with them.  We will need to identify these issues and problems and to
propose alternatives before the next workshop meeting on August 30.
