A story from the Associated Press on Gov. Davis' announcement  that he will 
reveal the details of 38 power contracts is included  below.
?
Some information I received that is not in the  story:
?
The sequence of events appears to be that the governor will  announce 
tomorrow how he will reveal the contract details.? This  announcement may be 
in conjunction with an?attempt in a San Diego  court?to invalidate the 
confidentiality agreements within the  contracts.? The court hearing is part 
of the lawsuit by newspapers and  Republicans to make the contracts public.
?
Davis has reportedly speculated that the actual details will  be released 
near the end of the week.? Some information apparently will be  removed from, 
or blacked out in, documents that are issued.
?
One impetus could be that the details of some of the contracts  have 
apparently been leaked by various sources.? One reporter told me he  
understood that FERC had given some congressional Republicans details on the  
contracts.? The one name was given to me as a recipient of the details was  
Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana.
?
Davis had also promised to make the contract details available  within 6 
months of when they were first signed, a deadline that would expire in  
mid-July.

??? SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gray Davis plans to  release the 
much-sought details this  week of 38 long-term contracts between the 
state and power generators, aides said Tuesday.  
??? "We now believe that the  balance tips in favor of disclosure 
rather than continuing to withhold the contracts," said  Davis 
senior adviser Nancy  McFadden. 
??? Republican  lawmakers and several news organizations, including 
The Associated Press, filed lawsuits in March saying  Davis' refusal 
to release details of the  state's electricity purchases violates 
the California Public Records Act. 
??? But the Davis administration has  refused to release the 
contracts, saying  that revealing the details would put the state at 
a competitive disadvantage in other contract  talks. 
??? The state has  been purchasing power since January for customers 
of three cash-strapped utilities. Much of that has been  on the 
expensive spot market, but  increasingly, state officials have 
locked in contracts for long-term deals. 
??? Raymond Hart, Department of Water  Resources deputy director, 
sent letters  to power generators Monday saying the department will 
ask a judge Wednesday to throw out a confidentiality  provision in 
the contracts.  
??? While revealing the details  still might pose some problems in 
negotiations, "those impacts are far more limited than  they might 
have been had the contracts  been released even two weeks ago," the 
letter states. 
??? Senate leader John Burton, D-San  Francisco, said lawmakers need 
to see  the details of the contracts before they could approve the 
governor's plan to rescue Southern California Edison, or  any 
alternate plan. 
??? "Until we see those contracts, and  know exactly what's in them, 
we can't  make a determination," Burton said. "There was an 
argument that I think was valid that the governor made at  beginning 
of the contracts. ... We're  totally beyond that now." 
??? Burton said Tuesday he'll introduce  three energy-related 
measures in the  Legislature - including one that would repeal a 10 
percent rate hike scheduled to take effect next  year. 
??? The 1996  electricity deregulation law included an automatic 10 
percent rate reduction until March 2002. Burton's bill  would remove 
that out from state law,  but the Public Utilities Commission could 
still raise rates if commissioners felt it was  needed. 
??? Burton is  also authoring a bill to provide backup battery power 
for traffic signals in some intersections to keep the  lights on 
during blackouts.  
??? Burton's third measure is a  resolution that voices support for 
Davis  to commandeer power plants under his emergency powers 
authority. 
??? "The governor talks about it," Burton  said. "We're going to 
show him that  there is support in the Senate for seizing these 
power plants from these generators who have been ripping  us off."
