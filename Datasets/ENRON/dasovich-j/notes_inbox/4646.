Meeting w/ Jay Lewis turned out to be with Scott Stoness and Tamara only.  
Their mind was pretty well made up that flat surcharge is best approach.  We 
prevailed upon them to quantify the impact of several types of rate design, 
and the sensitivity of their conclusion to how much of the summer peak load 
we can shave.
I also left a message with Gary Weiss telling him Stoness would approach 
someone in his organization about how much summer load reduction could 
actually be achieved, and asking him to get involved in that process.  (I'm 
not sure Scott will convinced, so anything you can do to drum up support of 
that idea is great.)  I think this is the real opportunity to minimize losses.

Sue Mara and I are going to talk to Bob Weisenmueller about likelihood of 5 
different types of rate design:
1)flat surcharge
2)big summer bang (Loretta's example)
3)on and off peak based on equal % of market price
4)variation on 2-part Real Time Pricing, where load incremental or 
decremental to baseline is priced or credited at market price
5)hybrid of embedded cost and market price, reflective of actual portfolio 
mix.

I think 2) or 3) are likely and anything else is a longshot.  We'll need to 
consider desirability of Enron testimony (also a longshot); but more likely, 
identify who we need to partner up with.
