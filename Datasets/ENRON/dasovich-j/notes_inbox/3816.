OPEN ACCESS TO POOLING POINTS

EBS announced this week that it is providing open access to=20
its global network of 25 pooling points for buyers and sellers of=20
bandwidth.  This approach enables qualified market participants=20
to connect to Enron=01,s pooling points and transact with all=20
connected parties.

=01&What we=01,re trying to do here at Enron is promote liquidity in=20
the bandwidth intermediation market and a more efficient means=20
of interconnection,=018 said Geoff Allen, director of global=20
bandwidth risk management for EBS.=20

Although the pooling points are private, open access means=20
that Enron supports the notion that counterparties have the=20
freedom to transact through any pooling point system they=20
choose.  Enron offers interconnection at its pooling=20
points for a monthly port fee of $1,000, which will be waived=20
for transactions in which the carrier is a counterparty.

=01&There will be room for different entities supporting various goals=20
and objectives,=018 continued Allen. =01&Companies will be able to=20
access bandwidth services from a plethora of providers, creating=20
a hub for exchanging bandwidth services.=018

Enron has deployed 18 pooling points in the US, six in Europe=20
and one in Asia.

ENRON BROADBAND SERVICES (EBS) had bad news in March with the collapse of i=

exclusive=20
20-year video-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. However, the company can tak=

solace in an=20
agreement signed with Electronics Boutique to launch broadband video games.

Steve Elliott, managing director of EBS Europe, says the venture with=20
