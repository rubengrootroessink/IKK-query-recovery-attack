Hi Jeff. As I indicated earlier, we are working hard to finalize a
first-rate event. Attached is a one-page draft of the conference agenda and
speaker list. This is not meant to be circulated except perhaps to the few
people in your company who should have a picture of what we will do. We
expect a few changes in the speaker list as we receive answers to those not
confirmed yet (indicated), but I believe anyone can see the high level and
quality that are taking shape.

I hope to hear from you soon re sponsorship (or anything else).
Best,
Lee

Thanks, Lee.  Is there a firmed-up agenda yet?  If so, could you forward to
me?
