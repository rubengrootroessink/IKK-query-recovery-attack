Patricia,

Good hearing from you.

From our contact with the Governor's office, we feel Kari Dohn, formerly in
the Governor's office, and recently appointed Chair of the Electricity
Oversight Board, would be an ideal candidate.

Kari would likely be most receptive if the request came from the CSU.  You
can tell her she was referred to you by Jeff Dasovich of Enron.  Kari's
number is 916-324-3501.

Let me know if there is anything else we can assist you with.  I look
forward to seeing you in Sacramento next month!

Regards,

Tom Riley

Greetings Tom, in preparation for our upcoming Board of Governors'
meeting,
I would like to ask you for your help in getting a speaker for the
evening.
The March 11 (Sunday) Board meeting in Sacramento is focused around CSU
Legislative Day scheduled for Monday, March 12.  The Board meeting is
scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm followed by a dinner.  We will invite the
CSU
Trustees to attend the dinner along with other key CSU leaders; we
normally
have about 30-40 individuals attend the dinner.

This year, we would like to invite someone from the Governor's office to
come and talk a little about the energy crises in California.  Can you
help
us identify someone in Davis' administration that may be interested in
speaking to this distinguished group of individuals?

Again, briefly,
Meeting date/time:  Sunday, March 11, 2001 at 4:00 pm; dinner is
scheduled
for 6:45pm; in Sacramento.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
