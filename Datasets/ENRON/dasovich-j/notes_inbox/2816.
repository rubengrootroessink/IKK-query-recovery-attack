Bush-Davis standoff: President still refuses price caps; governor may sue
By Laura Mecoy
Bee Los Angeles Bureau
(Published May 30, 2001)=20
LOS ANGELES -- President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis met face to face Tuesday=
=20
but didn't see eye to eye on the issue of imposing caps on wholesale=20
electricity prices.=20
The Republican president reiterated his opposition to price caps in a speec=
h=20
delivered before the two even met and called for an end to "pointing finger=

and "blame shifting."=20
The Democratic governor emerged from the 35-minute, closed-door meeting=20

"I explained to the president that if he were governor he, like I, would be=

doing everything in his power to fight for the 34 million people in=20
California who are getting a raw deal," Davis said.=20
The standoff was expected. But the meeting drew extraordinary attention,=20
because Bush and Davis are considered potential rivals for the presidency i=

Bush has come under fire for being indifferent to California's energy woes,=
=20
and Davis' poll standings plummeted as electricity bills rose.=20
With Davis sitting just two seats away, Bush told the Los Angeles World=20
Affairs Council that conservation and increasing supply are the solution to=
=20
California's energy problems -- rather than price caps.=20
"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand," he said. "And they do nothing to=

Bush said price caps may sound appealing to those struggling to pay expensi=

and higher prices.=20
Three protesters rose from the audience to wave signs and shout support for=

He graciously welcomed Davis, then subtly attacked the governor for his=20

"For too long, too often, too many have wasted energy, pointing fingers and=

On Tuesday, Bush campaigned aggressively for his national energy plan, and=
=20
the governor tried to match him with his own series of events.=20
The president began his day at Camp Pendleton, highlighting the federal=20

He also touted a Department of Energy plan to stimulate the building of mor=

Outside the hotel where Bush and Davis spoke, about 150 protesters waved=20

Bush over whether the Bush-controlled Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=

should impose some form of wholesale power price relief.=20
The Republican president paid his first visit to the state and, after some=

negotiations over protocol, agreed to a brief personal meeting with the=20

in ads attacking Republican members of Congress in the state, for example.=

It was very evident in advance that Bush would reject price controls. His=

aides had made that clear in pre-visit discussions with reporters, and in t=

public appearances before sitting down with Davis in Los Angeles, Bush said=
=20
it again.=20
Bush told one Los Angeles audience -- with Davis sitting nearby -- that=20
"price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase=20
supply," adding that in the long run, price controls create "more serious=

shortages and, therefore, even higher prices."=20
Davis was, of course, undeterred in his quest for price caps that, if=20
implemented, would remove some of the pressure on him to come up with enoug=
h=20
money to pay California's soaring power bills. While eschewing any overtly=

partisan rhetoric and carefully thanking Bush for meeting with him and taki=

some steps to relieve California's energy woes, Davis said they have "a=20
fundamental disagreement over whether California is entitled to price relie=

State loses round in FERC fight: Legislators and Oakland will file an appea=

(Published May 30, 2001)=20
Exactly one week after California lawmakers filed suit, an appeals court=20

With scant explanation, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court o=

the city of Oakland last week, saying: "Petitioners have not demonstrated=

Determination, conservation pay off in lower energy bills
By David E. Graham=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
May 29, 2001=20
For Dan Russell, incandescent light bulbs with their century-old design are=
 a=20
thing of memory. In their place in his Middletown home are those=20
pigtail-shaped fluorescent bulbs.=20
The retired San Diego firefighter washes clothes by giving them a good=20

s=20
from the Great Depression.=20
His refrigerator is new, but only because it is many times more=20
energy-efficient than the 17-year-old model he had before.=20

And his bill for the 143 kilowatt-hours of power he used in his=20
1,900-square-foot home last month was $18.33.=20
"Saving energy is my hobby," Russell, 58, said recently after he had climbe=

down from his attic, where he had been adding insulation to conserve furthe=
r.=20
Russell is among those San Diegans who, confronting soaring electrical rate=
s=20
and diminished statewide energy supplies, have taken the call to conservati=
on=20
to heart. Like other super conservers, he has scoured over the way he uses=
=20
electricity in his house and has cut back. Then, he trimmed some more.=20
Russell's electrical usage last month was down almost to half the 280=20
kilowatt-hours he had used a year earlier, and he is looking forward to the=
=20
rebate Gov. Gray Davis is offering San Diego County residents this summer.=
=20
Residential customers who use an average of at least 15 percent less energy=
=20
from June through September than they did those same four months last year=
=20
qualify for a 20 percent rebate on those four bills.=20
The governor is hoping such reductions could go "a long way" toward reducin=
g=20
projected blackouts during peak demand periods this summer, said Davis=20
spokesman Roger Salazar.=20
Energy super-savers say a combination of changes are key to reducing energy=
=20
usage, but the essence of conservation involves using only what is genuinel=
y=20
needed, finding more efficient appliances and developing alternate ways of=
=20
doing some tasks -- such as hand-washing clothes or dishes.=20
Seeing the worsening energy crisis, Denice and Jeremy Riddle of El Cajon an=
d=20
their two daughters became super cutters, reducing their consumption by=20
two-thirds after they received a February bill for $208 on 976=20
kilowatt-hours.=20
"We had a family meeting," Denice Riddle said. "We're not going to pay that=
=20
anymore."=20
The Riddles have installed motion sensors in their 1,200-square-foot home s=
o=20

=20
room. The children no longer wear different outfits throughout the day, and=

clean laundry dries outside on a line with only a couple minutes in the dry=
er=20
to add softness.=20
They wash dishes by hand. The dishwasher is going to be removed to make spa=
ce=20
for more cabinets.=20
"I know what we're doing is working," she said.=20
Her last bill was $110 for 532 kilowatt-hours of power, a significant=20
reduction. That amount is close to the 500 kilowatt-hours that SDG&E=20
considers the average monthly usage for residential customers. And the=20
Riddles are not finished.=20
The Riddles added a small bank of solar panels that directly power their=20
freezer, a security measure during blackouts. A Jacuzzi still takes some=20
power, as does a swimming pool pump. Yet the Riddles say they plan to add=
=20
more solar to provide even more of the home's power.=20
"We're going to have a $5 electricity bill, eventually," Denice Riddle said=
.=20
While rigorous, neither Russell nor the Riddle family is fanatical in their=
=20
pursuit. They go about most typical activities of personal and home=20
maintenance in Southern California life. It is just that they do it with a=
=20
stingy discipline.=20
"It can be done," Russell said.=20
He was filled with excitement last week when on a trip to Olympia, Wash., h=
e=20
bought a more energy-efficient television that he calculates will save seve=
n=20
more kilowatt hours a month. He hopes that amount will help offset what he=
=20
figures his wife "wastes" each month by switching on lights he considers=20
unnecessary.=20
Russell also benefits by having some appliances that burn natural gas. His=
=20
combined electrical and gas energy bill last month was $33.47.=20
Russell has so immersed himself in the conservation pursuit that -- as he=
=20
goes about his life -- he lobbies managers of hotels, government offices an=
d=20
businesses to conserve what he considers waste.=20
He sent a visiting friend home to Idaho with a compact fluorescent bulb, th=
e=20
new type with the distinctively curled, pigtailed tube, so the friend could=
=20
start conservation practices there.=20
There is another incentive for energy super-savers, too. People who use no=
=20
more than 130 percent of the monthly baseline electricity allowance, the=20
amount considered a household minimum, can avoid any new rate increases.=20
A San Diego Gas & Electric spokesman said most county residents typically=
=20
have a baseline in summer of 298 kilowatt hours, if their households=20
utilities are all electric, and 130 percent of that would be about 387. For=
=20
households that also use natural gas, the baseline is typically 252 kilowat=
t=20
hours, and 130 percent of that is about 327 kilowatt hours.=20
In mountain and desert areas, the baseline amounts are significantly higher=
.=20
Russell has carried his energy hobby into a family competition with=20
brother-in-law David Rock, who lives in an El Cajon apartment with his=20
21-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son. Rock managed to scrape by last=20
month on 258 kilowatt-hours of energy for $33.17.=20
He is looking forward to qualifying for the governor's 20 percent payment=
=20
rebate this summer.=20

short supply, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Tuesday.=20
"If we remove transmission constraints across the country like those in=20
California and those present here in New York, the result would be lower=20

Speaking at a Consolidated Edison substation in Yonkers that routes power=

south to New York City, Abraham said, "This is a superb facility, but we ne=

Suggesting that blackouts are likely again this summer in California, Abrah=
am=20
said most of the past year's blackouts there "are the result of a=20

He said that on Monday, he directed the Western Area Power Administration, =

"There's an ample supply of energy in this state but transmission constrain=
ts=20
and bottlenecks limit the ability to transfer that electricity to places=20

And he said the Bush administration wants to win the power to decide where=
=20
new transmission lines should go. Noting that Connecticut had recently=20
rejected a transmission line that would have brought much-needed power from=

New England to Long Island, he said, "The transmission grid is the intersta=

Under current law, transmission siting is left to the states. Abraham said=

CAROLYN COLE / Los Angeles Times

?????President Bush, venturing into California for the first time as=20
president, stood firm Tuesday in his opposition to reining in wholesale=20
electricity prices, prompting Gov. Gray Davis to announce that he likely wi=
ll=20
sue federal energy regulators within a month.
?????In their much-anticipated private summit, Bush met with Davis for near=
ly=20
40 minutes in what was characterized afterward as a cordial, businesslike=
=20
session. Davis said Bush offered little to help with California's energy=20
crisis, while Bush's aides said Davis' prescription would worsen the state'=
s=20
woes.
?????"He just listened and said he is against price caps," Davis said.
?????For his part, the president said in a midday speech to the World Affai=
rs=20
Council in Century City: "My administration will continue to work to help=
=20
California through the difficult months ahead."
?????The president's first full day in California consisted largely of=20
appearances before friendly audiences. The only discord came at the World=
=20
Affairs Council luncheon, where three hecklers disrupted his otherwise=20
well-received speech on energy and the economy, and a few dozen protesters=
=20
gathered outside the Century City hotel.
?????Davis toned down his harsh rhetoric of recent days, praising Bush for=
=20
speeding up the process by which the federal government grants permits to n=
ew=20
power plants.
?????The governor said Bush agreed to begin looking into natural gas=20
prices--a step that Davis praised. Natural gas, which fuels virtually all n=
ew=20
power plants being built in California and many of the old ones, costs=20
roughly three times more in California than in New York.
?????The big disagreement remains over the wholesale cost of electricity. T=
he=20
state spent $7 billion on electricity in 1999. The cost could skyrocket to=
=20
$50 billion this year.
?????"We have an agreement to disagree, but it is a big disagreement," Davi=
s=20
said.
?????The Davis administration has appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission to impose some type of price controls on electricity. Davis said=
=20
he expects to sue within a month, if the federal commission turns down the=
=20
state's latest petition, which was filed Friday. Also Tuesday, a federal=20
appeals court rejected a lawsuit by state legislative leaders to force=20
Washington energy regulators to cap electricity prices in California.
?????"I'm going to pursue every recourse possible to me," Davis said, addin=
g=20
that he also will press his case on behalf of California and other Western=
=20
states with the newly Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate.
?????The Bush-Davis meeting was almost twice as long as the 20 minutes=20
allotted on the president's public schedule. On his first visit to the=20
nation's most populous state since taking office four months ago, Bush came=
=20
face to face throughout the day with the reality of the energy crisis and i=
ts=20
potential for dragging down the economy of California and the nation.

?????'Price Caps Now,' Heckler Tells Bush
?????Bush was thrust into the controversy that the crisis has engendered: A=
t=20
the luncheon speech, one woman stood up and shouted, "Price caps now!" and=
=20
"Stop the greedy generators!" As she was slowly led out, two other women=20
echoed her cries, including one who stated primly, "Excuse me, Mr. Bush, we=
=20
need price caps."
?????Medea Benjamin, a California Green Party candidate for the U.S. Senate=
=20
last year, was one of the three women ushered out.
?????Benjamin and 79-year-old Ceil Sorensen were unfurling a banner inside=
=20
the hotel when they were ushered out, said Donna J. Warren, a Green Party=
=20
candidate for the 32nd Congressional District seat. The women were released=
=20
within 30 minutes, Warren said. The president continued his speech, making =
no=20
reference to the interruptions.
?????Meanwhile, a group of economists--among them aides to former President=
=20
Reagan and to Bush's father--sent Bush a letter opposing price caps,=20
countering another letter from economists delivered by Davis supporting=20
temporary steps to stabilize California's electricity market.
?????The president, sounding defensive after coming under attack in a state=
=20
in which he faces wide skepticism about his policies and his poll numbers a=
re=20
drooping, said in an apparent slap at Davis:
?????"For too long, too often, too many have wasted energy, pointing finger=
s=20
and laying blame. Energy is a problem that requires action, not politics, n=
ot=20
excuses but action. Blame shifting is not action, it's a distraction."
?????Bush's day began at dawn in Los Angeles. He flew to Camp Pendleton,=20
where Marines demonstrated their energy conservation efforts. Speaking to a=
n=20
assembly of Marines in front of the 1st Marine Division headquarters, Bush=
=20
was cheered and greeted with several throaty chants of "hoo-aah" from the=
=20
approving leathernecks.
?????After the speech in Los Angeles, he took part in a meeting on energy=
=20
efficiency and then met with the governor. At the end of the day, he flew t=
o=20
Fresno, for a visit today to Sequoia National Park.
?????Andrew H. Card Jr., Bush's chief of staff, said after the meeting with=
=20
Davis: "It was a very, very friendly and constructive conversation." Davis=
=20
described the session as cordial and businesslike.
?????Card said that the two found areas in which they agreed to disagree, b=
ut=20
that there were more areas of agreement.
?????Card also said Bush told Davis that he had asked Pat Wood, a power=20
utility official in Texas whom he has named to the Federal Energy Regulator=
y=20
Commission, to visit with the governor to explore the state's energy proble=
ms.
?????The day had the feel of two intersecting political campaigns.
?????Bush tried to show that he cared about California's woes; Davis=20
surrounded himself with "real Californians," including three young children=
.=20
The group was handpicked by the governor's aides to illustrate the effect o=
f=20
rising electricity bills.
?????"I had hoped [Bush] might have been able to hear the stories directly,=
"=20
Davis said before his private meeting with the president. He sat on a couch=
=20
on the 19th floor of the Century Plaza, with three young children, and=20
listened to their parents and others discuss their worries about rising bil=
ls=20
and fears about blackouts.
?????Linking a thriving economy to a reliable, affordable energy supply, Bu=
sh=20
said all his work on energy would be guided by this test: "Will any action=
=20
increase supply at fair and reasonable prices? Will it decrease demand in=
=20
equitable ways? Anything that meets that test will alleviate the shortage,=
=20
and we will move swiftly to adopt it.
?????"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increa=
se=20
supply," he said, adding that the Clinton administration also opposed such=
=20
restrictions.
?????He said they may sound appealing "at first blush for those struggling =
to=20
pay high energy" bills, but they would bring "more serious shortages."=20
Critics of price caps argue that they would make production of energy=20
uneconomical and thus discourage exploration for new sources of oil and gas=
.
?????In a nod to concerns that energy companies are taking advantage of the=
=20
shortages, Bush said the federal government "takes very seriously our=20
responsibility to make sure that companies are not illegally gouging=20
consumers."

?????Energy Problems Detailed to Media
?????To the surprise of no one in the Davis administration, Bush did not=20
adjust his schedule to listen to Davis' Californians with energy problems.
?????So Davis held a news conference where they could tell their stories,=
=20
then appeared with them in interviews with reporters from national televisi=
on=20
networks.
?????"I'm surprised [Bush] wouldn't meet with this group, and I'm surprised=
=20
he's only giving the governor 20 minutes," said Gladys Cannon, 75, who has=
=20
emphysema. "What can you do in 20 minutes, other than say, 'No.' "
?????Cannon and her husband, Frank, told the governor that they are "on the=

edge," living on fixed incomes, and said they fear the effects of blackouts=

?????Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Court=

years, just in time for summer crisis.=20

By TONY PERRY, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A year earlier than initially planned, the Metropolitan Water District=
=20
of Southern California will begin producing electricity today at its mammot=
h=20
reservoir near Hemet in Riverside County.
?????Four turbines at MWD's Diamond Valley Lake reservoir will produce abou=
t=20
13 megawatts of electricity--enough for about 9,750 homes.
?????The move comes as the state approaches a summer for which energy=20
officials have predicted rolling blackouts.
?????"In this crisis, every kilowatt counts," said Ronald Gastelum, MWD=20
general manager.
?????For anyone looking for a microcosm of what the energy crisis has done =
to=20
change California's thinking, the four roaring turbines at Diamond Valley=
=20
Lake are a good place to start.
?????For openers, the California Energy Commission says the power plant at=
=20
the Hiram J. Wadsworth Pumping Plant is the first new California=20
hydroelectric facility in six years--a period during which demand was=20
increasing and supply remained static.
?????Also, the hydroelectric turbines were not part of the original design =
of=20
the $2-billion reservoir. "There was plenty of power in the state," Gastelu=
m=20
said. "Hydroelectric was not a priority."
?????But as the state tumbled into energy disarray, the MWD board voted to=
=20
retrofit some of the reservoir's pumps to produce electricity.
?????If all 12 pumps are altered to act as power generators--at a cost of=
=20
about $4.5 million--the output will be about 40 megawatts, enough for 30,00=
0=20
homes.
?????Opened in March 2000, the Diamond Valley reservoir is scheduled to hol=
d=20
800,000 acre-feet of water when full. Energy will be generated by running=
=20
water through the turbines before it is sent either to Riverside County=20
agencies or south to its largest customer, the San Diego County Water=20
Authority.
?????The MWD also is considering how to upgrade its transmission lines to=
=20
draw more electricity from existing hydroelectric plants at Hoover and Park=
er=20
dams on the Colorado River.
?????Furthermore, the MWD is looking for other locations to generate power=
=20
along its complex system of aqueducts and canals, and is mulling proposals =
to=20
become partners with would-be power plant builders who need water for cooli=
ng.
?????The megawatts produced at Diamond Valley will be sold to the state's=
=20
Independent System Operator, rather than Southern California Edison Co. or=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.--and that too is a sign of how the energy shorta=
ge=20
has changed things in California.
?????The MWD has long-term contracts to provide energy to Edison and PG&E=
=20
from some of its 15 other hydroelectric facilities. But those financially=
=20
shaky companies now owe MWD about $2 million each, and so the MWD decided t=
o=20
sell to the ISO instead.
?????Beyond serving the state, the MWD stands to make money by selling powe=
r=20
and increasing its stake in the energy business. It plans to use the profit=
s=20
to pay some of its own electricity bill, which has increased by $110 millio=
n=20
this year.
?????With a fast-track approval process from the Federal Energy Regulatory=
=20
Commission, the four 6,000-horsepower pumps were converted in the past two=
=20
months to be ready to produce energy for the peak-usage period of each day=
=20
during the summer.
?????"We don't have all the whistles and bells on it," said David Gledhill,=

Los Angeles -- President Bush and Gov. Gray Davis, who have sparred=20
long-distance for weeks about California's power woes, clashed in person=20
yesterday over their vastly different views on the need for energy price=20
controls.=20
Bush, in a speech before the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, argued=
=20
that California's energy crisis demands "action, not politics, not excuses,=
"=20
and he ruled out federal price controls on the wholesale costs of energy,=
=20
saying, "We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse=
."=20
Davis, however, argued that California's consumers are getting "a raw deal"=
=20
without price limits. He said he will sue the federal government to impose=
=20
controls, which he deems essential to fixing the state's energy problems.=
=20
Emerging from a 35-minute meeting with Bush -- nearly twice as long as=20
scheduled -- Davis said the session was "informational, businesslike" but "=
we=20
still have a fundamental disagreement over whether or not California is=20
entitled to price relief."=20
"I don't think it's a matter of philosophy or ideology. It's a matter of=20
law," Davis said.=20
Federal agencies "made a determination in November, and again Dec. 15, that=
=20
the California market was dysfunctional, prices were too high, . . . and we=
=20
are entitled to some form of price relief," the governor said.=20
Davis warned that without price controls the state would spend $50 billion =
on=20
power, which could send the economy spiraling down and affect the nation.=
=20
The meeting, although described by both sides as cordial, highlighted deep=
=20
philosophical and political differences between Bush and Davis over the=20
state's energy crunch. Those opposing views have been underscored by=20
increasingly harsh rhetoric between top Bush administration officials,=20
including Vice President Dick Cheney, and the governor and his top aides.=
=20
Energy has dominated the California political landscape in a way no one cou=
ld=20
have predicted during last fall's campaign. Field Polls released last week=
=20
show Californians are disappointed in the performance of both men on the=20
energy front. Rolling blackouts and rising utility bills account in large=
=20
part for an 18 percentage point drop in the once-popular Davis' job approva=
l=20
rating from January to May, analysts say.=20
Bush's first trip to California as president is intended to counter the=20
governor's repeated criticism that he has not helped the state solve the=20
energy crisis. Both men tried to spin the trip -- and yesterday's personal=
=20
meeting -- to gain a measure of public support.=20
Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said Bush's visit could help him=20
repair his image in California, where Davis has tied the president to big o=
il=20
interests.=20
BULLY PULPIT
"For too long, (Bush) has ceded the bully pulpit to the governor," allowing=
=20
him to be tied to "oil buddies" in Texas, Jeffe said after the president's=
=20
speech in Los Angeles. "Did he sound like an oil guy today? I was looking=
=20
around for the tree he was gonna hug."=20
In a 22-minute speech to an audience of several hundred, Davis among them,=
=20
Bush said, "for too long -- and too often -- too many have wasted energy=20
pointing fingers and laying blame. . . . Energy is a problem that requires=
=20
not excuses, but action. And blame shifting is not action -- it is a=20
distraction."=20
Bush repeated his opposition to price limits, which, he said, "do nothing t=
o=20
reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase supply."=20
Davis and other Democrats, including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, have=
=20
for months urged Bush to order price controls. Garry South, Davis' senior=
=20
political adviser, charged yesterday that Bush, not the governor, was playi=
ng=20
politics with California's future.=20
The president must come to grips with "the notion that adhering to rigid=20
ideology in the face of an existing law, which requires him to act, is not=
=20
just some kind of a face off with the governor of California," South said.=
=20
"It actually endangers the national economy."=20
'GREEDY ENERGY COMPANIES'=20
Bush's speech, which addressed trade, the economy and tax issues as well as=
=20
energy, was interrupted by lengthy heckling from three protesters, includin=
g=20
former Green Party U.S. Senate candidate Medea Benjamin. The protesters,=20
yelling "stop the greedy energy companies," and "price caps now," were=20
hustled out, and one was arrested.=20
But the president, to warm applause, pressed on with his talk, saying that=
=20
the administration has taken specific steps to assist California, including=
=20
working with Davis "to speed the approval of new power plants, expand=20
electricity production, and increase the flow of natural gas into the state=
."=20
Bush also stressed conservation as "an important part of the energy=20
equation." He said his proposed energy plan "encourages renewable sources o=
f=20
energy, including "safe and clean nuclear power, wind, solar, biomass."=20
And the president repeated his commitment to uphold the moratorium on=20
offshore oil drilling in California.=20
Bush also said he will take aggressive action to ensure that consumers are=
=20
protected against price gougers.=20
"The federal government takes very seriously our responsibility to make sur=
e=20
that companies are not illegally gouging consumers," he said. "We will=20
protect consumers against abuses."=20
In Los Angeles, and earlier in the day at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, Bu=
sh=20
attempted to dismiss the debate over energy as political posturing.=20
'TIME TO PUT ASIDE POLITICS'=20
"It's time to put aside politics and focus on the best interests of the=20
people," he told several hundred Marines at Camp Pendleton. "This is no tim=
e=20
for harsh rhetoric. This is no time for name calling. It is time for=20
leadership. It is time for results."=20
Bush said he will ask Congress to appropriate $150 million for "low-income=
=20
energy assistance" in addition to the $300 million for such aid already in=
=20
his budget.=20
The president also said he will direct Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to=
=20
smooth the way for permits and easements needed to "unplug the Path 15=20
bottleneck" -- a problem with the transmission grid that restricts the flow=
=20
of energy from Southern to Northern California.=20
Before their private meeting, Bush and Davis met in a closed-to-the-press=
=20
session with a dozen business leaders, including the heads of Santa Clara's=
=20
Intel Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp., to discuss the energy crisis.=
=20
"Both the governor and the president seemed fairly inquisitive," said one=
=20
participant, John Woolard, chief executive of Alameda software-maker Silico=
n=20
Energy Corp. "They wanted to know what was actually realistic to solve the=
=20
problems."=20
That 45-minute meeting, also attended by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,=
=20
apparently went more Bush's way than Davis. The business leaders supported=
=20
the president's calls for entrepreneurs to help solve California's troubles=
,=20
and no one brought up the topic of price controls.=20
Woolard said Bush and Davis "seemed surprisingly comfortable with one=20
another," although it was Bush who clearly was in charge of the talks.=20
Overall, he said, Bush was "sympathetic to California's problem and wanted =
to=20
do whatever he could, within certain constraints."=20
Price limits, Woolard concluded, obviously were one such constraint.=20

.DTL=20
The spinmeisters worked overtime to control yesterday's George Bush- Gray=
=20
Davis energy shootout -- but from the looks of things, Davis' folks got the=
=20
upper hand.=20
The White House had tried to dodge a punch by scheduling the Davis-Bush=20
meeting too late for the national evening news -- but Davis' people didn't=
=20
miss a beat.=20
They held a little premeeting gathering of their own up in the governor's=
=20
suite at the Century Plaza in Los Angeles at 10 in the morning where they=
=20
invited a group of people from San Diego to come in and tell their energy=
=20
crisis "horror stories."=20
And wouldn't you know it, all the national press was invited to Davis'=20
meeting as well.=20
The governor then did separate "sit-downs" with five national networks. And=
=20
that didn't include the network morning shows he appeared on just to get=20
things rolling.=20
"It was pretty clear that the Bush team wanted the president's Camp Pendlet=
on=20
visit to be the story of the day," Davis' right-hand political adviser Garr=
y=20
South said as the cameras were setting up. "But hey, what can I say -- we'r=
e=20
pretty good at what we do, too."=20
Then, of course, there were the battling postpresidential-confab news=20
conferences: Davis on the ground floor, and Bush advisers Gerald Parsky and=
=20
Karl Rove holding forth one floor below.=20
But again Davis got the upper hand -- 18 TV cameras showed up for the=20
governor's press conference. The Bush team got only one.=20
Bush, on the other hand, did receive a standing ovation at a luncheon speec=
h=20
before the World Affairs Council, also at the Century Plaza.=20
Even some Republicans were taken aback by the Bush team's apparent lack of=
=20
political thinking in the sit-down with Davis.=20
"The meeting never should have happened in the first place," said former U.=
=20
S. Secretary of Energy (and former state GOP chairman) John Herrington.=20
In Herrington's view, it was clear from the start that Davis was "just goin=
g=20
to use the meeting to kick the stuffing out of the president."=20
And if there was to be a meeting, he says, it should have included some=20
Republican legislators who support the president's energy plan.=20
"That way, they would at least have people coming out on the president's=20
side," Herrington said. "This way, Bush just comes off as Davis' scapegoat.=
"=20
And with every move, an ever-courteous Davis played the role to the hilt,=
=20
sticking like glue to his main talking points:=20
-- California is building new energy plants as fast as possible.=20
-- The state is undertaking a major conservation drive.=20
-- The president needs to back temporary price controls to limit the=20
skyrocketing electric prices being charged by out-of-state power companies.=
=20
And at the end of the day, that was pretty much the message that went out.=
=20
DOMESTIC MATTERS: Big sit-down the other day at the D.A.'s office -- with=
=20
Terence Hallinan making it clear that he wants the "charge count" upped on=
=20
domestic-violence cases.=20
Seems stats show that San Francisco is running below the state average when=
=20
it comes to taking domestic cases to court.=20
In April, for example, of the 192 domestic-violence cases brought in by the=
=20
cops, fewer than half wound up going to court -- mostly for lack of evidenc=
e.=20
But Hallinan (who is already eyeing a run for mayor) wants that to change.=
=20
"We've got to do better even if it means tightening up the charging=20
criteria," Hallinan told us.=20
In other words -- push cases they know they're going to lose.=20
"It's B.S.," one cop tells us. "They're just doing this so that the numbers=
=20
look better -- the cases are just going to get tossed anyway."=20
Maybe, but as far as Hallinan is concerned, that's just "all part of the=20
process."=20
LAWYER BUZZ: The big energy suppliers aren't the only ones cashing in big=
=20
time on California's gas and electric crunch -- so are the lawyers and=20
consultants handling Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s bankruptcy.=20
According to the Daily Journal legal newspaper, dozens of attorneys and=20
financial consultants -- some charging as much as $550 an hour -- have been=
=20
assigned to the case. And they stand to collect "tens of millions of dollar=
s"=20
in fees before their work is finished.=20
And although a bankruptcy judge must sign off on the final bill, the=20
newspaper says, "Whatever amount the judge finally approves, including fees=
=20
for attorneys for both the utility and its creditors, comes out of the PG&E=
=20
bankruptcy estate, which ultimately means the pockets of ratepayers."=20
In the case of San Francisco's Howard, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, Falk &=20
Rabkin, the law firm not only raised its rates by 16 percent -- but tripled=
=20
its proposed PG&E team to 34 lawyers and assistants.=20
"A one-hour meeting of the entire team would cost the utility $9,575," says=

LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Gray Davis and President Bush ended weeks of harsh=20
rhetoric with a cordial meeting in a quiet hotel room here Tuesday. But the=
=20
two couldn't resolve their biggest difference over the state's electricity=
=20
crisis: what Washington should do to help.=20
Bush remained unmoved in his opposition to the price caps California=20
officials have sought. And Davis emerged from their 35-minute meeting=20
declaring he had no choice but to go to court to force federal regulators t=
o=20
enact the temporary limits on wholesale electricity prices.=20
``On the big enchilada, the thing that matters above all else, temporary=20
price relief, I'm disappointed that we do have a fundamental disagreement,'=
'=20
said Davis, who presented Bush with a briefing book describing the state's=
=20
response to the crisis. ``And I did tell him that if we do have to pay $50=
=20
billion for power, it could well trigger a recession in California which=20
could drag down the American economy into a recession.''=20
Davis had little reason to be optimistic heading into the meeting. Shortly=
=20
before, Bush publicly reiterated his strong opposition to price caps in his=
=20
most extensive comments to date on California's energy troubles.=20
``We will not take any action that makes California's problems worse -- and=
=20
that's why I oppose price caps,'' Bush said in a speech to the Los Angeles=
=20
World Affairs Council. ``At first blush, for those struggling to pay high=
=20
energy bills, price caps may sound appealing. But their result will=20
ultimately be more serious shortages and, therefore, even higher prices.''=
=20
White House officials said price caps would discourage conservation by=20
consumers, lead power wholesalers to sell their electricity elsewhere and=
=20
make companies less inclined to invest in new power plants in the state.=20
But Davis said price caps are the only way the state can rein in the soarin=
g=20
costs of electricity until new power plants under construction are online.=
=20
And Davis emphasized his belief that federal law requires regulators in=20
Washington to enact such price caps after they found last fall that=20
electricity prices in California are ``unjust and unreasonable.''=20
``While the president and I have a fundamental disagreement over whether or=
=20
not California is entitled to price relief, I believe there is no doubt we'=
re=20
entitled to it as a matter of law,'' Davis said. ``We will file a lawsuit=
=20
against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for failing to discharge i=
ts=20
legal obligations.''=20
The lawsuit probably will not be filed for about 30 days, Davis said.=20
Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Sa=
n=20
Francisco declined to order regulators to cap wholesale electricity prices.=
=20
The state attempted to solve that problem by filing an official request for=
=20
rate caps with FERC on Friday. The commission now must consider the=20
application, but is expected to deny it, opening the door for the federal=
=20
lawsuit.=20
Davis and Bush greeted each other warmly on the stage of a ballroom at the=
=20
Century Plaza Hotel. Davis used both hands to clasp Bush's right hand when=
=20
they met on stage before the speech, and the two shared a laugh afterward.=
=20
But Davis listened impassively as Bush restated his policy differences with=
=20
the governor -- then indirectly criticized Davis and other Democrats for=20
their pointed attacks on his energy positions.=20
``For too long and too often, too many have wasted energy pointing fingers=
=20
and laying blame,'' Bush said in a speech that twice was interrupted by=20
people protesting his opposition to price caps. ``Energy is a problem that=
=20
requires action, not politics, not excuses, but action. Blame-shifting is n=
ot=20
action, it's a distraction.''=20
Davis' chief political adviser, Garry South, said Bush's criticism was=20
misplaced.=20
``I think he ought to perhaps go back and listen to his vice president, who=
's=20
basically been running a campaign of vilification against Gray Davis for a=
=20
couple of weeks,'' South said of recent comments by Vice President Cheney.=
=20

reliability of energy here, a double whammy that will help tilt the state=

Davis is undoubtedly right when he charges energy producers with an=20

energy policy.=20
Neither of these political pros is telling the whole truth, needless to say=

And, barring intervention from a power higher than political expediency,=20
don't hold your breath waiting for that kind of honesty.=20
If Bush wanted to tell the truth, he might admit that his policy is tilted=

t=20
bailing us out at the expense of the people who backed him.=20
Bush may be correct to say that we can produce our way out of the current=

can't produce affordable non-renewable resources forever.=20
So an honest federal plan would emphasize conservation, not brush it aside =
as=20
the vice president and other administration officials have cavalierly done.=
=20
An honest plan would not pay mere lip service to renewable energy sources.=

But Davis is no slouch when it comes to denying reality, either. Oh, he=20

He forgets that California and the nation lived in a fantasyland of=20
unsustainably low energy prices during much of the 1990s. We persistently=
=20

s=20

If Davis had even an ounce of risk-taking in his soul, he'd find a better w=

=20
has helped to shape, steer and stall the state's efforts: farmers.=20
Farmers have fought off stiff rate increases, shot down early efforts that=
=20
could have saved Pacific Gas & Electric Co. from bankruptcy and locked up=
=20
millions in special state subsidies to help cut their energy costs.=20
``Their influence is extraordinary,'' said V. John White, an environmental=
=20
lobbyist who has been immersed in the Capitol energy crisis negotiations.=
=20
With good reason, some say.=20
California is the nation's largest farming state. Between 500,000 and 1.1=
=20
million people work in agriculture, accounting for up to one of every 14=20
state jobs. Each year, big agricultural interests spend millions lobbying=

As everyone from consumer groups to Silicon Valley leaders tried to fight o=

big rate increases crafted earlier this month by the Public Utilities=20
Commission, agriculture had the biggest success in dulling the impact on=20
their industry.=20
Average Californians are paying up to 35 percent more for power. Farmers=20
managed to get regulators to scale back a proposed 25 percent rate hike to=
=20
about 15 percent.=20
``Clearly agriculture is unique,'' said Michael Boccadoro, an industry=20
lobbyist. ``Agriculture is going to be probably the hardest hit industry in=

California this summer.''=20
In Sacramento, Boccadoro has been involved in every major policy decision=

Within days, the proposal that farmers feared would put too much control of=
=20
water in state hands was dead. And with it went an early opportunity to=20
prevent PG&E from falling into bankruptcy.=20
Agriculture's influence became very public last month when its lobbyists=20
helped orchestrate a legislative ambush that stunned even some veteran=20
lawmakers.=20
For weeks, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, had been working to cobbl=
e=20
together a $1 billion conservation program meant to cut energy demand=20
dramatically this summer.=20
But lawmakers from the Central Valley -- the heart of farm country -- refus=

to back the measure until Sher included special perks for agriculture.=20
The bill languished as legislators tried to work out a compromise.=20
Sher agreed to rewrite the bill to include millions to help farmers buy=20
low-polluting equipment. Apparently, it wasn't enough.=20
Agricultural lobbyists turned to supporters in the Assembly. As Sher stood =
up=20
to present his bill in the Assembly Appropriations Committee, the house=20
Democratic leaders directed the chairwoman to add new agricultural perks to=
=20
the delicately balanced bill.=20
``That was the part that took me back,'' Sher said, recalling his=20
frustration. ``But you roll with the punches.''=20
Farmers were seeking special limits on the amount of time they could be=20
forced to shut off their power during energy emergencies. And they wanted=
=20
permission to run high-polluting diesel generators when they were blacked=
=20
out.=20
State Sen. Mike Machado, D-Stockton, a farmer who pushed for the various=20
changes, said it was important for state leaders to consider how agricultur=
e=20
fits into California's ``economic fabric.''=20
``I use computer technology in my farm, in my tractor, so I need Silicon=20
Valley,'' Machado said. ``They need me to ensure there is fruit and=20
vegetables on their tables.''=20
Other industries=20
But other legislators said there was no rational reason to treat agricultur=
e=20
differently from any other major industry. And they complained that the=20
last-minute legislative assault prevented any discussion on the merits of t=

``If you make a straight-up case about why you should be exempted, it's=20

committee, it raises the suspicions that they can't get the amendments on=

In the end, agriculture lost the cap on blackout hours, but kept millions i=

As expected, Mr. Davis asked Mr. Bush for federal price caps on the soaring=

Bush, who lost California in the 2000 election, made his first trip to the=

he rejected Democrat Davis' demands for caps on the price of energy--mainly=
=20
natural gas from the president's home state of Texas.=20
"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase=20
supply," Bush said during a midday address to the Los Angeles World Affairs=
=20
Council. The president's comment brought enthusiastic applause from the=20
audience of more than 1,000, which included a large number of business=20
people. Davis sat stone-faced a few feet from the rostrum where the preside=
nt=20
spoke.=20
In an earlier appearance, Bush also denounced the posturing surrounding=20
energy politics.=20
"Energy debates sometimes throw off some sparks," he said. "But this is no=
=20
time for harsh rhetoric. It's certainly no time for name calling. It's time=
=20
for leadership and results. It's time to put politics aside."=20
Bush and Davis had a 35-minute meeting following the president's lunchtime=
=20
address in Los Angeles. Afterward Davis made clear he plans to pursue other=
=20
approaches in his quest for price controls. While the governor said he and=
=20
the president had found areas of common ground, he said there is a major gu=
lf=20
between the two on prices.=20
"We still ... have a fundamental disagreement over whether or not Californi=

president. "I don't think it is matter of philosophy, or ideology. It is a=

"The Federal Electric Regulatory Commission ... made a determination in=20
November and again Dec. 15 that the California market was dysfunctional,=20

The governor, who has been mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential=

Davis said suppliers were selling natural gas to New York for $5.95 per=20

governor repeatedly has charged that big energy suppliers--many on them bas=

gouging. Bush said Tuesday that he would order federal agencies to thorough=

Bush's speech was briefly interrupted three times as protesters demanded a=

reduction in energy prices. "Stop the gouging of our economy," one proteste=

shouted. Another stood on a chair shouting as she held up a banner reading,=
=20
"Rate Caps Now."=20
Earlier, in a speech at Camp Pendleton U.S. Marine Base near San Diego, Bus=
h=20
announced he would seek $150 million more in aid to help low-income people=
=20
struggling with rising energy bills. He already has asked Congress for $300=
=20
million for such assistance.=20
Though Bush's speech was billed as an energy conservation address, he spent=
=20
much of his time praising the military for its service and emphasizing the=
=20
administration's support of the military, including plans to raise pay and =
to=20
improve health benefits and housing.=20
Bush was more than halfway through his 10-minute speech when he brought up=
=20
the subject of energy conservation. He began by praising Camp Pendleton and=
=20
federal agencies for heeding his May 3 order to take extra steps to conserv=
e=20
energy during peak hours. Bush said the Department of Defense committed=20
itself to reducing its energy consumption by 10 percent during peak hours.=
=20
"I'm pleased to report that the military and federal agencies are exceeding=
=20
expectations," he said.=20
Bush said the conservation efforts have saved 76 megawatts per hour during=
=20
peak periods, enough for the needs of 140,000 people during peak demand=20
periods. "That's as many people as live in Pasadena, Calif.," Bush said.=20
Bush noted that a new car uses half as much gasoline as a 1972 car and a ne=

this conservation progress stalled in the 1990s," Bush said.=20
