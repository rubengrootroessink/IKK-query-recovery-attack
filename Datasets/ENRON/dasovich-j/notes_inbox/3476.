Andrea-

I received some additional information on your request for the status update 
of S. 764.

According to Sen. Feinstein's staff, S. 764 is with the Sen. Energy and 
Natural Resource Committee and is ready for mark-up.  The Committee is aware 
of the substance of the bill because the Senator already introduced bills 
S.26 and S.287 which both would direct the federal government to place "cost 
of service" based rates on electric energy in the western states.

Moreover, in the House of Representatives today, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held a mark-up of a bill, 
H.R. 1647, requiring FERC to establish a clearinghouse for the purchase of 
electric energy during electric emergencies.  Rep. Waxman (D-CA) offered Sen. 
Feinstein's language from S.764 as an amendment to H.R. 1647.  The amendment 
failed, but was eagerly watched by those in the government and industry.

Finally, it is my understanding that Senator Feinstein will be writing 
personally to all of the major natural gas and electric companies in 
California asking them to support the Williams position.

Please call with any questions.
