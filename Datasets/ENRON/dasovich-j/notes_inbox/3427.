Janel:

FYI - 

Vince Kaminski's office called Ginger to request some background materials 
for Vince on Enron's position on the CA crisis (he is going to a meeting next 
week and thought he may be asked about it).  With Steve's approval, I gave 
him the Solutions Document (marked "internal and preliminary") and the CA 
one-pagers.  Ginger also gave him the e-mail Ken and Jeff sent out to all of 
Enron a couple of months ago.  

Ginger suggested that we may want to put together some sets of these kinds of 
documents in case we have similar internal requests in the future. 

If you agree, which documents should be included?
Have we considered sending out some updated information on CA to all Enron 
employees?

Any thoughts?

Jennifer
