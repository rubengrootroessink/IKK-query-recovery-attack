o Gateway Still On Board After IBM Says No To Transmeta Chip

SAN DIEGO -- Computer manufacturer and retailer
Gateway said it is still on track to use chip design
company Transmeta's microprocessor in an Internet
appliance it is developing with America Online.
IBM announced this week it will not use Transmeta's
Crusoe chip on its ThinkPad 240. IBM said it never
committed to using Transmeta in its 240 laptop,
and only used the chip in its demonstration model.
IBM, which did not comment on why it decided against
the Transmeta chip, said it is still considering
using Transmeta in future ThinkPad models and has
not called off its plans to manufacture the chip.
Gateway, which said it has not deviated from the
plans it announced in May, said it opted for Transmeta's
Crusoe processor because of its small size, long
battery life, and low operating temperature. Gateway
also said it selected Transmeta's Mobile Linux as
the operating system for its products. Transmeta
plans to hold its IPO next week to raise a maximum
of $194 million. Transmeta did not return calls
for comment. The five-year old Transmeta is backed
by America Online, Compaq Electronics, Compaq Computer,
First International Computer, Five Points Capital,
Deutsche Bank, Gateway, Invemed Associates, Phoenix
Technologies, Soros Fund Management, Tudor Investment,
Van Wagoner Capital Management, Vulcan Ventures,
and individual investors.
