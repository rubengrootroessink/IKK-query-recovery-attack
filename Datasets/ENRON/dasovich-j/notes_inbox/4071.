India State Panel To Rework Power Pact With Enron Unit

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra state government will constitute 
a high-level committee to renegotiate a power purchase agreement with Enron 
Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co., the Press Trust of India reported 
late Monday, quoting India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha. 
"We have decided that the government of Maharashtra will constitute a 
negotiating committee to negotiate issues like the cost of power and use of 
power with DPC," the PTI quoted Sinha as saying soon after his meeting with 
the Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and federal Power Minister 
Suresh Prabhu.
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to the company charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.82) a 
kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with around INR1.5/KWh charged by other 
suppliers. 
Enron has a 65% stake in the controversial 2,184-megawatt, $3 billion Dabhol 
project, which supplies power to the State Electricity Board. Dabhol, India's 
largest private power plant, was scheduled for commissioning in two phases. 
The project's first phase, a 740-MW power plant, has already been 
commissioned. 
The committee, comprising representatives of the federal government, 
Maharashtra state government and Maharashtra State Electricity Board, will be 
constituted in a week's time, Sinha said. 
"We hope the DPC will respond positively to this and they don't take steps 
that will precipitate a crisis," Sinha said. 
He added that the cost of power supplied by DPC was too high. 
"We have to look if the state can use all the power generated and if the 
excess power can be wheeled out to needy states," he said. 
Dabhol has attracted India's largest single foreign investment. MSEB has 15%, 
General Electric Co. (GE) has 10% and Bechtel (X.BTL) has 10% in the project. 
Under a 1996 counter-guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged 
to pay Enron if MSEB defaults. 
Enron invoked that guarantee in February, marking the first time in India's 
history that a company has invoked a federal guarantee, when the state 
utility said it couldn't afford to pay Dabhol. The state government finally 
paid $17 million in outstanding bills.

HOUSTON, April 23 /PRNewswire Interactive News Release/ -- Continental 
Airlines' (NYSE: CAL) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gordon Bethune 
has, for the third consecutive year, been named one of the 50 best CEOs in 
America by Worth magazine. The complete list appears in the magazine's May 
issue. 
Other honorees include the CEOs of a wide range of successful corporations, 
including Microsoft, Enron, Alcoa, Dell Computer Company and Federal Express.
Nominated by Wall Street analysts, Worth's Top 50 CEOs were selected for 
their leadership and vision and "based on our belief in the CEO's ability to 
deliver long-term shareholder value." 
"In a world of airline woes, Gordon Bethune is an island of relative 
contentment," said Worth magazine. "Every time American, United and Delta are 
nettled by labor disruptions, Continental gets a bump both in revenue and in 
its reputation for reliability." 
Bethune, who ranked 33rd on this year's list, joined Continental Airlines in 
February 1994 as president and chief operating officer. He was named chief 
executive officer in November 1994 and chairman of the board in September 
1996. 
Worth is an upscale, monthly personal finance and business magazine for 
people who are passionate about business, investing and financial well-being. 
It reaches one million loyal readers with a median net worth of more than $1 
million. Edited by John Koten and started in 1992, Worth is the flagship 
publication of Worth Media. 
Continental Airlines is the fifth largest airline in the U.S., offering more 
than 2,200 departures daily to 133 domestic and 92 international 
destinations. Operating hubs in Newark, Houston, Cleveland and Guam, 
Continental (www.continental.com) serves more international cities than any 
other U.S. carrier, including extensive service throughout the Americas, 
Europe and Asia. 
Continental was named the 2001 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World, as 
well as the 1996 Airline of the Year, making it the only carrier to receive 
this honor twice in five years. Continental is in the top quarter of Fortune 
magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work for in America," and is ranked the 
nation's No. 1 airline in customer satisfaction for long and short-haul 
flights by Frequent Flyer Magazine and J.D. Power and Associates. Continental

INDIA: Enron seeks lenders nod to scrap India contract.

04/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, April 23 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
is seeking lenders' approval to terminate its contract to sell electricity to 
a virtually bankrupt Indian state utility, a source close to the issue said. 
The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), 65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron, will 
discuss the proposal with global and Indian lenders at a meeting in London on 
Monday, the source added.
If the lenders agree, DPC will issue a notice to the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) terminating the contract, the source added. 
Such a move would jeopardise the nearly $3 billion invested in building a 
2,184 MW power plant near Bombay on the west coast of India, and damage 
India's image as a friendly destination for foreign investors, analysts said. 
Enron is India's largest foreign investor and its power project has been 
mired in controversy since the mid-1990s over allegations of corruption and 
high costs. 
MSEB agreed through the contract to buy power from Enron but has now reneged 
on its commitment, saying it cannot afford such costly power. 
The utility currently owes 2.26 billion rupees ($48.28 million) in over-due 
payments to Dabhol. ($1=46.81 Indian rupees).

GERMANY: German wind energy production to rise in 2001-BWE.

04/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

FRANKFURT, April 23 (Reuters) - Newly installed wind energy capacity in 
Germany will help boost production in the country which is already the world 
leader in the sector, the Federal Wind Energy Association (BWE) said on 
Monday. 
In the first three months of 2001, some 297,5 megawatts (MW) or 4.9 percent 
of new capacity were added, bringing the total to 6,400 MW, it said.
Last year, just under 1,700 MW were added. 
BWE president Peter Ahmels said planned expansions in the remaining three 
quarters of 2001 could boost capacity to more than 8,000 MW at the end of the 
year. 
By comparison, out of the 18,000 MW installed worldwide, the U.S. currently 
accounts for 2,500 MW, Spain for 2,500 MW and Denmark for 2,300. 
Germany now has 9,596 wind power units, producing around 12 billion kilowatt 
hours of electricity which covers 2.5 percent of domestic demand. 
Ahmels attributed the boost to the sector to the 12-months old law on 
subsidising power derived from renewable energies (EEG), which was recently 
backed by a landmark Europen ruling. 
The European court of Justice ruled in March that the generous prices payable 
by utilities and their customers to operators of renewable power did not 
constitute state aid and that environmental protection goals justified the 
subsidy. 
Aurich-based Enercon accounted for a 47.1 percent share of newly installed 
generation. 
Next was Nordex AG of Rostock (10.2 percent of the newly installed 
generation), followed by AN Windenergie GmbH of Bremen (9.8 percent), Vestas 
Deutschland GmbH of Husum (9.1 percent) and Enron Wind of Salzbergen (8.6 
percenrt).

India State Elec Bd To Contest Dues To Enron Unit At Mtg
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

04/23/2001
Dow Jones International News

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Indian state of Maharashtra's electricity board, 
or MSEB, a 15% stakeholder in Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power 
Co., will challenge Dabhol's claims of payments for power at a Dabhol 
shareholders' meeting in London Wednesday, MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said 
Monday. 
"We have received a bill for December 2000 and January 2001 from Dabhol Power 
which they claim is payable by us. We have a (counter) claim of 4.01 billion 
rupees ($1=INR46.78) on them. We are going to tell the board members that as 
far as we are concerned, nothing is outstanding," Bansal told Dow Jones 
Newswires in a telephone interview.
Enron India Ltd.'s spokesman Jimmy Mogal declined to comment on MSEB's 
challenge. 
Enron Corp. has a 65% controlling stake in the controversial 2,184-megawatt, 
$3-billion Dabhol project, which supplies power to the State Electricity 
Board. 
Dabhol has attracted India's largest single foreign investment. MSEB has 15%, 
General Electric Co. (GE) has 10% and Bechtel (X.BTL) with 10% are the other 
shareholders in the project. 
As previously reported, Dabhol and the federal government recently started a 
conciliation process, governed by the provisions of the U.N. Commission on 
International Trade Law, aimed at resolving Dabhol's latest dispute with 
MSEB. 
Dabhol said MSEB owes it INR1.02 billion for power supplied in December 2000. 
For its part, MSEB said it wanted the power bill to be offset against a INR4 
billion fine it levied on Dabhol for what it said was the non-supply of power 
for intermittent periods between October 2000 and the end of January. 
As reported, a meeting of Dabhol lenders is taking place in London Monday. 
The meeting has been called by Dabhol to update its lenders on the current 
situation of the project. Dabhol has nearly 40 lenders that include Indian 
and international financial institutions. 
In reply to local media reports speculating that Enron may seek shareholders' 
approval at the board's meeting to sell its entire Dabhol stake, Bansal said: 
"Our equity in Dabhol is 15%. At the moment, we don't have the money to buy 
more. But should that situation arise, we will consider all our options." 
Earlier this month, Dabhol sent MSEB a notice of political force majeure to 
enforce its rights under a 1995 power purchase agreement between the two 
parties. 
Essentially, this move is to protect Dabhol from being penalized by the State 
Electricity Board if political uncertainties interrupt its power supply to 
the Board. 
Last week, Dabhol served two notices of arbitration on the Maharashtra state 
government. 
In a statement, Enron India said the notices were served because the 
Maharashtra government had failed "to honor its obligations under the 
government of Maharashtra State Support Agreement and Supplemental State 
Support Agreement," signed in 1994 and 1996, respectively. 
Dabhol said the agreements meant that the Maharashtra government had pledged 
to "support and encourage the further development and completion of the 
Dabhol project." It added that "without justification," the Maharashtra 
government has gone back on these agreements, which has "adversely and 
materially impacted Dabhol's ability to perform under its contractual 
agreements." Federal Govt Obliged To Pay Under Counter-Guarantee 

The statement added that as part of the arbitration process, an independent 
three-person panel will be set up to determine whether the Maharashtra 
government has "failed to comply with its obligations." 
Under a 1996 counter-guarantee agreement, the federal government is obliged 
to pay Enron when MSEB defaults. 
Enron invoked that guarantee in February, marking the first time in India's 
history that a company has invoked a federal guarantee, when the state 
utility said it couldn't afford to pay Dabhol. The state government finally 
paid $17 million in outstanding bills. 
Dabhol, India's largest private power plant, was scheduled for commissioning 
in two phases. The project's first phase, a 740-megawatt power plant, has 
already been commissioned and phase two is due to be completed later this 
year. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/KWh charged by other suppliers.

Ontario Energy to Be Open to Competition by May 2002 (Update1)

Ontario Energy to Be Open to Competition by May 2002 (Update1)

     (Updates with industry comment beginning in third paragraph,
background in sixth.)

     Toronto, April 23 (Bloomberg) -- Ontario will open its
electricity market to competition by May 2002 in a bid to spur
investment in power generation projects, Energy Minister Jim
Wilson said in the Legislature.
     ``Open, competitive markets are beneficial,'' Wilson said.
``They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit
consumers.''
     Independent power producers such as TransAlta Corp., Canada's
biggest investor-owned utility, and Enron Corp., a Houston-based
energy trader, will be able to negotiate rates with local
utilities and big corporate users. Currently, independent
producers are required to sell electricity to the Ontario
government, which resells it to local utilities.
     ``It's long overdue,'' said Arthur Dickinson, president of
the Association of Major Power Consumers of Ontario, which
represents 67 companies in the province. ``The sooner we get a
competitive market, the better.''
     He said a government proposal to raise electricity rates by
0.7 cent per kilowatt hour in June will cost members of his
association C$150 million ($96.8 million) annually.
     ``My members are very concerned they have no one to negotiate
a contract with'' and have to accept the price increase, Dickinson
said.
     Ontario had planned to open the electricity market in
November. Government officials said the plan was delayed because
of concerns it might result in soaring prices and short supplies,
such as occurred in Alberta and California.
     Alberta capped prices for consumers and small businesses and
is spending more than C$3 billion in rebates to lower costs.
Pacific Gas & Electric filed for bankruptcy protection in
California after accruing $9 billion in losses from buying power
at prices higher than it was allowed to charge customers.
     ``Ontario is different from Alberta and California,'' Adam
White, manager of regulatory affairs for TransAlta, said last
week. ``They (Ontario) have ample supplies so they're not as
vulnerable.''
     Average demand for power in Ontario is 23,000 megawatts,
about the same as New York state. Each megawatt is enough power to
light 1,000 homes. Independent producers such as TransAlta
currently generate about 1,600 megawatts of electricity in the
province.
