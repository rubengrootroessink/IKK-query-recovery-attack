ironic that they will be using our dollars (Linda's office of course gives to 
both the RNC and the DNC)

The advocacy ad blitz has started.  I don't know if I have the title correct, 
but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad 
campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).  The head of the 
committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the 
Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we" 
want to make sure that they're held accountable."

Best,
Jeff
