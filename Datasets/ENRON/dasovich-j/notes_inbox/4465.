Comrades:

Attached you will find the call assignments for the
new admits.  We all have five or six people to call in
the next 7-10 days.   I made a couple of matches where
it seemed there was some kind of similarity in
background or career, but for the most part, the
assignments were essentially random.  The list
includes names, phones at home and work, company and
title.

Remember these are newly admitted students who have
not yet accepted our offer of admission.  The deadline
to accept this offer is April 27th.

A general outline of the phone call, should you choose
to use it, would be:

1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas
School

2) indentify yourself as "involved with the student
government at the Haas School, and the evening office
asked me to give you a call to see if you had any
questions about the program.  Then answer the
questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for
further follow-up

3)describe your own experience at school and how it
has worked with your career--timing, advancement,
scheduling, tuition payments, etc.

4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them
around.  EMBA office will coordinate.

5)remind them of the "New Students Admit Reception" on
April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks
and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent
email for other particulars.

Some pieces of information you might want to have
handy

-required new student orientation is August 11-12;
classes start on the 13th

-fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required,
including the two units for MPAR

-orientation packages will be sent out mid-June

-administration will call each new student in July
with class schedules

-second round of admits come out in early June

Thanks very much for helping.  Let me know if there is
anything else you may need or could suggest to help in
this effort.

Joseph Tambornino
