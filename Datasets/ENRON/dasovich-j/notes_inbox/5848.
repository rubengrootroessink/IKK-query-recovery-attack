I don't understand the import of this ruling.

Judge is ruling that prudently incurred costs are recoverable therefore:
They cannot let the utility go bankrupt?????  They still can if the CPUC 
rules that the value of their assets exceed the shortfall.

Can you tell me what the significance of this ruling is??

This suggests that the utilities were bluffing about declaring chapter 11.  
Now they are protecting against it.?

                    Southern California Edison Applauds Court
                       Findings in Lawsuit Against CPUC

                  Southern California Edison Company (SCE) today
                    released the following statement in response to
                    today's expedited decision by the U.S. District
                    Court upholding the utility's right to recover the
                     costs of purchasing power for its customers.


                  ROSEMEAD, Calif., Jan. 8, 2001--SCE applauded
                  today's decision by U.S. District Court Judge
                  Ronald S.W. Lew upholding the central claim of our
                  lawsuit against the California Public Utilities
                  Commission (CPUC)--our right to recover the
                  reasonable costs of purchasing power for our
                  customers. This ruling is an important step toward
                  rebuilding the financial stability of California's
                  electric power system.

                  The court found that a trial is needed on the
                  question of whether SCE's purchases were prudent.
                  We believe we will prevail on that issue too because
                  the CPUC has repeatedly held that purchases
                  made through California's Power Exchange and
                  Independent System Operator are, by definition,
                  reasonable. We will work with the CPUC to
                  implement a schedule for the reasonable recovery
                  of our costs.

                  We filed the lawsuit on Nov. 15 asking the federal
                  court to overturn rulings by the CPUC that illegally
                  prevent it from the reasonable recovery of operating
                  costs for purchasing power it has been forced to
                  incur on behalf of our customers. We believe that
                  the five members of the commission violated
                  federal law when, after requiring us to procure
                  wholesale power for its customers from the state's
                  newly deregulated wholesale market, and to sell it
                  without markup, the commission blocked us from
                  recovering the full cost of doing so.

                  Our lawsuit was made necessary by the
                  commission's refusal over the past eight months to
                  heed warnings that its policies breach federal law
                  and unfairly place the company and our customers
                  in jeopardy.

                  In the lawsuit, we noted that we incurred
                  "undercollections" (the difference between
                  out-of-control wholesale power costs and frozen
                  retail rates) approaching $5 billion that have
                  seriously weakened our financial integrity and
                  service reliability.

                  This suit is one of many steps we are taking to
                  attempt to remedy serious market problems that
                  threaten the ability of the state's major utilities to

                  continue serving their customers. We are pursuing
                  every possible means of protecting our customers
                  and shareholders from California's dysfunctional
                  electricity market.

                                   ###
