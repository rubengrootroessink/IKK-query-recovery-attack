The 4th of july is wednesday and that's the day I have off from work. 

So, lets plan on going domeward for then.? And perhaps you could download the 
eight-page directions on the nicest, most view-worthy, fastest way to get 
there....

I tried to read some of Gary's burrito....? couldn't do it.? But, better 
reading than what I usually see here or in the Chronicle.

Do good work for the people, we're counting on you......
