electric utility and is considering signing up with Enron. And the Board of=

discuss the feasibility of the county becoming a public power provider.=20
Last month, the San Marcos City Council voted 4-1 in favor of creating a=20
city-owned utility. Now, former mayor Lee Thibadeau is urging the city to b=

its power from Houston-based Enron. The city could save an estimated $17.5=

Thibadeau said he had discussed with Enron a deal under which the energy=20
giant would sell electricity at about 4.37 cents per kWh. That compares to=

about 20.5 cents per kWh that is currently charged by SDG&E, a unit of Semp=

Last month, the municipal utility in Roseville, Calif., approved a $114=20

Earlier this month, Bill Horn, a member of the San Diego County Board of=20
Supervisors, called for the creation of a public power district. San Diego=
=20
County, which is the second largest county in the state, faces economic=20
disaster because of out-of-control electricity rates, he said. Horn said he=
=20
and the board=01,s chairwoman, Dianne Jacob, will ask the supervisors on Se=
pt.=20
12 to approve the hiring of a consultant to study the idea of creating a=20
county-wide utility.=20
Horn said his goal is to have the public power utility operating by next=20
summer. His idea is to find cheaper wholesale power only, not to take over=
=20
SDG&E=01,s wires. =01&I am assuming we can work with SDG&E,=018 he said. =
=01&I don=01,t want=20
to take over lines or become a power generator.=018=20
Residents of the San Diego area have been hit with surging power costs this=
=20
summer as a result of SDG&E=01,s entry into free-market electricity. Their =
bills=20
have doubled and even tripled, compared to last year=01,s prices.=20
=01&Rates have been getting more and more out of hand,=018 said Thibadeau.=
=20
San Marcos, a city of 55,000 about 35 miles north of San Diego, has been=20
interested in creating a municipal electric utility for years, said City=20
Manager Rick Gittings. =01&We=01,ve been looking at this for almost a decad=
e, on=20
and off,=018 he said. The City Council had not brought the issue to a vote=
=20
because it was fairly well satisfied with the electric service provided by=
=20
SDG&E, he said. However, recent developments =01&have certainly stimulated =
a=20
different opinion,=018 Gittings said.=20
Within the next two months, the city expects to put out a request for=20
proposals for a consultant to advise it on the road to municipalization,=20
Gittings said.=20
Thibadeau, who was mayor of San Marcos in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, is=
=20
running for a seat on the City Council in the November election. He is urgi=
ng=20
city officials to move as fast as they can to find a new supplier. The=20
difference between SDG&E=01,s residential rates (as of late August) and the=
 cost=20
of buying power from an alternative supplier such as Enron amounts to $48,0=
00=20
a day, he said.=20
Other cities in California have kept electric rates low by forming municipa=
l=20
utilities, he noted. In Anaheim, residents are paying about 10 cents a kWh,=
=20
or less than half what San Marcos residents are paying SDG&E, he said.=20
=01&That=01,s what a municipal utility can do,=018 Thibadeau said.=20
SDG&E has said that it does not want to sell its distribution system within=
=20
San Marcos and has urged the City Council to reject the idea of operating i=
ts=20
own utility. =01&The city would have to pay SDG&E fair market value for our=
=20
facilities, and that would cost millions and millions of dollars,=018 said =
SDG&E=20
representative Carol Dorman. =01&You would also have to hire between 200 an=
d 300=20
employees to design and maintain the system.=018=20
But Thibadeau said the city would not have to buy the investor-owned utilit=
y=01,
s distribution system in order to reap savings for its residents. He would=
=20
like to see the city buy the system eventually, but for now the city could=
=20
simply shop for electricity and pass the savings on, he said. SDG&E would b=
e=20
owed a fee for its transmission and distribution expenses, but residents=20
would save on the cost of bulk power, he said. As a municipal utility, San=
=20
Marcos also will be eligible for a share of low-cost federal hydro power,=
=20
which currently is selling for 2.7 cents a kWh, he said.=20
And the city could require all new utility easements to be dedicated to the=
=20
city-owned utility rather than to SDG&E, Thibadeau said. This would gradual=
ly=20
reduce the transmission and distribution costs being charged by the private=
=20
utility, he said.=20
Earlier this month, the California Assembly passed a bill to reduce wholesa=
le=20
electricity rates of SDG&E customers to about 6.5 cents a kWh. The payment=
=20
ceiling would last until 2003, with the utility footing the bill for the=20
remaining costs. But eventually those costs, plus interest, would become du=

The uproar over electric rates in the San Diego area has drawn attention fr=
