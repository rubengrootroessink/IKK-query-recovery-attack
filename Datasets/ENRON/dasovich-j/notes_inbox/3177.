Hello, Jeff,

I just called you regarding the tariff to transport gas from California 
border to Mexico/Baja.  Below is a more detailed request from the LNG project 
developer.

Please email me what you find out.  

Have a good weekend!!

George/Ming, 

While you are investigating the pipelines, also see if you can find out the 
tariff that Sempra charges to transport gas from the California border to 
Mexico/Baja.  We are in discussions with Sempra regarding possible joint 
activities, so your investigation should be cautious.  I don't want to 
disturb Sempra, but I would like to find out how the transportation works:  
transport rate, fuel charge, etc.

George,

Thanks for the concise and informative summary.  The cost data and schedule 
information is of particular interest to me.

Would you continue your investigation concerning the following:

1. I would like to know what the existing pipeline distribution system looks 
like in that area.

2. Can we get a map of the pipelines and power plants down the west coast of 
Baja

3. What are the intentions of the competition in that area.

4. What are the major requirements to do work in the area,  both onshore and 
offshore.

Let me know what you guys can dig up. Of course confidentiality at this stage 
is of paramount importance.

Best regards

Mike

Mike,

We have put together a one page summary of the North Baja Pipeline and the La 
Rosita plant.  Let us know of any changes or additions that should be made to 
the summary or if there is another angle you would like us to approach this 
from.  Also, if there are any other projects or topics you would like us to 
analyze, please don't hesitate to contact us.
