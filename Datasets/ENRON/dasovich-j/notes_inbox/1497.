Subject: Ron's Outline of Comments to November 1 Order

Attached find Ron's outline of comments on the FERC's November 1 order in the 
Section 206 proceeding.  They are primarily legal arguments.   

Concerning his comments about the congestion management redesign - I'm not 
sure that we want to oppose LMP.  I think instead we want to ensure that 
there are not a large number of nodes.

Alan will be writing the technical comments on the $150 caps, not Seabron.  
Sue called me this morning and said IEP will not be contesting the $150 price 
cap.  This is too bad because we had hoped they would carry the ball on 
arguing why $150 is not sufficient to incent peaking generation.  Sue is 
working on IEP to try to get them to reconsider.

I think we also need to make sure we make all of the arguments that relate to 
the CPUC's subpoena.  I have asked Lysa Akin to set up a conference call 
about this ASAP with Richard, Dan, Gary Fergus, Me, Mike Day, Sue, and Jim.  
Please tell Lysa if I haven't listed you and you wish to be on this call.
