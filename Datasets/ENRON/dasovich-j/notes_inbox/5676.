I, too, read the case and was prepared to write a memo except for the crucial
fact that I have no idea what the prof. is looking for.  I haven't seen the
suggested questions which I assume will point us in the right direction.

I took a look at the case last night.  It is very short and appears to be

Has anyone received the files with the suggested questions and spreadsheets
