Kern River solicits interest in Kramer Junction

Kern River Gas Transmission, a Williams-owned pipeline, is considering=20
building a new
meter station at a proposed Kramer Junction interconnection with Southern=
=20
California Gas.
In May, SoCal Gas announced plans for a 200 million cfd system expansion,=
=20
called
the Kramer Junction Interconnect project, including a 32-mile pipe that wou=
ld=20
link with
Kern River and Mojave Pipeline. The project is slated for completion at the=
=20
end of December
(GD 5/16).

Kern River is proposing to construct a meter station at Kramer Junction, wi=
th=20
primary
firm delivery of up to 500 million cfd. Such new capacity, the pipeline sai=
d,=20
=01&is reserved to
facilitate a reduction in the facilities otherwise required for [Kern River=

Project.=018 To do so, Kern River will allow existing 2002 and 2003 expansi=
on=20
project
shippers to acquire capacity at the Kramer Junction in return for=20
relinquishing equivalent firm
delivery entitlements at the Wheeler Ridge, which interconnects with SoCal=
=20
Gas.

To maximize the reduction of design requirements and associated costs in it=

2003 expansion
project, Kern River said it will allocate capacity at Kramer Junction as=20
follows:
=01=07 Capacity will be allocated to any shipper requesting delivery point=

entitlements to be
re-aligned from Wheeler Ridge to Kramer Junction under certain conditions;
=01=07 Capacity will be allocated pro rata among shippers that have no exce=
ss=20
entitlements but
request to replace Wheeler Ridge entitlements with Kramer Junction=20
entitlements; and
=01=07 Available capacity will be allocated pro rata among shippers that ha=
ve=20
excess entitlements
and request to replace Wheeler Ridge entitlements with Kramer Junction=20
entitlements.
Uncommitted Kramer Junction capacity will be made available to all shippers=
=20
on a first-come,
first-served basis, with requests made no earlier than 25 days before the=
=20
delivery point is
in service, Kern River said. In addition, capacity at Kramer Junction=20
delivery point that is
committed to the Kern River 2002 or 2003 expansion projects in this request=
=20
process will also
be available on a first-come, first-served basis.
