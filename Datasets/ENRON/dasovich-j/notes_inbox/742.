Jeff:

We'll complete the draft CPUC sales report you faxed.  It looks like it
should be mostly "zero's" for this period - you could not have sales
already in California, correct?

And to confirm our conversation of Thursday, we are to recommend ICAs
for Pacific and for GTE/Verizon.   Enron can generally pick & choose
whole sections too.

In Arizona, a state Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion, FYI,
which requires specific fare market price setting prior to grants of
CPCN authority and this has delayed many Applications pending there. I
will check with Anita on the status of Enron in Arizona.

We also drafted several Customer Notices to be submitted to the CPUC
with the latest tariffs and will send you copies prior to filing.

Please let us know any questions,

Jeremy
