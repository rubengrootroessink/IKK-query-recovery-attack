WHY CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO Enron Corp


CALIFORNIA=01,S ELECTRICITY WOES
The root cause of California=01,s high electricity costs today stem from a=
=20
severe lack of new power plants.  Why?  Not enough capacity was added since=
=20
1996 due to tough siting problems in this ecology prone state.  In fact in=
=20
all the state only 700 MW of new capacity was added since 1996 compared to=
=20
its growth of 11,000 MW since then.  The growth ate up all the surplus=20
capacity that existed in 1996.  It is a tough dilemma since this state=01,s=
 high=20
tech businesses and commercial businesses and homeowners have fast growing=
=20
demand for more and more reliable power.

THE 10 PERCENT CUTS
The CPUC compounded the state=01,s problems when they put their electric=20
deregulation plan in place in 1997-98 by mandating a high 10 percent rate c=
ut=20
to residential and commercial consumers=01*which Enron protested at the tim=
e. =20
The rate cut discouraged alternative power sellers from selling into=20
California because it was a hard price to beat and it blurred consumers=20
understanding of what is actually happening to their cost of power.

BILATERAL CONTRACTS TO THE RESCUE
Further problems arose because of the CPUC=01,s requirement for wholesale b=
uyers=20
and sellers to use the PX (power exchange) auction system=01*instead of=20
bilateral contracting which Enron Government Affairs advocated at the time.=
 =20
The PX uses an auction to set a single highest price that clears the market=
=20
in one time period for all power rather than the variety of prices that can=
=20
be agreed to by dozens of counterparties under a free market using bilatera=
l=20
contracting.

Because the CPUC has been shocked by the high prices being reached in the P=
X,=20
it now has been setting tight $150-$250 MW price caps which obviates its ow=
n=20
auction process and discourages sellers of power away from selling power in=
to=20
California.  But it also worsens the economics for any potential power plan=
t=20
developers who might be considering building a plant in California.  Many U=
S=20
power markets have no price caps at all or caps of $1000 MW (or high enough=
=20
so they are seldom triggered).=20

CALIFORNIA=01,S WOES AREN=01,T EASY TO FIX
What does all this mean?  If the state would use bilateral contracting=20
instead of the PX auction to get its supplies so if Duke or Enron or Exelon=
=20
or Dynegy or whoever had contracts with counterparties the prices would be=
=20
variously set, and if more power demand was evident developers would have a=
=20
clear economic basis on which to contract for their new plants.  There woul=
d=20
be no need for price caps.
=20
NIMBY ISSUES REMAIN
On the power plant siting problem, this is a tough one.  California is a=20
beautiful state and prides itself on its green conscience.  Even a few high=
=20
tech companies that need 99.9999 percent reliable power desperately are sti=
ll=20
unwilling to build a small clean gas combined cycle plant inside their own=
=20
fence.  So we do not know how California can resolve siting problems as it =
is=20
a quirk of the state that says give me lot more reasonably priced,=20
environmentally clean power but don=01,t build plants here in my state unle=
ss=20
they can meet the state=01,s tough economic and environmental criteria. =20
