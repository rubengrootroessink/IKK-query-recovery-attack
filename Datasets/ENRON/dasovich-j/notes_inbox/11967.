-----"Easily the most serious, well-run and
-----informative technology venture conference
-----series you can attend"
-----Technologic Partners' Outlook Conference attendee,
-----June 2001

Dear Jeffrey:

As a VentureWire reader, you know that the internet has
become an essential component of everyday life for both
businesses and consumers, despite recent investment
challenges. Though some dot-commerce plays face market
disfavor and wary private and public investors,
internet-based technologies and business models that
demonstrate a defensible ROI are still making real money.
And advances in internet technologies are almost
exclusively the domain of the venture backed start-up.

Read on, or take a moment to link to the URL below for
more details. VentureWire subscribers have a preferred
rate* for this conference - $1795 - which represents a
$400 saving on the full list price. All you need do is
register before July 27th, 2001 and ensure you enter the
code VWIO at the bottom of the registration form.
