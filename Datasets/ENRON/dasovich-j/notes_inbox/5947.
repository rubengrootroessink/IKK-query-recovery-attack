Review & Outlook
California Messes Up
What a lovely mess in California. Wholesale electricity prices are zooming,=
=20
power reserve margins are shrinking, the state's two biggest utilities are =
on=20
the verge of bankruptcy and its Governor has just gone, hat in hand, to vis=
it=20
Alan Greenspan, as though he could somehow make all of this awfulness go=20
away. California has created an unusual problem for editorial writers. Too=
=20
much blame! We are dizzy trying to decide how to allocate it. But here's ou=
r=20
best guess:
The stars. An unfortunate misalignment of the planets has zoomed prices=20
nationwide for an important raw material in electricity -- natural gas. And=
=20
in California, which depends on natural gas, higher prices have been=20
aggravated by an inadequate supply of electricity generation (more on this=
=20
later) and insatiable demand. Demand for electric power has been increasing=
=20
at almost triple the national rate of increase of 2% to 3% a year.
***

Unplugged=20

But the magic moment happened when the planets governing prices collided wi=
th=20
the need to shut down 25% of generation capacity a few weeks ago. This past=
=20
summer has been rough on electric power generation. Some of the plant=20
shut-downs were for maintenance and repair, some because plants had reached=
=20
their air-pollution limits for the year. In the past, California would just=
=20
gulp down some power from neighboring states in the Northwest. However, the=
=20
planetary influences in the Northwest have not been auspicious either. A=20
drought has left hydropower plants with less generating capacity; and colde=
r=20
weather, earlier than usual, has swelled demand.
The regulators. Four years ago, California regulators took their first -- a=
nd=20
so far, only -- step toward the deregulation of electric power. (Note: They=
=20
did not deregulate electric power, they vaguely made a pass at it.) Hence,=
=20
the wholesale price is relatively free to reflect market conditions in=20
generation, but the retail price to consumers remains frozen. That isn't=20
deregulation; it's California's popular Santa Claus theory of economics.
Thus, when wholesale prices started to rise sharply in June, utilities were=
=20
forced to buy higher priced power without being able to pass the increase=
=20
along to consumers. The mismatch has resulted in a multibillion-dollar=20
shortfall that has Southern California Edison saying it cannot pay its powe=
r=20
bills due January 4. "Consumer advocates" seem to think the utilities have=
=20
stashed money somewhere. Nonetheless, credit-rating agencies, looking at th=
e=20
current runaway debt situation for both Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern=
=20
California Edison, have downgraded their ratings, making it more expensive=
=20
for them to borrow.
These very same regulators then made a muddle when they tried to rush to th=
e=20
rescue. First, when the price of power rose, state regulators slashed the=
=20
price cap on wholesale prices to $250 from $750 per megawatt-hour. This of=
=20
course caused those who generate power to sell it to states without price=
=20
caps. So the regulators dropped the cap completely only to watch prices sho=
ot=20
up to an amazing $1,400 per megawatt-hour. Then the state regulators called=
=20
in the Feds. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered more price ca=
ps=20
and the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, ordered 75 Western wholesaler=
s=20
to continue selling to California utilities, despite the fact that they may=
=20
not be able to pay their bills.
The utilities. They not only agreed to the original, bogus deregulation=20
scheme, but they supported it. The scheme itself is a masterpiece of=20
short-term thinking.
At the time, energy prices were low, so having a plump fixed rate must have=
=20
looked mighty appealing. So the utilities cheerfully signed off on an=20
arrangement that provided them with fixed rates to consumers and mandated=
=20
that they buy power -- whose price was not fixed -- from a central exchange=
;=20
moreover, the scheme dictated that they could buy no longer than one day=20
ahead of need. No longer-term or side contracts permitted. In other words,=
=20
the utilities agreed to buy in a volatile commodity market without the tool=
s=20
allowing them to hedge.
Nor have the utilities shown much interest in investing in metering that=20
gives consumers a peek at what they are paying for electricity. Thus=20
consumers not only have no incentive to conserve, but have no idea of how=
=20
much their own use of electricity costs.
Consumers. Of course having no incentive to conserve -- (Why?! Our rates ar=
e=20
fixed!) -- they haven't. Indeed, what happened in San Diego this summer=20
provides a scary look into the consumer mind-set. San Diego Gas & Electric,=
=20
the state's third largest investor-owned utility, ended its rate freeze in=
=20
mid-1999. Rates dropped and everything seemed hunky-dory until last summer=
=20
when the price of power skyrocketed. As their electric bills went up,=20
consumers did, in fact, start conserving on their energy use. But they also=
=20
went berserk and demanded rates be frozen again. The state's Santa Claus=20
legislature accommodated.
The great state of California itself. If this were happening in any state=
=20
other than California, we'd be covered in sympathy. California, however, is=
=20
an advanced example of the peril of Nimby. It has the toughest environment=
=20
regulations. It has some of the toughest plant siting and permitting=20
procedures. In fact, things are made so tough in California that no new=20
substantial power generation has been added in the state in almost 15 years=
.=20
(Thus causing Nimby to be replaced by Banana -- build absolutely nothing=20
anywhere near anyone.)
The great state of California, which now imports 20% of its power, has just=
=20
assumed that states in the Northwest and Southwest would continue to supply=
=20
its needs. Too bad if those neighboring states need that power for=20
themselves; California just gets the Feds to order them to keep sending pow=
er=20
anyway.
***
Although blame has many receivers, in this case there is only one lesson to=
=20
be drawn: You can't have your cake and eat it, too. California ought to=20
recognize there are trade-offs. Either it deregulates electric power=20
completely and is prepared to take the occasional bad consequences of high=
=20
prices with the more frequent good consequences of lower prices or it=20
continues to shield users from price volatility and suffers from inadequate=
=20
supplies of power. Either it indulges its hyperaesthetic environmentalism o=
r=20
it builds the necessary power generation.
The coming weeks will be interesting. The federal order requiring Western=
=20
wholesalers to sell to California will expire; the California Public Utilit=
y=20
Commission will decide on whether to lift rates for consumers, the federal=
=20
courts will decide whether to accept FERC's price caps, the bills for power=
=20
for the two largest utilities will come due, and Standard & Poor's will=20
decide whether to lower the utilities' credit ratings into junk bond=20
territory. Optimists see the opportunity for some sort of resolution; we're=
=20
betting on seeing a wider opportunity to assign blame.
