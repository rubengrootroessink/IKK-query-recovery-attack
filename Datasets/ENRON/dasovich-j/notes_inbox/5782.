Students,

Most of you seem to have figured out that the first library workshops are
in January, not in June as I erroneously said in my email to you. Thanks to
the sharp-eyed students who brought this to my attention. The website does
have the month right!

I encourage all of you but especially the first year students to sign up
for these as they will ground you in using information resources
intelligently and efficiently.
