Subject: Secured Access to the CA Issues Intranet Site.

As you probably already know the California Deregulation/Power Issue Intranet 
site is now available at home.enron.com. However, there have been 
difficulties in accessing the secured document part of the site because of 
Windows 2000 migration issues. 

To access the secured documents there are two things you can do.

1. To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in
your user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network,
and then type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging
onto the network. 

2. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you
will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to
do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site
or not, it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your
internet password, go to this link Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES 
and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says "internet
password" and type in whatever password you would like, preferably your
current network login password. (In the internet password section you will
see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network
password.) Then go to the save and close button. You should then have access
 to the secured documents on the site.

Please let me know if you have any problems accessing this information. My 
number is 713-853-4382.
