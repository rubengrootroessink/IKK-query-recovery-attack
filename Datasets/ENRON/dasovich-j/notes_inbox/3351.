The CPUC decision on rate design should be used to develop the core rate 
comparison.  That decision has not been issued yet, but it may happen today.  
It would take the form as the schedules that have been previously used, but I 
think we can use a more summarized version of it.

With regard to calculation of the transmission component, I agree that the 
T&D rate for core, if allocated on a system average basis is understated.  
Reviewing some data filed by PG&E in the rate design hearing, I suggest that 
the T&D component be factored up by 1.25.  This is based on the average T&D 
component for PG&E's "core" customers to the average system T&D rate 
component.  Similar information was not available for SCE and San Diego, but 
suggest it could be used as a proxy.
