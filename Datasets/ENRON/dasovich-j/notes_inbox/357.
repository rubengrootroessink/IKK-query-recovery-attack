Rick --

The information below is very helpful for Government Affairs across the 
country.  I have a few other questions to support our advocacy:  

1. How much of our new power plant development is not subject to Building & 
Construction Trade Labor Agreements? 

2. Does Enron have any specific policies on whether or not we should use 
Union labor on our construction?  We recently established human rights and 
environmental policies, I am wondering if this applied to Unions?

3. Do you know if the pipelines are also using Union labor on their 
expansions?  Or maybe, who could tell me?

Thanks.

Jim

Sandy, I was again disapointed to hear that Union leaders are accusing Enron 
as being unfriendly to Labor.  In the last 20 months we have pursued 
construction on over 3000 MW of new generation capacity.  
Enron Development Activity subject to Building & Construction Trade Labor 
Agreements
California 
 500 mw - PDEF - FeB. 99
 750 mw - PEF - Feb. 2000
Indiana
 550 mw- Westfork Development -  Oct. 99
Illinois
 680 mw - Lincoln Energy Facility - Nov 99 
Tennessee
 540 mw -  Gleason Power I - Oct 99
Oregon 
 240 mw - Coyote II (planned January 2001)
 Ethynol Plant - Columbia County - Baugh Const. June 2000

Hopefully this will prove to be valuable information:  In addition to the 
direct agreements, Enron is pursuing third party projects in Chicago and New 
York City that will be subject to labor agreements.

If the parties are interested, feel free to have them contact me directly 
503-464-7548
Regards, Rick Johnson
