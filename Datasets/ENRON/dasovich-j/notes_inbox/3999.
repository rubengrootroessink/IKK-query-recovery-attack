I don't mind doing it, but I can't see duplicating effort, either! :--)
Either way...let me know,=20

While it won't directly hamper Davis' plan for solving the energy crisis, t=

worth of bonds this summer as part of his rescue package.=20
The bonds are intended to replenish the state treasury as well as finance=
=20
future power purchases. Since mid-January the state has committed $5.7=20
billion to buy electricity for troubled Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and=20
Southern California Edison. The commitment has chewed up a significant=20
portion of a budget surplus estimated by state Treasurer Phil Angelides at=
=20
nearly $6 billion; Davis and other state officials have pegged the surplus =
at=20
$8 billion.=20
Either way, it's clear that the power expenditures have left Wall Street an=
d=20
many state officials nervous. S&P and other rating agencies have had=20
California on a ratings "watch" for some time, signifying that a downgrade=
=20
was possible.=20
"The fact is that the state's credit rating and financial strength will=20
continue to be in jeopardy until the state's general fund is repaid for=20
energy costs," said Angelides, who's responsible for selling the bonds.=20
"We have to get the general fund out of the business of purchasing energy.=

(The budgetary drain) will begin to affect very dramatically the ability of=

Angelides spent much of the day urging legislators to pass legislation to g=

The Legislature already authorized the bonds, but Angelides said it must do=

developed for bond repayment. The bond will be repaid with money from a rat=

formula will siphon too much money from their coffers.=20
Angelides said lawmakers must quickly pass the new bill -- which requires a=

closing on a crucial $4.1 billion bridge loan. That loan is designed to tid=
e=20

=20
won't fork over the funds until they're assured the bonds will be sold,=20
because the state will use the bond proceeds in part to pay off that loan, =

said.=20
Ironically, the sale of those bonds won't be hurt by the S&P downgrade=20
because customer revenue instead of taxpayer dollars are being used to pay=

them off, analysts said.=20
"What's important for the bonds is how the (utility) rates are structured t=

But the downgrade will raise the interest rate on a host of other bonds=20

one-quarter of 1 percent, said chief economist Ted Gibson of the state=20

Energy price gouging might end up felony
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Democratic lawmakers this week will unveil a proposal to make energy price=
=20
gouging a felony -- punishable by stiff fines and possible jail time -- tha=
t=20
could be subject to the state's controversial "three strikes" law.=20
The measure, sponsored by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, would punish companies=
=20
that sell electricity or natural gas in California at "unjust or unreasonab=
le=20
rates."=20
"There is a tremendous amount of wealth that is being transferred from=20
California to five companies, mostly in Texas," Bustamante said. "If what=
=20
they're doing isn't illegal, it ought to be."=20
Though lawmakers are expected to introduce the measure Thursday, it already=
=20
has generated opposition from Republican lawmakers and constitutional=20
questions from legal experts.=20
Several aspects of the bill, AB 67x, are unresolved and could change.=20
But the intent will remain the same, and energy companies that take advanta=
ge=20
of Californians will still face significant penalties, said the bill's=20
author, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced.=20
According to a draft version of the bill and some proposed amendments, a=20
corporation, or a person with decision-making authority at the corporation,=
=20
would be found guilty of a felony if "they collude or conspire to manipulat=
e=20
the market to achieve unjust or unreasonable rates for electricity or natur=
al=20
gas."=20
A state or federal regulatory agency -- such as the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission -- would determine whether rates were unjust or unreasonable. If=
=20
that happened, the bill would open the door for prosecution by the state=20
attorney general or local district attorneys.=20
In addition, if found guilty, companies would be forced to pay restitution=
=20
and could face fines as high as 10 percent of their gross corporate assets.=
=20
Lawmakers are debating whether to make the felony a "three strikes" offense=
,=20
which requires 25 years to life sentences for some people convicted of thre=
e=20
felonies.=20
Though the provision was in an early draft of the bill, Cardoza said it's=
=20
"not likely" to show up in the final version.=20
"While I think this crime is every bit as abhorrent as going in and stealin=
g=20
money from a bank, we're going to have to figure out a little bit different=
=20
way of dealing with it," he said.=20
Even without the three strikes provision, the bill raises certain=20
constitutional issues, said Clark Kelso, a professor at the McGeorge School=
=20
of Law in Sacramento.=20
For instance, he said, it's not clear whether the state can legally base a=
=20
fine on an out-of-state company's gross assets.=20
And the measure, which requires a two-thirds vote for passage, already has=
=20
generated Republican opposition.=20
"To the extent this bill is onerous toward power producers, it may deter th=
em=20
from selling here rather than risk fines and prison," said James Fisfis, a=
=20
spokesman for the Assembly Republican Caucus. "We haven't seen the details,=
=20
but it sounds like it may be a piece of legislation that goes too far."=20

Dan Walters: It's time for politicians to be honest about the energy crisis


(Published April 25, 2001)=20
Gov. Gray Davis is continuing to tell Californians that he's on top of the=
=20
state's energy crisis and, as he said at one gathering last week, "in three=
=20
years, this problem will be a distant memory." Fat chance. All major aspect=
s=20
of the situation are growing worse, not better, minute by minute.=20
Politicians took over the crisis in January as the state's major utilities=
=20
exhausted their cash reserves and lines of credit. Davis began what he said=
=20
then would be a short-term emergency program of power purchases to keep=20
electrons flowing into homes and businesses.=20
From that moment forward, the situation has steadily deteriorated, moving=
=20
toward a three-pronged disaster: severe summer blackouts, the bankruptcy of=
=20
the utilities and sharply escalating power bills. With the bankruptcy filin=
g=20
by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and decisions by Davis and the state Public=
=20
Utilities Commission to begin ratcheting up utility rates, two of the three=
=20
negative scenarios are now in place. And everyone involved in the crisis=20
expects blackouts this summer as demands for power soar and supplies dwindl=
e.=20
The Davis strategy, if there is one, is to continue the state's massive pow=
er=20
purchases while negotiating longer-term and presumably cheaper supply=20
contracts, encourage conservation, help utilities pay off their debts by=20
selling their intercity transmission system to the state and tapping=20
ratepayers, and build more power plants to ease the supply crunch.=20
Currently, the governor is touting his deal with Edison International, pare=
nt=20
company of Southern California Edison, to sell its portion of the power gri=
d=20
and is working on a similar deal with Sempra, the parent of San Diego Gas &=
=20
and Electric. But PG&E's bankruptcy filing casts doubt on the viability of=
=20
the cash-for-grid concept, and legislators, particularly Davis' fellow=20
Democrats, are very skeptical of the Edison deal.=20
Clearly, Davis rushed into the Edison deal just three days after PG&E made=
=20
its bankruptcy filing, in hopes of erasing the political stain of the latte=
r=20
action, but its provisions are being labeled a bailout by critics. It place=
s=20
only a token financial burden on Edison International while guaranteeing th=
e=20
profitability of its utility subsidiary by charging its customers whatever =
is=20
required to cover its costs and past debts.=20
Meanwhile, the state is spending -- by Davis' own account -- about $70=20
million a day or $2 billion-plus a month on spot power purchases, paying=20
roughly five times what consumers are being charged at the retail level. An=
d=20
the futures market for power indicates that wholesale power prices will jum=
p=20
50 percent by midsummer; higher prices and greater purchases could increase=
=20
the drain on the state treasury to as much as $5 billion a month.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides is desperately trying to arrange a bridge lo=
an=20
to relieve pressure on the state's rapidly vanishing reserves, but Wall=20
Street is reluctant to lend without a fuller explanation of what's happenin=
g=20
and a specific authorization from a suspicious Legislature. Meanwhile,=20
bankers are sending strong signals that the state government is becoming as=
=20
poor a lending risk as the utilities.=20
Davis, for some reason, is unwilling to declare this situation the emergenc=
y=20
that it is truly becoming -- one that could take a toll on human life if=20
major blackouts shut down air conditioners, respirators and traffic lights.=
=20
He insists on issuing his periodic -- and wholly unrealistic -- assurances=
=20
that things will turn out all right, even declaring to reporters on Tuesday=

"20 minutes" with a rate hike, but refused to do so.=20
While addressing the California Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Davis said=

that the long-term contracts will spread the cost of buying power over a=20

"If they go into bankruptcy, the state will be buying power for three or fo=

?????Credit ratings help determine how much states and other borrowers have=

?????The state Treasurer's Office concluded in a preliminary estimate that =

?????"All California bond holders are going to lose value in their bonds=20
because the state's credit has been downgraded," said John Fitzgerald,=20
managing partner of Seidler-Fitzgerald, a Los Angeles municipal debt=20

?????The downgrade most affects investors who want to sell their bonds now,=

almost certain to get the face value when their securities reach maturity,=
=20
because the state is unlikely to miss any interest payments or otherwise=20
default on its bonds, traders said.
?????S&P analysts said the state's continuing surplus and "deep and diverse=

?????Still, the downgrade places California below most other states on S&P'=

Louisiana has a lower rating, at A-minus, according to Bloomberg News.=20

they may downgrade California's bonds. Fitch Inc. said last week that it wa=

?????State Treasurer Phil Angelides has been pleading with lawmakers to pas=

$15 billion by year's end, according to the governor.
?????The consequences of a downgrade are profound, Angelides said, noting=
=20
that it took California years to overcome the downgrades spurred by the=20
recession of the early 1990s.
?????"It is critical that the Legislature act immediately to clearly=20
establish our legal authority to sell bonds and replenish the state's gener=
al=20
fund," Angelides said.
?????California began buying massive quantities of electricity in January=
=20
because the state's three major investor-owned utilities could no longer=20
afford to do so. Since then, the state has been purchasing roughly one-thir=

to state officials.
?????Under a plan approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Davis,=

?????The bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state's large=

Price Controls Spark Deja Vu=20

Energy: The specter of Richard Nixon's actions 30 years ago hangs over=20
current debate on how to check the state's surging power costs.=20

By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer=20

?????A debate now rages in California over whether price controls should be=
=20
adopted to stem the state's soaring power costs and help consumers who are=
=20
bracing for huge spikes in their electric bills.
?????But price controls are one of the most controversial actions in=20
economics--and in politics, for that matter. And now the caps are more in=
=20
dispute than ever because they run counter to the nation's move over the la=
st=20
two decades to deregulate more and more industries, from airlines to=20
railroads to energy.
?????Yet California is a good example of deregulation gone haywire, so=20
controls are again being demanded by lawmakers, consumer advocates and othe=
rs=20
as a way to check surging prices. On the other side is a chorus of critics=
=20
who ridicule price caps as being ineffective and, at times, making matters=
=20
worse for consumers.
?????Case in point: the Golden State itself, which tried last summer to use=
=20
temporary price caps to keep a lid on skyrocketing wholesale electricity=20
prices.
?????Critics claim that the caps drove power sales out of state, thus=20
widening the imbalance between supply and demand, reinforcing the existing=
=20
shortages and contributing to this winter's rolling blackouts.
?????But defenders of the caps note that the dysfunctional California marke=
t=20
had no way to self-correct. The utilities couldn't simply refuse to buy=20
electricity in the face of higher prices, and with no price ceiling in sigh=
t,=20
something had to be done.
?????And now Gov. Gray Davis and others are again calling for temporary=20
controls until more electricity supplies can be added, especially as the=20
state enters the peak-power summer season. On Tuesday, Sens. Dianne Feinste=
in=20
(D-Calif.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) introduced legislation that would impo=
se=20
price controls on wholesale energy throughout 11 Western states.
?????Mindful of the controversial history of controls, Feinstein and Smith=
=20
stressed that the caps would last only through March 1, 2003. But they also=
=20
argued that the economic damage to industries and consumers from escalating=
=20
power costs would exceed any harm caused by price controls.
?????"I have a strong preference for markets, but it's a mistake to believe=
=20
that we have a free market when it comes to energy," said Smith, the only G=
OP=20
co-sponsor of the legislation.
?????Their bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whi=
ch=20
regulates U.S. wholesale electricity prices, either to impose a regional=20
price cap or institute a rate schedule for each power generator, tying the=
=20
price of electricity to the cost of producing it.
?????Coincidentally, FERC today is expected to decide on various other=20
proposals to again limit California's power costs--but without explicitly=
=20
stating that the plans include price controls. Why? Because the Bush=20
administration and FERC Chairman Curt Hebert Jr., among others, are on the=
=20
record as adamantly opposing price caps.
?????That's not surprising. Price controls often are tagged as a liberal=20
maneuver that flies in the face of conservatives' free-market ideology. Yet=
,=20
ironically, hanging over the California debate is the legacy of a Republica=
n=20
president who was the last one to mandate price controls on a nationwide=20
level: Richard M. Nixon.
?????The late president took that rare step 30 years ago this August to try=
=20
to quell inflation and spark an economic rebound. His actions were so=20
dramatic that they are still invoked by those wanting to criticize or, in=
=20
some cases, endorse setting limits on prices.
?????"What he did is almost larger than life now," said Shannon Burchett,=
=20
chief executive of RiskLimited Corp., a strategic consulting firm in Dallas=
.
?????Nixon's controls were the most far-reaching since World War II, when=
=20
prices were capped so that profiteers couldn't reap huge sums for scarce=20
commodities being used for the war and simultaneously rationed at home.
?????In most cases, price controls have been much less sweeping and targete=
d=20
at specific products or services. They don't always involve changing the la=
w,=20
either. In 1962, President Kennedy publicly rebuked the then-U.S. Steel Cor=
p.=20
and its chairman, Roger Blough, for starting an industrywide move to raise=
=20
steel prices. The price hikes were rolled back a few days later.
?????Since Nixon, price controls have become rarer as industries that were=
=20
once regulated--which means their prices were government-controlled--have=
=20
been deregulated.
?????So it is in California, where electric utilities' prices were controll=
ed=20
for decades until the state's deregulation law in 1996. But now that the la=
w=20
has been blamed for the soaring wholesale prices, power shortages, crippled=
=20
utilities and the need for a huge jump in ratepayers' costs, some again wan=
t=20
price controls on electricity until the crisis eases.
?????Which brings everyone back to Nixon.

?????Some Nixon Controls Were Lifted by Reagan
?????"I've heard people make the analogy to what happened . . . when Nixon=
=20
put on controls," but in California "this is fundamentally different," said=
=20
Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator,=
=20
which oversees most of the state's electricity grid.
?????"When you get into a situation of shortage [of supplies], there is=20
really no restraint at all on prices," said Florio, who said he normally=20
prefers unfettered markets but also defended the state's caps last summer.=
=20
Such government intervention "on a temporary basis is better than nothing,=
=20
but I don't think it's ideal."
?????The reverberations from Nixon's fiat aren't just felt in California=20
either. When New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently proposed more stringe=
nt=20
controls on wholesale electricity costs in New York state, critics promptly=
=20
pointed to Nixon's controls. "They were a disaster," one columnist wrote.
?????Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was in the private=
=20
sector in the early 1970s, turned down several requests to take high-level=
=20
White House jobs in part because he was disgusted with Nixon's price contro=
ls.
?????Many economists and historians also judge Nixon's controls as a mistak=
e.=20
But some maintain that his decision--which began with a 90-day freeze on=20
prices, wages and rents--wasn't entirely a failure and even provided "shock=
=20
value" that, for a while at least, arrested higher inflation.
?????In addition, part of Nixon's move involved taking the dollar off the=
=20
gold standard--which in effect meant its price was controlled--and letting =
it=20
float in value against other major currencies. And that, many believe, is t=
he=20
base upon which today's global financial markets operate.
?????Others disagree.
?????"There really isn't an example of where they've [price controls]=20
worked," said Robert Goldberg, a senior fellow at the National Center for=
=20
Policy Analysis, a nonpartisan think tank in New York.
?????"Controls always lead to an underproduction" of the commodity involved=
=20
because producers don't have any incentive to spend more on additional=20
output, he said. When the caps ultimately are lifted, prices typically soar=
=20
anyway as producers move to quickly recoup the profit they lost when the=20
controls were in place, Goldberg added.
?????Others note that although most of Nixon's price controls lasted only a=
=20
couple of years, various forms of controls over crude oil and natural gas=
=20
lasted for another decade until they were removed by President Ronald Reaga=
n.
?????In the meantime, the controls--aggravated by embargoes and other suppl=
y=20
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--distorted the fr=
ee=20
market for energy, critics say. The controls kept U.S. oil prices=20
artificially low, which in turn kept demand for oil high, giving OPEC more=
=20
power over world production and prices in the 1970s, they contend.
?????Nonetheless, proponents keep calling for controls when prices for=20
certain items seem to be spiraling out of control.

?????Critics Say Controls Worsen the Problems
?????President Clinton's massive health-reform proposal in the early 1990s=
=20
included price controls on drugs. But the idea set off howls of protest fro=
m=20
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and ultimately the entire=
=20
proposal was shelved. Consumer advocates and others also demanded federal=
=20
controls on rising cable TV rates in 1997 and 1998, again contending that t=
he=20
cable operators were hiking prices at a much faster rate than inflation.=20
Cable firms were allowed to keep passing certain costs on to their=20
subscribers, but specific price caps weren't enacted.
?????But proponents of temporary price controls on California power emphasi=
ze=20
that electricity isn't in the same category as an airplane seat, steel or=
=20
other commodities that don't have to be bought if the price soars too high.
?????"In soybeans maybe the market can adjust quickly" to changes in supply=
=20
and demand, "but in electric generation in California it can't," said Flori=
o,=20
who also serves as an attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer=
=20
group. "For most products, one of the ways prices get determined is if buye=
rs=20
refuse to buy when the price gets too high. But that's generally not an=20
option for people when it comes to electricity."
?????Critics of California's attempt to cap prices last summer said the=20
controls instead prompted many power suppliers to sell their electricity to=
=20
other states. That "actually made the tight-supply problem worse [in=20
California] by driving imports out of the state," the Bay Area Economic=20
Forum, a research group funded by regional business and government agencies=
,=20
said in a report last week.
?????Indeed, the temporary caps were basically abandoned by year's end to=
=20
keep enough electricity in the state.
?????Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor who heads the=
=20
Independent System Operator's market surveillance committee, said there are=
=20
ways to mitigate the state's power prices without having to set rigid=20
controls. One proposal: Have FERC require that generators supply 75% of the=
ir=20
expected future sales to California under long-term contracts at "just and=
=20
reasonable" prices set by the federal agency, he said.
?????That would "send the right [price] signal to suppliers to come into th=
e=20
state," Wolak said.
?????And because it will take time for California to get more of its own=20
power-generating plants up and running, the state's electricity crisis isn'=
t=20
unlike a natural disaster in which "normal public service is disrupted" and=
=20
short-term controls serve a purpose, Florio said.
?????"Over time, market forces will work" and controls shouldn't be need, h=

said. "But does that mean we're supposed to pay $10,000 per kilowatt-hour=

Davis Names Executive to Speed Construction of Power Plants in State=20

Energy: Richard Sklar headed a building firm and worked for Clinton in=20
Bosnia. Governor sees the crisis abating by fall.=20

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--With temperatures rising and electrical supplies strained,=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis on Tuesday tapped a former Clinton administration official=
=20
and executives from major construction firms to help speed completion of=20
power plants.
?????Davis, who predicted that the worst of the energy crisis will abate by=
=20
the fall, announced that he has retained Richard Sklar, 67, former presiden=
t=20
of a construction firm, to head a team that will help accelerate the buildi=
ng=20
of power plants.
?????Speaking to business leaders at a California Chamber of Commerce=20
convention in Sacramento, Davis said Sklar's job will be "to make sure ther=
e=20
are no hurdles [and] to cut red tape."
?????"Richard Sklar knows electricity," Davis said. "He knows how to find=
=20
megawatts."
?????Former President Bill Clinton sent Sklar to the Balkans in 1996 to try=
=20
to help resolve the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sklar arrived in Sarajevo to=
=20
find that power was on for only two hours a day and set about expanding=20
electricity generation.
?????In an interview, Sklar said his father was a mechanical engineer who=
=20
designed power stations.
?????"This power world is my world," Sklar said, adding that he had an=20
electric car and solar panels in the mid-1970s.
?????This Feb. 8, Davis announced at a news conference that he was appointi=
ng=20
Larry Hamlin, a vice president of Southern California Edison, as his=20
"construction czar." Hamlin's job was to speed power plant construction.
?????Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said that Hamlin's stint was temporary a=
nd=20
that the executive must return to Edison. Sklar's contract is for a longer=
=20
period, Salazar said, but it is unclear how long.
?????Sklar is being retained as a consultant, paid $100,000 initially. Othe=
r=20
firms, Salazar said, are loaning employees as volunteers. Joining Sklar wil=
l=20
be representatives of the engineering and construction firms Bechtel, URS=
=20
Corp. Engineering, Fluor Daniel, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, and =
A.=20
Teichert & Sons. At least one Bechtel subsidiary is involved in power plant=
=20
construction in California.
?????"There is no conflict of interest," Sklar said, adding that no one in=
=20
the group will have authority to decide who gets contracts.
?????A mechanical engineer, Sklar was president of the San Francisco-based=
=20
construction management firm O'Brien Kreitzberg Inc. Sklar's firm also=20
oversaw construction of the Metro Rail Green Line in Los Angeles and the=20
rebuilding of the Los Angeles Central Library.
?????He was also chairman of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission=

in URS, one of the firms that will loan employees to Sklar's team.
?????"He's very competent," said state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton=

(D-San Francisco) of Sklar, whom he met in 1972. "He's a very good problem=
=20
solver and he brooks no nonsense. . . . He's a renaissance man. He loves=20
music, he loves politics and he's a gourmet cook."
?????Sklar has also displayed a sense of humor, once donating to San=20
Francisco Zoo two capybaras, rodents the size of a hog. He named one Quenti=

senator who is now a Superior Court judge.
?????"I'm 67; I've made all the money I need to make," said Sklar, who owns=

?????"My reputation is what's going to be at stake in this, not the=20
governor's," he said. "I have a 40-year history of delivering--and that's=

what I'm going to do. I don't like to lose."
?????As Davis announced Sklar's appointment, one of the governor's top ener=

advisors, John Stevens, resigned, effective Friday. The governor praised=20
Stevens as a tireless worker.
?????Stevens worked on several energy-related tasks, among them Davis'=20
efforts to keep utilities out of bankruptcy. Davis appointed him for a day =
in=20
January to the state Public Utilities Commission, on which he cast a key vo=

to raise rates.
?????The state's power grid operators declared a Stage 2 emergency Tuesday=

Power Plant Emits Tons of Fumes=20

Round-the-clock operation of old generators in Glendale and elsewhere=20
produces more than twice the old limits of pollution.=20

By JEAN GUCCIONE, Times Staff Writer=20

?????For the past five weeks, Glendale's Grayson power plant has been=20
belching a half-ton of pollutants into the air almost daily, more than twic=

previous limits.
?????The same is true for many of the other 14 power plants in Southern=20
California as the "haves" generate power, sometimes round-the-clock, for th=
e=20
"have-nots."
?????The generators, some of them nearly 50 years old and once considered t=
oo=20
dirty for regular use, now keep electricity flowing to fellow residents=20
around the state. And those living downwind are subjected to twice as much=

air pollution as before California's energy crunch.
?????Not every Glendale resident is happy.
?????"You don't want anyone to get stuck with a rolling blackout, but we ge=

plants at a nursery across the street from the power plant. "It is a tough=
=20
decision."
?????Not so for Ignacio Troncoso, director of Glendale Water & Power. "Ther=

is a pretty decent trade-off, helping our neighbors in the state to keep=20
their lights on," he said.
?????A USC specialist warned that increased power plant emissions raise the=

risks of asthma and other lung ailments in the young and old.
?????"There is a potential for more emergency room visits, more people seei=

their doctors and more hospitalizations this summer," said Dr. Henry Gong,=
=20
professor of medicine and a specialist in the health effects of air polluti=
on.
?????With extended hours, the Glendale generators are emitting as much as 9=
95=20
pounds of pollutants into the air during peak demand, more than double the=
=20
old limit of 390 pounds a day, city and air-quality officials said.
?????The other 14 power plants in Southern California also have more than=
=20
doubled their overall emissions, according to preliminary figures from the=
=20
South Coast Air Quality Management District. As a group, the plants emitted=
 a=20
total of 2,045 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxide in the first three month=
s=20
of 2001, compared with 905 tons for the same period last year.
?????The AQMD hearing board on Tuesday eased pollution controls so Glendale=
=20
may continue to generate excess electricity for sale to the energy-starved=
=20
state. Under the plan, Glendale may run three of its old steam boilers=20
around-the-clock to meet the state's energy demand. Usually, these boilers,=
=20
hidden behind a tall brick wall, sit idle except during the peak summer=20
demand because they are inefficient and costly.
?????Glendale, like Burbank and the Los Angeles Department of Water and=20
Power, continues to produce electricity at its city-owned plant. The three=

cities opted against participating in a scheme of deregulation, a decision=

that has shielded their residents, by and large, from the huge utility rate=
=20
hikes and rolling power outages experienced elsewhere. But they also will=

contribute to easing the state's energy emergency in the dirtier air they=

will be forced to breathe.
?????Air-quality officials said power plants contribute just about 3% of th=

900 tons of pollution emitted into the air daily, with about 70% of the=20
pollution coming from vehicles, not factories. And in recent years, many of=

the region's municipal power generators have been updated with=20
pollution-control devices that reduce emissions.
?????Glendale's three steam generators, built between 1953 and 1963, are=20
inefficient by today's standards, but they are 85% cleaner since the city=

pumped millions of dollars into upgrades. They will be even cleaner, city=

officials say, with more retrofitting.
?????Under the plan, Glendale must reinvest profits from energy sales,=20
estimated at $3 million to $5 million this year, in equipment to reduce=20
future emissions at the plant and in community-based programs, such as mobi=
le=20
asthma clinics and programs to reduce school bus emissions.
?????The city plans to sell as much as 50 megawatts of power, enough to ser=
ve=20
50,000 homes. Under the decision Tuesday, pollution limits resume Jan. 1,=
=20
2002, or when the energy emergency ends.
?????In Los Angeles, power officials said they don't expect to exceed AQMD=
=20
caps, because they are adding pollution controls at two of the city's four=

power plants. Although they will produce more electricity, they should not=

d=20
Angelina Galiteva, LADWP's director of strategic planning.
?????"We will have much cleaner equipment in place by June," she said.
?????Even the environmentalists are trying to balance the risks.
?????"We realize we have a problem this summer. We have to run these plants=

said Sheryl Carter, a senior policy analyst for the National Resources=20
Defense Council.
?????Carter said natural-gas-powered generators, like the ones in Glendale,=

Power Plant Plan Worries Neighbors=20

Energy crisis: Regulators will decide next week whether to allow Huntington=

?????On Hula Circle in Huntington Beach, families have tried to live with=

?????State regulators will decide next week whether to allow the company to=

taking what residents fear will be a heavy toll on them.
?????It's one of several proposals to restart or build new power plants in=

the wake of the power crisis using a "fast track" process that allows the=

projects to go forward before environmental and pollution studies are=20
completed.
?????"The plant is so close. We want to know if it is impacting our kids in=

ways we won't know about until 10 years from now," said Janette Mortimer, w=

closest to the plant.
?????Already, residents say, the AES plant is casting a mightier shadow.=20
There are the ear-ringing rumbles and roars. There are the mysterious plume=
s=20
of smoke that waft over the neighborhood. Then there is the grime that seem=

never to go away.
?????If the California Energy Commission approves the permit for AES, the=

facility could run at full capacity for the first time in memory. Officials=

said the plant's previous owner, Southern California Edison, typically ran =
it=20
at 30% of capacity.
?????AES could be allowed to run the four gas-fired boilers and a "peaker"=

unit whenever California hits a Stage 3 alert--which is expected to happen=
=20
often this summer. The "peaker" plant alone is powered by eight jet=20
engines--and sounds like it.
?????Currently, only two boilers are operating.
?????But residents say they are most worried about the air they breathe and=
=20
the water they swim in.
?????Under the fast-tracking process designed to get more electricity for t=

state as soon as possible, several key environmental questions have yet to =
be=20
studied.
?????Scientists studying the cause of ocean pollution that closed much of=

Huntington Beach's shoreline in the summer of 1999 said that the plant, alo=

?????AES Inc. will pay $1.5 million to further study the issue, but the=20
research won't be complete for some time.
?????"So much is uncertain," said Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley=20
Dettloff. "These are big, big things."
?????For now, residents say they are bracing for more noise, smoke and=20
disruption.
?????To begin with, AES' proposal calls for 20 hours a day of nonstop=20
construction to get the two mothballed generators in service by July.
?????Then there are the sizzling summer temperatures. Residents usually ope=
n=20
their windows to let the ocean breezes cool their homes. But the noise and=

smells from the plants may make that impossible.
?????"It's going to be bad. There's no escape," said Bryan Visnoski.
?????The plant has towered over the Huntington Beach coastline for nearly 4=

years. The housing tracts came later, but most inhabitants of Hula Circle a=
nd=20
surrounding streets seemed to make peace with their industrial neighbor.
?????Some have installed double-paned windows to dampen the sound. Others=
=20
have remodeled their homes to obstruct ugly views. The Mortimers grew tall=

trees and trained vines past the windows.
?????The problems, they say, began with the energy crisis.
?????The plant was owned by Edison until 1998, when it was sold to=20
AES--California's largest private electricity producer--at the dawn of=20
deregulation.
?????The two gas-fired boilers that AES wants to restart have been dormant=
=20
since 1995 and were slated for demolition until the power crisis struck.
?????But a few months ago as rolling blackouts hit the state, Gov. Gray Dav=

?????Hulu Circle residents said the order has resulted in more hours of lou=

?????Whenever the peaker plant goes on, residents call the Air Quality=20

S&P lowers California's bond rating=20
First cut since '94 could cost taxpayers millions=20

Citing the "rapidly escalating uncertainty" surrounding the power crisis,=
=20
Standard & Poor's slashed California's credit rating yesterday for the firs=
t=20
time since 1994, when the state was still climbing out of a recession.=20
The downgrade -- and the energy debacle that led up to it -- will cost=20
taxpayers tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year by raising the=20
state's borrowing costs. Investors will probably see the market price of=20
California municipal bonds and bond funds decline further.=20
But the biggest blow may be to the state's ego. S&P downgraded the state's=
=20
general obligation bonds two notches -- to A+ from AA. The only other state=
=20
currently rated A+ is Hawaii. The only state with a lower credit rating is=
=20
Louisiana, according to S&P.=20
Most states are rated AA. Some states don't have a credit rating because th=
ey=20
don't have bonds.=20
California's credit rating is still "investment grade," which means it is n=
ot=20
expected to default on its bonds. However, the state's ability to repay its=
=20
debt "isn't as strong as it used to be," said Steve Zimmermann, a managing=
=20
director with Standard & Poor's. "This is a very speculative situation."=20
States hire companies like S&P to give them an independent credit rating wh=
en=20
they borrow money by selling bonds. The rating reflects the state's ability=
=20
to repay its debt in full, on time.=20
When they sell new bonds, states with lower credit ratings usually pay high=
er=20
interest than higher-rated states, to make up for the added risk.=20
A rating change does not affect the interest rate states pay on bonds that=
=20
have already been issued, but it can affect the price of bonds when they=20
trade on the open market among investors.=20
Yesterday's downgrade "reflects the mounting and uncertain cost to the stat=
e=20
of the current electrical power crisis, as well as its likely long-term=20
detrimental effect on the state's economy," S&P said in a news release.=20
"Given the large magnitude of the problem in relation to the size of fund=
=20
balances the state typically budgets, the capacity to pay debt service, whi=
le=20
still adequate, has been reduced."=20
In January, S&P placed the state's debt on "CreditWatch with negative=20
implications," a signal that it might lower the rating.=20
In an unusual move, S&P kept the state on CreditWatch after yesterday's=20
downgrade, which means the rating could fall even lower.=20
Zimmermann said S&P is keeping California on CreditWatch pending its abilit=
y=20
to sell $10 billion to $14 billion worth of bonds to reimburse the state's=
=20
general fund for past and future power purchases.=20
"If they did the bond issue, they'd replenish the fund, at least for the=20
short term. If they don't do it, then it's more of a concern," Zimmermann=
=20
said.=20
Unfortunately, the downgrade could make it harder for the state to sell the=
=20
bonds.=20
"If they could have gotten the deal done before the downgrade, they would=
=20
have had a stronger deal," said Kelly Mainelli, a municipal bond fund manag=
er=20
with Montgomery Asset Management.=20
California must obtain an investment-grade rating (BBB- or higher) on the=
=20
bonds before it can sell them.=20
Mainelli said California municipal bond prices have already fallen in=20
anticipation of a ratings cut. When prices fall, bond yields go up.=20
"The downgrade is the culmination of everything that's happened since early=
=20
December," he said.=20
In November, California municipal bonds yields were 0.4 to 0.5 percentage=
=20
points below the national average. Today, they're 0.1 to 0.2 percentage=20
points above the national average, and Mainelli thinks they could go up 0.1=
=20
to 0.2 percentage points more because of the downgrade.=20
The total difference -- about 0.7 percentage points -- doesn't sound like=
=20
much, but it adds up.=20
Last year, the state itself sold $4.6 billion in new bonds (excluding bonds=
=20
sold to replace existing bonds). If it sells the same amount this year, plu=
s=20
$12 billion in energy bonds, that 0.7 percentage point difference on $16.6=
=20
billion in bonds would cost the state $116 million a year in additional=20
interest costs.=20
Yesterday's downgrade only affected the state's general obligation bonds an=
d=20
others secured by the "full faith and credit of the state," such as the=20
California Health Facilities Construction Loan Insurance Fund (Cal Mortgage=
).=20
But the energy debacle could wind up costing other municipal bond issuers i=
n=20
California -- such as cities, counties, school and water districts -- more=
=20
money when they sell bonds. Although their ratings have not changed because=
=20
of the energy crisis, analysts say the yields on most California municipal=
=20
bonds have gone up, and will go up some more, as a result of the state's=20
downgrade.=20
"The values of all California bonds will be hurt by this downgrade, whether=
=20
they should be or not. Psychologically, it's just how the market reacts,"=
=20
says Richard Goldstein, a San Ramon financial planner.=20
Investors who have to sell their California bonds on the open market before=
=20
they mature may not get all their principal back. But investors who hold=20
their bonds until maturity will probably get paid in full, Goldstein said.=
=20
No matter how bad the energy crisis gets, most experts believe the state wi=
ll=20
continue making principal and interest payments on its bonds, even if it ha=
s=20
to raise taxes, cut expenditures or run a temporary deficit to do so.=20
"There's also the prospect at some point of federal help," Goldstein said.=
=20
"The federal government does not want California to default or even come=20
close.=20
Do you know what that would do to the national economy and the world=20
economy?"=20
California's bond-rating history=20
S&P cut its rating on California debt yesterday for the first time since=20
1994.=20

Will price caps deter investment, as federal regulators say?=20

(04-25) 00:43 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Some key power generators say=20
California's dearth of energy supplies, and its growing demand, make it a=
=20
good place to build more plants and sell more power in the years to come --=
=20
even if dreaded price caps are imposed.=20
``Regardless of what the (market) structure turns out to be, the state's=20
going to need electricity and it's going to need to buy it from somebody,''=
=20
said Bill Highlander, spokesman for San Jose-based Calpine Corp.=20
Calpine is investing about $4 billion in power plants over the next four=20
years that will generate 9,000 megawatts, enough for more than 6 million=20
homes. The state's current energy crisis ``hasn't really changed our plans =
or=20
our strategy,'' he said.=20
But Chief federal energy regulator Curtis Hebert says price caps on wholesa=
le=20
electricity will hinder, not help, California's energy crisis.=20
Energy wholesalers seeking higher prices than California is willing to pay=
=20
will invest in other states, warns Hebert, the chairman of the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission. And any regulations that cut into future profits wil=
l=20
scare away desperately needed new power plants, he says.=20
Eight of the 13 new power plants approved in California already are under=
=20
construction. Twelve more are under review, according to the California=20
Energy Commission, which approves power plants.=20
CEC spokesman Rob Schlichting said that's a huge boost over the last decade=
,=20
when uncertainty over the rules of deregulation -- not a threat of price ca=
ps=20
-- kept applications down. No companies have withdrawn plans to build plant=
s=20
since December.=20
``The only way price caps would scare away investment is if they were set s=
o=20
low you couldn't make a profit,'' Schlichting said. ``It's still a market=
=20
that people seem to want to come in and produce power for.''=20
Other companies still planning to invest in California include North=20
Carolina-based Duke Energy, which has two plants in the works, and=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy, which is negotiating with the state to sell=
=20
power on long-term contracts.=20
Reliant's spokesman, Richard Wheatley, wouldn't say whether price caps alon=
e=20
would inhibit them from building more plants. What he did say is that=20
California's power politics leave a lot of room for improvement.=20
The state has considered taking over power plants through eminent domain an=
d=20
implementing a windfall profits tax to take some of their earnings away.=20
Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering a bounty for any=20
information that could prove wholesalers worked together to drive up prices=
,=20
which could lead to more lawsuits and investigations.=20
If California wants to encourage construction, it's got to tone down its=20
vilification and stop adding more restrictions, Wheatley said.=20
``Whenever we go into an area and consider building a power plant, we have =
to=20
look at the economics of the facility, we have to look at the regulatory=20
situation, esoteric things like what the mindset is like,'' he said.=20
``California is not the easiest place in which to do business.''=20
Some power companies have invested so much in pipelines, gas reserves and=
=20
plants already under construction that it's folly to turn back now.=20
``We want to build in California, but we need to have regulatory stability =

Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., plan this we=

to introduce legislation urging FERC to impose a temporary price cap over t=

California and other troubled states a breather to make long-term decisions=
.=20
Feinstein's bill does not yet specify a price. Some economists say $150 to=

$250 per megawatt hour would be just and reasonable, yet provide generators=
 a=20
profit. Prices have gone as high as $1,500 for the same amount of power in=
=20
the past year.=20
Tying the price cap to the cost of making power could make it easier for=20
generators to swallow, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University =
of=20
California, Berkeley's energy institute. Such a cap would account for=20
variables such as the wildly fluctuating cost of natural gas used to genera=
te=20
much of the energy in California's power plants.=20
Price caps can be effective, but only if they are very carefully designed,=
=20
warned Frank Wolak, chairman of the Independent System Operator's market=20
surveillance committee. The ISO manages the state's power grid.=20
Set them too high, and companies will only bid that amount, saving little=
=20
money, Wolak said. Too low, and the generators could choose to sell elsewhe=
re=20
unless all other nearby states have the same price limits.=20
Also, capping the most expensive energy sales -- power sold on the spot=20
market at times of high demand -- won't lower prices for other key componen=
ts=20
of the state's energy supply, such as electricity bought for the next day's=
=20
power needs.=20
``Suppose you're paying $150 every single (megawatt) hour. That still puts =
us=20
in big trouble with wholesale energy costs,'' Wolak said.=20
The state already has spent $5.1 billion buying power for customers of=20
California's three largest investor-owned utilities, which lost their credi=

-- and thus their ability to buy power -- after paying sharply higher costs=
=20
for wholesale energy.=20
Borenstein said paying even $250 a megawatt hour is still preferable to the=

``This summer we are going to be truly short of power and at those times th=

FERC remains opposed to price caps, but after months of complaints, the boa=

One of Wall Street's top credit-rating houses has downgraded California's=

bonds because of the state's handling of the energy crisis, a move that cou=

Saying that mounting and uncertain power costs are likely to do lasting har=

to California's economy, New York-based Standard & Poor's on Tuesday lowere=
d=20
the state's credit rating on its ``general obligation'' bonds two notches,=

=20
of the state bond heap with only one state -- Louisiana -- rated lower.=20
Standard & Poor's said the rating could go lower if the state cannot resolv=
e=20
the power crisis.=20
The downgrade will cost California millions of dollars in coming years=20
because a lower rating makes it more expensive for the state to issue gener=
al=20
obligation bonds to finance projects such as school construction.=20
The interest on those bonds, which will rise from an estimated 5 to perhaps=
=20
5.25 percent, is paid from the state's tax-financed general fund. Although=
=20
the rating change doesn't apply technically to the different type of bond t=

Heightened urgency=20
``There's a sense of urgency that this problem has been escalating,=20

analyst for Standard & Poor's. ``This problem could move quickly.''=20
At least one bond expert said the downgrade was surprising.=20
``To me it's clear that S&P doesn't have much faith in this power-bailout=
=20
plan of the Legislature and the governor. To me that's the reason they did=
=20
it,'' said Zane Mann, publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor=20
newsletter.=20
No single new piece of information triggered the downgrade, Hitchcock said.=
=20
The major factor, he said, was simply spiraling costs and no long-term plan=
=20
for paying the bills. Last week Gov. Gray Davis said the state had been=20
spending $73 million a day to buy electricity, up from $45.8 million a day =
in=20
late March. Hitchcock said some energy traders suspect the actual costs are=

so-called ``credit watch,'' but only Standard & Poor's has downgraded. One=

Q&A with Gov. Gray Davis on energy issues=20
Gov. Gray Davis visited the Mercury News editorial board Monday. On the=20
subject of electricity, Davis talked about increasing the number of power=
=20
plants, the rejection of price caps by the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission, and the condition of the state's two largest utilities, Souther=
n=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Davis has proposed a deal to=
=20
rescue Edison, and the Legislature is considering it. PG&E has filed for=20
bankruptcy.=20
Here is a condensed version of Davis' remarks.=20
Q: What would you like to say by way of introduction about the state's=20
electricity problems?=20
Davis: There are really two problems. One is the amount of power available=
=20
and the other is the price of power.=20
In 2002, we'll have more megawatts on line, at least 5,000 more. By 2003,=
=20
we'll have a slight excess of power over demand. That's very important.=20
Because at the moment, we import 20 percent of our power. We have no=20
leverage. We are at the mercy of forces that show no mercy. That will never=
=20
change until we have more power than we need.=20
OK, price. As you know, the only entity that can influence the [wholesale]=
=20
price of electricity is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.=20
Deregulation surrendered the ability of the state to do that.=20
In 1999, this state for all power, including municipal power, spent roughly=
=20
$7 billion. In 2000, we spent $32.5 billion. I don't know what it will be=
=20
this year, but it will be substantially higher.=20
Through all this the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has refused to do=
 a=20
thing, zero, zippo. Lest you think I'm being partisan, that commission=20
consists entirely of Clinton appointees.=20
The final piece is the financial consequences of what's happened to date. I=
t=20
is our hope that if we can keep Southern California Edison credit-worthy an=
d=20
able to re-enter the power purchasing market Jan. 1, 2003, we can then go t=
o=20
the PG&E creditors committee [the generators to whom PG&E owes money] and s=
ay=20
to them: ``Look at the arrangement we made with Southern California Edison.=
=20
We believe that this is a far better deal than PG&E can give you.''=20
I think this is a fair plan. We get every electron that Edison's utility ow=
ns=20
committed for 10 years, at a cost-of-service basis. Under [current law] the=
y=20
could sell that next March at market rates. We got $400 million returned fr=
om=20
the holding company, a $3 billion investment in the transmission and delive=
ry=20
systems .?.?. a permanent easement on about 20,000 acres of environmental=
=20
property around all their hydro facilities.=20
Q: Do you have in mind a finished product for the changes that are happenin=
g=20
in the electric system? What will it look like in a couple of years?=20
Davis: It is my expectation that the utilities will be purchasing the power=
=20
entirely, commencing Jan. 1, 2003. Our goal is to get them back in business=
.=20
In addition to investor-owned utilities, I believe we also need a public=20
power authority. At some point I believe the private sector will say to=20
itself, ``I want to build new plants to replace the 40-year-old plants, but=
=20
do I really want to get the state to a 15 percent margin over supply, there=
by=20
reducing the value of the electrons I already own?'' If they do, God bless=
=20
them. But if they don't, at least we'll have the opportunity to build them=
=20
ourselves.=20
Once we have even a slight margin of capacity over demand, the spot market=
=20
prices will come down dramatically.=20
Q: You said in February that you could have solved the electricity problem =
in=20
20 minutes if you'd been willing to raise rates. Now, rates are going to be=
=20
raised. Should you have favored a rate increase earlier?=20
Davis: I should have been more specific. I should have said I could have=20
solved it in 20 minutes if I wanted to triple rates. I think the rate=20
increase I proposed is fair. It rewards people who are the most energy=20
efficient, the people who only use up to 130 percent of their baseline. The=
y=20
are approximately half the state. So half the state will see no rate=20
increase, beyond the 10 percent that everyone saw in January.=20
Q: Is the state willing to spend anything it costs to keep the lights on, o=
r=20
at some point, would it stiff the generators and just say we will accept a=
=20
blackout?=20
Davis: We have to provide power. There are many people who have medical=20
devices that have to keep running. Blackouts can cause deaths, traffic=20
accidents, all kinds of calamities that I wouldn't want to happen.=20
I'm reluctant to tell the generators we'll pay any price, so I'm not going =
to=20
say we'll pay absolutely any price, but my bias obviously is to find a way =
to=20
keep the lights on.=20
Q: When will you reveal how much electricity the state has bought, from wha=
t=20
companies, at what prices and what this will cost the state this year and i=
n=20
coming years?=20
Davis: We'll reveal an awful lot of information as soon as the bonds go to=
=20
market. [The state plans a bond issue to cover the upfront costs of=20
purchasing electricity.] That information has to be made public. That will=
=20
probably be in less than two months.=20
Believe me, I don't like going around getting beat up for hiding informatio=
n.=20
I'm doing it for one reason only, which is that I know every additional edg=
e=20
I give the generators will result in higher prices for customers.=20
Q: There's an impression that the state budget is being drained by the powe=
r=20
crisis. Is that right?=20
Davis: The simple answer to that is no, because the state will be fully=20
reimbursed with interest as soon as these bonds are sold.=20
At the moment, in the short term, it is crowding out other spending. But I=
=20
think everyone understands that's a temporary phenomenon, until the state i=
s=20
reimbursed by bonds that are repaid over time through the rate structure th=
at=20
I proposed.=20
Q: Would it be your pledge that ratepayers, not taxpayers, will fully repay=
=20
the state's cost in purchasing electricity?=20
Davis: That is the assumption underlying these bonds. That's right as it=20
relates to electricity, but obviously the conservation incentives came out =
of=20
the general fund.=20
Q: Have you talked to President Bush about this?=20
Davis: I hear all these rumors as to why the Bush administration doesn't wa=
nt=20
to be helpful, but this state, and particularly this region, has been=20
disproportionately helpful in America's economic growth and technological=
=20
productivity. If he wants America to grow, it behooves him to keep Californ=
ia=20
growing. To date, I think it's fair to say that of my public requests,=20
President Bush has been responsive to all but the price caps.=20

Power Companies and Regulators Must Take Steps To Avoid Spread of=20
California Power Virus/ Andersen Analysis



WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
A "new virus spawned
in California" poses formidable challenges requiring new strategies on
the part of power companies, regulators and policymakers to contain
and reverse its damage, according to "Energy Crisis in the Western
United States: Lessons for Navigating Regulatory and Market
Minefields," a new Andersen report released today.


"The implications for the development of competitive energy
markets go far beyond the Western United States," Andersen's national
utility practice head Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing.
"Unfortunately, California has taught the nation that regulatory and
political barriers can create and sustain an energy crisis."


"California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity
industry, if not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously
and profoundly impact all market participants. To be effectively
managed, these risks need to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured
and monitored. When they are hidden or ignored, all parties can
potentially suffer. A shared, integrated view of these risks, and a
strategy for their assumption and management, is critical to avoiding
rapid value destruction within the energy market," Smith said.


An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside
California, also released at the briefing, indicates most utility
companies believe they inoculated themselves against the California
virus so that it is unlikely to affect their operations beyond slowing
the pace of deregulation and increasing investor scrutiny. However,
based on the potential implications it sees of the California
situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots are advisable
for power companies and regulators. "To deliver reliable service at a
predictable cost in today's environment, companies must focus on
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships
between suppliers, customers, employees and investors -- while working
with government officials and regulators to chart a smoother
transition to a deregulated power market," according to Smith.


Eight Implications


The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications
emanating from the Western energy crisis that are shaping the
longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional and national
economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution:


1.  Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk -- Tension and


differences between state and federal regulators raise the


specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum


California's investor-owned utilities have faced. If federal


initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain


regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators


pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should


materialize? Tensions between state and federal regulators


over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or


abandon retail competition.


As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating,


the prudence principles that state regulators have used for


many years may have to be changed. For example, if FERC and


RTO monitors determine that deregulated wholesale markets


operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be


considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed


into state-regulated retail rates without regard to the


prudence principles state regulators have used for years.


Therefore, utilities' traditional burden of proving costs are


or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.


2.  Reduced investor confidence -- Prior to deregulation,


stringent prudence review and disallowance of generation costs


in the rate base made regulatory risk largely uncontrollable,


killing IOU interests in most new investment. A major purpose


of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk


could be managed, but California's political and regulatory


environment provides only a limited ability to manage risks.


The confidence and perceptions needed to support investment


decision-making will be slow to return given the approach of


the state to remedy the crisis.


3.  Contributing factor in economic softening -- Uncertain energy


reliability and higher costs can drive-out marginal


businesses, cause healthy companies to constrain expansion,


and lead new entrants to question whether to make new


investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to


inflation pressures and may slow economic growth.


4.  Increased pressure on the Western grid -- Even as capacity


increases and demand reductions work to resolve the California


crisis, these solutions have long-term implications for the


Western Grid. These include a realistic possibility of


California becoming an "energy island" as a result of


near-term reduction in available regional resources for export


to California; increased emphasis on security control to


protect against overall Western grid failure as sub-regions


have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen locally


available supplies to bolster overall system reliability;


longer-term development of new plants using plentiful coal


resources and clean coal technology will alter the pattern of


imports into California; and the emergence of Mexico as a


major supplier to southern California and Arizona,


contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into


northern and southern markets.


5.  Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio


strategies -- For California investor-owned utilities,


unbundling has achieved neither the least-cost solution sought


by regulators nor value maximization targeted by investors.


This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management


strategies potentially involving generation, transmission,


power trading and marketing, and retail businesses in multiple


geographies serving multiple markets.


6.  Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development


restrictions -- California's retail price caps and multiple


explanations for the crisis have left accelerated siting


processes and environmental standards changes open to


challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting


application of new siting orders only to small generators


contributes to uncertainty and investor hesitancy.


7.  Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating


leverage -- Competitive markets compel participants --


suppliers, marketers, large industrial buyers, etc. -- to


strategically manage procurement as a critical value-driver.


Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential


of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the


sophistication of negotiations and contracts increases as


competitive markets evolve.


8.  Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new


technologies -- California's reliability and price challenges


have triggered a re-emergence of energy crisis measures from


the 1970s. End-users are investing in solutions they control,


and the distributed generation market is being aggressively


developed among large retailers, industrial users and


residential customers. This makes possible the development of


microgrids connecting consumers in local areas and related


changes in traditional grid systems, from modifications in


interconnection agreements to changing definitions of reserve


margins and system reliability.


Industry Executives' Response


Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a
combined market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in
revenues responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the
implications of the California power crisis for their companies and
for the industry. The survey, conducted between February 19, 2001 and
March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &amp; Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found
that the companies are observing the California situation carefully,
expect a slowing -- but not a turnaround -- of deregulation, and
believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target for the
changing environment:


--  Deregulation -- Nearly all executives believe recent


California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the


next five years for states that have not begun or finished


writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it will


cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many


states will review their legislation to assess their risk of


duplicating California's current situation and make any


changes necessary to avoid it.


--  National legislation -- Few executives suggest the situation


will initiate national energy policy/legislation; others


believe it will be a continuing issue but, because of


state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to pass any


comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring


timeline. Some expect additional state-level legislation.


--  Company strategies -- Most do not see any changes to their


business models or strategies for generation, distribution or


supply procurement as a response to the situation in


California. However, many have expanded their risk management


programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing


long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation


capacity, and started hedging with futures trades. Those


facing price caps are rethinking their stance on them.


--  Investor scrutiny -- Many executives indicate their


shareholders are aware of the situation and investors --


particularly institutional investors -- are more heavily


scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has


prompted retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism


of industry restructuring.


--  Transmission deregulation -- Many executives agree the


California situation will increase interest in FERC's regional


transmission organizations (RTO) deregulation effort.


Utility Company Action Items


Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a
potentially powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities
should bolster their basic preparedness with a variety of tactics --
or inoculations -- specifically aimed to combat a potential California
power virus, according to Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:


--  Improve procurement management and risk management


capabilities -- To manage exposure to volatile supply and


demand shifts, organizations must be sure that comprehensive


and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points, risk


limits and communications are in place.


--  Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures --


Companies and regulators must focus on communicating price


signals that create value for both the customer and the


provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures that more


closely tie the customer's price to the real cost of supply


will better signal the value of the service as well as


providing more accurate information upon which both end user


and supplier can make decisions.


--  Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies


-- In addition to new pricing strategies to help achieve and


maintain supply-demand equilibrium, companies must now focus


on employing more extensive and innovative demand side


management programs. These programs may offer significant


benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy


supplier.


--  Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent


jurisdictions -- Companies must take a broader view -- beyond


typical geographic market definitions -- of the economics of


generation and related business decisions in an increasingly


volatile market in which supply will follow the best prices.


--  Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new


generation capacity -- In the face of potential ongoing


generation capacity shortages, companies and regulators must


be prepared to move with a portfolio of strategies to meet


demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and


distributed generation. In addition, they should explore


efficiency-improving upgrades to existing facilities and seize


any opportunity to accelerate near-term construction plans.


--  Proactively address potential organizational disruption -- As


regulatory and economic changes continue to churn the industry


waters and companies adjust and/or restructure, they must be


highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and directly address


employees' concerns with information about the company's


future and theirs'.


Industry/Regulatory Lessons


There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric
power industry -- nationally and internationally -- should take away
from its first major domestic test case in deregulation and
restructuring, according to Andersen principal David O. Jermain:


--  Simplify market design.


--  Build a continuing role for regulators.


--  Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests.


--  Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions.


--  Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced


wholesale competition.


--  Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and


development.


--  Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals


and responses.

Soaring Temperatures Produce Call for Conservation;=20
California ISO Also Announces New Outage Notification System and On-call=20
Number



FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
As the mercury
climbs this week, the California Independent System Operator
(California ISO) is reminding consumers to curb their electricity use
in order to minimize the strain on the power grid. The first warm
spell of the season is expected to cause temperatures to jump 10
degrees, leading to a 2,000 megawatt increase in electricity
consumption -- the equivalent of two large power plants. The week
started out with a peak demand of 28,835 megawatts, but by tomorrow it
is forecasted to top 30,500 megawatts. This comes as hydroelectricity
resources (both Northwest and California) run low, more than 10,000
megawatts of power plants remain off line due to planned and unplanned
maintenance, and some 3,000 megawatts of Qualifying Facilities or
alternative energy suppliers are not operating.


The California ISO's renewed call for conservation precedes a
forecast of 90 degree highs in the inland areas that may tempt many
Californians to flip on air conditioners. For conservation tips --
such as using fans instead of air conditioners, setting thermostat at
78 degrees, etc. -- please see the California ISO's web site
www.caiso.com.


New Notification System:


With a challenging summer around the corner, the California ISO
wants to do all it can to bring information to the public as quickly
as possible. For that reason, a new notification system is being
brought on line. Media and the public can now access the Internet to
keep current if rotating blackouts are issued.


Navigation:


Visit www.caiso.com


Click on System Conditions for current information on rotating


outages (will appear only when activated) For previous outage


information (last hour, etc.), click on Market Notices, scroll to


bottom of page and click on Notice Log


The California ISO is also testing a new service to notify
newsrooms immediately by email should the ISO initiate electrical
emergencies (Stage One - Three) or rotating outages. If you would like
to participate, please email kwerst@caiso.com with a maximum of one
email address per newsroom.


Additionally, a single on-call media pager number has been
established: 916/815-0679. To make it easier on media, ISO
Communications will no longer be posting on-call schedules for media
spokespersons on the web site. Simply call the on-call pager after
hours.


News releases alerting the media to electrical emergencies will
continue, as will news conferences held on-site in Folsom and via
telephone. As a reminder, if you wish to visit the ISO control rooms
(in Folsom or Alhambra) always call ISO Communications first at
888/516-NEWS to make an appointment. Access to the control rooms may
be limited on certain days, depending on system conditions and/or
level of requests from media.
