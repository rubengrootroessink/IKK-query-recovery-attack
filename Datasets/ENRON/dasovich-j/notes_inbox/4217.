Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent (Update2)

     (Adds Enron boosts 2001 forecast in second paragraph.)

     Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales
almost quadrupled.
     Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents,
from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said. Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast
to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to
$1.75.
     First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from
$13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North
America by 90 percent. About one-fifth of the increase came from
the western U.S., where a California electricity shortage caused
power prices to surge.
     Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a
share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million,
or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-
earlier period.
     The Houston-based company was expected to make 45 cents a
share, the average estimate of analysts polled by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Estimates ranged from 43 cents to 47
cents.
     Earnings were released before the market opened. Shares of
Enron rose $2.14 to $59.44 yesterday. They have fallen 11 percent
in the past year.


USA: UPDATE 1-Dynegy earnings soar in first quarter.

04/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity supplier 
Dynegy Inc., which has been defending itself against allegations of 
overcharging for power sales in California, said on Tuesday its first-quarter 
earnings rose 73 percent, driven by a strong performance from its core energy 
marketing and trading business. 
Recurring net income jumped to $137.5 million or 41 cents per diluted share 
from $79.4 million or 26 cents in the first quarter of 2000. The company had 
already said on April 2 that it expected to report earnings per share of 
about 40 cents for the quarter.
First-quarter revenues rose to $14.2 billion from $5.3 billion, due in part 
to last year's acquisition of Illinova Corp., parent company of Illinois 
Power, a regulated power and gas distribution company serving 650,000 
customers. 
Dynegy produced and sold 26.1 million megawatt hours of electricity in the 
first quarter of 2001, a rise of 19 percent over the same period of 2000. 
But the volume of natural gas it marketed fell 1.7 percent to 11.4 billion 
cubic feet a day as lower European volumes outweighed gains in the United 
States. 
Houston-based Dynegy said it benefited during the quarter from supply and 
demand imbalances and energy market volatility which led customers to seek 
Dynegy's services to protect themselves against sharp swings in natural gas 
and power prices. 
Dynegy's stock more than tripled in value in 2000. So far this year its 
shares have fallen some 5 percent, reflecting broader stock market weakness 
and concerns about possible fallout from the California power crisis which 
has already led to rolling blackouts and a filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection by utility Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp.. 
CALIFORNIA POWER INTERESTS 
Dynegy has ownership stakes in 13,000 megawatts of U.S. electricity 
generating capacity, including a 50 percent stake in a joint venture that 
owns some 2,800 megawatts of capacity in California where wholesale prices 
have soared in recent months. 
In March the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered Dynegy and five 
other companies to refund California utilities for overpriced power sales 
unless they can justify their high prices. Dynegy has said its prices were 
just and reasonable. 
Dynegy has previously said that at the end of February 2001, it was owed some 
$265 million for power sales to California's troubled utilities and that it 
had set aside unspecified reserves to cover the risk of default on those 
payments. 
The company's Dynegydirect Internet-based trading platform, which was 
launched late last year, recorded nearly $9 billion in notional transaction 
value during the first quarter of 2001. 
Dynegy's fledgling broadband telecommunications business, which began 
operations in the second half of 2000, posted a first quarter loss of $11.6 
million. 
Dynegy has previously indicated it expects this business to become profitable 
in the second half of 2002. It is developing a 20,000 mile fiber optic cable 
network in the United States that is linked to a network of over 8,000 miles 
in Europe. 
Dynegy believes rapid growth in demand for broadband network capacity, which 
is capable of delivering far larger volumes of data than conventional copper 
cable, will ultimately lead to the trading of network capacity, or bandwidth, 
as a commodity. 
Like its hometown rival Enron Corp., Dynegy believes the marketing, trading 
and risk management skills it has honed in the deregulated U.S. wholesale 
natural gas and electricity markets will make it a leader in broadband 
marketing and trading. 
Recurring net income reported by Dynegy excluded certain one-time items in 
the first quarter and the same period of 2000. Net income including those 
items rose to $139.5 million or 41 cents per diluted share from $69 million 
or 23 cents per share.

Electricity Facilities Sprout Near Tiny Tennessee Town --- Merchant Plants 
Are Raising Question of Who Controls Nation's Power Grid

NUTBUSH, Tenn. -- This town of about 100 people hasn't seen anything quite 
this electrifying since the 1950s when a local teenager, Annie Mae Bullock, 
left town and became Tina Turner, the queen of rock 'n' roll. 
Power plants are sprouting in the flat, rich cotton fields nearby. One is 
under construction; another is about to start. Bulldozers are grooming a site 
for a third. "We think it's great," says Alvin Williams, owner of the Nutbush 
Grocery and Deli, as he prepares for the surge of construction workers who 
come in for lunch.
While this may seem promising at a time of growing energy shortages, the new 
plants are part of a power clash that presents the Bush administration and 
federal and state regulators with one of their knottiest problems: Who 
controls the nation's power grid? 
On one side is a new breed of freewheeling energy dealers called merchant 
traders, spurred by deregulation to generate and trade electricity. Led here 
by Enron Corp., they build small gas-fired generating plants, but most don't 
construct their own power lines. Instead, they hook up the plants to existing 
lines and sell electricity wholesale over long distances when prices peak 
during the summer. Thus, many of their plants are called "peakers." 
On the other side are old-line utilities, represented here by the federally 
owned Tennessee Valley Authority. They operate the power lines and warn that 
the system could become overloaded, leading to blackouts from the imbalance. 
Near Nutbush here in Tennessee's southwest corner, natural-gas pipelines run 
from the Gulf Coast and intersect with some of the TVA's 17,000 miles of 
transmission lines, which are spread over seven Southern states. That is what 
is making Nutbush boom: It is an attractive place to connect to the grid. 
By 2003, at least 13 new merchant plants altogether will be hooked up across 
the TVA's system. There will be dozens more on neighboring systems that will 
also use TVA lines, says W. Terry Boston, a TVA executive vice president. 
This year, TVA expects 300,000 requests for wholesale power deals on its 
system, up from 250,000 last year and just 25,000 in 1996. Mr. Boston 
foresees a congestion problem that will make it more difficult for the 
utility to maintain its record of 99% reliability. "This summer is going to 
be interesting," he says. 
Combat started here in the spring of 1999, when an Enron plant at nearby 
Brownsville began bombarding TVA with about 800 requests for summer 
transmission service, up from 33 the TVA had received from merchant plants 
the year before. Some were huge, elaborate trades involving brokered 
electricity from other sources that Enron wanted to ship across the TVA 
system. Kevin Presto, an Enron vice president, recalled: The TVA "pretty much 
fought us the whole way, even though they needed the megawatts." 
That June, TVA pulled the plug, telling Enron that from then on, its wheeling 
and dealing would be confined to the amount of electricity produced in Enron 
plants. Enron claimed foul and appealed to the North American Electric 
Reliability Council, or NERC,, a voluntary organization of utilities and 
electricity consumers. Along with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
and state regulators, NERC functions as the traffic cop for North America's 
power grid. 
Enron also sued the TVA and the dispute "raised a number of issues that we 
are trying to put our fingers on," says Don Benjamin, NERC's director of 
operations. One upshot is that it is busy rewriting the rules for how the 
national grid is controlled. The Bush administration's energy task force and 
Congress are also looking at the control issue and ways to expand the grid's 
capacity. So far, they have found no easy or inexpensive answers. 
The grid, with its dense webs surrounding major cities and few links in 
between, resembles a U.S. highway map from the 1930s before the Interstate 
system was built. And it is governed by rules that were negotiated by 
utilities at about that time, as they began to interconnect their systems 
with their neighbors'. Big utilities became "control areas" that perform the 
moment-to-moment adjustments that keep lines from overloading and equipment 
from melting down. With electricity, supply must always match demand. But 
lately, operators of merchant plants, such as Enron, have also qualified to 
become control areas. Regulators have ordered utilities to give merchant 
power plants open access to the grid, though the utilities sometimes curtail 
access for "reliability" reasons. 
"This was a very good system," sighs Thomas Overbye, an engineering professor 
at the University of Illinois. But while merchant plants have more access to 
the grid, he notes, they have little incentive to build more power lines. 
"When you restructure that way," asserts Mr. Overbye. "You're going to 
overload the system, and that's exactly what's happening." 
NERC's Mr. Benjamin worries that control will get harder this summer. "We've 
got to be able to look at this and see what effects these deals are having on 
the whole system," he says. Some ad hoc curtailment of wholesale deals and 
service to customers may be necessary to protect the grid, but the result 
will be expensive, he notes. "It means that merchants won't make money on 
that deal, and that the customer they sold power to will have to buy it from 
somebody else." In the summer of 1999 there were such 70 curtailments; last 
summer there were 180. 
Lynn Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Association, which 
represents 40 merchant power companies and electricity traders, suspects that 
decisions taken by big utilities for "reliability" reasons are sometimes used 
to block legitimate competition from her members. To prevent this, her group 
wants more federal control over the grid. "We're seeing lots of 
discrimination." The TVA's Mr. Boston counters that his system can't take 
more "surprises," such as the one on Aug. 19, 1999, when a series of 
wholesale trades brought the TVA's part of the grid to the brink of collapse 
from the overload. 
This year, Enron settled its fight with the TVA with a secret out-of-court 
settlement. Enron says it is also in the process of selling the plant near 
here and two others it had hooked to the TVA system to other merchant power 
producers. But it is still waging war over who controls the grid. 
In a separate case now before the U.S. Supreme Court, Enron argues that FERC 
has the power to open more of the grid's capacity to merchant power plants. 
Utility commissioners from several states argue it doesn't. While this is 
going on, FERC is pondering how to cut back the grid's proliferating number 
of control areas. Right now there are about 150. According to one FERC 
expert, who asked not to be identified, to avoid "complications" there should 
be around 14. 
Meanwhile, officials in Tina Turner's home turf still want the power plant 
construction to keep on rocking. "There's going to be others," predicts John 
Sharpe, the executive of Haywood County, who has been out recruiting more 
power plants to keep the local economic boost going. "I'm working my pants 
off to try and make that happen."

Energy Concerns Get Creative in Pursuit Of Names That Are Clever, Yet 
Practical
By Jon Kamp
Dow Jones Newswires

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHICAGO -- When Houston Natural Gas Corp. acquired InterNorth Inc. in 1985, 
the combined energy company needed a stylish new name that reflected its 
national aspirations. 
Jim Uehling, then an executive vice president at marketing firm Lippincott & 
Margulies Inc., helped conjure up "Enteron." Top executives loved it, 
unveiled it and were quickly humiliated when news reports noted that enteron 
is also a medical term for the human digestive tract. "That was a snafu," 
said Mr. Uehling, who is now a principal at Kass Uehling Inc., a private 
consulting firm in New York that he co-founded in 1988. "It was a very 
embarrassing moment."
But the clouds cleared, and the renamed Enron Corp. has evolved into a 
massive global energy firm with year 2000 revenue of $100.8 billion. It has 
also become an influential and successful brand name, Mr. Uehling said. 
Pressured by deregulation and a consolidating industry, other energy 
companies are hoping to pull off similar transformations punctuated by just 
the right name. 
"With a new name you want to convey a new image," said Beth Willis, vice 
president of corporate communication at Xcel Energy Inc., a company formed in 
August from the merger of Northern States Power Co. and New Centuries Energy 
Inc. 
The chief challenge facing utilities is that the market for actual English 
words has been cornered, said James Dettore, owner and chief executive 
officer of Brand Institute Inc., a privately owned marketing firm in Miami. 
That leaves utilities and their consultants to drum up new words, an effort 
spurred on by companies' desire to secure intuitive Internet domain names. 
"Real words are almost impossible to get these days," Mr. Dettore said. 
Although utilities are eager to drop the obvious "Power & Light" titles, they 
often gravitate toward names that keep the energy theme intact, then try to 
spice it up with a dash of dynamism, excellence or synergy. Mr. Uehling 
helped turn Mid-South Utilities into Entergy Corp. following a corporate 
turnaround in 1988. The name, picked from a list of hundreds, lets the 
company come very close to owning the word "energy," Mr. Uehling said. 
Following that theme, Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. and PSI Resources came up 
with Cinergy Corp. for their newly formed company in 1994. Dynegy Inc. 
emerged in 1998. And Mr. Uehling nearly put the name "Primergy" into 
circulation in 1995 as the moniker for the merged Northern States Power Co. 
and Wisconsin Electric Power Co. before the deal fell through. 
The cleverness could come with a price, said Linda Byus, a utilities analyst 
with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Chicago. Power companies run the risk 
of turning off some customers when they ditch comfortable old names for new 
ones that give no indication of what they actually do. A name like Mirant 
Corp., the new title for power company Southern Energy Inc. unveiled in 
January, may contain a fancy Latin root, but it doesn't contain much that 
tells you what the company does. 
A name like "Cinergy," at least, includes a pun on the company's hometown. 
"Cinergy is maybe one of the better ones," Ms. Byus said. But plenty of other 
names, she said, don't work quite as well. Minnesota Power Co. may have 
missed the mark last year when it renamed itself Allete, a name meant to 
better reflect the company's growing interest in other businesses like car 
auctions. The name, a combination of "all" and "elite," has some analysts 
scratching their heads. "That one looks like they misspelled it," Ms. Byus 
said. 
But even when names sound like something familiar, they can still cause 
confusion. While Allete neighbor Northern States Power avoided the 
sounds-like-nonsense charge and shunned the sounds-like-energy bandwagon when 
it chose the name Xcel, it walked right into another problem. Exelon Corp. -- 
the result of the merger between Commonwealth Edison Co. parent Unicom Corp. 
and PECO Energy Co. -- charged Xcel with being a copycat. 
That Exelon shares its name with a Novartis Pharmaceuticals medication for 
Alzheimer's disease didn't matter to the utility. When it came to 
electricity, the Exelon name was used first, and company officials warned 
Xcel when it formed that there were confusing similarities. Xcel kept its 
name anyway, and it nearly took a trip to federal court in Minnesota last 
month to resolve the dispute. Xcel, which agreed in a settlement to use the 
full Xcel Energy name, didn't originally think Exelon had a case -- or much 
of a name, for that matter. 
"Exelon sounds synthetic" and doesn't mean anything, Alan Carlson, Xcel's 
trial lawyer from the Minneapolis firm Merchant & Gould, said before the 
settlement. "Xcel is a powerful, great name." Asked recently about the 
meaning of Exelon, co-CEO Corbin McNeill offered, "It promotes excellence."

California Reliant Sees Profit Double in 1st Quarter
From Bloomberg News

Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-2
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

Reliant Energy Inc., the owner of Houston's utility and a power supplier in 
California and other states, said Monday that first-quarter earnings more 
than doubled on higher profit from energy-trading and natural-gas businesses. 
Profit from operations rose to $273.5 million, or 94 cents a share, from 
$133.7 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Reliant spokeswoman Sandy 
Fruhman said. Revenue more than tripled to $13.3 billion.
Soaring power prices pushed California's largest utility, PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric unit, into Bankruptcy Court and may cost the state as 
much as $70 billion in electricity-buying costs this year, lawmakers 
estimate. Most of that money went to power sellers such as Reliant's trading 
unit, which had a first-quarter operating profit of $216 million compared 
with a $22 million loss a year earlier. 
"It's driven principally by the way-over-average pricing environment in 
California," Jefferies & Co. analyst Paul Fremont said. 
Reliant shares rose $1.46 to close at $47 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Houston-based Reliant said last year that it would sell 20% of its 
non-utility businesses, including wholesale power sales and energy trading, 
to the public by early this year and spin off the rest to shareholders. The 
$1.46-billion initial stock sale will take place early next month, Chief 
Executive Steve Letbetter said Monday. 
Rival power sellers Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. are expected to follow 
Reliant later this week in reporting higher earnings. 
Power prices along the California-Oregon border averaged more than $288 a 
megawatt hour in the quarter, more than nine times the year-earlier average. 
The high prices put generators at risk of not collecting payment from 
utilities. Reliant set aside $38 million before taxes in the first quarter in 
case it can't collect money owed for California power sales.

USA: Enron Corp. beats first-quarter targets.

04/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp 
on Tuesday surpassed first quarter earnings estimates on across-the-board 
increases in revenues, trading volumes and retail energy services contract. 
The Houston-based company, North America's largest gas and electricity 
marketer, reported first-quarter earnings per share of 47 cents per share, 
compared to year-ago EPS of 40 cents. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson 
Financial/First Call had expected Enron, which also has Internet and 
telecommunications businesses, to earn 45 cents per share.
Enron also raised its 2001 earnings target range by five cents, to $1.75-1.80 
per share. In January, the company said it expected to earn $1.70-1.75 per 
share. Enron also said it had a nearly threefold increase in year-over-year 
revenues, from $13.1 billion in first quarter 2000 to $50.1 billion this 
year. 
Enron had suffered some setbacks during the first quarter, including the 
dissolution of its marquee video on demand deal with Blockbuster Inc.,the 
trimming of 20 percent of its broadband unit's staff and continuing payment 
problems with the Dabhol Power Plant in India. 
The wave of bad news prompted president and chief executive officer Jeff 
Skilling to hold a mid-quarter conference call to soothe investor concerns 
after the stock dropped into the $50s, its lowest level since January 2000 
and well off its high of $90.56 last August. The stock closed at $59.44 on 
Monday.

It's last call for Harris before the lights go out
Terence Corcoran
National Post

04/17/2001
National Post
National
C19
(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved.

Premiers say the darndest things. Take Ontario's Mike Harris. "Throughout my 
years at Queen's Park," Mr. Harris said in February, "I've always believed in 
open, competitive markets because they help keep costs low for consumers and 
encourage innovation." That was news to me. He may well believe in open 
markets, but after 6 years in office Ontario's Tories have done nothing to 
put those beliefs into practice. A dozen trees were privatized a few years 
ago in Northern Ontario, but otherwise the Harris Tories have been absolute 
slaves to the statist quo. 
Name a sector: water, urban transit, education, health care, liquor, beer, 
intercity bus service, public housing -- we haven't had one innovative idea 
that might help open markets to competition. For most of the past six years, 
the ideological lights have been on a dimmer in Tory Ontario. And time is 
running out; if the Harris government doesn't soon make at least one move 
toward competitive markets, there will be no reason for anyone to pretend any 
longer that this Conservative government is anything more than another hack 
Tory regime clinging to power.
The Harris government delivers a Speech from the Throne on Thursday, to be 
followed that night by the Premier's Dinner, now the most successful annual 
political fundraiser in the country. It will all look slick and controlled, 
but unless the government makes a significant move to unravel at least one 
government monopoly, it will all signify nothing. It would be a good time, in 
other words, for the Harris government to make a clear statement on the one 
agenda item they have actually prepared for, electricity deregulation. If 
they don't do electricity, they might as well just turn the lights out at 
Queen's Park and go home. 
It wouldn't take much, just a sentence or two. Here's a draft: "This 
government has always believed in open, competitive markets because they help 
keep costs low for consumers and encourage innovation. That's why we're 
determined to go ahead with our plan to open Ontario's electricity market to 
competition by November of this year." That's it. End of statement. It might 
be short, but it would galvanize activity in the power industry. 
There are short-term practical reasons for the government to make such an 
announcement. Most of the major players in the power sector are ready for a 
market opening in November. Hydro One, the new provincial transmission 
company, is anxious to move forward. Ontario Power Generation, which controls 
most of the generating capacity in the province, is ready. The Independent 
Market Operator, which will run the electricity exchange, has started the 
clock ticking on a critical-path timetable aiming at a November start-up. 
Many local power distribution companies, including Toronto Hydro, are already 
promoting competitive retail electricity markets to a population that seems 
willing. 
By declaring November the official target date, the government would also 
send a signal to some of the more reluctant corners of the province. Some 
local municipal utilities, for example, may need direct prodding from the 
province and the Ontario Energy Board. 
But the more important reasons for making a commitment to November are longer 
term. The main reason for opening up the market is to create a competitive 
environment that will attract private power generating capacity. If 
California has any lesson for Ontario, it is that new power generating 
capacity is essential to meet rising demand. Delays in opening the market and 
uncertainty have already stalled new investment. Kenneth Lay, the chairman of 
Enron Corp. of Houston, said his company had planned to have a new generating 
plant up and running this June, but stopped the project due to uncertainty 
over deregulation. Ontario needs private-sector investment in electricity, 
and without deregulation no investment will be made. 
One alleged obstacle to November deregulation is the continued existence of 
Ontario Power Generation, which controls about 90% of capacity. The 
fashionable economic theory is that OPG should be broken up to create a 
viable competitive market. Even if a breakup is desirable, that's no reason 
to wait. Competition is competition. If the market is free and barriers to 
entry are relatively low, the so-called threat of OPG's market power would be 
quickly neutralized by aggressive competitors such as Enron. 
At this point in its history, the Harris government cannot be expected to do 
anything too radical. Do not buy shares in a company that plans to run school 
boards or take over the Toronto Transit Commission. But most of the hard work 
has already been done in electricity. With the flick of a switch, the Harris 
government could turn its ideological lights back on. If it doesn't do 
electricity, it will never do anything.

India: BMS hits out at Govt. policies

NEW DELHI, APRIL 16. Raising a war cry against the World Trade Organisation, 
the International Monetary Friend, the World Bank and the Union Government 
for anti-labour, anti-farmer and anti- poor policies, the Bharatiya Mazdoor 
Sangh, trade union wing of the Sangh Parivar, today warned the BJP-led 
National Democratic Alliance Government to either correct these policies to 
protect the sovereignty of the nation and interests of its people, or face 
the wrath of the masses. 
The BMS demanded the scrapping of the Enron agreement and reversal of the 
policy of privatisation of PSUs. It demanded a probe into the Enron deal and 
probes into the privatisation of the Modern Food Industries and BALCO.
Addressing a rally at the Ramlila Ground here to mark the beginning of a 
"mass movement" against the WTO and the "anti- 
labour policies" of the Central Government, the BMS chief and founder of the 
Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Mr. Dattopant Thengadi, 
bitterly criticisied the NDA Government for its "anti-national and 
anti-people policies". He accused it of betrayal for giving in to the threats 
of economically powerful nations and in the process sacrificing national 
interests. 
Opposed to MNCs 
The fact that those leading the Government happened to be friends would not 
deter the BMS from opposing the Government, Mr. Thengadi said; the BMS only 
preached and practiced the objective policies of responsive cooperation. "We 
will oppose the Government which opposes the interests of the nation, people 
and its workers. We oppose multinationals. We will oppose the Government 
which supports multinationals." 
Referring to the concern expressed in certain quarters about the impact of 
the movement on the future of the Government, Mr. Thengadi said, "Our rally 
will not push out the Government. The Government is pushing itself out. If it 
goes, it will go because of its wrong policies. Governments have come and 
gone in the past too." 
Mr. Thengadi said they were hoping that the Government would resist the 
threat of sanctions from powerful nations controlling the WTO. This had not 
happened. Instead of succumbing to such pressures and diktats, the 
Government, he said, should challenge these nations to enforce sanctions. "We 
might suffer initially, for about a year and a half at the maximum, and then 
the economy would prosper again." His logic was "America needs India more 
than India needs America"; if Vietnam could bring such a powerful country to 
its knees, India could do it too. 
'Form parallel WTO' 
Asking the Government to quit the WTO, Mr. Thengadi said India should take 
the lead in forming a powerful block of developing countries within the WTO 
in order to secure favourable and equitable terms for continuing its 
membership. He even suggested that the Government "take a bold initiative to 
form a second WTO along with other developing countries to guard against 
exploitation of the poor and the developing countries. Let it be a rival 
WTO." And if the Government failed, "we will try to do it". 
He said the trade union movement had gained in strength because of the 
Government's wrong policies; the movement was emerging as a rallying point 
for not only workers but also poor farmers, traders and common people. He 
attacked the privatisation of even profit-making PSUs including BALCO. Like 
Modern Food Industries, BALCO was sought to be privatised. He saw no 
justification for such action. 
He blamed politicians, bureaucrats and private vested interests for 
manipulating the privatisation of PSUs which have been deliberately rendered 
sick for extraneous considerations. He demanded a probe into the 
privatisation of both these industries saying the deals smacked of 
corruption. Similarly, the Enron deal should not only be scrapped but also be 
probed and the guilty punished. While terming the Union Disinvestment 
Minister, Mr. Arun Shourie, an honest man, Mr. Thengadi said the 
privatisation of Modern Food Industries was "a fraud by bureaucrats". 
Sinha, a 'criminal' 
Attacking the latest budget initiatives, particularly the announcement that 
contract labour as well as hire-and-fire policy would be permitted, Mr. 
Thengadi called the Finance Minister, Mr. Yashwant Sinha, a "criminal". He 
was guilty of a grave constitutional impropriety in that he made 
announcements to change the Industrial Disputes Act and the Contract Labour 
Act even as these issues were pending before the National Labour Commission. 
Mr. Thengadi said Mr. Sinha had "committed a crime of encroaching upon the 
legitimate jurisdiction of the Labour Ministry". 
Like other Finance Ministers, he too was gripped by "amnesia" ever since he 
assumed charge. Prior to him, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who had authored the report 
on 'Challenges to the South' on economic colonisation, on becoming Finance 
Minister started acting against what he had professed. 
The national BMS president, Mr. R.B. Shah, criticised the policy of 
privatisation saying the BJP before coming to power had swadeshi on its 
agenda but unfortunately was pursuing the new economic policies more 
vigorously. "For the implementation of these policies eight committees were 
formed and no one from workers or farmers, who are the direct victims, were 
taken on the committees. The BMS from time to time apprised the Government of 
the real situation, but in vain." Workers from all over the country 
participated in the rally and dispersed after burning an effigy of the WTO.

BALCO sale a fraud, Sinha a criminal: RSS veteran
The Times of India News Service

NEW DELHI: Dattopant Thengadi, veteran RSS leader and Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee's contemporary in the Sangh Parivar, has challenged the 
government to mend its economic policies or risk losing power. 
In a vitriolic attack on the government's economic policies at a rally here 
on Monday, Thengadi, who helped raise the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, one of the 
country's biggest labour organisations, called Finance Minister Yaswhant 
Sinha a ``criminal'' for usurping the labour ministry's constitutional rights.
In a speech dripping with sarcasm, Thengadi's attack on Vajpayee's charisma 
and image was thinly veiled. He opened his speech with a reference to media's 
capacity to do ``image building.'' Quoting from management guru Peter 
Drucker's book Beware of Charisma, Thengadi said: ``A country cannot progress 
merely by building one or two persons' image. Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini 
are examples of image-building destroying personalities and their 
organisations.'' 
The 81-year-old Sangh leader sought a committee to enquire into the 
profitability of public sector companies. ``I want to testify before an 
enquiry that bureaucrats are deliberately turning the public sector companies 
into loss-making.'' He accused bureaucrats of making their own deals with the 
new promoters and ensuring the PSUs' sale to these private promoters. 
``Modern Food was sold for a throwaway price, now it is sick. The same fate 
awaits BALCO. Arun Shourie is an honest minister, but there was pressure from 
above and bureaucrats too misled him. It (BALCO sale) is a fraud,'' he said. 
Though not named, External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, who was finance 
minister in Vajpayee's 13-day government, too was not spared. Referring to 
that BJP government, Thengadi asked, ``Who gave Enron the counter-guarantee? 
Enron deal should be scrapped, those who agreed for it should be identified 
and punished.'' As finance minister, Jaswant Singh had agreed to the 
counter-guarantee. 
Thengadi was blunt in his warning to the government: If the government wants 
to protect multinational companies, drive the farmers and small-scale 
industrialists to suicide by flooding the market with cheap imports, and sell 
off profit-making public sector companies, the people will pull down the 
government. 
The choicest rebuke was reserved for Finance Minister Sinha. Reminding Sinha 
of his Swadeshi Jagran Manch (Thengadi founded SJM too) days, Thengadi said 
whoever occupies the finance minister's seat suffered from amnesia after 
assuming office. 
SJM had met in Nagpur shortly before the BJP came to power. Sinha as part of 
the central leadership vociferously opposed to India joining the WTO and, in 
fact, wanted the country to quit WTO. ``I am in search of a medicine to treat 
him for amnesia. They suddenly forget what they are, where they have come 
from, and what they are wearing. Sinha has encroached upon the jurisdiction 
of the labour ministry while making 85 lakh people vulnerable to the hire and 
fire policy. It is a crime against the Constitution. He is a criminal 
minister,'' Thengadi said. 
Even Thengadi's call for a rival World Trade Organisation was well argued. He 
said he has information about an attempt to form a developing countries' 
caucus within the WTO. He argued that India as the largest developing nation 
should lead this caucus, fight ``the club of fraudulent countries, who have 
put the WTO together for their interests.'' The rival WTO, Thengadi said, 
``is a reality which will happen despite the government's wishes.''

DIGITAL CAPITAL - Harnessing the power of business webs: Don Tapscott, David 
Ticoll and Alex Lowy; Nicholas Brealey Publishing, London. Distributed by 
Rupa and Co; Post Box No. 12333, 15, Bankim Chatterjee Street, College 
Square, Calcutta- 700073. 11.99. 
AT THE height of its popularity - and commercial success - as the preferred 
chip to put under the hood of your PC, Intel's Pentium processor suffered a 
body blow, a few years ago, that the company will not easily forget. A small 
glitch in how the chip performed floating point calculations - and Intel's 
initial arrogant and hamhanded treatment of customer complaints - resulted in 
a barrage of adverse publicity spreading like wild fire across the Internet. 
Jokes were posted and gleefully exchanged among Intel users: "What's the 
difference between a nine-year-old kid and the Pentium chip? A nine-year-old 
can do long division." The company learned the hard way about brand 
vulnerability in the digital economy and had to do some costly firefighting 
before it regained lost ground.
Making money in the Internet Age is more than a mere matter of "attracting 
eyeballs" to one's e-commerce website. Tapscott, Ticoll and Lowy are 
respectively, Chairman, CEO and MD of Alliance for Converging Technologies, a 
firm of e-biz consultants. Together they have pooled their considerable 
experience to write a fast-paced, survival guide for those who have ambitions 
of surviving and profiting from the new Internet way of doing business. 
The authors define digital economy as the internetworking of three types of 
knowledge assets: human capital (what people know), customer capital (who you 
know) and structural capital (how what you know can be built into the 
business system). To drive home the point they review how the Internet has 
become an awesome structure for collaboration, with "apps on taps" - 
application tools aplenty. It has created new "mantras" like "Content is 
king" and made possible hitherto unworkable business practices like 
"coopetition" - companies that cooperate in some areas to compete with each 
other, in a larger arena. 
The book provides some striking stories of companies that have leveraged 
these new models to create success stories - the auction sites like "e-Bay", 
online book sellers like "Amazon", air travel bargain ticketing like 
"priceline" and direct selling of "made to order" PCs as pioneered by Dell. 
It also analyses how a power supplier like Enron has reinvented itself as a 
provider of broadband telecom services; how a "rogue" airline operator like 
Virgin, encashed its considerable goodwill to set up a Tele-bank. 
The errors of the pre-Net years are recalled to underline how essential it 
has become for e-commerce players to give up competing on "petty, parochial 
and proprietary differentiators". The classic case of corporate shame was how 
the software giants in the 1980s lost the opportunity of coming together and 
creating a truly customer-friendly operating system with Unix, because of 
their predatory and monopolistic pricing tactics. The mindset of that 
generation of proprietors was shaken; but like James Bond's martini, not 
stirred. The authors suggest that with Linux, the new "open" system created 
by a Finnish student, that mistake is not about to be repeated. 
The book is prescient in some notable ways; it warns of the dangers of 
aggressive patent regimes in a nascent technology, quoting some bizarre 
recent cases; companies trying to patent Internet selling models like 
e-auctions, or bargain airfares, which they compare to a notorious surgeon in 
the U.S. who patented a new technique in cataract surgery and tried to 
prevent others from using it. 
However, in the few months since the book was written, some of the top stocks 
in Nasdaq - like Amazon, Yahoo and e-Bay - have faced hard times and the 
gleaming success stories begin to appear a mite tarnished. It only underlines 
the central theme of this stimulating, consistently readable book that the 
digital economy is central to today's competitive commercial strategy. The 
best ones succeed, but many fall by the wayside of the Information 
superhighway.

Centre appoints conciliator for DPC arbitration

The Centre has appointed Justice B P Jeevan Reddy, chairman, Law Commission 
as its conciliator to find a solution to the payment problem between Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
DPC had appointed Lawrence Street, former chief justice of New South Wales, 
Australia as its conciliator last week. The Enron-promoted company issued a 
notice for conciliation or arbitration to the Centre on 4 April for not 
honouring its counter-guarantee for MSEB's December bills of Rs 102 crore.
Finance ministry sources said that the government has already informed DPC 
about Justice Reddy's appointment as its conciliator. DPC sources confirmed 
that the company had received a communique in this regard from the Union 
finance ministry. 
"Both the parties will soon sit together and appoint an independent 
conciliator to complete the job within a time-frame of 60 days," said a DPC 
spokesperson. 
Issuing the notice, DPC had said, "This step was necessary in order to 
preserve our rights in the project, and to ensure that all parties honour 
their existing contractual obligations." 
The notice to the Centre was issued by DPC after the former conveyed to the 
company that until the availability penalty issue was resolved, it did not 
intend to pay the December bill under the counter-guarantee.

Dabhol slaps one more notice on Maharashtra

The game of notices and counter-notices continues. The Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC) has fired a fresh salvo at the Maharashtra government by 
slapping another arbitration notice. This time it is for not honouring the 
state government guarantee for the January 2001 and December 2000 bills. 
DPC stated in a communique, "DPC has issued a notice of arbitration to the 
government of Maharashtra for failing to honour its obligations. The state 
government repeatedly failed to honour its guarantee including towards there 
December 2000 and January 2001 bills and in respect of interest on late 
payments."
"This action is one of a number of steps DPC is taking to protect its rights 
and the rights of its stakeholders. Other recent actions included declaring 
political force majeure under the power purchase agreement and calling upon 
the government of India to commence the conciliation process over their 
failure to honour the counter-guarantee for December, 2000," the notice said. 
"We will give DPC an appropriate reply soon," said a senior state government 
official, reacting to the DPC missive. The notice has caught power industry 
observers by surprise as the Union government and DPC are trying to resolve 
the counter-guarantee tangle on the December bill through the conciliation 
process.
