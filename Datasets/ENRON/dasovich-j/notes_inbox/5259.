Bill,

Thursday looks real crazy right now--we are hosting a congressional staffer
and I'm acting group commander this week. MAYBE late in the day I will have
an opening; please coordinate with Karen at 277-2910.  Thanks!

Greg

Good afternoon, LTC Emanuel.  As you can see, I am trying to set up some
informal  meetings ahead of the publication of the the privatization
procurement
for utilitiesat Edwards AFB.  Please see the original correspondence with
Paul
Weaver below, where I requested his direction/advice.  Would such
informational
meetings be possible with you, and whoever you deem appropriate on Thursday,
22
Feb?  Bill Votaw, my President, and I will be in the area on that day, and
hope
to visit.

On a separate note, we have scheduled the next CA electric commodity update
for
the Edwards AFB/AFCESA personnel for Friday Feb 23 at 1100 hours (PST).  I
have
arranged for the same call in number1-800-711-8000, passcode 7137112.

Paul, I would like to stop by your office to meet with you on Thursday at
0830,
if that is convenient for you.

Jeff, Bill and I will be at your office on the 23rd at 1030 hrs, and we will
get
on the USAF call at 1100.

regards,
Bill

Bill, as far as I'm concerned you're welcome to drop by.  Re the
privitization thing, I've not been much involved with the evolution of this
at Edwards thus far.  I think I would be increasingly involved when and if
it really does happen, but like I said I've not been part of that inner
circle so far.  I might advise you to work that approach through LTC Greg
Emanuel 661-277-3336. (gregory.emanuel@edwards.af.mil).  Hope this helps.
Paul

Hello, Paul.  I tried to contact you several times by phone yesterday
(Friday), but I was unable to reach you.

Bill Votaw (Pres, EFSI) and I will be in the Western US in some meetings
next week, and we wanted to visit Edwards AFB on Thursday, 22 Feb.  Our
purpose is twofold.  First, we wanted to meet you in person and bounce off
you some ideas for energy usage at air force bases before we took them to
AFCESA.  Our hope is that you could coach us a bit on whether certain ideas
would need some tailoring in order to improve their reception at AFCESA.

Second, we wanted to meet with some CE-type personnel regarding the future
privatization of the electric, gas, water, and wastewater systems at
Edwards.  These we envisioned as informal discussions to find out about the
attitudes Edwards personnel have regarding privatization, the maintenance
work being done now, and the status of the systems.  Our thinking is that
the civilian person in charge of each system's maintenance might be
appropriate to talk to.  Of course, we needed to have such discussions
prior to the publication of any privatization RFPs.  I had thought of
calling COL Durkin directly, but I do not know him, and did not want to
just "cold call" my request, yet I would not attempt to arrange such
meetings without permission of him or his designee.  Can you suggest the
best way to establish such meetings for next Thursday?  Your support is
well-appreciated.

I am still on the road at the moment, but I will be in the office on
Tuesday morning ( I assume Monday to be a holiday for both of us).  I will
be checking email over the weekend, should you retrieve this during that
period.

Regards,
Bill
