Enron Unveils Storage Trades
Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market,=
=20
commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time.  It acted as a=20
market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was=
=20
then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products.  Crucially,=
=20
both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm=20
delivery with liquidated damages.

In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-manage=
d=20
and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro=
=20
network.  Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offerin=
g=20
and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader =
at=20
Enron.  "When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market t=
o=20
buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later.  Tha=
t=20
is unprecedented," says Thuraisingham. =20

The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed t=
o=20
firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significan=
t=20
development.  Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to=20
favour discounts on future purchases.  "There is a premium in the price for=
=20
firm delivery," says Thuraisingham.

He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to=
=20
Enron as a market maker.  In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the=
=20
possibilities of the market.  "most storage equipment at the moment is=20
supplied to the enterprise market.  This development opens up the wholesale=
=20
storage capacity market," says Thuraisingham.  =20

commoditisation of the market.=20

The concept of firmness of delivery will encourage more participants in the=
=20
long term. What is important to realise is that firmness doesn=01,t mean=20
delivery tomorrow. All it means is that if you commit to a date and then fa=
il=20
to deliver on that date you must pay damages. These are not punitive, they=
=20
are fair. In the telecoms sector, damages are usually payable in credits, b=
ut=20
it=01,s important that any damages go above what was originally paid in tha=
t=20
contract. Otherwise, there is no contractual incentive for the carrier to=
=20
deliver on time or at all. =20
=01; =01;
The downturn in investors=01, appetite to put money into telecoms companies=
 will=20
hasten a trading culture. The carriers already trade capacity between=20
themselves to allow them to sell services. As investment for expansion=20
declines, these options will become more attractive. But it generally still=
=20
makes sense to build rather than buy where there is volume.
=01; =01;
Pooling points are the logical conclusion to the problems of connectivity.=
=20
Metro platforms are a key feature of a number of carriers=01, strategies be=
cause=20
they help you get around a lot of local loop issues and offer increased=20
access to buyers and sellers. Carriers are currently trying to build to as=
=20
many telehouses within a metro area as possible, because no-one wants to be=
=20
tied. The pooling point concept takes that to a logical conclusion. It is=
=20
more economical to create a hub that can then connect to all the telehouses=
=20
through the networks of the carriers involved. It=01,s efficient and fairly=
=20
cheap to connect. The idea that people don=01,t want to be involved with po=
oling=20
points because it=01,s a link you can=01,t control is nonsense. Carriers co=
nnect=20
with third parties such as CLECs all the time and rely on them to complete =
a=20
route. It=01,s not a revolution, it=01,s an evolution.
=01; =01;
You can be a player without owning a network. In Europe, Enron has no fibre=
=20
network and is involved in the buy and the sell side of the market. That=01=
,s a=20
positive development, which reinforces the model we=01,re trying to build. =
A lot=20
of players spend a lot of money finding and closing simple transactions. We=
=20
can help them do it cheaper and allow their sales force to concentrate on=
=20
higher value-added sales. What=01,s wrong with that?
