Re: Today's IEPA Call
?
The early discussion was about the Chronicle article?on  Sunday -- which said 
that demand was not much greater than last year, which  California met -- and 
the methodology used.? IEPA/McNally has send the MRW  info to KFBK 
(Sacramento's leading news station), which picked up on the story,  and is 
preparing a response for the Chron.? It may be in the form of a  short op-ed 
or a letter to the editor.? 
?
The line on the FERC refund order is that what it does is  eliminate some 
uncertainty about the rules producers operate under.? There  was a strong 
message that the producers have been playing by the rules --  somewhat 
uncertain though they were -- and will continue playing by the  rules.? The 
positive is that FERC has now offered a methodology that will  eliminate 
short-term uncertainty.
?
IEPA has issued a floor alert to oppose AB 39x.? The  alert has been issued 
in conjunction with the California Chamber of Commerce,  Western States 
Petroleum Assn. and others.
?
There is a target date of the end of next week for completion  and possibly 
printing of the packet they are developing.? There may be a  new round of 
editorial board meetings and it sounds as if there will be an  effort to meet 
with the Senate Republican Caucus to follow on a similar meeting  recently 
held with Assembly Republicans.? 
?
Greg and Stephanie (whose name and affiliation I did not get  but I'm sure 
you can tell me) have been named co-chairs of the group.?  They'll coordinate 
the calls and items such as staff.? Budget issues will  go to the whole group.
?
Those were the main points.? If there was a summary  prepared by IEPA or 
McNally and it comes to me by e-mail, I'll pass it  along.
