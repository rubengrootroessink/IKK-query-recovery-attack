The Chief ALJ of the CPUC has put out for comment in the rate stabilization
case a proposed services agreement between DWR and PG&E to cover meter
reading and billing services provided to DWR by PG&E.  Of note is the fact
that DWR will pay $1.7 million as a set up fee and between $80,000 and
$115,000 a year for such services over the next four years.  Please advise
if you want to review this agreement.  If direct access remains viable, this
may represent an interesting precedent for utility billing and metering
costs.
