The time seems ripe for someone to issue a press release asking Gov. Davis to 
justify his statements about "out-of-state price gougers" and "greedy 
out-of-state generators"---or at least acknowledge that the highest prices 
paid by California went to Los Angeles Dept. of Water & Power, other 
California munis, and Crown corporation B.C. Hydro/Powerex---and that 
Texas-based companies accounted for only 10% of energy sold to California, 
and were among the lowest-cost sellers.

More rhetoric.  I'm not too sure what FERC order he was reading.

> SACRAMENTO 
> Governor Gray Davis issued the following statement today regarding the
> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's recent refund order:
> "FERC is up to its old tricks again. They talk about refunds for
> California. But in this case, talk really is cheap: the details of its
> latest order show it has no intention of making California whole.
> Beginning on January 17, 2001, the people of California, through the
> Department of Water Resources, had to pay out-of-state gougers outrageous
> prices to keep the lights on. And now FERC says Californians are not
> entitled to refunds even though they determined the prices were
> excessively high. It's time for FERC to decide who they are working for:
> the greedy out-of-state generators, or the people of California. We are
> calling on FERC to change its order. If it doesn't, we will be in court."
