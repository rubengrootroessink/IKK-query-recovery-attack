Jan & Linda,

In response to messages from both of you re: Jeff Dasovich's availability for 
a conference call w/Jim and Bob
@ 2:30 PDT/4:30 central, Jeff tells me he is not available.

In the future, please send these requests via e-mail addressed both to Jeff 
and myself so that we don't 
duplicate effort? I'd appreciate that.

Let me know if you have any questions [(415) 782-7841].

Thanks,
Joseph
