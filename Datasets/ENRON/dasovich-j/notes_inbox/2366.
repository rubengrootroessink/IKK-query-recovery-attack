Hi Everyone,

Attached please find your Spring 2001 schedule as of Round II.

(1)  To make any adjustments to your schedule, please come by the Evening
MBA office in January (first week of classes) to fill out an add/drop form.
 Do not go into Telebears.

(2)  Please double-check that there are no time conflicts, especially with
the one-unit courses.  You must let us know by Friday, December 15 if you
plan to drop any of your one-unit courses.  You will not be able to drop a
one-unit class after December 15 and you will be responsible for the
readers and textbooks.

(3)  If you are interested in taking day classes, please let me know by
e-mail.  I'll put your name on a list.  During the first weeks of classes,
I'll confirm the availability of seats.

Thanks,

TJ
