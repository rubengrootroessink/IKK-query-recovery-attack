Ms. Halligan,
Mr. Mark Baldwin with Interstate Gas Services will be representing 
Transwestern Pipeline Company during Tuesday's hearing.  Transwestern is a 
party of record in this proceeding.  Mr. Baldwin is Transwestern's California 
consultant, and is well versed in state regulatory matters and, in 
particular, this docket.  On behalf of Transwestern, Mr. Baldwin will address 
the following issues:

1. The PD in light of recent events in both the natural gas and electricity 
markets in California.
2  A comparison of certain features of the PD and the alternative settlement 
(Comprehensive Settlement) supported by SoCalGas Company and the majority of 
the stakeholders, including Transwestern Pipeline.
3. The relationship between the CPUC's decision in this proceeding and the 
ongoing investigation of the sufficiency of infrastructure for both natural 
gas and electricity.

My understanding is that the CPUC prefers the speakers be brief.  With your 
permission, Mr. Baldwin's remarks will be limited to no more than 5 minutes, 
with an opportunity for questions to follow.

Please let me know if there are any other guidelines the CPUC would like 
parties to follow in this proceeding.  Also, please let me know if there are 
any questions that I can answer for you.

Jeffery C. Fawcett
Transwestern Pipeline Company
