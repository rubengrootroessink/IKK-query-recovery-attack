Re:        FERC Commissioners to Keynote CMTA Energy Conference

For all manufacturers who will ultimately pay the price for California's

energy crisis and for all those individuals involved with energy policy,

the only place to be from August 1-3 will be the CMTA Energy Conference
at Harvey's Hotel-Casino in South Lake Tahoe.

Headlining the Conference as Keynote Speakers are two of the five
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners (FERC).  Commissioner Nora
Brownell will keynote the Thursday, August 2 session and Commissioner
Bill Massey will open the Friday session.

Commissioner Nora Brownell was nominated by President George W. Bush to
serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on April 30,
2001 and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on May 25.  Prior to joining
the Commission, Ms. Brownell served as a member of the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission (PUC).  During her tenure at the PUC, Ms.
Brownell took an active role in the roll out of electric choice in
Pennsylvania.  In addition to her work in establishing the framework for

one of the most successful retail electric markets in the country, Ms.
Brownell was a leader in the administration of Pennsylvania's Electric
Choice Consumer Education Program.

William L. Massey was nominated by President Clinton and was confirmed
by the Senate in 1993.  He was renominated and confirmed for a second
five-year term ending June 30, 2003.  Commissioner Massey was the only
Clinton-appointed FERC commissioner to support Governor Davis' demand
for electricity price controls in the western states earlier this year.

The CMTA energy Conference agenda will include the latest information on

energy legislation making its way through the state capitol, an update
of pending CPUC decisions as well as a review of the various financial
proposals aimed at returning Edison and PG&E creditworthiness and
restoring direct access to California's electricity consumers.

We have scheduled panels of government and industry experts to discuss
Natural Gas Prices, Supply and Infrastructure; Managing High Prices and
Blackouts; Environmental Impacts and Trade-Offs; and two panel
discussions on present and future energy markets.

2001 Energy
Conference at Harvey's in South Lake Tahoe.
