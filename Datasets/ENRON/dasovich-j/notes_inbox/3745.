needs to dedicate time to learning & developing skills
in an organization.  The trick is that the training
must have be relevant, applicable, & targeted
(appropriate for level), and have a very clear
objective.

feel better if it were the type of training mentioned
above...it's important for all employees to know what
their company does.  Probably not as important for
small companies, because this learning happens
effectively through informal channels.

5)I do it because it is mandatory;
2) I do it because it will help me learn my job
quicker;
3)I do it because it will give me skills I can
use in my next job;
4)I do it because it will help the company be
more profitable;
1) I do it because it allows me to refresh my
skills;
6)I do it because it is a way to get away from
my job
