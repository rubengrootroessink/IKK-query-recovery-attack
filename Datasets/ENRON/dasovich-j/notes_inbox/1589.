Hi Evening MBA students:We'd like to confirm your Fall 2000 schedule with
you.  This is what we currently have on record at the Evening MBA office and
we will match this up with the campus system next week.

Please reply with any corrections or simply state that all is fine.  It
would be great to hear from you right away on this by e-mail.  Please
respond by Monday, November 13.

Thanks and see you,

T.J.
