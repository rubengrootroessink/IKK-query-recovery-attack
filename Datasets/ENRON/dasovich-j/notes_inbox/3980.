We will do it.  Maureen and I have already talked about the Freeman meeting 
and we are making Steve hotel reservations, wherever we put Ken.

Since Steve Kean is planning to accompany Ken on his meetings next week in 
CA, please be sure to cc Maureen McVicker on all meetings that are scheduled 
so she can manage Steve's calendar. 

Thanks.
