I agree about the need to have a clear strategy.  Another thing to keep in 
mind, however, is that we can enlist the AGs' assistance on other fronts as 
well; it doesn't have to be limited to 271 applications.

Thanks for the information.  It is good to know we have a potential ally.

I'm not sure when the MA AG weighed in on the Verizon petition.  If it was a 
last minute effort at the FCC it is likely to be less effective that if they 
were active in the proceeding when the state was making its determination.  
The point here is that the timing of the AG's participation is bound to be as 
important as the issues they raise.

Obviously, before we would engage in soliciting AG intervention, we would 
have to have a very clear strategy about how much pressure we want to exert 
in 271 applications, directly or indirectly, in exchange for cooperation on 
other fronts (access to high capacity loops, for example).  This is 
especially true in light of our discussion around our primary wholesale 
trading partners on today's weekly call.

Everyone,

I finally touched base with Emily Meyers, my contact at the National 
Association of Attorneys General ("NAAG") regarding their involvement on the 
telecom side, specifically with regard to Section 271 authorizations.

According to Emily, there is no group effort that exists (i.e., a telecom 
committee or an individual AG taking the lead on telecom issues).  Individual 
AGs get involved, but that is all.  For example, MA AG Tom Reilley recently 
opposed Verizon's application for 271 authority, but the FCC still granted 
Verizon's petition.  

Emily recommends that we use the AGs as much as possible.  For example, if we 
believe that local competition is non-existent and we have evidence to that 
effect, we should certainly convey that information to the individual AG and 
have him/her weigh in on our behalf.  Emily recognizes that Enron is 
pro-competitive and that typically the AGs would be in agreement with our 
positions - so it's something for us to keep in mind as we move forward.  
There's no guarantee that the FCC will listen to the AGs, but it may be worth 
a try.

If anyone has any thoughts or comments, please let me know.  Thanks.

Lara
