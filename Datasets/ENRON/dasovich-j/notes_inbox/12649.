Paul, your old friend Lew McMurran and I talked about this in Tacoma and I 
would be happy to follow up.  He is with WSA which was formally the 
Washington Software Alliance (now just 3 letters) that has both software and 
other tech vendors in its membership.  I think we can put something together 
without too much difficulty (of course if experience dictates otherwise, 
please let me know).  I will also sniff around for some other organizations 
that may be interested.

You would take back your clothes comment if you were around here today.....  
I had to have my wife bring a pair of slacks to work because I forgot I had a 
lunch w/ Erik Sten and wore casual Friday jeans (which are more casual than 
my Monday dress jeans).

At one point last year we tried to unite the Washington high-tech community 
on energy issues and were unable to do so.  Can you look into whether there 
is a "Silicon Valley Manufacturer's Association" equivalent in Washington?  I 
think they meet through a subset of AWB, but they may have their own group.  
Maybe we can have sponsor a meeting on energy issues ....?  Maybe we can 
speak at their annual meeting?  Maybe ....

Let me know your thoughts.  It seems to me that your'e the best one to look 
into this ... you have the best clothes.
