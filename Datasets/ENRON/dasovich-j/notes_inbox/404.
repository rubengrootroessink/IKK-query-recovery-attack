Dreaming of an Overseas Retirement?
------------------------------------------------------------
Many Americans dream of retiring to an exotic locale
overseas. The dream can come true for those "expats" who
plan their retirement wisely. Here's a look at retiring
abroad, with links to valuable online resources and a guide
to some of the decisions you'll make on such issues as
health, taxes, voting status and Internet access.

Internet Scams
------------------------------------------------------------
Pump and dump. Virtual stocks. Pyramid schemes. These are
just a few of the online frauds, scams and swindles that
tempt the unwary investor. Remember, if an alleged
investment sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't
legitimate. Another hint: beware of an e-mail that
announces that you're on the "friends and family" list of
an IPO you've never heard of. Protect yourself from these
deceptions, and others, by reading this article, which
describes each scam and also refers you to links at
the SEC and other regulators for more information.

Is Trading Stocks "Just Like Gambling?"
------------------------------------------------------------
There are certain parallels between investing in stocks
and gambling on games such as roulette and blackjack. But
it's important to know where these similarities end, and
how the practices or an astute investor are much different
than those of a casino gambler. This article explains how
the Las Vegas odds favor the house, and why gambling is
not the same as intelligent, long-term investing.

Election 2000 - An Investor's Guide
------------------------------------------------------------
The Presidential campaign is heading into its stretch run,
and the Republican and Democratic candidates have staked
out positions on the issues that most concern investors.
Where do they differ - and where do they agree? This
analysis from the Schwab Washington Research Group*
summarizes where the candidates stand on taxes, the Federal
budget, health care, education, and retirement savings. If
you think there's hardly any difference between the two
platforms, you're in for a surprise.

Financial Services: The Urge of the Merge?
------------------------------------------------------------
The once staid world of financial services appears to be
undergoing tremendous change, as commercial banks,
insurers, brokers and others grapple with new technologies
and deregulation. Recent legislation by Congress was
expected to trigger a wave of cross-industry mergers and
acquisitions. Yet this feeding frenzy has been slow to
begin, due to Y2K concerns, rising interest rates and
lower stock prices. What's the outlook now for a
convergence? Will bankers gobble insurers, or vice versa?
Where are some of the opportunities for investors? Read
this analysis from the Washington Research Group.*

Come Walk the Boards
------------------------------------------------------------
Check out our new streamlined message boards at
http://schwab.ed4.net/go/1sigserv7t/sept/boards/.
Since July, we've added eight boards on popular topics
such as mortgages and margin investing. If you haven't

After Hours Trading Becomes Extended Hours Trading
------------------------------------------------------------
Here's an update on new trading times and policies:
- Pre-Market session: Order entry begins at 7:45am ET,
  Execution between 8:00am - 9:15am ET
- After Hours session extended: Order entry begins
  at 4:05pm ET, Execution between 4:15pm - 8:00pm ET
- Ability to trade odd and mixed lots
- Most Listed and Nasdaq securities are available

Remember that Extended Hours Trading poses certain risks
and may not be for everyone. Schwab reserves the right to
change or modify hours of operation for extended hours
trading at any time.

To learn more go to
http://schwab.ed4.net/go/1sigserv8t/sept/extendedhrs/

Due to limited liquidity in extended hours trading
sessions, there are no assurances that an investor's
stock order will be executed.

Decimalization: What is It?
------------------------------------------------------------
Decimalization is the process of converting the pricing
of equities from fractions to decimals. Currently, U.S.
markets quote and price stocks (and their underlying
options) in fractions, while most foreign markets use
decimal pricing. The conversion process will take place
gradually, with the first phase on August 28.

To find out more about this conversion and how it might
affect your trades and investments, check out
http://schwab.ed4.net/go/1sigserv9t/sept/decimal/

------------------------------------------------------------
Now Signature Services clients who subscribe
to Schwab's Price Alert service can receive their Price
Alerts even more rapidly. We are accelerating the delivery
of Price Alerts, which can be delivered to you via e-mail

A Smart Way to Invest in Technology
------------------------------------------------------------
MarketPro Talk featuring Dennis McKechnie, PIMCO Funds
Wednesday, September 13, 2000 at 7:30pm ET

Technology has been the engine driving the stock market's
remarkable bull run, yet many investors have held off
buying tech stocks. Have you ever considered having an
expert pick tech stocks for you? Listen in an get involved
in the discussion.

Funds focusing their investments on companies involved in
a single sector - such as technology - may involve a
greater degree of risk than an investment in other mutual
funds with greater diversification. Please read prospectus
carefully before investing.
