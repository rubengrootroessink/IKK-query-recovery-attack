Subject: Call from PG&E's CEO

Received a call this afternoon from Gordon Smith, CEO of PG&E (I met Gordon 
when he was CFO of PG&E and I was a bureaucrat at the PUC working on the Blue 
Book).  He was following up from the meeting this morning with Bob Glynn.  He 
was very positive about the comprehensive solution that Ken Lay described to 
Glynn at this morning's meeting.  He was particularly positive about the 
core/noncore proposal.  He asked to meet to discuss it further.  I have an 
appointment to meet with him Monday afternoon.  He offered--as a board member 
of the California Chamber of Commerce--to help bring the Chamber along, and 
he also said that he can help with the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Ass.  
I'll report back after the meeting.

And may have already mentioned that I have a meeting scheduled in Sacramento 
Monday with the CEO of the Chamber and the President of CMA.

Will report back on the meetings.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff
