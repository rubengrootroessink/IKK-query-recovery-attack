Fix your typos and incorporate your changes ASAP for Rick.  Refer to the San 
Diego meeting this past week as another example of California trying to 
assert itself.  I can't recall whether the presentation identifies December 1 
as the Governor's release date ... the presentation should identify this date 
as a key date. 

THANKS.
