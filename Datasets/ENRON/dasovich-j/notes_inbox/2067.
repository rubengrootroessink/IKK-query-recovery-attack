Davis is supposed to release his plan on Friday.  Jeff was with Davis' staff  
in LA with Steve Kean.  I will forward to you an e-mail from Steve Kean 
summarizing that meeting.   Also, I will be on the call, and possibly Jeff 
will as well, to give you the intelligence that we're hearing.

Subject: Davis's proposal

I read something today that Gov Davis is releasing a proposal for his fix to 
the electricity problem on 12/1/00.  Can anyone in your group shed some light 
on what we expect?
