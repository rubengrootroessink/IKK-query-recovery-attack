I'm actually in Portland today and will be in Salem tomorrow.  I'd like to 
have a staff meeting, but it will have to be later (or earlier) in the day.  
My Salem meeting starts at 9:00 a.m.   I need to leave Portland by 8:00.  

Folks, please let me know of your availability on Thursday afternoon for a 
quick staff meeting.
