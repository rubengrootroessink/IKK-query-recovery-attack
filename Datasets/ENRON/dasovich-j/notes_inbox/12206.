e=20
happy to consider it, asking for a CV and passing on the need for Edward to=
=20
be based in either SF or Portland.=01; The latter point is fine, he would b=
e=20
willing to travel.
=01;
From the CV=01;Edward's background is similar to mine on the educational fr=
ont,=20
although he took a turn into Government rather than consulting when he left=
=20
university.=01; I think Edward is excellent.=01; He is one of the best=20
regulators/civil servants I've come across in terms of both his economic=20
knowledge and=01;awareness of commercial issues.=01; He should have a very=
=20
successful career at the DTI and it=01;be good if we=01;were able=01;to hel=

=01;
So - we've got the CV and the=01;agreement in principle to offering Edward=

PS: Richard Lewis did have one concern, ie, that if Edward gets too close t=
o=20
our reg affairs staff he may develop a cynical view of our regulatory staff=
=20
"arguing the book" rather than crusading for truth, justice and the public=

e this=20
is a potential problem, I don't think we should be unduly=01;concerned beca=
use:
=01;
- Edward is astute enough to realise what drives most regulatory affairs=20
activity
- we generally are arguing in the public interest anyway
- if we're aware of the problem we can circumnavigate it.
