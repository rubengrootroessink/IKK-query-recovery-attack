The common response to neighbourhood landfill? "Not in my backyard." But 
waste may soon grow more attractive -- as an alternative way to light your 
home and heat your furnace.

This energy will come from methane gas, collected through vertical wells and 
horizontal trenches in landfill sites. Suncor Energy Inc., the Alberta 
oilsands giant, has signed a five-year agreement with Conestoga Rovers and 
Associates (CRA) of Waterloo, Ont., which specializes in tapping this gas 
from landfills. Over five years, Suncor will pour up to $60 million into the 
project. Suncor vice-president Gerry Manwell says individual sites will cost 
up to $10 million to develop, making a profit within about five years. Only 
six of Canada's 392 landfills are being reviewed for development, but if the 
public embraces the new gas, its commercial viability should inspire other 
companies to follow suit. 

In the past, such a venture would not have been profitable, says Rick Mosher, 
project leader at CRA. But that may be about to change. Come November, when 
Alberta and Ontario deregulate their electricity industries, power will be a 
marketable commodity like natural gas. Conventional electricity may get 
pricier, opening the door for alternatives. Toronto Hydro Corp. has already 
announced plans to buy 130 million kilowatt hours produced from green energy, 
including methane.

So those decaying kitchen scraps and lawn cuttings may soon provide both 
fuel, for heating and generating electricity, and carbon dioxide, which will 
be sold to nurture seedlings in greenhouses. That's good news for consumers, 
who will be empowered to help reduce the noxious smell and greenhouse gas 
emissions from the landfill in their "backyard."
