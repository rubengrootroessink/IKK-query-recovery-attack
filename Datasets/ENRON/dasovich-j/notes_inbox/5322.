State sees $2.3 billion tab for emergency buys
San Diego Union-Tribune=20
By Ed Mendel=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
February 15, 2001=20

SACRAMENTO -- The amount the state expects to spend on emergency power has=
=20
soared to $2.3 billion and may continue to grow for weeks or months.=20
A request for an additional $500 million last week was quickly followed by =
a=20
request for another $500 million this week, in part because the state has=
=20
begun buying power for San Diego Gas & Electric.=20

The emergency purchases began Jan. 17 when Gov. Gray Davis declared an=20
emergency because suppliers would no longer sell power to two nearly bankru=
pt=20
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison.=20

The state is buying power on the expensive spot market while struggling to=
=20
negotiate a portfolio of long-term contracts that are expected to sharply=
=20
reduce costs.=20

Davis said yesterday that more long-term contracts could be announced this=
=20
week. But the state does not want to obtain all of its long-term contracts=
=20
immediately, because prices could go down later.=20

Meanwhile, the governor said he hopes that an agreement on a plan to begin=
=20
paying off the $13 billion debt of the utilities, in exchange for their=20
transmission systems and other assets, will calm the market.=20

The governor intends to reach an agreement with legislative leaders on a=20
debt-relief plan that can be presented to the utilities tomorrow, setting t=
he=20
stage for several weeks of negotiations.=20

"As soon as the utilities indicate their assent to this plan -- or some=20
modified version we can assent to -- everything will begin to stabilize and=
=20
calm down," Davis said.=20

"There is no question when there is uncertainty it affects prices, and we=
=20
want to create the opposite -- some certainty, predictability -- in what I=
=20
like to call a challenge," Davis told reporters, "and you guys call a=20
crisis."=20

The governor said that state purchase of the transmission systems will be t=
he=20
biggest part of the proposal tomorrow. Other assets that have been mentione=
d=20
are stock options, scenic land around hydroelectric facilities, and payment=
s=20
from utility parent firms.=20

The state is not revealing the price of its power purchases, arguing that=
=20
would prevent lower-priced bids from suppliers in the future. Davis said he=
=20
hopes to have a secrecy period of less than six months and may announce a=
=20
schedule in two or three weeks.=20

"But I definitely do not want to jeopardize the integrity of the secret bid=
=20
prices," he said. "Because if we do that, we are just going to force=20
Californians to pay more for power than they would otherwise."=20

An official of the state Department of Water Resources, which owns=20
hydroelectric facilities and is purchasing power for the state, estimated=
=20
last month that the state was paying $45 million a day for power.=20

The governor's emergency order last month authorized the state to dip into=
=20
$440 million in Water Resources funds. The Legislature quickly appropriated=
=20
$400 million for additional power purchases, and included $500 million in t=
he=20
bill authorizing long-term contracts.=20

But Feb. 5, the state Department of Finance sent the Legislature a=20
"deficiency"=20
notice saying it intended to begin spending an additional $500 million to b=
uy=20
power in 10 days, unless the Legislature objected.=20

The department issued another notice this week saying yet another $500=20
million will be required because all of the previous funding is expected to=
=20
be exhausted by Feb. 23.=20

"This is somewhat sooner than had earlier been anticipated due to colder=20
weather and the inclusion of electricity purchases for the San Diego Gas &=
=20
Electric service area," said the notice issued Tuesday.=20

The long-term contracting legislation signed early this month by Davis made=
=20
SDG&E eligible for the state purchases. SDG&E is in better financial=20
condition than PG&E and Edison, but has a debt of more than $500 million.=
=20

All three utilities are the victims of a failed deregulation plan: The rate=
s=20
they can charge customers are capped (in SDG&E's case by legislation after=
=20
bills doubled last summer) while the wholesale cost of power soared,=20
producing huge debts.=20
The long-term contracting legislation authorizes the state to issue $10=20
billion or more in bonds to spread the cost of the power purchases over a=
=20
period of years in an attempt to avoid a rate increase.=20

The bonds will be paid off by ratepayers through a monthly charge on their=
=20
bill. Money from the bonds also will be used to repay Water Resources and t=
he=20
state general fund for the purchases made on the spot market.=20

In comparison, the $2.3 billion that the state expects to spend on power=20
purchases so far is equal to the reserve in the $104.7 billion state budget=
=20
proposed for next fiscal year. It is more than the total amount of money=20
earmarked for the state's mental health programs.=20

State Treasurer Phil Angelides told reporters last week that the $10 billio=
n=20
bond issue will not be ready until May. He said if interim financing throug=
h=20
short-term notes is too expensive, the state has $9 billion in cash reserve=
s.=20

Angelides said that the long-term contracts must be obtained before the bon=
ds=20
can be issued. He said the average price of the contracts will determine th=
e=20
total amount needed for the bond issue, which could exceed $10 billion.=20

The governor spoke yesterday while revealing more details of his plan to=20
boost power generation in California by 5,000 megawatts to avoid blackouts=
=20
this summer, when air-conditioning drives up the demand for electricity.=20

He is proposing legislation that would provide rebates to companies that=20
install small business generators of less than 10 kilowatts, a 50 percent t=
ax=20
credit for generators between 10 and 200 kilowatts, and $50 million for=20
co-generation, wind and solar programs.=20

"We are in for a struggle this summer," Davis said. "It will test our=20
resolve. But I am convinced if we all do our part, we will get through this=
=20
summer without major disruptions."=20

Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive officer of Enron, the nation's largest=20
electricity trader, said electricity costs would go down when significant=
=20
progress occurs in planning power plants.=20

"Faster siting will cause the forward price of electricity to drop below $5=
0=20
a megawatt," Skilling said yesterday at an electric industry conference in=
=20
Houston. In retail terms, that is 5 cents a kilowatt.=20

Yesterday was California's 30th straight day in a Stage 3 power alert. Grid=
=20
operators struggled to meet demand by making last-minute power purchases fr=
om=20
the Northwest.=20

"We came close this morning (to blackouts) but it got better by the hour,"=
=20
said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the state Independent System Operator.=
=20
"It was touch and go."=20

ISO managers had worried they might not meet demand because of the forced=
=20
shutdown of power plants capable of producing 10,400 megawatts -- 400=20

LME to continue with longer open-outcry hours
By Martin Hayes=20

LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME), the world's=20
largest non-ferrous metals market, said on Thursday an experimental extensi=
on=20
to its open-outcry hours would continue.=20

``The board looked at a whole range of issues at its (February) meeting...I=
t=20
decided that this aspect should continue, but will be kept under review,''=
=20
LME Director of Corporate Affairs Jonathan Haslam said.=20
In a move that bucked the inexorable trend in European markets away from=20
floors and towards electronic trading platforms, the LME last October=20
introduced a trial 1330-1510 GMT extension to its open-outcry trading hours=
.=20

Before then, there had been a break at the end of the morning session when=
=20
the floor was closed. Now LME open-outcry trading hours run from 1140 to 17=
00=20
continously.=20

LME Select, the exchange's screen trading system which was launched on=20
February 9, operates from 0730 to 1930, with the exception of a 45-minute=
=20
closure between 1230 and 1315, when the second official rings take place.=
=20

Traders from the LME's 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs), who are entitled to=
=20
trade during the open-outcry sessions, said more activity has been seen=20
during the first part of the extended period.=20
``The guys on the floor have got accustomed to it now, and are doing more=
=20
business than they previously would have,'' one floor trader said.=20

Others said the bulk of trade was seen after 1330, with business slackening=
=20
after some 45 minutes, only to pick up from 1510 onwards when the customary=
=20
afternoon rings take place.=20

``There is a bit of a dead zone between 1415 and 1515...but the longer it=
=20
(the floor) is open, the better it is for the survival of the ring,'' anoth=
er=20
senior trader said.=20

EVEN LONGER HOURS UNLIKELY=20
Last month traders from the RDMs mooted the idea of even longer trading hou=
rs=20
-- with some seeking to begin daily floor trading from as early as 0900 GMT=
,=20
ending as now at 1700 GMT.=20

``It (the board) looked at this situation in the light of a great deal of=
=20
change that is taking place....We continue to review the whole of the=20
operation,'' Haslam said.=20

As well as introducing an electronic trading platform to run alongside but=
=20
not replace open-outcry trading and the inter-office telephone market, the=
=20
LME also demutualised late in 2000 and reconstituted its board.=20

Traders said another extension was unlikely as there was no unanimity among=
=20
the 12 RDMs. Also, such a move would meet opposition from the LME's 27=20
associate broker clearing members (ABCMs). These companies have all the=20
rights of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry sessions.=
=20

Then they largely become customers of the market and trade through the RDMs=
.=20

``The current extension means that they (ABCMs) have lost a lot of their=20

Nigeria races against time to end power outages

Enron has the task of providing 270 megawatts (MW) of emergency electricity=

STATE MONOPOLY A FAILURE=20
The state power monopoly, the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) has=
=20
become a by-word for inefficiency in Nigeria where some households can be=
=20
without electricity for months.=20

The $800 million Enron project is the initiative of Governor Bola Tinubu,=
=20
whose territory covers the sprawling metropolis of Lagos, with a population=
=20
of more than 10 million inhabitants.=20

NEPA now produces just over half the 4,000 MW which it estimates is the=20
minimum Nigeria needs. Some 40 percent of that is consumed by Lagos, the=20
country's industrial hub in the southwest.=20

The most visible part of the work involves laying a 10-km (six-mile) stretc=
h=20
of pipeline that will collect natural gas from a station in the Ikorodu=20
district of Lagos state to fire Enron's barge-mounted electricity generatin=
g=20
plants anchored at a small jetty near Egbin.=20

Also in full steam are contracts awarded by the federal government to fulfi=
l=20
President Olusegun Obasanjo's pledge to end power outages nationwide by=20
December this year.=20

After two countrywide blackouts early last year, an angry Obasanjo went on=
=20
state television to apologise to the nation. He sacked NEPA's management an=
d=20
took direct charge of plans to boost electricity supply.=20
Obasanjo, who was elected in May 1999 at the end of 15 years of military=20
rule, faces re-election in 2003. Many Nigerians believe his chances depend=
=20
largely on how he delivers on his promise of uninterrupted power supply.=20

Close to the Enron site lies Nigeria's biggest power station, the Lagos=20
Thermal Power Station at Egbin. NEPA workers have been clearing sites there=
=20
for equipment due to be shipped in by the Japanese engineering firm Maruben=
i.=20

The company won the federal contract to overhaul two Egbin generating units=
=20
of 220 MW capacity each in the thermal plant.=20

Similar projects are in progress to refurbish rusty generating plants=20
neglected by ruling generals.=20

TOUGH TASK=20
Obasanjo has set NEPA the tough target of raising electricity output to 4,0=
00=20
MW by the end of this year.=20
``It is not going to be easy, but we are achieving this target by end of th=
is=20
year,'' said NEPA spokesman Mohammed Mousa-Booth.=20

Electricity generation reached a new record peak of 2,600 MW in the first=
=20
week of January, he said. The previous highest level of 2,460 MW was last=
=20
attained in 1996.=20

Other international companies involved in Nigeria's electricity programme=

Team Canada assists China's power monopolists=20
Financial Post - Canada; Feb 15, 2001
BY GRAINNE RYDER

Team Canada's host in China, Premier Zhu Rongji, has performed miracles in=
=20
restructuring much of China's debt-ridden state sector. Burdened with=20
hundreds of thousands of decrepit state companies that could neither repay=
=20
their debts nor create new jobs, Mr. Zhu shut down thousands of money-losin=
g=20
coal mines, textile factories, and steel works, slashing 12 million jobs in=
=20
the last three years. He gave the military five months to divest its busine=
ss=20
empire of trading companies, luxury hotels, and nightclubs. He granted citi=
es=20
greater autonomy to run their own affairs -- a move credited with improving=
=20
the country's investment climate and providing new incentives for=20
environmental cleanup. The Far Eastern Economic Review describes his reform=
s=20
as "the largest transfer of industrial property since Mao Zedong nationaliz=
ed=20
industry in the 1950s."=20

But Mr. Zhu's plans to bring competition to the last big holdout of the=20
monopolists -- China's power industry -- have stalled. China's old guard ha=
s=20
decided to make its stand for central rule in the power sector and it has=
=20
found an important Western ally: Canada.=20

Under Mr. Zhu's plans, the power industry would no longer be run as a=20
monopoly. State power companies operating hydro dams and nuclear stations=
=20
would have to compete with private power companies for access to customers.=
=20
Consumers would need to pay for transmission costs as well as generation=20
costs, giving local power producers -- who don't need to ship power a great=
=20
distance -- a major cost advantage over distant suppliers.=20

If Mr. Zhu and his reformers succeed in implementing this plan, China's=20
multi-billion dollar hydro and nuclear empires -- long subsidized by Canadi=
an=20
taxpayers -- could face bankruptcy. Even without these reforms being fully=
=20
implemented, the state power industry, a bastion of central planning, knows=
=20
that it cannot find willing customers for power from its hydro dams and=20
nuclear plants.=20

Chinese officials now openly doubt whether the Three Gorges dam, backed by=
=20
Canada's Export Development Corporation, will be able to sell all its outpu=
t=20
when it starts generating power in 2003. The provinces and cities slated to=
=20
buy its power either already have enough power, or they prefer to have the=
=20
private sector build local power plants to meet future demand.=20

Other large government-run hydro projects face the same predicament. The=20
US$3.5-billion Ertan dam, built with Canadian grants and World Bank loans,=
=20
has run at an annual loss of US$120-million since it came online in 1998. I=
t,=20
too, can't find enough customers. Its largest prospective customer, Chongqi=
ng=20
municipality, balked at buying its overpriced power. The newly built=20
US$4-billion Xiaolangdi dam, again backed by Canada and the World Bank, can=
't=20
find customers either. As the retired deputy general manager of the Three=
=20
Gorges Project Corporation recently explained to China Business Times,=20
provincial governments and municipalities favour local power plants over th=
e=20
central government's distant hydro dams because local plants produce=20
lower-cost power and, when they're privately owned, generate local tax=20
revenue.=20

Under pressure from residents who are tasting democracy and making=20
environmental demands, cities are also switching from coal to cleaner-burni=
ng=20
gas -- but rarely with the help of Canada. The city of Lanzhou, on the Worl=

e=20
city's inefficient industrial boilers. Already, five major Chinese cities=
=20
have built their own natural gas networks to promote private investment in=
=20
gas-fired power plants.=20

While Canada partners with China's aging monopolists to push outdated,=20

IMAGINE this. You are running a company and sign a long-term contract with =
a=20
supplier. You guarantee the supplier you will buy at least 90 per cent of=
=20
everything he produces. In case you fail to buy up to 90 per cent of the=20
supplier's plant capacity then you agree to pay a penalty to the supplier.=
=20

The absolute quantum you have to pay is determined, among other factors, by=
=20
the rupee-dollar rate as well as the prices of certain commodities in the=
=20
international market. Under the terms of the contract, you agree to shoulde=
r=20
both these risks.

In case you fail to pay your supplier who, incidentally, is supplying only=
=20
about a fifth of your total requirements, the contract mortgages all your=
=20
assets as well the assets of your parent company. The contract also=20
guarantees that in case you fail to pay the supplier, your parent company=
=20
will be forced to pay the supplier and then deduct it from the revenues due=
=20
to your company.=20

As if all this is not enough, the contract also stipulates that it is not=
=20
governed by Indian laws and that the parent company will continue to pay th=
e=20
supplier even if the contract is termed illegal, invalid or unenforceable.=
=20

The supplier starts his operations and given the nature of the contract, th=
e=20
product is extremely high-priced and your company is not in a position to=
=20
pay. What would you do?=20

"Are you stupid? I would never sign a contract like that." "If my company=
=20
even got a hint that I was contemplating signing a contract like this, I=20
would be sacked and legal proceedings initiated against me," were some of t=
he=20
reactions I got when I put this proposal to some of my friends from the=20
corporate circles.=20

Why is it then that the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the Maharashtr=
a=20
Government as well as the Union Government have got into such an agreement=
=20
with the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporation? Were they all really=20
concerned about the power situation in Maharashtra or were there other unsa=
id=20
imperatives?=20

We will perhaps never get the answers to these questions, but as DPC evoked=
=20
the Central counter-guarantee for its payment, the controversial project ha=
s=20
once again become the focus of media attention.=20
Last week was full of stories and discussions on the controversy from=20
day-to-day news reports, to a lengthy feature in the India Business Report.=
=20
But the most interesting one was on India Talks on CNBC and featured Mr Har=
ry=20
Dhaul, Director-General of the Independent Power Producers' Association, an=
d=20
Mr Abhay Mehta, activist and author of Power Play, an "expose" of the Enron=
=20
project.=20

Anchored by Mr Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the discussion kicked off by talking=
=20
about the options open to the various parties involved. Mr Dhaul,=20
understandably considering his constituency, was of the opinion that the=20
first thing to do is honour the contract. He believed it was possible for a=
ll=20
parties concerned to come to some kind of an amicable solution. Mr Guha=20
Thakurta interrupted to ask him whether the Maharashtra Government going=20
bankrupt by honouring the contract was an amicable solution. Mr Dhaul's=20
answer was a classic case of using numbers to confuse the issue. "I do not=
=20
know whether by adding five per cent of the capacity the Maharashtra=20
government will go bankrupt," he said.=20

Reacting to this, Mr Mehta pointed out that for this additional five per ce=
nt=20
capacity that Mr Dhaul talked about, the MSEB would be shelling out about 3=
0=20
per cent of its revenues and once the second phase of DPC came on stream, t=
he=20
MSEB would be paying out close to 70 per cent of its total revenues. "There=
=20
is no set of conceivable economic parameters which can allow payments of th=
is=20
magnitude," he said.=20

Mr Mehta pointed out that what has never been appreciated is the sheer amou=
nt=20
of money involved. The total contract with DPC is worth $35 billion, "the=
=20
single-largest commercial contract in the history of this country," as Mr=
=20
Mehta described it and went on to say that if one assumed a 6.5 per cent=20
annual depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, as it has happened ove=
r=20
the last 50 years, it meant a total outlay of - hold your breath - Rs 400,0=
00=20
crore.=20

When Mr Dhaul started to ask whether it meant that the country was not in a=
=20
position to accept foreign investment of $2- 3 billion, Mr Guha Thakurta,=
=20
again to his credit, interrupted to say the issue was not really the quantu=
m=20
of foreign investment as the terms at which it has been contracted.=20

Mr Mehta disputed the claim that DPC has invested $3 billion or about Rs=20
15,000 crore for a 2,000 MW project. "Are they out of their minds?=20

Who has checked these figures," he asked, pointing out that internationally=
,=20
the norm for power projects was Rs 2 crore per MW. "There is no way they ha=
ve=20
invested more than $1.5 billion," he said. Mr Thakurta, with a wicked grin =
on=20
his face, interrupted to ask him whether he was including the $20 million=
=20
that Ms Linda Powers of Enron had said been spent on educating Indian=20
authorities. Second, Mr Mehta said that almost 60 per cent of the investmen=
ts=20
has come from India from institutions such as the IDBI, SBI, etc.=20

"We have an absurd situation when a country like Mozambique orders equipmen=
t=20
from the US and the US EXIM bank gives a loan for it without any guarantees=
.=20
But the US EXIM Bank's loans to Enron have been guaranteed by Indian=20
institutions," Mr Mehta said.=20

Mr Dhaul, while eventually agreeing that power from DPC was more expensive,=
=20
said that the regulator in Maharashtra has made certain observations about=
=20
it. He said he was not worried about the merit or dispatch aspect of the=20
issue. Mr Dhaul was, of course, referring to the Maharashtra Electricity=20
Regulatory Commission's direction to the MSEB to buy power from the cheapes=
t=20
available sources. But the problem is that, irrespective of whether the MSE=
B=20
buys power from Enron or not, the PPA stipulates that it still has to=20
continue paying. A point that maybe not Mr Dhaul, but all citizens of=20
Maharashtra should be worried about.=20

Mr Dhaul went on say that he shared Mr Mehta's concerns about the cost of=
=20
electricity, and felt that some sort of solution could be found. But he lef=
t=20
the critical issue unsaid. Where is the money?=20
How is the Maharashtra Government going to pay the absurd amounts of money=
=20
that it has contracted for?=20

Enron Saga: Power of political will on test
Rajesh Ramachandran

NEW DELHI: Is there a way out of the Enron imbroglio? Contrary to what=20
`experts' and the government say, there seem several options available to t=
he=20
government. But to avail them would require some political will.=20

S N Roy, former chairman of the Central Electricity Authority, points out=
=20
that just as Pakistan got a US power company to reduce its tariff by half,=
=20
India too should get the Enron tariff reduced.

When asked whether it is ready to re-negotiate the power purchase agreement=
=20
(PPA) and bring down the tariff, Enron did not respond. Instead, a public=
=20
relations agency replied that ``tariffs are not high''.=20

Observers assert that even after ensuring a reasonable profit for Enron, th=
e=20
tariffs can be cut. K K Govil, director projects, Power Finance Corporation=
=20
insists, ``The present PPA is heavily in favour of Enron. The PPA should be=
=20
re-negotiated to get capital costs and rate of return calculated in rupees=
=20
and not dollars.''=20

According to Govil, pegging the costs and tariffs to foreign exchange is=20
unheard of. ``The capacity related incentive should also go. Ideally, the=
=20
cost of a gas-based plant should be half that of a coal-fired plant.=20
But in Enron's case it is not so. This too has to be rectified,'' said Govi=
l.=20

The government is tight-lipped, but sources say the government may palm off=
=20
the burden to utlilities like National Thermal Power Corporation, Power=20
Trading Corporation or Power Grid Corporation. That will end the public=20
scrutiny of the project, contrary to what is happening in Maharashtra now,=
=20
and the account will be shared by central utilities, state electricity boar=
ds=20
and others. Also making the round is a politically powerful industrial=20
house's name, which might broker the deal.=20

But will all this help? Roy feels it would be a disaster: ``Impossible. How=
=20
can the government force NTPC or PTC, a commercial enterprise, to buy power=
=20
at Rs 5 a unit and sell it at Rs 2?'' Even at full capacity, Enron's power =
is=20
expected to cost around Rs 5 a unit, much higher than the NTPC's selling ra=
te=20
of about Rs 2 per unit.=20

Prasant Bhushan, fighting a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court=
,=20
has another set of solutions: Nationalise the project by an Act of=20
Parliament, paying Enron a token or fair amount as in the case of bank=20
nationalisation. Or, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's=20
statutory power should be invoked to override the PPA and regulate the=20
tariffs.=20

The Supreme Court had earlier limited the petition's scope to accountabilit=
y=20
of the public servants. ``If the SC gives full leave, the project will be=
=20
voided since there was much illegality involved. Most importantly, if a=20
criminal investigation into the bribes is initiated, enough evidence could =
be=20
unearthed in three months,'' said Bhushan.=20

Will all this deter foreign investment in India? Ashok Rao, convenor of=20
national working group for power, feels the bogey of foreign investment=20
fleeing is a blackmail tactic. He points out that India is a bigger power=
=20
industry market than most of Europe, West Asia or Latin America. ``There is=
 a=20
global recession in power industry. So, most private power companies are ju=
st=20
a front for power equipment manufacturers who have to sell their equipment =
in=20
India. That is why they insist there should be no competitive bidding for=
=20
equipment.'' Would it hurt much if the government synchronised people's nee=
ds=20
with investor priorities?


Making the power sector viable

The fact that Enron had to invoke the Central government's guarantee before=
=20
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board finally paid its dues till November=
=20
shows that both the MSEB and the Maharashtra government are comprehensively=
=20
bankrupt. The MSEB paid because the Maharashtra government realised that=20
pushing the burden onto New Delhi would not get it off the hook. The=20
counterguarantee ensured that the Centre would pay Enron and deduct the mon=
ey=20
from Maharashtra's annual plan allocation. So why did Mumbai create the=20
confrontation?=20

If one were to go by the ranting of Maharashtra politicians , it was to mak=
e=20
sure that there would be `no more Enrons', that is, no more corrupt deals=
=20
with rapacious foreign investors, bent upon robbing the poor people of Indi=
a=20
by forcing them to pay seven rupees a unit for power. But the true reason i=
s=20
that the Maharashtra government was trying to shift the blame for its own=
=20
lack of courage. Like virtually every other State government, Maharashtra=
=20
lacks the courage to stop giving electricity free, or nearly free, to more=
=20
than three quarters of its consumers. This has plunged the MSEB deep into t=
he=20
red, because there is an obvious limit to how far the remaining paying=20
consumers can subsidise the rest.

The CEO of Enron in India put this in a nutshell a few days ago when he=20
pointed out that the MSEB's problems arose from the fact that it was=20
subsidising 90 per cent of its consumers and allowing transmission and=20
distribution losses - an euphemism for power theft - of fully one third of=
=20
the power it generated. As if this was not bad enough, the Government=20
repeatedly declared an amnesty for consumers who had not paid their bills.=
=20
The MSEB has therefore sunk deeper and deeper into the red. To cut its cost=
s=20
it has bought as little as possible from Enron, and that has pushed the per=
=20
unit cost of Dabhol power into the stratosphere. Enron's argument is=20
unassailable. Every single power utility in the world follows one basic rul=
e=20
in power pricing. This is to set a tariff that covers the average cost of=
=20
generation for all the stations that are on line at the time. When a new=20
power plant is added, or an old one replaced, the much higher cost of=20
generation from the new plant (the marginal cost to the utility) is absorbe=
d=20
by raising the average tariff just enough to absorb the increased cost at t=
he=20
margin. In the case of Maharashtra, since the Dabhol plant added 6 per cent=
=20
to the State's total generating capacity and amounted to about 8 per cent o=
f=20
MSEB's capacity, an 8 per cent increase in average tariff or in the=20
realisation of unpaid dues, would have sufficed. But although the MSEB had=
=20
been increasing its average tariffs in earlier years, it did not do so=20
between 1997-98 and 1998-99, that is, when Dabhol was commissioned. Add to=
=20
this a rise in T&D losses, and MSEB's average realisation actually fell aft=
er=20
Dabhol came on line.=20

If Maharashtra does not want to buy Dabhol's power, why does it not sell th=
e=20
surplus to a neighbouring State or to the National Thermal Power Corporatio=
n=20
in the public sector? The answer is that none of them has kept its average=
=20
tariff realisation above the average cost of generation. They too will add =
to=20
their losses by buying Dabhol power, and therefore prefer load shedding=20
instead.=20

The difficulty that Enron is experiencing in recovering its dues has=20
delivered the coup de grace not just to foreign, but to all private=20
investment in power projects. For if it takes a dentist's tongs to extract=

of adding at most 3000 MW of generating capacity a year when the country=20
needs three times that capacity, economic growth will soon slow to a snail'=
s=20
pace for want of power.=20

The Central government knows this. Since 1996 it has been prodding the Stat=
e=20
governments towards breaking up the State electricity boards into separate=
=20
generation, transmission and distribution companies, and then privatising=
=20
them. But so far only one State - Orissa - has gone the whole way. The cris=
is=20
that the country therefore faces is that while at the present pace the=20
privatisation of distribution could take as long as ten years, the power=20
crisis is already here. What the country needs is a means to make the State=
=20
electricity boards viable today, before they are privatised. So far, apart=
=20
from making the States bind themselves to various financial reforms in the=
=20
memoranda of understanding that they have signed with the Centre as they as=
k=20
for doles to tide them over their financial woes, the Central Government ha=
s=20
done nothing.=20

There is, however, a way to do this almost immediately. This is to end the=
=20
theft of power that is taking place in the country in the name of the farme=
r.=20
In sharp contrast to the privatisation of the SEBs, this can be accomplishe=
d=20
in at most two years.=20

While everyone knows that some of the electricity supposedly consumed by th=
e=20
farmer is actually diverted to other uses, most people have assumed that th=
e=20
proportion diverted is relatively small. This is because the rise in the=20
share of electricity consumed by the rural sector, from 14 per cent in 1978=
=20
to 31 per cent in 1995, seems on the face of it reasonable.=20

Not everyone has realised that in absolute terms, farm consumption increase=
d=20
by 8.3 times. And this happened when the number of electrified tubewells ha=
d=20
only doubled from 3.3 million to 6.3 million and the land under irrigation=
=20
had increased by only 48 per cent. In absolute terms therefore electricity=
=20
consumption for agriculture should not have risen by more than three times.=

Had the States realised only Rs. 2 per unit for this electricity, it would=

have increased the revenue of the SEBs by Rs. 18,000 crores, and made them=

agriculture for fear of hurting the farmers. But the Central Government can=

show them a simple way of continuing to subsidise irrigation, which is=20
overwhelmingly the main consumer of electricity on the farm, without=20
encouraging wholesale diversion and theft. This is to issue registration=20
papers for every electrified pumpset in the country, stating its horsepower=

and the land cultivated by the farmer, raise the rural tariff to a flat Rs.=
 2=20
per unit, or whatever the SEBs deem appropriate, and offer a rebate of Rs.=

1.75 (the going rate of subsidy) on the estimated maximum consumption of=20

There's little argument that existing deregulation has not only failed, but=

has failed so profoundly that politicians and regulators are not talking as=

"Deregulation has gotten to be such a bad word," said state Sen. Bill=20
Finkbeiner a Kirkland Republican who in 1996 chaired the Legislature's Ener=

Committee, which rejected deregulation. "It's never going to happen now, at=

For all of us, the power crisis has become a lesson in how policies of=20

"Here's how it is," said Ed Mosey, a Bonneville Power Administration=20

Gov. Gary Locke, who is often reluctant to publicly criticize allies such a=

"We didn't make the same decision they did," Locke said. "But California's=

Great Depression.=20
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal gave the Northwest the bargain o=
f=20
a lifetime. Hoping to lift the nation out of the Depression, the Roosevelt=
=20
administration arranged an unprecedented series of public works projects,=
=20
providing jobs building roads, bridges and dams, among other things, across=
=20
the nation.=20

The Works Progress Administration built the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dam=
s=20
on the Columbia River, the vanguard of the 29 federal hydroelectric dams th=
at=20
now feed power to the Bonneville Power Administration, a self-supporting=20
federal authority with headquarters near Portland.=20

The BPA is the powerhouse of a region the size of Texas, providing half of=
=20
all electricity used in the Northwest. The remainder comes from a network o=
f=20
public and private utilities, including giants like Seattle City Light that=
=20
pre-date Bonneville by decades.=20

All told, there are about 250 big and small hydroelectric dams in the=20
Northwest, and a far smaller number of coal and gas-fired plants.=20

In the early days, the BPA dams generated so much more power than the=20
Northwest could use that congressmen joked that even the jackrabbits could =
be=20
wired up. During World War II, the government took advantage of the plentif=
ul=20
power by building aluminum production plants in Tacoma, Spokane and Vancouv=
er=20
to supply the needs of aircraft makers and shipbuilders such as The Boeing=
=20
Co. in Seattle and Henry Kaiser's shipyard in Portland.=20

After the war, BPA officials and local politicians persuaded the aluminum=
=20
producers to stay put, promising continued low-cost, subsidized power -=20
contracts recently renewed to run through 2006.=20

For local industry, cheap power has always been a selling point. No raw=20
materials used in making aluminum are found in the Northwest, but shipping=
=20
them here is cost-effective because smelting the ore takes a lot of juice.=
=20
One aluminum plant consumes as much electricity as a small city.=20

In the 1960s, this newly powerful local industry secured its first major=20
coup: a federal mandate that public utilities in the region, such as Seattl=
e=20
City Light, could buy power at the subsidized cost of production. Sixty=20
percent of that "preference power" stays in Washington state. Oregon=20
generally takes 25 percent. The balance goes to Idaho and Montana, and any=
=20
surplus can be sold at market rate.=20

This combination of natural resources, federal investment and populist=20
politics has allowed the Northwest to enjoy some of the cheapest electricit=
y=20
in the nation. A 1998 BPA survey showed that the average residential cost f=
or=20
power in the region was 5.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with a=20
nationwide average of 8.3 cents, a rate that - at least until now - has=20
continued to attract industry to the region. In 1999, when Seattle resident=
s=20
were paying $10 monthly electricity bills, the same amount of power on the=
=20
East Coast sometimes cost as much as $40.=20

"Much of the high-tech relocation up here directly was linked to cheap=20
power," said Intel's director of governmental relations, Richard Hall. Inte=
l=20
employs 2,000 people at its plant in DuPont.=20

While rates have gone up recently, power in the Northwest remains a good=20
deal. City Light residential customers, for example, pay 3.23 cents per=20
kilowatt hour for the first 16 kilowatt hours they use in a day, and 7.56=
=20
cents for each kilowatt hour afterward.=20

In 1968 and 1969, the BPA completed an 846-mile line called an intertie=20
between The Dalles, Ore., and Los Angeles, allowing it to market what seeme=
d=20
like a never-ending surplus of power to utilities in fast-growing Californi=
a.=20

In 1996, BPA sold about 127,000 megawatt-hours for use in California, or=20
about 12 percent of all BPA power sales that year - the most recent year=20
Bonneville reported those numbers. It takes about 1,000 megawatts of=20
generating capacity to serve 1 million homes.=20

Public utilities in California are small, but two giant private,=20
investor-owned companies rival Bonneville in size. Monopolies regulated by=
=20
the state, California giants Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern=20
California Edison (CalEd) eventually grew to serve a combined 20 million=20
customers, making them the nation's two largest private utilities.=20

During the summer, when air conditioners cause California power use to peak=
,=20
utilities there supplement their needs by turning to the Northwest, which=
=20
usually has electricity to spare. In winter, when furnaces cause demand to=
=20
peak in the Northwest, California plants ship surplus power north. The=20
relationship worked flawlessly for decades. In fact, it worked too well.=20

With the West Coast tied into one grid, the easy flow of power between=20
regions allowed the states to avoid the politically difficult chore of siti=
ng=20
and building new power plants that would allow each to become=20
self-sufficient, even as the total population in the three states blossomed=
=20
from 25.5 million in 1970 to 43.2 million today.=20

In the mid-1990s, California began climbing out of a recession brought on b=
y=20
deep defense cuts, high unemployment and energy prices that were among the=
=20
highest in the nation, inadvertently driven up by state and federal=20
regulators who feared that oil and natural gas prices would soar. These=20
officials had pushed the utilities to diversify their generation methods. T=
he=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required that they buy a portion of=20
their power from what were then expensive alternative sources, such as wind=
=20
and geothermal plants. CalEd estimates that the order has cost its customer=
s=20
$25 billion over two decades.=20

California business interests began to pressure their lawmakers to deregula=
te=20
the power industry, allowing them to buy electricity on the open market and=
=20
to force PG&E and CalEd to cut rates. Congress wrote the law in 1992, and t=
he=20
energy commission pressured the utilities to get moving in 1994.=20
In December 1995, the California Public Utilities Commission voted to open=
=20
the state's electricity industry to competition. The Legislature followed=
=20
with a law based on an agreement brokered with CalEd, its biggest industria=
l=20
customers and an association of independent power producers.=20

But the deal was based on four colossal miscalculations. And those led to t=
he=20
current crisis:=20
No one foresaw that California's economy would come roaring back from=20
recession so strongly or so quickly, or that so much of the new economy wou=
ld=20
depend on energy-hungry computers and the plants that produce them. Both=20
factors over-taxed a system that hadn't seen a new power plant come online=
=20
for nearly a decade.=20

California generates about 75 percent of the electricity it uses, relying o=
n=20
imports from the Southwest and the Northwest for the rest. Officials=20
acknowledge that California has not added enough power plants to accommodat=
e=20
the roughly 2 percent annual growth in its demand for electricity. To meet=
=20
that each year, the state has to add either 1,000 megawatts of generating=
=20
capacity or conserve an equal amount.=20

Regulators forced California utilities to sell their generation divisions=
=20
without also requiring them to sign long-term power contracts at fixed - an=
d=20
presumably lower - rates. This put the utilities at a disadvantage, because=
=20
they had to buy power on the open or "spot" market from operators such as=
=20
Houston-based as Enron and Dynegy, which have reportedly seen revenues clim=
b=20
by 400 percent in the past two years while the utilities spiraled into debt=
.=20

A combination of factors cut into the amount of power available on the spot=
=20
market. Less power has been flowing into the grid because several major=20
California power plants have been off-line for needed repairs; Northwest=20
hydroelectric dams have been operating at lower capacity as they try to avo=
id=20
draining reservoirs during the drought; and a failure to upgrade California=
's=20
distribution system makes it hard to move surplus power to where it is=20
needed.=20

In fact that failure to upgrade the transmission system has proven to be a=
=20
problem of the same scale as the lack of new power plants. California's fir=
st=20
rolling blackout was caused not by a lack of power but by a lack of free=20
lines to move it. Washington has missed blackouts because it has enough=20
capacity to move power when needed.=20

While attorneys general in all three states are investigating accusations=
=20
that some power sellers have been withholding electricity to drive up price=
s,=20
it's unclear whether they did, or whether any laws were broken.=20

With deregulation, the spot market has taken on the trappings of a desperat=
e=20
auction. Every morning, the power marketers pay what they must for whatever=
=20
surplus power they can find. Wholesale prices can swing wildly, climbing an=
d=20
falling hundreds of dollars per megawatt- hour over a day of trading.=20

When California's demand began to outstrip its supply last summer, San Dieg=
o=20
was hit first. The Northwest barely noticed. But as the problem spread, the=
=20
power that Bonneville and Puget Sound Energy once bought for winter coverag=
e=20
wasn't there. Local prices began inching up.=20

Finally, and some would say most important, California's deregulation schem=
e=20
included a cap on rates for consumers. In fact, the Legislature there force=
d=20
a 10 percent retail rate cut as part of the deal to win passage of=20
deregulation. These errors and circumstances, combined with some corporate=
=20
restructuring that shifted resources away from traditional lines of busines=
s,=20
forced California's big utilities to amass a combined debt of $12.7 billion=
,=20
severely limiting their ability to buy power and prompting the recent round=
=20
of blackouts in Northern California.=20

"Do you see the problem there?" asked Mosey, the BPA spokesman. "It didn't=
=20
allow the market to function. It gave consumers zero incentive to conserve.=
=20
If you had to devise a method whereby you shot yourself in both feet, you=
=20
couldn't do a better job."=20

California lawmakers are trying to undo the damage. They have appropriated=
=20
billions of dollars in emergency funding to keep the utilities afloat while=
=20
they consider a more expensive bailout and re- regulation scheme that might=
=20
involve turning PG&E and CalEd into public utilities - exactly the opposite=
=20
of the intent of deregulation.=20

Deregulation was initially popular in Washington state, but it never had th=
e=20

o=20
Bonneville and public utilities.=20

Rentable Storage: Efficient But Risky
Michael Alexander

CMP TechWeb
Copyright 2001 CMP Media Inc.

EMC, Enron, Exodus, Sun, and other big companies are throwing their weight=
=20
behind storage services, promising to help deliver storage capacity much li=
ke=20
utilities furnish electricity.=20

But a looming market shakeout makes it more vital than ever for companies t=
o=20
scrutinize providers before committing to a contract.

Some customers already are seeking to protect their data with service-level=
=20
agreements (SLAs) that compensate them when their storage service provider=
=20
fails to deliver as promised. Experts also recommend examining a provider's=
=20
market capitalization, expertise, reference accounts, and all the other=20
attributes a company would typically consider when choosing a strategic IT=
=20
partner.=20

Storage service providers, or SSPs, claim to remove many headaches of=20
managing storage. Customers don't have to invest in their own storage=20
infrastructure and personnel, so SSPs can be a cheaper and faster way to ge=
t=20
started. Customers buy only as much capacity as they need.=20

The cost of buying and managing a storage system was so prohibitive that=20
Verilytics Inc. signed on with StorageNetworks, which charges the Web porta=
l=20
builder about $12,500 per month for 200 Gbytes of storage.=20

"Because they have a pay-as-you-go model, it allowed us to get in at a fair=
ly=20
low entry point," said Mike Harvey, head of operations at Verilytics. "As o=
ur=20
needs require, we can add additional capacity."=20

Verilytics signed an SLA with StorageNetworks that specifies financial=20
penalties for unplanned downtime based on the length of an outage. In fact,=
=20
nearly half of 297 companies surveyed by Dataquest say they're willing to p=
ay=20
SSPs extra for agreements that compensate them for lost revenue due to=20
downtime or service problems.=20

Increasing numbers of customers are even demanding SLAs per application typ=
e.=20

"Unless these storage companies are making appropriate investments so they=
=20
can guarantee per-application SLAs, they're going to meet some resistance=
=20
from potential customers," said Sage Research president Kathryn Korostoff.=
=20

The range of SSP options varies widely. For example, to keep data in-house=
=20
because of security or privacy concerns, a company may elect to have the=20
vendor provide remote storage management.=20

Companies pay about $20,000 per month per terabyte for basic=20
storage-on-demand. Additional features=01*such as scheduled backup and rest=
ore,=20
real-time data replication and SLAs guaranteeing 99.99 percent uptime=01*ca=
n=20
push costs to more than $80,000 per month per terabyte. That figure include=
s=20
equipment, maintenance, floor space and personnel costs. StorageNetworks=20
quotes fees of $25,000 to $125,000 per month per terabyte, said John Clavin=
,=20
executive vice president of marketing.=20

A downside to outsourcing storage is that an organization is putting valuab=
le=20
digital assets into someone else's hands. The data may not be adequately=20
protected from snoops or secured against loss. And what happens to the data=
=20
if the SSP should suddenly go out of business? No one really knows.=20

"We tell our end-user clients to be very selective who they choose, and we=
=20
tell them to make sure they have very concrete, very well defined escape=20
clauses," said Arun Taneja, an analyst at the Enterprise Storage Group.=20

Brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co. prefers to maintain control of its huge=
=20
repository of customer data, said David Sherr, vice president of architectu=
re=20
and planning. Sherr questions the wisdom of trusting customer data to a thi=
rd=20
party. "It would be problematic," he said. "You need to protect the privacy=
=20
of your customers' data."=20

The initial SSP customers were mostly dot-coms, but in recent months more=
=20
Global 2000 enterprises have signed up, according to a recent survey by Sag=
e=20
Research. The survey found that 3 percent of businesses with fewer than 500=
=20
employees and 6 percent of larger enterprises outsource storage. "While tho=
se=20
numbers are small, they are significant because the category is still so=20
new," Korostoff said.=20

More than half of the 175 companies with which StorageNetworks has contract=
s=20
are large enterprises, Clavin said.=20

Several companies have jumped into storage services in recent months. Exodu=
s=20
Communications (stock: EXDS), Sun Microsystems (stock: SUNW), and=20
StorageNetworks (stock: STOR) said they plan to co-market managed storage=
=20
services delivered and hosted by Exodus. Pure SSPs include ManagedStorage,=
=20
Storability, and StorageWay.=20

Among application service providers that also host data are Conxion, Digex,=
=20
PSINet (stock: PSIX), and USInternetworking (stock: USIX). Storage vendors=
=20
such as Compaq (stock: CPQ), EMC (stock: EMC), IBM (stock: IBM), and Sun ha=
ve=20
storage services alliances with ASPs and other providers.=20

Even energy company Enron is getting into the business. Its Broadband=20
Services unit launched a B-to-B exchange on Jan. 31 that matches excess=20
capacity owned by SSPs with corporate storage buyers.=20

Enron has signed a deal with StorageNetworks and is negotiating similar=20
agreements with at least six other providers, said Ravi Thuraisingham, Enro=
n
's lead storage trader.=20

Many analysts see a massive consolidation on the horizon. "A lot of compani=
es=20
have gone into this business thinking that it's an easy business," Taneja=
=20
said. The economics of running an SSP profitably aren't well defined, Tanej=
a=20
said, and the long-term cost of building and regularly upgrading a=20
best-of-class storage infrastructure may be too onerous for many.=20

Meanwhile, the amount of data that companies amass is increasing=20
exponentially. Forrester Research predicts that companies will increase the=
ir=20
average online storage capacities by a factor of 10 over the next five year=
s.=20
That means storage and associated administration will grow from 5 percent o=
f=20
current information systems budgets to 17 percent in 2003, the firm=20
estimates.=20

And the business outlook for SSPs is rosy. North American businesses will=
=20
spend $6 billion on storage utilities by 2003, according to Dataquest.=20
Enterprise Storage forecasts a $11.2 billion market in 2004.

capital cost and plant load factor based on demand, etc.

Mr. Sharad Pawar, the architect of the project (and whose party is part of=

There are suggestions for Enron to go in for direct selling, bring in the=

If the power from Dabhol phase II is not going to be absorbed by Maharashtr=

the PTC, in view of the overall power shortage in the country, should, in=

We're inching closer to the day when we won't have to go to the video-renta=

Universal Studios announced on Wednesday that it will distribute new releas=
es=20
and extensive film archives through video-on-demand service Intertainer.=20
Subscribers to the digital cable channel will be able to choose among 300=
=20
movies from eight major movie studios at any time. The addition of Universa=
l=20
gives Intertainer the broadest selection of major motion pictures among=20
video-on-demand, or VOD, players, which include Blockbuster, CinemaNow and=

SightSound, and which is rolling out a service in partnership with Enron=20
Broadband.

"Intertainer is a terrific partner for our ongoing VOD efforts because of i=
ts=20
experience in the category," Holly Leff-Pressman, senior VP at Universal=20
Television & Networks Group, said in a statement.

Intertainer's deal with Universal comes as Hollywood mulls the digital futu=

=20
deliver their libraries over the Internet to consumers and movie theaters.=
=20
Sony's Web-based MovieFly system is gearing up for a spring launch, and=20
Disney also is said to have a VOD system in the works. The rest of the=20
studios are said to be in varying stages of talks with Sony or Disney.

Intertainer continues to make strides even though studios have a history of=
=20
despising the middleman. Blockbuster has long locked horns with the studios=
,=20
which have complained that the chain was reaping ancillary film revenues th=
ey=20
should have controlled.

By aligning with Intertainer, the studios are supporting a new middleman by=
=20
bolstering it with a larger selection of movies than their own services=20
likely will have. Antitrust concerns prevent the studios from grouping all=
=20
their content in a single jointly owned channel. But they also are better o=
ff=20
distributing their films to as many outlets as possible. "It's never been t=
he=20
studios' way to just sell movies to their own channels," said Jonathan=20

Intertainer is a relatively small competitor from an audience standpoint. T=
he=20
company was formed in 1997 and just launched its VOD service last spring. T=
he=20
service is currently available in Cincinnati and Willow Grove, Pa., and wil=
l=20
be rolled out in seven more cities by the end of summer.

Intertainer is offered as a service to digital cable subscribers in those=
=20
markets. Currently, there are fewer than 10,000 subscribers to Intertainer.

The deal was Universal's second VOD pact in as many days. On Tuesday,=20
Universal agreed to add its movies to Blockbuster's VOD service.
