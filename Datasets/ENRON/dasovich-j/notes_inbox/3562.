Karen:

I received a follow-up call today from the LA Chamber wanting to know if
anyone from Enron would participate in their June 5 forum on energy crisis.
There has been a change in the speaker from DWP. Instead of Frank Salas or
David Wiggs, Enrique Martinez, Assistant Director, DWP will attend.
Martinez acquires power on behalf of DWP.

If you are able to identify a speaker, the Chamber would like a bio so they
can provide their members with some background information on the speaker.

Thanks

Sandra
