Subject: California

I have heard twice now in two conferences that California is the perfect 
example of why restructuring/deregulation is undesirable and should not be 
instituted in India.  I typically speak up and state that the regulatory 
structure is mostly to blame for the operational difficulties (brown-outs, 
etc.) stating that the wires business remains regulated always.  I don't 
really have an answer for the soaring spot market prices in California.  Do 
we have any written explanation of the situation in California or could we 
write one?  It would be very helpful to us here.  As restructuring becomes 
more and more hotly debated, especially once the Electricity Bill is debated 
in Parliament, we will need this kind of support.  Thanks in advance.
