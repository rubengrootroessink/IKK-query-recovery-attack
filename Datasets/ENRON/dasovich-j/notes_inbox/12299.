I have electronic copies of the applications referenced in the below note
from ALJ Wong.  The servicing agreements between SDG&E and DWR and SCE and
DWR are (based on a cursory review) virtually the same.  The agreements seem
pretty straight forward.  The only area of real interests are the service
fees (i.e., the costs being assessed DWR by the UDCs for system changes
necessary to do the DWR billing and the ongoing costs of that billing).

Protests on the applications are due on Friday the 29th.  Let me know if you
would like copies of the applications.

Attached are two Chief ALJ Rulings shortening the protest and response time
to the applications filed by San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Southern
California Edison Company that were filed on June 22 and June 25,
respectively.  These applications address the servicing agreements to be
entered into between the California Dept. of Water Resources and these two
utilities.  Interested parties have until June 29, 2001 to file protests or
responses to the application, and the utilities have until July 2, 2001 to
