Vicki:  I got your message and I am attaching the brief memo we did in 
mid-January, which I assume is the one you were looking for.  This may be a 
bit dated, but I think it contains the "basics."  I have copied some of the 
other parties who I thought would want this.  Could I ask you to forward it 
to anyone else.  Thanks  John
