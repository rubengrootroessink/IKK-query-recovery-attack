Evening Students,

Find elusive numbers!
Prove your point every time!
Look like a genius!
Read Library Handouts!

Learn how to find statistics online and in print by attending the library
workshop "Finding Statistics" on Monday and Tuesday, March 5 and 6. Meet me
at the Reference Desk at Long Library at 7:40pm. We'll look at national and
international organizations that generate statistics and where they are
published in print and online. A handout to supplement your memory will be
provided.
