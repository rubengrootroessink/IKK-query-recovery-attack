Hi Everyone,

As you may know, each semester during the last instructional week of the
term, we host a series of thematic catered dinners for the EvMBA students
and faculty in the Wells Fargo Room during the 7:30 - 8:15 pm break. We
hope you will
join us, as it's a great time for the students and faculty to get together
on a very casual basis.

Tonight's feast will be a Salad Buffet.  Heathy living, it's not just for
rabbits.
