THIRD ANNUAL UC BERKELEY BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION LAUNCHES NOVEMBER 8
 The third annual UC Berkeley Business Plan Competition will officially 
launch on November 8 at 6:00 p.m. in the Arthur Andersen Auditorium. The main 
event will introduce the rules of the competition to attendees, and will be 
followed by a mixer giving entrepreneurs the opportunity to mingle and 
hopefully begin to form teams. All faculty, students, staff, and alumni of 
the Haas School and UC Berkeley, as well as members of the community, are 
invited to attend.

The UC Berkeley Competition has quickly established itself as the one of the 
leading entrepreneurship competitions in the country. In addition to access 
to venture capitalists and Silicon Valley business leaders, participants hone 
skills to turn ideas into fundable ventures through a series of workshops and 
mentorship. 

The purpose of the competition is to encourage the creation of viable and 
fundable business ventures. Teams from the previous two years have secured a 
total of $91.45 million in funding. The breakdown of the funding to date is:

THE REAL ESTATE & ECONOMICS SYMPOSIUM LOOKS AT TIMES AHEAD 
? The Haas School's Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics will 
examine issues of real estate and economic outlook in the face of changing 
demographics and e-commerce markets on Monday, November 13, at the Westin St. 
Francis Hotel in San Francisco.? This symposium continues a 23-year tradition 
of excellence and has become the premier west coast event for academics and 
practitioners in the field of real estate. 

Haas School faculty and faculty associates of the Fisher Center for Real 
Estate are invited to attend free of charge.? Students who wish to volunteer 
and help at the Symposium can also attend for free.

"This is an opportunity to hear some of the most successful and thoughtful 
people in the real estate industry," says symposium co-chairman Robert 
Edelstein, co-chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban 
Economics. Edelstein will moderate several of the day's panels along with 
symposium co-chairman Richard Wollack, chairman of the CB Richard Ellis' 
Global Capital Markets Group and member of the Fisher Center's Policy 
Advisory Board, who has been involved with the conference for 20 of its 23 
years.

Lawrence Chimerine, president of Radnor International Consulting, Inc., 
starts the day's presentations with a talk titled "Real Estate and Economic 
Outlook." Chimerine has been one of the premier forecasters of the economy 
for the past two decades. "Almost every person speaking is a brand name," 
says Edelstein. "It is designed for real estate professionals, but at the 
highest level. The conference is at the interface of academe and 
practitioners."

Later in the morning, Haas Lecturer Noel Nellis, partner at Orrick, 
Herrington, and Sutcliffe LLP, will moderate the "What's Happening in the 
California Real Estate Market?" panel, which will include Warren E. "Ned" 
Spieker, BS 66, chairman, Spieker Properties, and Douglas W. Shorenstein, 
president and CEO, Shorenstein Company, L.P. and a member of the Haas 
Advisory Board.

J.S. Holliday, historian, author, and director emeritus of the California 
Historical Society, kicks off the afternoon's panels with a speech on "The 
Origins of California's Image as America, Only More So." Holliday's latest 
research draws comparisons between the 1849 gold rush and "new gold rush" in 
Silicon Valley.? Haas Lecturer Lynn Sedway, executive managing director of 
Sedway Group, a division of CB Richard Ellis, will participate in the "Real 
Estate Financing and Investing" session. The complete agenda can be found at 
http://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate/.

Faculty who wish to attend, and students who wish to volunteer, should e-mail 
Zee Zeleski (zeleski@haas.berkeley.edu), who is handling the registrations. 
Please note that complimentary registrations are available only for Haas 
faculty and student volunteers. All other registration information can be 
found at http://haas.berkeley.edu/realestate.

INITIATIVE TO CONNECT ALUMNI AND STUDENTS IN THE WORKPLACE IS OFF TO A FAST 
START
 Begun as a pilot program this fall, a Haas School initiative that brings 
alumni and students together for learning and networking, has had great 
success in its first few months. Organized by Dan Israel, MBA 01 & MBAA VP 
for Alumni Affairs, with the support of the Haas Alumni Affairs Office and 
the Haas Alumni Network, "Haas at Work" brings small groups of Haas students 
to the workplace of alumni for a two-hour session to help build bridges 
between current students and the Haas alumni community. 

"It's been wonderful to see such a strong response from alumni interested in 
giving back to Haas. I'm hopeful this program will continue to build stronger 
ties between MBA students and alumni," says Israel.

The sessions give the alumni a chance to educate Haas students about their 
companies and industries. With just four to six students at each event, they 
are still manageable for the busy host companies and personal for the 
students.? "This visit to OffRoad was fantastic -- a highly informative, 
engaging meeting," says Ruthanne Feinberg, MBA 01, who participated in the 
program. "It was a great chance for us to discuss in a small group their 
business -- opportunities and challenges.? We also had access to high level 
executives, including the CEO."

Events have included speaking to the students over lunch; setting up brief 
presentations from different employees at a firm; or taking them on a tour of 
the office/facility. "Having the group of Haas students visit DigitalThink 
was great fun," says Jeff Marshall, performance consultant at DigitalThink, 
Inc. "The students' interest in and knowledge of the e-learning industry 
impressed me. It was also wonderful to give career advice and catch up on the 
latest happenings in the MBA program.? I can't wait for the next opportunity 
to have another group visit."

?The companies that have hosted or are scheduled to host students so far this 
fall include: Genesys Telecom Labs, Alliant Partners, Vitaminic, Versata, 
netcentives.com, DigitalThink, PRTM, netcustomer.com, Fireman's Fund 
Insurance Company, OffRoad Capital, Extensity, Flexsilicon, Tularik, 
ExchangeWave, CommerceOne, Wind River Systems, High Tech Business Decisions, 
What U Want, RestaurantPro.com, Centillium Communications, Dreyer's, AOL, 
Sporteum, Gap, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, EXP.com, Charles Schwab, and Visa.

To participate, as a student or as an alumni host, send e-mail to Dan Israel 
or call the Alumni Relations Office at (510) 642-7790. For more information, 
check out http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/alumni/involve/haasatwork.html.

HAAS IN THE NEWS
 A memorial article on the late John Harsanyi, professor emeritus and Nobel 
Laureate, written by Frederick E. Balderston, professor emeritus, appeared in 
the November issue of California Monthly. 

In the same issue, California Monthly also published a photo of Dean Laura 
Tyson and Paul Newman from his appearance at Haas in September. 

John Brennan, MBA 91, was profiled in Fortune's October 30 issue in an 
article titled "Impact Player." In the profile Brennan talks about his career 
path going from a partner-track consultant at Andersen to joining the startup 
Charitableway to becoming vice president for corporate strategy at Hewlett 
Packard. 

Dean Tyson's column in the October 30, BusinessWeek, "Earth to America: The 
World Won't Go Away," was about the American public's lack of interest in 
foreign issues, until they appear on the television screen. Tyson explained 
how globalization will continue to effect the lives of the average American.  
? NetBusiness Online reported on October 28 that Gruner+Jahr, a Bertelsmann 
company, has purchased a 10% stake in Handy.de, the German startup founded by 
Thorsten Rehling and Dirk Friese, MBAs 00, during their time at Haas. The 
article is available at 
http://www.net-business.de/startup/news.html?id=972741382.1&ssid=ba44641d4bc61
8bb4c512a898a09e3

Severin Borenstein, E.T. Grether Professor in Public Policy and Business 
Administration and director of the University of California Energy Institute, 
was quoted in the San Jose Mercury News on Friday, October 27. Borenstein 
explained that it is unlikely that the state will be able to recover from 
electricity generators the high profits they earned this summer in 
California. He added that the profits were due to market power exercised by 
some producers and that the state needs to assure that consumers can respond 
to high real-time prices by next summer.

The New York Times featured James Hong, MBA 99, and his new Web site 
AmIHotorNot.com in the article "Face Time with a Twist" on October 26. A 
previous article on AmIHotorNot ran in the London Observer.

Tyson was mentioned in the Kyodo News on October 25 for a report she 
co-authored, "Future Directions for US Economic Policy Toward Japan."

October 24, Tuesday, Borenstein did interviews on KCBS radio live and 6pm 
KPIX TV news. In both he commented that the record 3rd quarter earnings 
Chevron had just announced were due to the very high price of oil and the 
tight and insufficiently competitive gasoline markets in California.

Tyson was profiled in the Financial Times on October 23 in a piece on her 
first two years as dean. 

Professor M. Frances Van Loo's Contemporary Philanthropy class was mentioned 
in the September 18 issue of "Food for Thought," an online newsletter of
