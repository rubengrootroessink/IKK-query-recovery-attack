8. 529 College Savings Plan

----------------------------------------------------------------

529 College Savings plans offer an innovative way to save for
your child or grandchild's college education.  Unlike education
IRAs and custodial accounts, which place many financial and
other restrictions on both the contributor and the recipient,
529 Plans offer one of the most flexible ways to save for a
college education.  Also, contributions of up to $50,000
($100,000 per couple) to a student in a single year are free
from federal gift tax if no additional gifts are made to the
same person in the next four years.

Other benefits include:
* tax-advantaged growth
* high contribution limits per beneficiary
* qualified withdrawals taxed at student's rate

9. The Schwab 1000 Fund(R). -- Smart About Growth. Careful About
Taxes(TM).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you concerned about taxes? Perhaps you should consider a
tax-efficient mutual fund, such as the Schwab 1000 Fund(R) Since
the fund's inception in April 1991, the Schwab 1000 Fund(R) has
not paid a capital gain distribution. Of course, past
performance is no guarantee of future results. For a prospectus
containing more information on management fees, risks and
expenses,

Go to http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t12/eb_jan/sig/taxes/

Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

10. Apply for an IRA Online

----------------------------------------------------------------

An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is an important part of
retirement planning. It offers tax advantaged investment growth
which means your money can grow without being subject to current
taxation. Even if you have a company plan, you may still have an
IRA to give you an additional opportunity to invest in stocks,
mutual funds or bonds on a tax advantaged basis. You'll find all
the resources you need to apply for your IRA at schwab.com

Go to
http://schwab.ed4.net/go/t13/eb_jan/sig/IRA/

Remember, the deadline  is April 16, 2001 to fund your IRA for
tax year 2000. Don't wait until the last minute! Funding your
IRA with Schwab has never been easier.  Find the closest
location to send your Year 2000 contribution.

11. A Smart Time to Refinance?

----------------------------------------------------------------

You actively manage your investments to maximize returns. Do you
pay as much attention to your mortgage? You should. Housing is
the single biggest investment most of us ever make. To find out
if refinancing can save you money, check out the Mortgage
Check-Up at the Schwab Mortgage Center, provided by E-LOAN. It
will look at today's rates and can help you decide if now is the
time to refinance. You can also set up a free account to monitor
interest rates on a daily basis. If a better rate is available,
you'll be notified immediately via email. Try this simple tool
today.

12. Schwab Learning Center Announces New Courses on Taxes and
Stock Investing

----------------------------------------------------------------

The Learning Center recently released two new courses -- Tax
Smart Investing and Understanding Stocks. Tax Smart Investing
covers that all-important topic of taxation and tax-efficient
investing. The new course guides you through key tax-related
factors to consider when buying, selling or holding an
investment. Understanding Stocks is designed to teach you the
fundamentals of stock characteristics and terminology. Check
out these courses and more.

13. Update: The Big Switch to Decimal Quotes

----------------------------------------------------------------

In recent months,  you may  have noticed in the newspaper that
some securities are priced in decimals rather than fractions.
This is part of a gradual conversion process in which all stocks
and their underlying options will eventually quote and trade in
decimals. The process began in phases on September 5, 2000 with
a small group of  New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) securities and
continues until January 29, 2001, when the remainder of
NYSE-listed securities will convert to decimals. Soon after,
securities traded over-the-counter (OTC) will begin a phased
conversion.  All securities and their underlying options are
planned to be converted by April 9, 2001. Your Schwab statement
and trade confirms will not change as security pricing already
appears in decimal format. For more information about
decimalization,

16. Advice for Fifty Plus: Charles Schwab's New Book

----------------------------------------------------------------

In his new book, You're Fifty -- Now What? Investing for the
Second Half of Your Life (Crown Business 2001 ), Charles Schwab
helps you create a financial strategy that takes you from your
working years through retirement . "Retirement planning that may
have worked for earlier generations no longer works today," he
says. "Not only are people living longer, but they are also
healthier and more active - meaning that retirement tends to be
more costly." Schwab helps you navigate these life changes in a
clear, user-friendly style with numerous easy-to-follow
worksheets, tables and guidelines. Available in hardcover, as an
ebook, and in Random House Audiobook and Large Print Editions.
