Notes version of the Judge=01,s report and recommendation issued at 4:49 PM=

today.  Attached is the complete work. =20

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- =01&While the amount=

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa=

summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=

offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also=

 =20
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales =
in=20
the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge=01,s=20
recommendations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales=
=20
that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior=
=20
to delivery."=20

Evidentiary Hearing- =01&The differences between what the State of Californ=

believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what=

the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise=20
material issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential=20
refunds involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a=

=20
apply to the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for a=
n=20
answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track=
=20
schedule.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for=20
calculating potential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a=20
methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal=
=20
PX's spot markets in an after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event,=
=20
sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating=
=20
that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein=
=20
over the entire refund period.=018

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=
he=20
June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to=
=20
calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's=
=20
and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period Octob=
er=20
2, 2000 through May 28, 2001. =20

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates=20
(associated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order=
)=20
provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based=
=20
upon a daily spot gas price.  =01&In the event that the marginal unit is lo=
cated=20
in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate and=
=20
Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the=20
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If=
=20
the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas=
=20
price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by th=
e=20
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  The=
=20
daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Financia=
l=20
Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned delivery=20
points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the=20
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and=20
holidays).=018=20

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the=20
calculated market clearing price. =20

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the=20
market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may=
=20
subtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin=
g=20
price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E an=
d=20
SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=
=20
prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the=20
real-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated t=
he=20
same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge=
=20
recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for=20
calculating refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85%=20
non-emergency requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount th=
at=20
actual prices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be=20
recalculated.

Offsets-  =01&Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a=
=20
refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all=
=20
charges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding=20
amounts due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be=
=20
offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any =
of=20
their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period.=018

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless=
=20
the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.
