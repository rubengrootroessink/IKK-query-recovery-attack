Harry has asked that Robert Nuestaedter and myself represent our area in 
developing EGA regulatory hedge strategies where EES has taken a  significant 
retail position.  I have met with the Utility Risk Management folks to let 
them know we will help develop and execute strategies.  Some of the goals the 
URM desk has set for themselves includes regulatory participation.  We may be 
able to draw from them resources if needed.  I know all of you have been part 
of ongoing strategy development/execution so I just wanted to let you know 
what we are doing on this end.  Government Affairs Support (that would be 
Harry et. al.) has put together a business plan for EES support which 
includes some recurring reporting and utility tariff (rate schedule) 
analysis.  Harry will be presenting some of this info next week.  Just a 
heads-up.
