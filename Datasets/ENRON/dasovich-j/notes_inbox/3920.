I sent a reply a few hours ago.  I wonder if there is a problem with my
e-mail.


I'm driving.  If you need a ride, let me know and I can meet you on Market
and
Beale.

Haven't heard from Mark yet... Am waiting to hear before
printing and emailing to Tasker...

Mark, Jeff: Are any of you driving over to campus from
the city?

Looks great to me (although the slide animation did not work on my machine
so I can't comment on that)!

If we are all in agreement, someone needs to e-mail Sarah a copy and print
one out for her.  Can you do that Anil once you get an okay from Jeff and
Mark?  Thanks for all the hard work.

See everyone around 5:30pm in Jimmy Bean's.

Hi Team,

Here's the final cut.

I added hyperlinks to DCF sheets in backup as well as to
trading comps and deal comps in the backup. And animation
for slide turns.

Also, be sure to preview the 3-legged stool slide I added
after valuations in slide presentation mode with sound
enabled... Totally OK to remove it if any of you don't like
it...

Any Qs, call me on my cell: 916 600 1245.
