Power firms held in contempt=20
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 29, 2001)=20
A special legislative committee investigating electricity price manipulatio=
n=20
voted Thursday to hold two power companies in contempt for refusing to turn=
=20
over thousands of pages of documents.=20
By unanimously declaring Enron Corp. and Mirant in violation of its=20
subpoenas, the state Senate committee summoned powers that haven't been=20
invoked in the Legislature for more than 70 years.=20
As a result of the unusual move, power company executives could find=20
themselves facing jail time. Possible punishments include fines or the forc=
ed=20
turnover of documents.=20
"There isn't a lot of legal precedent," said the chairman of the committee,=
=20
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, after the hearing. "Jailing an individual is an=
=20
option, and we intend to preserve all of our options."=20
The committee is trying to determine whether electricity generators or=20
marketers have artificially inflated prices of wholesale electricity. Other=
=20
state agencies, including the attorney general's office and the Public=20
Utilities Commission, also have initiated investigations.=20
Under the committee's 5-0 decision, Mirant and Enron have until July 10 to=
=20
change course and turn over documents. If they do so, the contempt charges=
=20
will be expunged. If not, the committee will forward its contempt findings =
to=20
the full Senate, which will determine which punishments, if any, should be=
=20
levied.=20
As part of its investigation, the committee began requesting documents from=
=20
most generators in April. After receiving little or no response -- and=20
complaints from companies concerned about giving out proprietary informatio=
n=20
-- the panel issued subpoenas to several companies June 11.=20
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with=20
specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of companies'=20
transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. Telephone bills,=
=20
e-mail messages and personal appointment books also were requested.=20
Many of those companies did not respond to the subpoenas until the deadline=
=20
Thursday. Only two -- Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. -- actually=20
provided documents.=20
During the nearly four-hour meeting, Dunn interrupted the proceedings sever=
al=20
times to announce that various letters or documents arrived moments before.=
=20
For example, Dunn said midway through the hearing that Dynegy had just=20
delivered 18,603 documents to his Capitol office.=20
For those companies that didn't comply with the subpoena, but promised to=
=20
deliver the necessary documents before July 10, the committee agreed to=20
withhold judgment until that date.=20
Robert Bittman, who represented Mirant at the hearing -- and was allowed to=
=20
make a hasty phone call to the company in an attempt to avoid the contempt=
=20
finding -- in the end was unable to adequately assure the senators that=20
Mirant would deliver all required documents before July 10.=20
After the hearing, Mirant spokesman Patrick Dorinson said the company will =
do=20
everything it can before July 10 to resolve the dispute.=20
"What Mirant needs is assurance from the committee that the company-specifi=
c=20
information in these documents doesn't find its way to some public forum=20
where it could be misused," he said.=20
Legislators were particularly irked by energy marketer Enron, which didn't=
=20
send a representative to the hearing.=20
Instead, Enron delivered a letter to Dunn on Thursday questioning whether t=
he=20
committee was violating the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's=20
jurisdiction in its investigation.=20
"My great frustration here is getting a letter from Enron on the day the=20
(documents) are due explaining why we don't have jurisdiction," said Sen.=
=20
Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey.=20
Rather than jail time, Bowen said she would like to see fines levied agains=
t=20
companies that have violated the subpoenas.=20
The last time the Legislature held someone in contempt was 1929. The case=
=20
involved a price-fixing conspiracy, but the commodity was concrete. Several=

officials from concrete companies were subpoenaed, but some declined to=20
testify or divulge documents to a Senate committee.=20

Edison's parent gets new cash
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 29, 2001)=20
In a move that keeps creditors at bay for now, Southern California Edison's=
=20
parent company obtained $1.19 billion in fresh financing Thursday. But the=
=20
troubled company had to pay a higher interest rate than it originally=20
expected, reflecting investors' anxieties about the state energy crisis.=20
The move doesn't affect the beleaguered Edison utility, which has been on t=
he=20
verge of bankruptcy for months, but eases immediate financial stress on its=
=20
parent Edison International.=20
The parent, through a newly created subsidiary called Mission Energy Holdin=
g=20
Co., borrowed the funds at rates of up to 14 percent. That's one percentage=
=20
point higher than Edison expected last week, according to Standard & Poor's=
=20
Corp. The company had to restructure the deal because of investor=20
uncertainty, S&P said, and there was speculation by analysts the deal might=
=20
get scrapped.=20
Even with the higher interest rate, the financing was a must-do for Edison=
=20
International, said S&P analyst Richard Cortright Jr.=20
The proceeds will go to pay off numerous Edison International debts,=20
including a $618 million bank loan due Saturday and $250 million in bonds d=
ue=20
July 18. The company has told the Securities and Exchange Commission that i=
t=20
needed new financing "to meet its cash requirements."=20
The company paid a steep price for meeting those requirements. Part bank lo=
an=20
and part bond sale, the financing cost Edison International about twice wha=
t=20
a creditworthy corporation would pay. The bank loan is at a variable rate 7=
.5=20
percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, a common benchma=
rk=20
for loans.=20
The deal originally called for Edison International to sell nearly $1.2=20
billion in bonds, but the company had to scale back the bond offering and=
=20
pull together the bank loan to make up the shortfall, analysts said.=20
Analysts said the new financing still leaves Edison International about $33=
=20
million short of having enough to pay the bond and bank debt coming due thi=
s=20
year. The company said it will sell its Edison Select unit to Tyco=20
International Ltd. for an undisclosed price. Edison Select provides home=20

Houston-based Enron said it keeps its documents in Texas, which is outside=

the committee's jurisdiction. Reliant Energy, also based in Houston, said=

If the full Senate agrees with the committee's contempt request, it will be=

The committee has been negotiating with the companies over the conditions=

power plants and the 25 percent reduction in energy use in state-run=20
buildings.=20
"The facts speak for themselves," Maviglio said. "The governor licensed the=

He also has attacked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which=20

"Rather than practicing political gamesmanship, Gray Davis should have paid=

A survey published Thursday by the Los Angeles Times showed that a majority=

Congress Reacts Sluggishly to Bush's Energy Proposals=20


By JANET HOOK and RICHARD SIMON , Times Staff Writers=20

?????WASHINGTON--More than a month after the White House unveiled its=20
national energy plan with great fanfare, President Bush's proposals are=20
languishing on Capitol Hill, casting doubt on whether Congress has the=20
political will to pass the kind of sweeping redirection of policy that Bush=
=20
is seeking.
?????Several powerful trends are contributing to the impasse: Gasoline pric=
es=20
are moderating across the country. So far, there have been no summer power=
=20
outages in California. Members of Bush's own party are obstructing efforts =
to=20
expand oil and gas drilling. And polls suggest the public isn't really sure=
=20
if the country faces a true energy crisis.
?????Fearful that one of its signature policy initiatives has been all but=
=20
unplugged, the administration fought back Thursday by launching a new publi=
c=20
relations offensive.
?????Leaders of both parties still promise passage of energy legislation=20
later this year, but it seems increasingly likely to be far less sweeping=
=20
than the bold action sought by Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.=20
?????Many Republicans, for example, have broken ranks with the White House =
on=20
oil and gas exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
?????Last week, the House voted to ban drilling off the Florida coast and i=
n=20
national monuments. And Thursday, a sizable contingent of House Republicans=
=20
teamed with Democrats to ban drilling under the Great Lakes.
?????"We're worried about it," acknowledged Majority Leader Dick Armey=20
(R-Texas). "Those votes were disturbing."
?????"Of course, we're discouraged," added Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.)=
,=20
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
?????Democrats aren't getting their way either. Their proposals to impose=
=20
rigid price caps on electricity in the West are going nowhere in the House,=
=20
and Senate sponsors are holding off on pursuing the issue.
?????To be sure, probably nothing would help Bush's energy plan more than a=
n=20
ugly summer of blackouts in California to stoke the nation's sense of urgen=
cy=20
about the problem. One reason political momentum has flagged, analysts say,=
=20
is the perception that the crisis is abating in California and elsewhere.
?????"The urgency in California is starting to dissipate," said Sen. John B=
.=20
Breaux (D-La.), who supports much of the Bush plan but put the chances of=
=20
passage of comprehensive energy legislation at no better than 50-50. "There=
's=20
less of a rush" to act.
?????"The shoe isn't tight enough," said Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska)=
,=20
who until recently was the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural=20
Resources Committee. "The prices aren't high enough."
?????Noted Stephen Bell, chief of staff to Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), =
a=20
senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: "The=20
momentum behind a comprehensive energy package has seriously dissipated. Th=

?????Bush sought to put the spotlight back on his plan Thursday by announci=
ng=20
$86 million in federal grants to encourage educational institutions and=20
private firms to develop more efficient fuel technologies.

Senate Panel Lashes Out at 2 Energy Firms=20
Hearings: Lawmakers hold Enron and Mirant in contempt for refusing to help =

pricing probe.=20

By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SACRAMENTO--Angered by the refusal of electricity wholesalers to=20
surrender information about suspected price gouging, a Senate committee vot=
ed=20
Thursday to hold two big energy companies in contempt of the Legislature.
?????It was uncertain what punishment, if any, may be in store for Enron=20
Corp. of Houston and Mirant Corp. of Atlanta. But committee members said=20
potential sanctions could include heavy fines and/or the jailing of corpora=
te=20
executives.
?????"Jailing of an individual is an option and we intend to preserve all o=
ur=20
options," warned state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the committ=
ee=20
investigating whether the wholesalers had manipulated the market.=20
?????"Could we impose, say, $9 billion in fines?" Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marin=
a=20
del Rey) asked rhetorically.=20
?????Enron reacted angrily. "This is a shakedown," charged spokesman Mark=
=20
Palmer. "And if this is a shakedown, we're going to protect our legal right=
s."
?????Enron had further enraged the committee by sending a letter saying the=
=20
legislative panel had no authority to conduct its investigation because=20
wholesale prices were the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission.
?????A spokesman for Mirant said the company intends to keep talking to the=
=20
committee to reach an agreement.
?????The bipartisan committee had been prepared to find eight=20
generators--mostly out-of-state companies--in contempt for refusing to=20
produce the subpoenaed records. But by the end of the four-hour hearing,=20
companies that said they would cooperate--AES, Duke, Dynergy, NRG, Reliant=
=20
and Williams--escaped a citation, at least temporarily.
?????Though the committee found Enron and Mirant in contempt, its action is=
=20
subject to ratification by the full Senate.
?????Dunn said contempt citations are so rare there are few guidelines to=
=20
follow in determining a punishment. He said it "could be anything that the=
=20
Senate believes is necessary and reasonable."
?????The finding of contempt for failure to obey a legislative subpoena is=
=20
rarely used in California. Sources said it last was done in 1929 when an=20
officer of a cement company refused to cooperate in a price-fixing=20
investigation.
?????Late in 2000 and earlier this year, the profits of major electricity=
=20
wholesalers soared astronomically, throwing the state's two biggest=20
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co.,=
=20
into financial chaos. Edison is teetering on bankruptcy and PG&E is in=20
Bankruptcy Court.
?????The committee, which first asked the companies to provide the=20
information voluntarily in April, encountered strong resistance from the=20
energy companies. They complained that their trade secrets might be exposed=
=20
to competitors, the public and government regulators.
?????Frustrated, the committee two weeks ago issued subpoenas demanding the=
=20
information, including whether the power sellers had destroyed any records.
?????The committee set Thursday as the deadline for compliance and threaten=
ed=20
to find violators in contempt, a tactic that appeared to turn around all bu=
t=20
Enron and Mirant.
?????"Let's move forward. We want to facilitate your investigation," said=
=20
Duke attorney Joel Kleinman of Washington, whose company had objected to it=
s=20
subpoena.
?????At the last minute, several sellers began sending urgent fax letters o=
r=20
witnesses to Dunn. Dunn said a quick scan of the letters showed wholesalers=
=20
were pleading for a second chance and assuring that the subpoenaed data wou=
ld=20
be forthcoming.
?????Kleinman told the committee Duke did not want to be held in contempt.
?????"We will make tens of thousands of documents available for inspection,=
"=20
Kleinman said.
?????But he said Duke and the committee staff still must settle on a=20
confidentiality agreement, a matter he indicated was close to resolution.=
=20
Other wholesalers appeared to fall into line.
?????Dunn said he was concerned that "minor problems" in reaching a=20
confidentiality agreement might become a tactic for further delay.
?????The committee gave the six companies until July 10 to reach=20
confidentiality agreements and turn over a vast assortment of records.
?????The contempt finding against Mirant and Enron would be abandoned if=20
they, too, provided the confidential documents by July 10, when the committ=

?????The wholesalers also are the targets of similar investigations by Atty=

California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce=20

researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles.=20
The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to de=
al=20
with the failed deregulation scheme. The authors of the report released=20

``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weath=

``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an=20

The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the=20
State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office=

Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to=20

``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,''=20
Maviglio said. ``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.=
''=20
Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting=20

The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by=20
anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy=
=20
crisis. In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 perce=
nt=20
in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The report predicts consumers can expect 1=

hours of rolling blackouts this year.=20
However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if=
=20
the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the=20

In a broad analysis of the state of U.S. energy markets, Federal Reserve=20
Chairman Alan Greenspan last night disagreed sharply with the Bush=20
administration's argument that capping spot prices for electricity in=20
California would discourage construction of new power plants.=20
Greenspan, in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, argued exactly the=
=20
opposite.=20
"Analogies to the economics of office buildings are evident," Greenspan sai=
d.=20
"Few office buildings would be constructed in the absence of the ability to=
=20
reach long-term leases. Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive =
to=20
new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the=20
building of new power plants." A copy of the text was released in Washingto=
n.=20
California 's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent=
 a=20
"worrisome situation for Californians, certainly," Greenspan said. "And=20
because the state comprises one-eighth of our national [economy], it should=
=20
be a concern for the U.S. economic outlook as well. Fortunately, the overal=
l=20
effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states,=
=20
seems to have been modest, at least to date."=20
Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other=20
petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy=
=20
in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of=20
non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for ne=
w=20
plants and equipment.=20
"As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of=
=20
corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter =
of=20
this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which compani=
es=20
apparently were able to pass through into higher prices" of the things they=
=20
sell, he said.=20
Most recently, however, natural gas prices "have fallen significantly" and =
so=20
have gasoline prices, particularly in the Midwest, Greenspan said. "=20
Electricity power costs continued to rise through May, but overall energy=
=20
prices paid in April and May were down from the levels of the first quarter=
,=20
suggesting some easing in pressures on profit margins from energy this=20
quarter."=20
Greenspan cautioned that "because of the unpredictability of events in the=

proclaimed by headline writers."=20
Greenspan said it was necessary to rely on market forces to guide both ener=
gy=20
production and consumption. "In the short run, energy markets must be=20
monitored closely for their potential effects on the cyclical behavior of t=
he=20

=20
can be played by market forces in conserving scarce energy resources,=20
directing those resources to their highest valued uses, and ultimately=20
ensuring adequate productive capacity for the future."=20
By Greenspan's analysis, California made a serious mistake by insisting tha=

Federal Energy Panel Approves
Power Price Controls for New York

Federal energy regulators, who last week authorized electricity price=20
controls for California and 10 other Western states, yesterday approved a=
=20
plan by New York officials to curb price spikes in that state's volatile=20
wholesale electricity markets.=20
However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expressed concern that th=
e=20
New York measure could restrict electricity prices that are legitimately=20
high. The agency, therefore, allowed the New York curbs only as a temporary=
=20
measure through Oct. 31, which would see New York through the=20
high-power-demand summer months. State officials had sought approval for th=
e=20
measure as a continuing tool to keep prices in check.=20
New York officials say the mitigation plan is necessary this summer to=20
prevent power generators from taking advantage of the state's tight supply=
=20
market and charging excessive prices for electricity when demand is at its=
=20
greatest.=20
The federal commission's approval is "an important step toward protecting=
=20
energy consumers," New York Gov. George Pataki said in a statement. Mr.=20
Pataki's appointees at the New York Public Service Commission had first=20
pushed for the price-curb plan after concluding in December that the state'=
s=20
wholesale power markets are "dangerously vulnerable to market power abuse=
=20
during a normal or hotter- than-normal summer."=20
Under the plan, the New York Independent System Operator Inc., which=20
administers the state's wholesale trading markets, would automatically revi=
ew=20
generators' bids when power prices exceed $150 a megawatt hour during perio=
ds=20
of high demand or when many electric plants are offline. System Operator=20
officials would look for bids that are either $100 more or 300% higher than=
 a=20
historic average of bids from an individual facility to determine whether t=
he=20
generator is trying to manipulate the market. If the generator can't offer =
a=20
good explanation for its high bid, System Operator officials automatically=
=20
would lower it to the historic average.=20
But the federal commission was hardly enthusiastic about the New York plan.=
=20
The agency sided with power generators in contending the New York plan woul=
d=20
allow officials to cancel high bids in cases lacking evidence of generators=
'=20
trying to manipulate the market. The federal commission, saying the plan=20
should be only a "temporary solution," also expressed concern that the syst=
em=20
wouldn't allow for "sufficient consultation" with generators.=20
While expressing "disappointment" in the ruling, Gavin Donohue, executive=
=20
director of the Independent Power Producers of New York Inc., said he was=
=20
heartened that the federal commission "recognized there's problems" with th=
e=20
new plan and applied it for a limited time period.=20
Mr. Pataki and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer both called on the=

federal commission to now authorize a separate pending proposal that would=

a=20
"proxy" price for electricity . That price is presumed "reasonable" and is=
