Hi, Jeff --

I was just checking in to see if you've heard anything about the Alliance
for Retail Market's move to narrow down its choice of pr companies to two
or three.  Rick Counihan said to me earlier this week that he expected
they'd have an idea by the end of the week, but I've not heard from
him.  I'm eager to know -- I'd really like to work on the account.

If you've not heard anything, no problem.  Thanks -- and have a great weekend!

Best,
Dana
