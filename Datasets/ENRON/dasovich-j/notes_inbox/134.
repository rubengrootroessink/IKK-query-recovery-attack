Things are wild, but as long as you keep your sense of humor and
perspective ...

Here is a cut and pasted answer. Brian is a fairly careful guy.   The
segmentation did not really do anything at least at the level of 3.3
cents/therm.

Short-term memory, since I had remember 3.5.

Let me know if you need any more digging.
