This is the last Burrito for the Year 2000.? I, like you, need some time of=
f,=20
although I doubt that will happen.? Just take a quick look at the events of=

the last three weeks.? Can you believe what we have been through?? From FER=

I have been unhappy with the public image our industry portrays.? I feel=20

=20
had several interviews, "When you write a column, who is your audience?"? S=
he=20
said she writes as if she was explaining the matter to her mother.? It's an=
=20
old journalist's trick.=20

Amazed at the answer, I decided to call my mother, and ask her what she=20
thought about the whole electric situation.? After all, she qualifies as a=

the electricity restructuring thing." "Well," she sighed, "everyone is=20
worried about their electric bills.? How much are they going up? And, why=
=20
haven't you called me more often?? I could have died, and my children would=
=20
be the last to know?"? Every tag line has a message.=20

So there it is.? If you want a simple view that people understand, then the=
re=20
it is.? People are worried about their electric bill.? The reasons for the=
=20
increase are of less concern, than how much their bills may go up.? All the=
=20
blather about forward contracts, alleged gouging, Stage 3 emergencies,=20
governance, jurisdiction, and FERC Orders is not on the minds of ordinary=
=20
California citizens.? They want to know how much more they are going to hav=
e=20
to pay.? And they are worried.=20

Focus, then, on how we, as an industry, will help.? We want to hold down=20
consumer electric bills in three different ways: by adding new generation, =
by=20
giving people more choice as to their energy provider, and by assuring ther=

?@@@ SCE's Bryson Rattles the Restructuring Cage=20

Not to be outdone by Herr Peace, SCE (Sufferin' Chutzpah Edison) issued a=
=20
press release by its CEO, John Bryson, calling for dramatic reform of the=
=20
California electricity market.? I know this will shock you, but, now that S=
CE=20
has recovered most, but not all, of its stranded costs, they want to revers=
e=20
the engine of progress, and "re-regulate California's electric system."?=20
Guess how?? By allowing utilities to "once again be charged with the=20
responsibility to plan for, acquire and assure sufficient power to meet the=
=20
state's needs without the threat of interruption."? By charging cost-based=
=20
rates.? By protecting customers.? Hallelujah.=20

Let's talk about a few things, here.? First, let's discuss the credit issue=
=20
that is plaguing the Pacific Northwest power producers who are increasingly=
=20
unwilling to sell supplemental energy into California.? The last I checked,=
=20
most PNW producers paid their counterparties on a 30-day basis, but receive=
=20
the cash from ISO about 100 days after the trade day.? The PNW producers mu=
st=20
cover their "owed" position by borrowing funds, and at the prices posted in=
=20
the last two weeks, the credit limit has been reached.? Where is the securi=
ty=20
for the payment?? It lies not with the ISO, but with the utilities who are=
=20
the major customers.? Therefore, if the utilities undercollect because froz=
en=20
rates are below wholesale prices, then the utilities accumulate a debt.? If=
=20
the debt continues unabated, then the credit rating companies downgrade the=
=20
UDC ratings.? That has occurred several times in the last few months.? If t=
he=20
utilities claim bankruptcy, or refuse to pay the PX, then the PX can't pay=
=20
the ISO, the ISO can't pay the sellers, and the PNW sellers are kaput.=20

This is my long-winded way of saying that two entities still hold all the=
=20
cards, at least for now, in the region: SCE, and me-too PG&E.? They have th=
e=20
leverage to bring the whole system to its knees.? Hark, recall that WPTF ha=
s=20
continually called for a breakup of the UDCs' default customer base for thi=
s=20
very reason.? We argued that two dominant buyers could extract monopsony=20
rents from sellers.? And here it is, big time.=20

What does Bryson have to lose by rattling the cage?? Nothing.? In fact, it =
is=20
so delicious to watch, for the umpteenth time, SCE exercise brute force whe=
n=20
they have an advantage.? You must respect that.? The golden rule aptly=20
applies.? Those who have the gold, make the rules.=20

Another aspect of Bryson's gambit is that he is playing a trump card on his=
=20
buddy, the Governor, who as of last week, through the PUC, suspended the=20
requests of Edison and PG&E for rate increases starting next January.? Davi=
s=20
has painted himself into a corner, and is no match for the cunning of the=
=20
Sufferin' Chutzpah gang.? I predicted that Davis would stumble and fall on=
=20
electricity matters.? I didn't expect it to happen so soon.=20

Do you think the public will buy Bryson's argument?? To tell you the truth,=
=20
I'm not sure.=20

Things in the People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ Rate Relief Reviewed, Again=20

Well, in a complete reversal, the CPUC put back on the docket list the rate=
=20
stabilization plans for PG&E and Edison.? Last week, President Lynch=20
suspended both companies' applications, denying them the right to raise rat=
es=20
subject to refund.? Now, this week, Lynch allowed for the rate stabilizatio=
n=20
applications to be re-opened, and duly considered.=20

Next Tuesday I will be on the local San Francisco station, KQED (88.5 FM) t=
o=20
debate the merits of electric competition with the likes of Lynch, and TURN=
's=20
Netie Hogue.? I did this last September on the same one-hour call-in show=
=20
that begins at 9 a.m..? I didn't know it was a call-in show until the calle=
rs=20
started firing crazy questions at the panelists.? If you are in the area,=
=20
then listen in, and better yet, call in.? Ask Ms. Lynch a few questions, wi=
ll=20
you?=20

I listened to a taped interview Ms. Lynch did on another local station, KCB=
S=20
that aired last Sunday.? Here are some of her more memorable quotes:=20
? "There is plenty of power in California.? There is no shortage.? It is ju=
st=20
not being managed properly on a day to day basis. There are power plants th=
at=20
should be available right now, but are not running."=20

"The State of California has 41,000 MW of power available at any hour."=20

"Plant unavailability is an artificial issue.? There is plenty [of power] i=
f=20
they [power plants] run."=20

"The PUC is trying to figure out what is wrong.? The plant owners only give=
=20
the ISO one-word explanations such as 'boiler', or 'fire'.? We are sending=
=20
our inspection team in to better understand the problems."=20

"I won't speculate [as to price manipulation] but last summer we saw very=
=20
suspicious bids and offers."=20

"More power plants have been approved during the first two years of the Dav=
is=20
administration than in all the years of the Wilson administration."=20

"This week the State stepped in to save the system by turning off lights an=
d=20
computers."=20

"The ISO is governed by a board made up of individuals from the utilities a=
nd=20
the power sellers.? There is one consumer representative, and one=20
environmental representative."=20

"The San Diego economy couldn't stand the price volatility of last summer."=
=20

"The [former Governor Pete] Wilson administration created the wholesale pow=
er=20
market."=20

"The market design of the PX is counterintuitive.? It takes the highest pri=
ce=20
bid and pays it to everyone.? So if you offer $50/MWH for a 100 MW, and=20
another person offers $100 for a 100 MW, then both parties get $100."


Things FERC and Federal=20
?@@@ Secretary Richardson Serves Smashed Salmon Pate=20

Mr. Richardson is the U.S. Secretary of Energy.? Most people don't know him=
,=20
nor have ever heard of him.? Last Wednesday, with only four weeks left in h=
is=20
job, he decided to take a bold step.? He did something.? Richardson invoked=
 a=20
rarely used authority in the Federal Power Act to require out-of-state=20
generators and marketers to sell into California upon demand.? The Section =
of=20
the statute cited had not been invoked since World War II.? If it was good=
=20
enough then, then it is good enough now.=20

Richardson also ordered BPA and WAPA to ship as much power to California as=
=20
possible.=20

In a way, the Order worked.? Because of credit issues, out-of-state parties=
=20
have been loath to violate their credit policies just to sell to California=
.?=20
Hence, the imports into California became scarce, and the ISO was teetering=
=20
on another Stage 3 Alert yesterday morning.? Because of the Order, BPA=20
started drafting from its hydro reserves, somewhere in the neighborhood of=
=20
1500 MW, and PowerEx delivered another 400 MW.? From where did this power=
=20
emanate?=20

Clearly, in the case of BPA, they are selling to California at the risk of=
=20
being unable to meet their own requirements later this year and next.? No=
=20
rain and cold weather could put BPA in a world of hurt.? Further, the=20
increased hydro spill may effect salmon.=20

I sent by e-mail to Mr. Richardson that included some wonderful recipes for=
=20
the damaged salmon. I mean, what do you do with tons of smashed salmon that=
=20
you would otherwise love to eat.? Pates, souffl,s, patties, chilled, ground=
=20
winter run, smashed spring run primavera, roasted, mashed fall run.? You na=
me=20
it.? We can whip up a mess of smashed salmon for just about any occasion.?=
=20
And, the added benefit is that California gets to continue the holiday seas=
on=20
festively, with lights on, without interruption.=20

I was reminded of a letter written to the Burrito last year.? It was a phon=
y=20
announcement that, in retrospect, wasn't far off.? Do you remember it?=20
? Exclusive: Christmas Lights Cause Crisis

Due to increased evening ramps caused by heavy Christmas light loads, the=
=20
California Independent System Operator (ISO) will begin running a series of=
=20
Public Service Announcements (PSAs) this week designed to lessen electricit=
y=20
reliability concerns.? Because homeowners? tend to turn their Christmas=20
lights on at dusk, there is a surge of? electricity demand that can create=
=20
havoc on the balancing act between? generators and users of power. The ads=
=20
will request that homes with odd numbered addresses turn on their Holiday=
=20
lights between 5:00-5:30 pm and? even numbered homes between 5:30-6:00 pm.?=
=20
According to Kellan Flukiger, ISO Vice President of Operations, the rationi=
ng=20
is required to avert an electricity crisis: "We're seeing extreme ramps tha=
t=20
are causing demands on the grid, we'll use this voluntary process for now t=
o=20
try and manage the problem."=20

The Author has learned, however, that the ISO intends to turn to a more=20
direct approach to control the problem after December 15th.? Tariff Amendme=
nt=20
73g, a little known document that to date has been? internal to the=20
California ISO, could have a major impact on the Holiday plans of=20
Californians.? The memo calls for some combination of a two-pronged attack =
to=20
keep Californians from all turning on their Christmas lights at the same ti=
me.


The biggest question, outside of the deliveries of BPA and PowerEx, is what=
=20
price is being paid for the power ordered by the California ISO. The Order=
=20
states that power will be sold to the ISO at a level that would ensure=20
generators receive a fair return.? What's that?? I know that some of the=20
Northwest power producers are sleeving their sales through credit-worthy=20
third parties.? But, other than that, I am not sure of the details.=20

Things FERC and Federal=20
?@@@ WPTF Supports PX Emergency Filing=20

The Power Exchange filed an emergency motion on Monday to keep alive its=20
energy markets in light of the emergency changes made by the ISO the previo=
us=20
Friday.? The PX requested an emergency order from FERC removing the "hard=
=20
cap" on Adjustment Bids and replacing it with an energy price equivalent th=
at=20
allows forward buyers and sellers to transact ahead of the ISO real-time=20
market.? Currently, the ISO hard caps the Adjustment Bids at $250/MWH, whic=
h=20
becomes the zonal price if congestion is present.? The mix of hard and soft=
=20
caps pushes more people into the real-time market, and wipes out much of th=
e=20
supply that would otherwise show up in the forward markets.=20

The WPTF Board filed comments with FERC on Wednesday supporting the PX's=20
motion.? The ISO filed against the PX motion, and the ISO offered a plan of=
=20
their own.? Copies of our filing can be found, along with all our other FER=
C=20
and PUC filings on our web page.? If you don't have a password for our=20
