I would not convert footnotes to endnotes- quick review: looks very good. I 
will review in more detail over weekend. Thanks.

Please let me know ASAP over the weekend or Monday morning by 11:00 eastern 
of any final comments.  In order to file this on Monday (as I strongly 
recommend that we do), I must ask that you please limit your comments to 
truly substantive considerations.

Mary: Unfortunately, because of the additional text that others proposed, 
moving the Joskow and Kahn analysis to an Attachment and moving the cites to 
footnotes did not serve to shorten the document, which is now 9 pages.  
(However, both these changes should make the document more readible so I 
think they were still good suggestions.)  We could save about 2 pages if we 
convert the footnotes to endnotes, but I would be reluctant to do that since 
only truly motivated readers read endnotes.

A nice weekend to all.  Ron
