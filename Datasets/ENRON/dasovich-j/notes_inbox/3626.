Hi folks:
Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse,
some nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time)
deleted my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed
up)---year's worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any
chance that someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them
to me, I would be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see
you on Monday.

Best,
Jeff
