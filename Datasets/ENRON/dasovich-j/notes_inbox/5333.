Hello, Eldon...
Your fireplace was improperly installed, and the fire was caused by embers
falling in between the fireplace and the hearth, igniting the plywood
underlayment and the wooden framing installed in front of the face and the
header above the fireplace opening.  There should be no combustible material
there, and sooner or later a fire will result.  You are fortunate the result
was not worse.  The important metal underlayment supplied with the fireplace
was not installed.  The fireplace must be moved about 5" up to the face of
the wall.  All the tile must be removed and replaced with non combustible
underlayment.  The chimney seems ok but you must replace the cap and the
chimney is no longer available, necessitating fireplace replacement if it
ever becomes necessary due to corrosion.  The insulation is probably wet,
which happens over the years and it settles, leaving hot spots in the
chimney.  At least yours is out in the air, but it should be checked, and
will be if I do this job.
You will provide the tile, and bear in mind that some will have to be cut,
so avoid small tiles.  You will also provide sanded grout and grout
additive, and a mastic (25#) such as epoxy "Elastobon".  Your tile supplier
will know what we're talking about.  I will get all other materials locally.
You are looking at, I estimate, $2,400.00 - $3,200.00 plus materials.  I
prefer to work jobs like this at Time and Materials, based on my labor rate
of $50.00 per man hour.  If I have to bid this job, it will be suitably
inflated to deal with unforeseen variables.  I have been here for 26 years
without any construction related problems, and have lots of references.
The materials will consist of cedar shingles, plywood, roofing shingles
(asphalt), glue, Wonder Board tile underlayment, stainless steel cap, 2X4's,
screws, plumbing fittings for the gas line, sheet metal, and incidentals.
My estimate is done as accurately as possible, but unforeseen problems could
change the time I've estimated for the job.  The materials will be about
$700.00, and this is the deposit I will require.  Let me know what the ETA
of your tile will be.  If you prefer, I can do the job without the tile,
leaving the Wonder Board tile underlayment exposed, which is totally safe,
and you can decide upon tile later, after looking at the site after the
fireplace is moved.  I will need a half square min. to do the roof of the
fireplace pop out.
Regards,
Will Guyan
