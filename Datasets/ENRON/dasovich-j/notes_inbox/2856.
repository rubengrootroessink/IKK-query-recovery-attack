I want you folks to read, carefully, the note I received from Larry
Stirling, who is an accomplished California politician, and currently a
Judge on the California Supreme Court.  Please keep the note
confidential.

I think you can see the dilemma.  Larry's vision has significant merit.
I don't see how we can get there.

Maybe this can be part of our discussion next Wednesday.

Also, I misstated the number of Board members necessary for a quorum.
It's 8, not 7.

Lots of good insight in your experiences.

it is always better to tell the truth. And it is better to tell it well to a
hostile group. That way you get noticed and remembered.

When only one side shoots, the other side dies.

Pete Wilson taught me that you do not get noticed fencing with yourself. If
he wanted a message out, he picked a fight with someone, that way the press
covered it. 

Here is one opportunity begging to be exercised.

Go give Lockyer hell for his unforgivable comments. He is after all the
Attorney General of the State, bound with an oath to uphold the law.

He is a long-time friend, racquet ball partner, power sharer. But his
comments give you an opening the size of  the run way for the space shuttle.
You should Nuke him for it in public.

Also, you have it right on the television bits. The talking head of a techie
male is not the answer.  

Also, the location of the interview itself has to be telegenic.

So, you need someone to soften the image.  You should considering hiring and
educating someone like Starr Parker, a brilliant black woman, committed to
private enterprise solutions.

Raoul Lowery Contreras, an articulate and unabashed Republican business
oriented Hispanic that knows exactly how to handle the press.

Since the face of California is changing, the face of the spokespersons has
to change with it to be credible.

I can get you in touch with either if you are interested.  I know that they
would like to help. But both need to be retained.

All the best, Larry Stirling
