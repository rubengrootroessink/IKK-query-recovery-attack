Calif PUC OKs Increase In SoCal Ed Borrowing Limit To $2 Billion

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)-State regulators voted Tuesday to allow Southern 
California Edison to raise its short-term borrowing ability for the purchase 
of wholesale electricity to $2 billion from $700 million, a company spokesman 
said. 
In its motion, the Edison International (EIX) unit said it needed to increase 
its limit due to the recent high price of power in the California Power 
Exchange spot market and Independent System Operator real-time market, said 
Public Utilities Commission president Loretta Lynch. 
State and federal investigations are underway to determine why wholesale 
power prices in California spiked to record levels this summer.
