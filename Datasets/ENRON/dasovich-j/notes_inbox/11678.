Utilities sell excess power -- at a loss=20

So those who stocked up -- including the state Department of Water Resource=

and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District -- are now selling megawatts=
=20
for less than they paid.=20
The state sold 177,571 megawatt hours of surplus power in the first half of=

for an average of $118 per megawatt hour -- a loss of about $14 million ove=

Those who want California out of the power-buying business call this proof=

that electricity is better left to private businesses, which will buy more=

"History has proven that there is nothing less efficient than a=20
government-run monopoly," said Assemblyman John Campbell, who prodded the=

Campbell, R-Irvine, said Tuesday that his office will be requesting more da=

more scrutiny to pre-July losses and to any ongoing sales.=20
"The broader issue here is, in the past, when an Edison or a PG&E does this=

That's not generally the case, say those who have monitored utility issues=

said Jim Tracy, SMUD's planning director.=20
That's because they will buy power in advance, in blocks, to lock in lower=

"When we buy a contract, it's for every day of the week," Tracy said. "If=

it's 98 degrees, we need it. If it's 88 degrees, we don't need it."=20
It's very common for utilities to be 1 percent to 2 percent off on their=20
forecasts over a year's time, and in any single month it's not uncommon to =

3 percent to 5 percent off target, largely because of fluctuations in=20
weather, Tracy said. The variations can get even more dramatic over shorter=

periods.=20
"You could have a real cool June and a hot July and they offset themselves =
in=20
the big picture," he said.=20
But this year has been much less predictable than usual for SMUD and other=

utilities, he added, because the public has responded so well to pleas for=

conservation.=20
SMUD began unloading power at a loss in spring, when it first became obviou=
s=20
its customers were cutting back on use, sometimes by as much as 10 percent,=

and it went through another round of sales in July as temperatures stayed=

well below normal.=20
"It's hurting us," Tracy said. "It's nice and cool, so our customers don't=

He said he couldn't provide any detailed figures because SMUD staffers=20

Dan Walters: Blackout threat dims, but state still faces tough energy=20

(Published July 25, 2001)=20
Unusually cool summer weather, and conservation efforts, have lowered power=
=20
consumption in California and forestalled -- at least for the moment -- the=
=20
threat of blackouts, but political and financial aspects of the energy cris=
is=20
remain very unsettled.=20
When the Legislature recessed for a monthlong vacation, it left behind the=
=20
highly controversial issue of whether the state should rescue Southern=20
California Edison from the threat of bankruptcy. The larger Pacific Gas and=
=20
Electric Co. has already sought bankruptcy protection, and Edison officials=
=20
have said that without state intervention, Edison would likely follow.=20
The Legislature's inability to agree on an Edison plan after weeks of publi=
c=20
and private debate and negotiations -- and the likelihood that nothing will=
=20
happen until late August, at the earliest -- add more complexity to an=20
already uncertain financial picture.=20
Had the Legislature simply rejected Gov. Gray Davis' bailout deal with=20
Edison, at least the utility, its creditors, the state Public Utilities=20
Commission and other players in the financial game would have known=20
something. But by leaving it unsettled -- not only what kind of plan, but=
=20
whether there will be any plan at all -- the Legislature left a very key=20
piece of the puzzle unfilled.=20
The state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for=20
California ever since the utilities lost their ability to borrow money in=
=20
January, declared this week that it can refinance the state's $8 billion-pl=
us=20
in power purchase debts, plus pay for future power buys, within the existin=
g=20
utility rate structure, which includes a hefty rate boost enacted last=20
spring. But those assurances are dependent on keeping wholesale power rates=
,=20
which have declined dramatically in recent weeks, low and that, in turn,=20
depends on the unregulated prices of natural gas.=20
The Department of Water Resources also says there's enough "headroom" in th=
e=20
rate to begin chipping away at the utilities' $13 billion-plus in power=20
purchase debt, but that's pure conjecture at this point. Had the Legislatur=
e,=20
Davis and Edison agreed on a bailout scheme, the dimensions of Edison's deb=
t=20
would have been known. The Legislature is insisting that Edison's parent=20
company and its debtors absorb some debt, rather than place it all on=20
ratepayers -- but how big a "haircut," if any, will be decreed is also=20
uncertain.=20
The uncertainty extends to the Public Utilities Commission, which must deci=
de=20
soon how the revenue stream is to be divided among various claimants, wheth=
er=20
rates need another boost, whether Edison's parent company should share=20
liability for its debts, and whether the Department of Water Resources will=
=20
be allowed to pass along its costs to ratepayers without PUC agreement.=20
If this all sounds very confusing, it's because it is. Even the experts don=
't=20
know whether all of these elements can fit together in some workable fashio=
n=20
-- uncertainty that was reflected in the sharp questions Tuesday to the=20
firm's chief financial officer, Ted Craver, by holders of Edison debt.=20
Craver described the legislative bailout plan as "still a work in progress"=
=20
and expressed optimism that a working group of legislators and Davis=20
administration officials could agree on a compromise scheme.=20
Craver, under persistent questioning, indicated that Edison would be willin=
g=20
to allow an Aug. 15 deadline for enacting its deal with Davis to slide -- a=
n=20
important element, since the Legislature won't return to Sacramento until=
=20
Aug. 20. But he said that even if there's agreement on a deal, Edison still=
=20
doesn't know whether it will mesh with the pending Department of Water=20
Resources and PUC actions that will affect rates.=20
So while power blackouts are not imminent, the tightly interwoven issues of=

bailing out Edison, the Department of Water Resources' power purchases, the=

Water crisis alert sought: El Dorado Hills could run out by the end of=20

Bee Staff Writer=20
(Published July 25, 2001)

Warning that the community of El Dorado Hills could run out of water by the=
=20
end of summer, El Dorado County water officials said Tuesday they will ask=
=20
state and federal officials to declare a water crisis and allow them to pum=
p=20
more water from Folsom Lake.=20
Amid heated exchanges at a Monday night community meeting, board members of=
=20
the El Dorado Irrigation District were unable to agree on a plan that would=
=20
have required strict water conservation measures for the fast-growing=20
community bordering Sacramento County.=20
So on Tuesday, district officials went to work on a strategy to obtain more=
=20
water from Folsom Lake, construct a new pipeline to bring water down from t=
he=20
upper Sierra or negotiate to purchase water from other agencies.=20
"We will not allow the system to run empty," EID General Manager Bill Wilki=
ns=20
said. He said the district was writing to the state Water Resources Control=
=20
Board, asking the agency to throw its political weight behind the district'=
s=20
bid for more Folsom Lake water.=20
The EID argues it is entitled to take more than its current allotment from=
=20
Folsom Lake by exercising its water rights for a hydroelectric dam and wate=
r=20
delivery system -- called Project 184 -- in eastern El Dorado County. The=
=20
system, heavily damaged by storms in 1997, is able to pull out only about=
=20
two-thirds of the water it normally would take from the American River. The=
=20
remainder merely flows down into Folsom Lake.=20
But, citing a shrunken lake level due to low snowmelt this year, the U.S.=
=20
Bureau of Reclamation cut the amount that all regional water districts coul=
d=20
pull from Folsom Lake by 15 percent. Federal officials say the EID is=20
entitled no special treatment.=20
Tom Aiken, the bureau's Central California manager, said the EID's request =
to=20
pull 1,700 to 2,000 acre-feet of water from Folsom Lake above its allotment=
=20
for the year could draw too much cold water from deeper depths of the lake.=
=20
The bureau must release a certain amount of cold water into the American=20
River to protect steelhead and salmon populations downstream, he said.=20
Aiken also said the EID had plenty of time to plan for its water needs=20
because the bureau issued warnings, starting in February, that lake levels=

LOS ANGELES -- Raising the political stakes in a battle over how to solve t=

state's power crisis -- and who will get credit for it -- Energy Secretary=
=20
Spencer Abraham said yesterday that the federal government plans to have=20
private companies upgrade central California's Path 15, a bottleneck in the=
=20
state's electrical transmission grid.=20
Abraham, speaking at a news conference here, said federal officials have=20
received 13 bids from unspecified companies interested in building a third=
=20
transmission line along an 84-mile corridor between Los Banos, in Merced=20
County, and Gates, near Coalinga in Fresno County. The line and related=20
improvements would enable an additional 1,500 megawatts -- enough power for=
=20
1.5 million households -- to flow from generating plants in Southern=20
California to the northern part of the state, he said.=20
"There have been moments during the recent blackouts when the southern part=
=20
of the state had an excess (of power) . . . and we couldn't get the=20
electricity from the south to the north," Abraham said. "Fifteen hundred=20
megawatts would have made a major difference."=20
The bids from private contractors mean the line, which will cost an estimat=
ed=20
$300 million, can now be built "in a way that doesn't require either the=20
taxpayers or ratepayers of California or the United States of America to ha=
ve=20
to take responsibility for it," Abraham said.=20
However, that claim was contradicted by Michael Hacskaylo, an administrator=
=20
for the Western Area Power Administration who appeared with Abraham.=20
Hacskaylo said ratepayers ultimately would bear the cost of building the li=
ne=20
through higher electricity rates.=20
"One way or another there will probably be a transmission rate charge to mo=
ve=20
power over this (new line) . . . and it would show up in the overall cost o=

Yesterday's announcement by Abraham caught state officials by surprise. Ste=

the announcement in advance and was unaware of details of the federal=20
proposal to upgrade Path 15.=20
"The governor is skeptical of any effort by private companies to increase=
=20
their stranglehold over the power system in California," Maviglio said.=20
John Tremayne, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, which owns the=20
existing Path 15 transmission lines, said the company has been working with=
=20
the California Public Utilities Commission for months on a separate proposa=
l=20
to upgrade Path 15 on its own.=20
More recently, PG&E also has cooperated with federal officials seeking to=
=20
take command of the project, Tremayne said, and the company is willing to d=

a limited amount of the expansion work in conjunction with other partners.=

Reliant Energy Sues California
  =20
By Associated Press=20
HOUSTON -- Reliant Energy Cos. has sued California to recover money the=20
company says it is owed under power contracts it signed with the state.

Reliant said it is owed $337 million for unpaid power bills in California,=
=20
but the lawsuit involves only a portion of that amount. A Reliant spokesman=
=20
did not immediately have a dollar figure available and the company did not=
=20
specify in the lawsuit how much it is seeking.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, applies to contrac=
ts=20
that Reliant made through the California Power Exchange Corp., the=20
now-defunct exchange that was the state's middleman for the buying and=20
selling of power.

Among the contracts Reliant entered into were those for future purchases, t=
he=20
Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday.

Reliant said in its lawsuit that because of defaults by purchasers Pacific=
=20
Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co., the Power Exchange=
=20
started liquidating contracts to distribute money to companies such as=20
Reliant.

But the state seized the contracts before the liquidation was complete and=
=20
transferred the rights to the California Department of Water Resources, the=
=20
suit said.

Reliant said that constitutes taking the Power Exchange's property rights=
=20
without just compensation under the California constitution.

The Houston-based company says it should be paid for the reasonable value o=
f=20
the contracts and hasn't been compensated for damages it suffered when the=
=20
state took the contracts.

Steven Maviglio, press secretary for California Gov. Gray Davis, called the=
=20
lawsuit "just another example of Reliant having no shame when it comes to=
=20
greed."

Maviglio told the newspaper that the state has said it will pay a fair and=
=20
just value for the contracts. The state's compensation and claims board is=
=20
expected to come up with the amount, but Maviglio said that may take some=
=20
time.

Sacramento -- California's sale of surplus electricity at a loss during the=
=20
first few weeks of July is a natural consequence of the state's entry into=
=20
the power- buying business, several energy analysts said yesterday.=20
While critics blasted the administration for what they called inept handlin=
g=20
of power purchases, some energy experts and representatives of Gov. Gray=20
Davis said the numbers actually reflect a turnaround in the state's energy=
=20
market.=20
State officials disclosed this week that mild weather and strong conservati=
on=20
efforts left California with more power than it needed on some days.=20
During the first three weeks of July, the state sold 117,571 megawatt hours=
=20
at a loss estimated to be about $14 million. The sale represents about 5=20
percent of all electricity purchased during the same period.=20
"We have achieved one goal -- which is to bring some normalcy to the entire=
=20
process," said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water=20
Resources, the agency purchasing the state's power. "The same things that=
=20
happen normally to a utility are happening to us."=20
Hidalgo said California is now the biggest power buyer in the nation. "We=
=20
have an impact on the markets every day," he said. "They know when we don't=
=20
need power, and the prices go down. They see the market conditions and . . =
.=20
adjust to our needs."=20
Susan Oto of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District said her district=20
sometimes finds itself, as does the state, in the position of having to sel=
l=20
off surplus power.=20
"It's not unusual when you look at an annual basis to be off 1 or 2 percent=
=20
either way," she said. "If you look at one day or one month the fluctuation=
s=20
are going to look much larger."=20
Since Jan. 17, the state has bought $8 billion of power for California's=20
troubled utilities. It has also entered into a series of long-term contract=
s=20
that will continue to provide power for the next 15 to 20 years.=20
Some energy experts said the loss is not alarming given the unusual July=20
weather.=20
"This wouldn't be an issue if it was a hot July and the prices were high,"=
=20
said Mark Bernstein, a senior policy analyst with Rand.=20
Bernstein said more moderate prices have the energy market on a more even=
=20
trend, although he expects natural gas prices rising again as more power=20
plants come on line.=20
The key is for the state not to buy too much power at high prices that it=
=20
will be constantly selling at a loss, said Michael Florio of The Utility=20
Reform Network. "At this point, the losses look like pretty small potatoes,=
"=20
he said. "The questions are: What is the magnitude and have they seriously=
=20
overbought into the future?"=20
Hidalgo, who did not dispute the estimated $14 million loss figure, said th=
e=20
Department of Water Resources tries to strike a balance in its contracts. T=
he=20
goal has been to have a mix of contracts that include peak power, long- ter=
m=20
and short-term supply.=20
State power buyers intend to have about 95 percent of estimated demand --=
=20
which is determined by the utilities -- lined up in advance, leaving a smal=
l=20
amount exposed to the volatile spot market.=20
According to documents released at the end of May, the state has about 40=
=20
percent of the estimated demand for the third quarter of the year locked up=
=20
in long-term contracts.=20
"There are going to be days when there is a surplus and days when we are=20
short," Hidalgo said. "This is a product that is bought based on a weather=
=20
forecast. If we had planned on July being cool and it wasn't, we would have=
=20
been in big trouble."=20
In a letter to Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, the director of the DWR=
=20
said that since July 1, the state had sold 177,571 megawatt hours at a rate=
=20
of $36.95 each, while it paid just over $118 a megawatt hour for about 3.5=
=20
million megawatts over the same period.=20

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets Wednesday for the last time=

Washington -- A nasty power struggle is looming between Gov. Gray Davis and=
=20
federal energy regulators over who should control California's energy marke=
t.=20
The possible outcome? The five Davis appointees on the board of the=20
California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid,=
=20
will be dumped in favor of a new board composed of so-called disinterested=
=20
parties -- mostly energy experts from industry and academia.=20
Davis' press spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said this week that the state has=
=20
been told informally that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's move=
=20
could come as early as today. When it does, the state will fight.=20
"The governor says he will declare nuclear war if they take the ISO away fr=
om=20
the state," Maviglio said.=20
Regulatory commission officials are poised to discuss the change at the=20
urging of private electricity producers who complain that the current Cal-I=
SO=20
board fails to meet federal requirements and is weighted against them.=20
But consumer advocates wonder why the commission would make changes in the=
=20
state's energy program just when it seems that California might be digging=
=20
its way out of its crisis through a combination of conservation and power=
=20
plant construction.=20
The timing of the possible regulatory commission order is a question mark,=
=20
however. California congressional sources say members of the regulatory=20
commission staff have told them the move probably won't come soon.=20
The furor started earlier this month when regulatory commission Chairman Cu=
rt=20
Hebert was quoted as saying that he wants to issue an order to replace the=
=20
current Cal-ISO board as soon as August.=20
But the commission could delay such an order in an attempt to first deal wi=
th=20
other pressing topics. These include ordering a 60-day evidentiary hearing=
=20
into California's demand for $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges by power=
=20
generators. Or it could be that Hebert cannot muster a majority of the=20
five-member federal regulatory board to support him.=20
WHERE STATE COMES FROM
The state's position is that federal authorities, who have clashed repeated=
ly=20
with Davis during the state's energy crisis, do not have the legal power to=
=20
"take away a state-created authority," said Maviglio.=20
The idea of stripping away state control of the ISO is being pushed by the=
=20
Electric Power Supply Association, a group of 42 power marketers and seller=
s.=20
The group petitioned the commission to reorganize the board in April.=20
Industry representatives argue that the five-member board is too politicall=

tied to the Democratic governor and the Legislature, and to the state throu=
gh=20
the Department of Water Resources, which is California's No. 1 power buyer.=
=20
The power producers have been up in arms since January, when the state=20
replaced a 26-member ISO board balanced between power producers and consume=
rs=20
with the smaller five-member board handpicked by the governor.=20
Davis argued that the old board was unwieldy and clogged with people direct=
ly=20
beholden to the power industry. The new board would be more responsive to t=
he=20
state's needs, state officials argued.=20
That's the problem, power producers said.=20
CONTROL AT STAKE
"It gives too much control to the buyer, which is the state," said Lynne=20
Church, president of the industry association.=20
Church said she has member marketers and power sellers who would like to se=
ll=20
directly to customers, especially California's big industrial power buyers.=
=20
But because the state is about to float a multibillion-dollar bond measure=
=20
for electricity purchases, it will require that all power sales go through=
=20
the state and not through such private buyers.=20
"They're just going to be able to keep (competitors) out of the grid," Chur=
ch=20
said. She said an impartial ISO board would help ensure an open marketplace=
.=20
Mark Stultz, a vice president of the power suppliers' association, said his=

would be the first step toward creating one or two regional power buying=20
authorities for the entire Western U.S. grid.=20
"We'd be happy with a larger regional transmission organization, one with=

the ISO is a bad idea.=20
"It would appear California has made a lot of progress in dealing with the=

"Let's kill the AISA now," advocated Commissioner Jim Irvin, noting that=20

"What scheduling did AISA do yesterday? What scheduling did AISA do today?=

In the past, commission staff engineer Jerry Smith has described the=20

The question of the continued need for the AISA, now that Federal Energy=20

Commissioner Marc Spitzer, who noted in a July 12 letter to the other board=

In that letter, Spitzer also described a proposed regional successor agency=

"It does appear that things fit under existing rates," said Theodore Craver=

Craver added that the utility has not completed its review.

great concern for all parties," the utility said in a statement.
The utility, a unit of PG&E Corp., released a detailed, critical

the numbers don't add up and are inconsistent. For example, the utility sai=

kilowatt-hour from utility customers in 2002 than in 2001.
But Davis administration officials called that a false comparison, saying=

that the water department collected money from utility customers for only=

Mining suffering an 'energy' shortage

With more than 51% of this country's electricity produced by coal-fired=20
plants, and more plants being announced seemingly every week, good times=20
would appear to be returning to the nation's coalfields.
But from east to west across the land, there's a glitch in the good times=
=01*a=20
situation that, while not affecting power plant operators just yet, could=
=20
have a significant impact in the not-so-distant future.=20

The problem is labor, and not the traditional union vs. management battles=
=20
the coal industry has endured since the first piece of the black mineral wa=
s=20
pulled from the ground.=20

No, this time the issue is lack of manpower, which management says stretche=
s=20
across the job spectrum, but labor says is a contrived situation designed t=
o=20
keep laid-off union workers out of work.=20

High quotes on contracts
Companies that fire with coal need not be worried right now; most coal is=
=20
purchased through long-term contracts.=20

Still, plant operators need to keep an eye on the problem. Utilities are th=
e=20
dominant consumer of U.S. coal, last year purchasing roughly 857.6 million=
=20
short tons, or 79.4% of all coal consumed in 2000, at an average price of=
=20
$24.25 per ton, according to U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information=
=20
Administration statistics.=20

Spot market prices have skyrocketed within the last year and coal operators=
=20
finally are feeling confident enough that higher prices are not an anomaly=
=20
that they are raising=01*in some cases significantly=01*their quotes on new=
 term=20
pacts.=20

"One- and two-year contract prices being quoted are definitely much higher=
=20
than they were a year ago," said Mark Morey, a principal in RDI's Coal=20
Consulting Group in Arlington, Va.=20

According to data from RDI Consulting, the price for Central Appalachia hig=
h=20
Btu, low sulphur coal has jumped to roughly $40 to $45/ton, from about=20
$25/ton a year ago.=20

Out West, Powder River Basin, 8,800 Btu compliance coal has jumped to $10-$=
14=20
per ton, from roughly $4.50 per ton one year ago.=20

Such prices could cause real consternation for power plant operators in a=
=20
deregulated world, where higher costs can't always be passed directly to=20
customers.=20

Many reasons for 'dismal situation'
"It's just a dismal situation," according to Jim Thompson, the Knoxville,=
=20
Tenn.-based general manager of Energy Publishing, which tracks coal and=20
energy markets. "Some companies have delayed expansion projects and even th=
e=20
opening of new mines. You talk to some people now and they say trying to ge=
t=20
help is even worse than trying to get (environmental) permits."=20

The personnel shortage in the coal industry is not an overnight situation;=
=20
the labor pool has been draining for a number of years, and coal operators=
=20
did little to replenish the supply. One reason was that the price for coal=
=20
was nearly as stagnant as pools of water in an abandoned strip mine. At the=
=20
same time, productivity numbers were climbing as mechanized mining machines=
=20
took the places of rank-and-file.=20

Indeed, between 1950 and 2000, DOE data show productivity jumped 468% for=
=20
underground mines, to 4.09 tons per miner per hour, from 0.72 tons per mine=
r=20
per hour. Surface mining production rose 435.2%, to 10.49 tons per hour per=
=20
miner from 1.96.=20

But technology also has led to personnel shortages=01*someone has to be tra=
ined=20
to operate the high-tech equipment that most of today's mines utilize.=20

"These are engineers working in today's mines," said RDI's Morey. "You have=
 a=20
much more sophisticated work force today."=20

You also have a group of workers who got tired of the industry's=20
boom-and-bust modus operandi, who followed opportunities in other industrie=
s=20
and in other areas of the country, and relocated from the coal fields of=20
Appalachia, Illinois and others.=20

And when workers leave, they take their families with them=01*telling their=
 sons=20
and daughters on the way to nirvana that they shouldn't look back when it=
=20
comes to working in the mine.=20

The result? Operators, big and small, are crying for electricians, mechanic=
s,=20
machine operators, engineers=01*even management personnel. Companies are ge=
tting=20
aggressive, utilizing radio advertising, even, it's rumored, setting up=20
recruiting tables outside the mouths of competitors' mines.=20

"It used to be the little operators were the training grounds for the big=
=20
guys," said independent coal consultant Stanley C. Suboleski of Midlothian,=
=20
Va. "But part of what we are seeing today is that with coal prices higher,=
=20
the little guys can pay better and their people aren't leaving for the bigg=

companies."=20

Mining engineering programs can't keep up
At the nation's mining engineering schools, roughly 100 to 120 graduates a=
=20
year have hit the job market over the last 10 to 15 years. However, those=
=20
numbers vary widely, depending on student perceptions.=20

"Thirty years ago, Penn State (Pennsylvania State University's Mining=20
Engineering program) graduated 10 students," said Christopher Bise, the=20
George and Anne Deike chair in mining engineering and professor of mining,=
=20
industrial health and safety at Penn State. "Then a year or two after that,=
=20
people saw the energy crisis and we had 75 to 80 graduates a year by the la=
te=20
'70s. By the early 1980s, we had more mining engineers than could be absorb=
ed=20
and enrollment gradually decreased into the '90s."=20

Now, demand is back big time, according to Bise, but the student mining=20
engineers are not.=20

"We're averaging about seven or eight graduates a year, but I would like 12=
=20
to 15 a year," he said. "There is a greater demand than I can supply."=20

At the University of Kentucky, the mining engineering program has averaged=
=20
seven to eight graduates per year for the last decade. Last September, just=
=20
one incoming freshman entered the program.=20

"But with the renewed emphasis on energy, the new administration with an=20
energy policy, we're counting on 15, perhaps as many as 20 students=20
registering this fall," said Richard Sweigard, chairman of the Lexington,=
=20
Ky., UK mining engineering program.=20

Graduates are hired right out of school, generally by Central Appalachian=
=20
companies, Sweigard said. But within the last two years, outside firms have=
=20
come calling.=20

"We've had TXU and Peter Kiewit come to Lexington looking for mining=20
engineers," he said. "A few companies have called pleading for people, but=
=20
what more can I do?"=20

UMWA maintains no shortage
While the companies are crying, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)=
=20
says there is no shortage, that thousands of union personnel sit idle.=20

"We don't believe there is a shortage of personnel; based on existing=20
panelists there are available miners," said Doug Gibson, communications=20
director of the Fairfax, Va.-based UMWA.=20

A "panelist" is a member of a "panel," a list created when a union mine lay=
s=20
off workers. Those workers must be called back when the mine starts hiring.=
=20
Gibson said there are roughly 11,000 panelists in Pennsylvania alone, and=
=20
"thousands" also in West Virginia.=20

"We feel the workers are not being called back due to age or anti-union=20
bias," he said.=20

Situation may grow worse
If indeed the labor shortage is real and critical in the coalfields across=
=20
the country, industry watchers see it continuing=01*if not growing worse=01=

With so many people leaving the industry, coupled with young people bypassi=
