FYI.? On November 22, Edison filed advice letter 1500-E,  which?revises=20

self-generation customers in calculating the Grid Management Charge =20

response to ISO=01,s November 1 filing at FERC to unbundle the GMC applicab=
le=20
to  scheduling coordinators.? ISO proposes that the Control Area Services =

Charge be assessed to SCs for all loads behind the end user=01,s meter,=20
including  loads served by on-site generation.? Edison is therefore revisin=
g=20
Schedule  PX to reflect the use of gross load in the determination of the G=
MC=20
for  self-generating customers.

On the same date, Edison filed advice letter 1499-E, which revises Schedule=

PX to reflect an increase to the utility's purchase limits for bilateral an=

BFM  products.? As background, when Edison filed its AL 1429-E last January=
,=20
it  requested that its trading limits be based on its "net short" position=
=20
for the  relevant quarter.? At that time, Edison said that its net short=20
position  would likely increase in the future due to further generation=20
divestiture or  load growth.? In response to subsequent advice letters, the=

Commission  authorized further increases to the trading limits.? The utilit=

further adders, to reflect further divestiture  and QF generation that may=

switch to PX-based pricing, to increase these limits  up to 8,300,=20
9,700,13,500 and 10,700 MW for these quarters.? The advice  letter provides=

series of tables which summarize various events which, should  they occur,=

further advice letters.? Instead, the utility would only submit a  complian=

letter which informed the Commission that the event had occurred and  the=

Comments are due on December 12.? I don't have an electronic copy of  the=

filings, but if anyone wants a fax, please let me know and I'll send it to =

you tomorrow (am out of the office today without access to a fax).
