CPUC sees market abuses, claims overcharges
California regulators told FERC in a filing they have sufficient evidence o=

market power
abuse to warrant additional investigation.
In response to FERC=01,s request for comments on proposals to repair Califo=

power market, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) also argued=
=20
retail electricity
consumers had been overcharged by up to $4 billion by independent=20
generators.  The CPUC
did not name any specific generator.

real, are overstated and explain less of the increased costs than FERC staf=

concludes,=018 the
CPUC says.

The CPUC=01,s filing cites FERC=01,s own assertion that California=01,s who=

California regulators, conducting their own investigation into market power=

increased expenses related to obtaining limited environmental permits.

In addition, the CPUC=01,s comments on the major aspects of the FERC report=
