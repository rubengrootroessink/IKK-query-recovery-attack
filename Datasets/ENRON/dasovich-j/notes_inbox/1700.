YEAH!

I'm very happy to announce that Seung (pronounced "Sung") Lee has joined our 
staff as Program Assistant.  Seung brings great experience to the office, so 
we feel very fortunate to have found him.  Seung comes most recently from 
SUNY Purchase College where he was an admissions advisor for three years.  
Prior to that, Seung was the Agency Coordinator at The Fresh Air Fund in New 
York.  Seung has a BA in  English, is a trained negotiator, and has taught 
fencing (though I think he does these last two things separately).   Welcome 
to Seung!

So, to summarize the EvMBA office staff members' responsibilities:

TJ Janus, Associate Director for Student Services.   TJ is responsible for 
registration, books and materials, and all the student services that are so 
critical to getting you through your program. Contact:  tj@haas; 510/643-0435

Julie Ito, Associate Director for Admissions and Marketing.   Julie is 
responsible for the admissions process and for our marketing efforts.  Julie 
will be contacting you about attending Open Houses and other marketing 
events, and she is the one to whom you should refer any interested colleagues 
and friends.  Contact:  jito@haas; 510/643-3258

Meg St. John, Assistant Director.  Meg's responsibilities are in all three 
areas - student services, admissions, and marketing.    In the student 
services area, you will be hearing from Meg about MPAR and other 
non-registration-type services.  Contact:  mstjohn@haas; 510/642-1406

Seung Lee, Program Assistant.  Seung's responsibilities support all the 
student services, admissions, and marketing efforts, and he's likely to be 
the first point of contact with the EvMBA office.  Contact:  slee@haas; 
510/642-1406

Cheers,

Diane
