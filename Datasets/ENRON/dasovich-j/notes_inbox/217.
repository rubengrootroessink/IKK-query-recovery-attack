Jeff,
     Stay at the hotel right here where the Chamber is located.  It is one
of the best and a 5 minute taxi away for you.  It is called the Whyndham (on
Broadway).  Stop by if you can.  Let Kelly or Pat know when you are in
(544-1311)

Jessie J. Knight Jr.

Jessie:

Steve Kean and I need to be at the following address on the 11th:  County
Adminstration Center Building, 1600 Pacific Highway in San Diego.  Can you
recommend a hotel that's near by and tolerable.  Much appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
