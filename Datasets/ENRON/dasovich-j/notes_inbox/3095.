Hi all

I heard through the grapevine that some of you were curious to know how Milo 
was doing. Below is a picture of him with his face painted after a stint at a 
Japanese festival. He usually is always smiling but we figured that his 
expression was appropriate for the picture.

I apologise for not keeping in touch with you on a more regular basis.

I hope all is good. Here in London things are looking up -- the sun has dared 
to come out for full-days at least 6 times since the beginning of the year. 

Overall things are good, Milo is great,Kate is warming up to Europe, and work 
is busy and interesting.

Take care 

Bruno
