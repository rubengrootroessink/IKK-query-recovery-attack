Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now.

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much.

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...
Courtney
