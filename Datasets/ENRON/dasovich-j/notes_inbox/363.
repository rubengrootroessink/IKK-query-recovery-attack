The following are my thoughts on how we should proceed this Fall.  
this is a first cut to stimulate discussion, and I welcome any suggestions, 
criticisms, or changes.   We ended this year with a relatively positive image 
of Enron by the legislature.  We have good relationships with leaders on both 
sides of the aisle.  Steve Peace's power has diminished greatly.  We have 
developed a good working relationship with Debra Bowen and her staff, who, as 
of now, will continue as chair of Senate Energy and we have a vastly improved 
our relationship with Rod Wright, to the point where he will not have a 
meeting on contentious legislation, unless we are involved (his public 
purpose bill, was an example from this year's session, we started out 
opposing it and ended up supporting it) He was also a coauthor and 
instramental in passing the  Williamson Act Bill.  Leadership in both houses 
should stay the same, although there will be 36 new members in the two 
houses, thanks to term limits.  I have spent time getting to know those who 
are in secure races and making sure they know Enron.
  In light of developing a strategy for California, I feel it needs to be 
broken into the following components:
       A session on what we see as the issues that will be facing us this 
fall and next  year in the legislative and regulatory arena.  I see the 
following as highly probably in Sacramento and there may be more.
         Revisions of 1890
          Rate stabilization of Edison and PG&E
          legislation combining the ISO and PX
          Legislation dealing with the governance of ISO/PX
          Pressure for price caps in all segments of the market
          clean up legislation on siting
     A session with the business units to develop the following:
          Resolve conflicts between ENA and EES regarding messages
          Develop priorities
          Develop messages
          Set tone of messsages
     Followup meeting on strategy
          Media
          Meetings with key officials
          Meetings with customers
          Coalition building
 Once we have accompished this, GA, plus the business units can start 
delivering the message.  Looking forward to comments
