I wanted to make sure that everyone involved with the CA New Product was 
aware that the CPUC may consider at its next public meeting (6/14) the 
implementation of the Direct Access suspension established in AB1x1.

We are hearing that the CPUC may not have 3 votes in favor of such 
suspension, but the topic is on the agenda.  It is very difficult to get any 
clarity on this issue given the politics and ex parte restricitions.

Even if the CPUC does not take action on this language at the next meeting, 
until that provision of the law is modified by the General Assembly, the CPUC 
could take action at a later time.

Please call me if anyone has any questions.

Jim
