Hi everyone -
The Consulting Club will be hosting its annual Firm Night on Thursday, 
September 28th.? We will have representatives from both traditional, larger 
firms (such as McKinsey, A.T. Kearney, Andersen Consulting, Deloitte) as well 
as from newer, Internet-focused firms (such as Scient and Zefer).? We expect 
between 20-25 firms (and maybe even more) to be in attendance.? We will send 
out a final listing of all confirmed participants towards the end of next 
week.

Details / Event Logistics
Date:? Thursday, September 28th
Time:? 6:30pm-9:30pm
Location:? Hyatt Regency in Embarcadero Center; Garden Room (on the Atrium 
Lobby Level / 3rd floor)
Fee:? $5 for Consulting Club members, $20 for everyone else (this 
automatically gives you a one-year membership)
Food:? Hors d'oeuvres and drinks will be served

The Hyatt Regency in Embarcadero Center is located within 5 Embarcadero 
Center (right off Market St. - where California St. begins).? Taking BART is 
very easy/convenient - coming from Berkeley, you need to get off at the first 
SF stop (Embarcadero).? Depending on which station entrance you come out of, 
you will be within a block or less of the hotel.

Resume Book
We will be putting together a resume book for this event.? This will only be 
for those looking for full-time positions (a separate resume book for those 
interested in summer internships will be assembled towards the end of this 
semester).? Please be on the lookout for an email from Seann Birkelund who 
will be coordinating this over the course of the next several weeks.


The Consulting Club Firm Night is open to all Haas MBAs (first years, second 
years, Evening MBAs).? First years - while most firms won't be recruiting for 
summer internships until the Spring semester, this is a GREAT way to learn 
about many of these firms and develop some contacts (many of whom are Haas 
grads) at the places you have a strong interest in.

Finally, given that most consulting firms are in the midst of interviewing 
for full-time positions, we ask first-years to wait until 7:30pm before 
arriving at this event.

Thanks and we look forward to seeing you at the Firm Night on Sept. 28th
Dave
Haas Consulting Club
