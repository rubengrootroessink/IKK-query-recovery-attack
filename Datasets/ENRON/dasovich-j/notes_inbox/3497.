PUC sweats $4.8 billion rate raise
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 10, 2001)=20
Big industries' electric bills would leap 50 percent or more and household=
=20
bills would rise an average of 11 percent to 17 percent under two proposals=
=20
outlined by state regulators Wednesday for revamping electric rates.=20
The twin proposals are efforts by Loretta Lynch, president of the state=20
Public Utilities Commission, and Christine Walwyn, a PUC administrative=20
judge, to decide how to divide the burden of a $4.8 billion rate hike.=20
"Both of them are just going to be very, very hard on business," said Bill=
=20
Booth, an attorney for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. H=
e=20
said it appeared that some cement and steel makers could face 90 percent ra=
te=20
hikes.=20
But small consumers were equally dismayed.=20
"This never should have happened in the first place," said Bob Finkelstein,=
=20
an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, placing the blame for soaring=
=20
rates on electric deregulation.=20
"In terms of allocating the fallout from the failed experiment, they seemed=
=20
to do a reasonable job. But it assumes that the fallout should be allocated=
=20
in the first place, and that just sticks in our craw," he said.=20
Several PUC commissioners have said they want to select a new rate design a=
t=20
a special meeting Monday, so the higher electric bills can begin going out=
=20
June 1 to customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California=
=20
Edison.=20
One version before the PUC would include Lynch's call to begin looking for=
=20
ways to charge federal installations power rates that are tied to wildly=20
gyrating wholesale costs.=20
Reportedly first floated as a joke, the idea quickly took hold within the=
=20
PUC. Lynch said she wants to set it up as "pilot program," perhaps beginnin=
g=20
in mid-summer, so the federal government can test its own theories about=20
unfettered market prices being good for consumers.=20
"I don't believe it's a dig at the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission)," she said during a news conference.=20
But she repeated her attack on federal regulators, saying electric rates ar=
e=20
rising in California only because the FERC has refused to cap runaway=20
wholesale electric prices.=20
Commissioner Richard Bilas later called a special federal rate "silly" and=
=20
"kindergartenish," and said the proposal was clearly intended "just to get=
=20
back at the federal government."=20
Any of the five appointed commissioners can offer an alternate version of t=
he=20
rate design, as Lynch did. The alternates will be considered alongside the=
=20
proposal by Walwyn, the judge who presided over lengthy hearings on how the=
=20
new rates should be crafted.=20
She recommended increases that would fall slightly more softly on residenti=
al=20
customers -- averaging 11 percent for Edison and 15 percent for PG&E -- and=
=20
more heavily on large industrial users, averaging 52 percent for Edison and=
=20
55 percent for PG&E.=20
But within those averages could be much higher individual increases, and=20
advocates for everyone from farmers to manufacturers waited anxiously=20
throughout the day for detailed tables that would list rates for dozens of=
=20
customer categories.=20
"I have got my expert economist standing by to look at the numbers when the=
y=20
come out," said Ron Liebert, associate counsel for the California Farm Bure=
au=20
Federation.=20
The release of the rate proposal has been delayed repeatedly as the PUC tri=
ed=20
to cram work that usually takes months into just a few weeks, and many of i=
ts=20
details remained obscure late Wednesday, dismaying those who are still=20
arguing for changes.=20
"We have to file comments on this by Friday. What they're doing is, they're=
=20
shutting down the comment period," said Jack Stewart, president of the=20
California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
He said it appears that some rates could nearly double, and "that's just a=
=20
death knell for many California manufacturers."=20
Lynch provided only sketchy summaries of her ideas, saying she wanted to=20
raise residential rates 16 percent for Edison and 17 percent for PG&E on=20
average, raise industrial rates 50 percent to 52 percent and cap agricultur=
al=20
rate increases on a sliding scale from 23 percent to 30 percent, partly at=
=20
Gov. Gray Davis' urging.=20
She said that about half of households statewide would see no increase unde=
r=20
a state law that protects those who use less than 130 percent of a "baselin=
e"=20
amount. However, PG&E has calculated that far more households -- 69 percent=
=20
-- use more than the baseline at some point during the year.=20
PG&E's baseline varies by region and season but generally runs between 300=
=20
and 400 kilowatt-hours, or about 50 percent to 60 percent of average=20
electricity use per household. It was created to give people access to a=20
minimal amount of power at a lower rate.=20
The heaviest household users still would see no increase on their first few=
=20
hundred kilowatt-hours, but after that prices would rise sharply, in tiers,=
=20
so that some households could see their overall bills rise 34 percent or=20
more.=20
Lynch and Walwyn also have proposed "bill limiters" so that businesses with=
=20
unusual usage patterns won't get hammered by unintended rate spikes.=20
The increases will not affect customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility=
=20
District, which recently approved its own hikes, averaging 22 percent, and=
=20
other ratepayer-owned utilities.=20

PG&E wants panel to get boot
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 10, 2001)=20
SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Wednesday asked a judge to=
=20
disband an unprecedented committee of ratepayers appointed last week to=20
represent consumers in the utility's bankruptcy case, saying that some in t=
he=20
group were politically biased.=20
The utility filed a motion arguing that U.S. Bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstr=
om=20
Stanley exceeded her legal authority by designating a consumers committee=
=20
armed with broad powers to investigate and negotiate alongside the utility=
=20
and its creditors.=20
The utility denounced the committee as a collection of "special interest"=
=20
groups with "well-known political and policy agendas" and a "history of=20
aggressive lobbying and litigation."=20
The PG&E motion, which was set for a hearing May 18 before Bankruptcy Judge=
=20
Dennis Montali, warned that turning the consumer committee loose could=20
"substantially retard the progress of this case and seriously prejudice its=
=20
outcome."=20
On Friday, PG&E singled out Consumers Union and The Utility Reform Network =
as=20
"well-organized lobbyists and political operatives."=20
Consumers Union regional chief Harry Snyder, a committee member, said he=20
would have no comment. TURN's representative to the committee, Nettie Hoge,=
=20
did not respond to a request for comment.=20
In appointing the ratepayers committee last week, Stanley, who is=20
administering the bankruptcy proceedings, said she was bringing it into the=
=20
case because the state, which ordinarily would represent the public, has=20
chosen to stay out.=20
Stanley chose the nine committee members to represent a mix of energy=20
consumers -- households, businesses, farms and government. In addition to=
=20
Consumers Union and TURN, the groups include the California Farm Bureau, th=
e=20
California School Boards Association and the California Manufacturers &=20
Technology Association.=20
If Montali upholds Stanley's action, PG&E must pay for the committee's=20
lawyers, accountants and other consultants to analyze data and present=20
arguments in the bankruptcy proceedings from the consumer's perspective.=20
"They (will) have all of the information that's going on," said Judy Beckne=
r=20
Sloan, a bankruptcy expert at Southwestern Law School, who speculated that=
=20
PG&E was balking at the committee's potential power and its costs to the=20
bankruptcy estate.=20
"The creditors and PG&E are opposed to their presence because to the extent=
=20
the judge heeds the consumers' concerns, he's going to be less aggressive=
=20
about raising rates," said Jesse Fried, a law professor at the University o=
f=20
California, Berkeley.=20
While Fried said Stanley's decision was defensible because the judge "is=20
supposed to take into account the wider interests of society," Los Angeles=
=20
bankruptcy lawyer Richard Levin sided with PG&E. Only the state should have=
=20
been allowed to represent consumers, Levin said, and its decision not to do=

Major job losses predicted; governor presses generators

By Dale Kasler, Ed Fletcher and Emily Bazar
(Published May 10, 2001)=20
As a private consultant predicted the state will lose 135,000 jobs from a=

summer of blackouts, Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday pressed power generators =
to=20
forgo 30 percent of their California earnings to help pull the state out of=

the energy crisis.=20
Summoning executives of the companies he has repeatedly accused of price=20

of the debt they're owed by California's two destitute utilities to win the=
=20
Legislature's approval for his controversial plan to repay the debts and=20
rescue the utilities.=20
"I suggest that they should look to (accept) 70 percent of what they claim=
=20
they were owed," Davis said after a four-hour meeting in the Capitol. "I fe=
lt=20
the Legislature will insist on a reduction."=20
Although Davis said, "I believe they are willing to take some reduction," a=
t=20
least one generator, Reliant Energy Inc., immediately dismissed the=20
governor's proposal.=20
The meeting capped a roller-coaster day in which anti-generator protesters=
=20
brought a pig to the Capitol and the state narrowly averted a third straigh=
t=20
day of rolling blackouts. But while enough megawatts were found to scrape b=
y=20
for a day, the state is surely facing a summer of severe shortages.=20
A study, commissioned by some of the state's most influential business=20
lobbyists and partly funded by Intel Corp., predicted chronic blackouts wil=
l=20
mean significant economic harm to California.=20
The study by John Urbanchuck of New Jersey-based AUS Consultants said the=
=20
blackouts would erase 135,000 jobs and cause $26 billion in economic=20
devastation.=20
Several California economists said the prediction was overblown, but none=
=20
doubted the electricity crisis could significantly harm the state's busines=
s=20
climate.=20
"It really depends on how severe the blackouts are," said UCLA economist=20
Chris Thornberg. "If we have 30 straight days of blackouts in June ... you'=
re=20
going to end up with a mess."=20
Everything else being equal, the loss of 135,000 jobs would raise=20
California's unemployment rate by 0.7 percent, to 5.4 percent, based on the=
=20
latest numbers from the Employment Development Department.=20
Ted Gibson, chief economist with the state Department of Finance, said AUS'=
=20
estimates seem high.=20
"It'd be hard for me to think those relatively limited, one-hour-at-a-time=
=20
(blackouts) would have such an impact," Gibson said.=20
As it is, the blackouts have struck some of California's most important=20
employers, such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices.=20
Tuesday's blackout hit Apple Computer Inc.'s lone U.S. factory, in Elk Grov=

Economic development agencies from other states have stepped up recruiting=

efforts in California, hoping to capitalize on the state's misfortunes. A f=

the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=20
It could get worse. For example, a leading Silicon Valley electronics=20
manufacturer, Solectron Corp. of Milpitas, said it is seriously considering=

pulling some of its operations out of California.=20
"The blackouts and the lack of reliable power are our biggest concerns," sa=

Solectron spokesman Bob Kula. "We have the ability to move (production)=20
quickly."=20
Solectron, whose factories were hit with blackouts in January and March,=20
employs 4,000 workers in Northern California.=20
A top state official said business leaders around the country look at the=
=20
electricity crisis as emblematic of a state that's becoming iffy as a place=
=20
to do business.=20
"The whole question of how did the state allow it to get this far -- I keep=
=20
hearing that from Wall Street, I keep hearing that from the business=20
community," said the official, who asked to remain anonymous. "The last yea=
r=20
has demonstrated that the risks of doing business in California are much=20
higher than anywhere else in the United States."=20
The state was spared a third day of blackouts Wednesday when cooler, windie=
r=20
weather in the late afternoon produced a spurt of wind-generated electricit=
y=20
and a much-needed drop in demand. Throw in an unexpected power purchase fro=
m=20
the Pacific Northwest, and the state's fragile power grid suddenly had 1,40=
0=20
megawatts it wasn't expecting, more than enough to compensate for a breakdo=
wn=20
of a major Bay Area power plant in early afternoon.=20
Another boost: Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said all but a handful of its=
=20
alternative-energy suppliers have resumed production. These suppliers,=20
responsible for a fourth of the state's energy supply, have been closed for=
=20
weeks because of nonpayment by PG&E and Southern California Edison. The two=

State revenue outlook shrinks=20
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 10, 2001)=20
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill dropped a budget bombshell Wednesday,=20
reporting to legislators that state revenues will be $3.4 billion lower tha=
n=20
Gov. Gray Davis predicted in his January budget proposal.=20
Instead of enjoying a $1.9 billion reserve, the Davis budget plan for the=
=20
fiscal year beginning July 1 would now leave the state $1.5 billion in the=
=20
hole, Hill wrote in a letter to legislators overseeing the budget.=20
Dwindling revenue from a faltering economy leaves Davis' plan in need of=20
major revisions. The new revenue estimates would require cuts in one-time=
=20
expenditures that Davis proposed for programs such as clean beaches and=20
fiscal relief for local governments. Cuts also may have to be made in new=
=20
spending contemplated for education, which got most of the new money in the=
=20
$104.7 billion January budget proposal.=20
"The number is so deep that it's going to be hard for us not to contemplate=
=20
cuts or make cuts," said Assemblyman Tony C?rdenas, D-Sylmar, vice chairman=
=20
of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. "We don't know where those cuts=
=20
are going to come from."=20
Little will be immune, said Dan Howle, chief of staff for Sen. Steve Peace,=
=20
D-El Cajon, chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.=20
"It's going to include programs the governor is very supportive of and woul=
d=20
like to get done, but we're in a little bit of a cash crunch here, and you'=
ve=20
got to do what you've got to do," he said.=20
"If anything's got a protective fence around it, it's education. But I stil=
l=20
think it'll have to take a share of the cuts."=20
These grim budget figures don't take into account possible hits on the budg=
et=20
caused by the state's breathtaking expenditures on electricity.=20
Those effects could be negligible if the state is able to sell bonds to pay=
=20
for power and replenish the treasury. But considering recent events in the=
=20
volatile energy crisis, no assumption is safe.=20
The budget crunch will likely highlight conflicting spending priorities and=
=20
could lead to more polarization between Democrats and Republicans who have=
=20
been squabbling over the energy crisis.=20
"A third of the Assembly has never done a budget," Howle said. "Another thi=
rd=20
has never dealt with anything other than huge surpluses. Now you're saying=
=20
we've got to go in and cut. This could be a long, hot summer."=20
The new revenue projections are a dramatic illustration of the state's=20
faltering economy. Revenues for the fiscal year that starts July 1 are now=
=20
expected to be $4.8 billion less than anticipated in January, Hill wrote.=
=20
That includes a decrease of $3.9 billion in income tax, $500 million in sal=

tax and $600 million in bank and corporation taxes, offset by some moderate=
=20
increases in insurance and estate taxes, said Brad Williams, chief economis=
t=20
in the non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office.=20
"It's deterioration in the stock market and implications for capital gains=

and stock options," Williams said, "and also the weakening outlook for the=

?????About half of the residential customers of the state's two biggest=20
public utilities would see no increase under the proposal if they continued=

to consume energy at their current pace.
?????Lynch said she could not guarantee that more rate increases would not =

necessary. "Even these astronomical average rates may prove inadequate," sh=
e=20
said, noting that wholesale electricity prices are still high and=20
unpredictable.
?????The rate hike, Lynch said at a news conference, is necessary because=
=20
"federal regulators have failed to follow federal laws to ensure just and=
=20
reasonable prices."
?????The deepening energy crisis compelled Lynch to release her proposal=20
after public hearings on the rate increase already had begun. Lynch said th=
at=20
she wished her proposal had been ready sooner, but that at least some of th=
e=20
remaining public hearings will have the benefit of reviewing it.
?????PUC passage of the essential elements of Lynch's plan seems likely.
?????Along with two of her colleagues on the five-member commission, Lynch=
=20
was appointed by Gov. Gray Davis, and they often vote as a bloc. Lynch said=
,=20
however, that testimony later this week from utilities, the public and othe=

interested parties could prompt modifications.
?????Structuring the $5-billion rate increase is an important but political=
ly=20
sensitive step in California's attempt to restore stability to the delivery=

of power to 9 million customers of two financially troubled utilities while=

protecting the state budget.
?????The PUC has tried to design rates that would encourage conservation=20
without damaging business. Competing interest groups, ranging from consumer=
=20
advocates to large manufacturers, have been jockeying for advantage for wee=
ks.
?????The PUC approved a rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour March 27=
=20
to help pay the state's mounting power tab, which now exceeds $5 billion.=
=20
This week, the commission is conducting statewide hearings on how the pain=
=20
should be shared among millions of residents and businesses. On Monday the=
=20
panel is set to vote on Lynch's plan and a similar one by a PUC=20
administrative law judge.
?????Neither proposal appeared to please anyone.
?????"The PUC says everyone should share the pain, but we think the fair=20
share of the pain for residential consumers should be zero," said Mindy=20
Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer=
=20
group. "It should be paid by commercial and industrial customers who wanted=
=20
and still want deregulation."
?????Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield said regulators should go after=20
power generators and their hefty profits rather than ratepayers.
?????"Rate increases are not the answer, and this is not going to be the en=
d=20
of them," said Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and=20
Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "This is like organized crime: The more yo=
u=20
give them, the more they want."
?????Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of up to 50%,=
=20
and agricultural interests would face increases of 23% to 30% under Lynch's=
=20
proposal.
?????Business interests contend that the rate hikes hit them much harder th=
an=20
residential users.
?????Calling the proposal "a death knell for the California economy," Jack =
M.=20
Stewart of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. estimated that=
=20
industrial customers would see their power rates increase an average of 53%=
.=20
And the pain of the rate hikes will be compounded by blackouts this summer,=
=20
which the group contends will cost California businesses $21.8 billion in=

lost productivity.
?????"For most large manufacturers, energy is a large piece of their=20
operating costs," Stewart said. "If you add 53% to that, it's going to=20
severely hamper their ability to do business."
?????Unlike residential customers, the business customers are not grouped=
=20
into tiers based on their amount of usage. Lynch said there was insufficien=
t=20
time to establish a tiering system for nonresidential customers by June 1,=
=20
when the rate hikes will start showing up on bills.
?????An earlier proposal by Lynch had attempted to narrow the gap between=
=20
residential rates and the lower rates paid by nonresidential customers. But=
=20
the commission president said that goal could not be immediately achieved=
=20
without seriously damaging the state's economy.
?????To protect the largest users from gigantic rate increases, Lynch's=20
proposal caps the maximum bill increase at 300% for most customers and 250%=

for agricultural customers.
?????"While we understand bill limiters may have some troubling conservatio=
n=20
impacts, at some point, price signals are unbearable for customers. Bill=20
limiters will protect customers from unanticipated extraordinary bill=20
impacts," Lynch wrote.
?????In recent weeks, the commission has received about 20 plans for=20
structuring the rate increase, including one from Davis, who had proposed a=
=20
slightly smaller overall rate increase. Lynch said her plan incorporates a=

number of features of the governor's plan, including a tiered structure tha=
t=20
would punish heavy users and reward those who conserve.
?????Under state legislation, there is no rate increase for consumption up =
to=20
130% of baseline, the amount deemed the minimum needed by a customer in a=
=20
given area and noted on ratepayer bills. Also exempted are low-income=20
customers who already receive discounted electricity rates.
?????Edison and PG&E said they could not assess how the PUC proposals would=
=20
affect their customers because the commission had not provided details to t=
he=20
utilities as of late Wednesday.
?????But PG&E has disputed the commission's claim that half of customers=20
would not be affected by the increase, noting that only 32% of PG&E custome=
rs=20
never exceeded 130% of baseline usage in the last year.
?????Industrial and commercial customers complained that the plan should no=
t=20
exempt such a large group of residential customers, in any event. A rate=20
increase for these users--based on the PUC's estimate that the group will=

billion.
?????If the PUC insists on exempting so many, the $1-billion shortfall shou=

be covered solely by other residential users, businesses say.
?????Under Lynch's plan the burden of paying that amount would be split=20
equally among commercial, industrial and nonexempt residential customers.
?????If covering the shortfall were not shared by the three groups, Lynch=

said, some residential customers would suffer a 100% increase in their bill=

?????The proposal calls for a pilot program, including one that would let=

?????Responding to reports that the administration would propose legislatio=

that Bush, in a speech delivered Tuesday, "offered no hint of what his=20

?????Though the president did not specifically mention possible actions in=

?????Activists Say Crisis Isn't Real
?????At a Wednesday news briefing, a coalition of environmental advocates=

?????"We cannot drill our way out of this situation," said Dan Becker of th=

te=20
regulations and utility policies are in the way.
?????That conflict between policy and conservation efforts has drawn the=20
attention of state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who chairs the Sena=
te=20
Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. On Tuesday, Bowen asked=20
California Public Utilities Chairwoman Loretta Lynch to review what Bowen=
=20
called "archaic" regulations governing how electricity meters are used in=
=20
office buildings. Bowen said she also plans to take up the issue in her=20
committee.
?????At issue is Rule 18, a regulation established by the commission two=20
decades ago that prohibits landlords from using submeters to assess energy=
=20
charges to tenants.
?????"It is quite old and dates back to a different era of electricity=20
distribution in California," said Bowen, who was urged to take action by th=
e=20
Building Owners and Managers Assn. "I asked Loretta Lynch to open a=20
proceeding to revise or eliminate that ban."
?????Lynch did not return calls for comment on the state's metering policie=
s,=20
but PUC regulatory analyst William Gaffney said more metering "would be a=
=20
boon to energy conservation" because "you could see what you are using."
?????"Direct metering would ultimately foster greater energy savings . . .=
=20
more permanent savings, because it would encourage capital investments in=
=20
more efficient equipment, windows, etc., etc.," said Evan Mills, a scientis=
t=20
in the energy analysis department of the Lawrence Berkeley National=20
Laboratory in Berkeley.
?????Usually, the only tenants in office buildings with utility meters are=
=20
retail and restaurant businesses, according to commercial real estate=20
experts. Most tenants in California office towers sign what are called "gro=
ss=20
leases" that include power. When electricity usage or rates go up=20
unexpectedly, landlords can charge monthly or annual "escalation fees" to=
=20
cover the extra cost. The fees typically are apportioned by the percentage =
of=20
the building a tenant occupies.
?????This method of billing is counterproductive to energy savings, said=20
Willet Kempton, senior policy scientist at the University of Delaware's=20
Center for Energy and Environmental Policy. Energy hogs are subsidized by=
=20
other tenants. Conversely, savings through conservation are only fractional=
ly=20
shared.
?????Two key obstacles block metering of individual tenants in a building.
?????One is economics--high-rise buildings get a far better rate with one=
=20
utility meter than if each floor is metered.
?????"We can sell a lot of energy on just one bill," said Randy Howard,=20
manager of commercial services at the Los Angeles Department of Water and=
=20
Power. "If we had 200 meters there and had to do the billing and meter=20
reading for each of them, each tenant would pay a higher rate."
?????Moreover, utilities aren't anxious to send meter readers to every floo=
r=20
of a building, going through private offices to find the meters. One=20
alternative--locating all the meters in a central area where the main=20
electrical line enters the building--would require massive rewiring of=20
existing office towers that could cost several hundred thousand dollars or=
=20
more, depending on the size of the building, said Ali Sherafat, senior vice=
=20
president of the Los Angeles office of Syska & Hennessy, a consulting=20
engineering firm.
?????A 1995 ruling by the PUC required that individual tenants in office=20
buildings be placed on meters operated by a public utility (as opposed to=
=20
landlord-managed submeters), but relatively few have been installed because=
=20
of exemptions.
?????For example, Southern California Edison Co. officials typically meet=
=20
with developers at the start of a building project to determine how many=20
meters it might require, said Matt Deatherage, a planning support manager f=
or=20
the utility. But because developers build office space so that its=20
configuration can change easily as tenants shift, the estimate is often=20
wrong. A building designed with three meters for three tenants might find=
=20
itself with six tenants or more by the time it opens.
?????"We don't require them to go back and rewire the building if it turns=
=20
out to be wrong, that would be too expensive," Deatherage said.
?????The second obstacle is Rule 18, the 1981 ban on submetering originally=
=20
intended to protect utility monopolies and to prevent landlords from gettin=
g=20
electricity at a discount price and selling it at a markup to tenants.
?????"When you resell electricity like that, you function as a utility and=
=20
that's not allowed," said Deatherage.
?????Nonetheless, Bowen believes that deregulation may have superseded thos=
e=20
issues and that current policy should emphasize conservation.
?????Although the leasing model used in California is common, it's not=20
universal, said Peter L. DiCapua, energy chairman of the Building Owners an=
d=20
Managers Assn. International.
?????Many New York tenants have individual meters. Others are on landlord=
=20
submeters, a system that allows them to tap into the lower, high-volume rat=
es=20
paid by the building's operator but still pay for actual, rather than=20
estimated, energy use.=20
?????Landlords would welcome a changed regulation to allow submetering for=
=20
several reasons. There are the conservation benefits, said Dan Emmett, chie=
f=20
executive of Douglas Emmett & Co., one of the largest building owners and=
=20
managers in Los Angeles County. It also would reduce some of the inevitable=
=20
arguments with tenants who claim they pay more than their fair share for=20
services at a building.
?????"I think submetering could be practical," Emmett said. "It is not that=
=20
complicated and is fairly inexpensive."
?????Sherafat said it would cost about $2,000 per tenant for the submeter a=
nd=20
the necessary software. Submeters could be installed at the electrical pane=
l=20
level without expensive rewiring for utility meters, he said. Better yet, t=
he=20
software allows data to be collected at a central point, eliminating the ne=
ed=20
for meter readers. Such a system also could allow big buildings to use one=
=20
master meter to get the best rate .
?????Though submetering would foster conservation, it still is not a panace=
a,=20
said Kempton of the University of Delaware. When it comes to energy=20
conservation, changing the behavior of businesses and workers is notoriousl=
y=20
tricky.
?????"Attorneys literally can't be bothered with the nuances of energy," sa=
id=20
DiCapua, an executive at Atco Properties & Management in New York. "They ar=
e=20
focused on things other than if the air conditioning was left on all night.
?????That is typical of professional services firms, because energy is just=

Power bills set to skyrocket for heavy users=20
Graduated rate increase would take effect in June=20

As state regulators outlined plans to raise residential electricity bills b=
y=20
as much as 40 percent, the head of the Public Utilities Commission warned=
=20
yesterday that power rates could soar even higher.=20
The PUC, which adopted an increase in March, is scheduled to approve detail=
s=20
of the new rates in San Francisco on Monday. Consumers will see the higher=
=20
rates in their June utility bills.=20
State regulators say nearly half of all consumers will see no change in the=
ir=20
power bills. The remainder will experience rate increases ranging from 3=20
percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the type of customer and the=
=20
amount of power used.=20
The increases would be added to an average 10 percent increase adopted in=
=20
January.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch suggested that rates could rise yet again if=20
wholesale electricity prices continue to surge this summer.=20
"If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise prices, we'll have to=
=20
look again at the numbers," she said.=20
INCREASE WILL CONTRIBUTE LITTLE
The proposed rate increase would bring in about $5 billion annually -- a=20
fraction of the estimated $65 billion California will spend this year=20
purchasing power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities.=20
Lynch said she expects the remainder to be made up by issuing bonds. The=20
state Senate yesterday approved $13.4 billion in bonds to help cover=20
California's power costs.=20
However, those bonds would not be released until August, by which time=20
California's energy tab would be billions of dollars higher.=20
"There's huge cause for concern that this latest rate increase is a down=20
payment rather than anything close to a final installment," said Bob=20
Finkelstein, staff attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco=
.=20
The PUC's Lynch stressed that while California's new rate structure would=
=20
place a greater burden on the state's heaviest power users, the increases a=
re=20
intended to spread the pain among all consumers.=20
"Energy is expensive for every hour of every day for every customer," she=
=20
said.=20
LINING UP TO GET PAID
That includes the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending=20
about $70 million a day to keep California's lights on.=20
While the PUC is moving to have more money collected from consumers to pay=
=20
California's power bills, it has yet to address the thorny question of how=
=20
the proceeds will be distributed among the various parties lined up for=20
compensation.=20
The Water Resources Department wants all rate-related revenues to first=20
replenish state coffers, while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern=20
California Edison Co. insist that they be paid as well for their own=20
expenses.=20
The utilities' costs include payments to small power generators that can no=
=20
longer afford natural gas to run their plants. The recent closure of hundre=
ds=20
of such facilities is a key reason California is experiencing blackouts thi=
s=20
week.=20
Although PG&E said yesterday that most of the smaller generators with which=
=20
it does business are now back online, it is not yet clear whether the utili=
ty=20
will be able to keep paying for their power.=20
"It appears that everything (from the rate increase) is going to DWR (the=
=20
Water Resources Department)," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.=20
Lynch said the PUC will take up the matter of apportioning funds at an=20
unspecified future date.=20
CONSERVATIVE USE PAYS
For the moment, state regulators have their hands full digesting two=20
competing -- and highly complex -- proposals for how rates should be=20
increased next week.=20
One proposal was submitted by an administrative law judge working with the=
=20
PUC and the other by Lynch. Commissioners will choose between them on Monda=
y.=20
The two proposals are largely identical. Under both, residential customers=
=20
who can keep electricity usage within 130 percent of predetermined limits=
=20
would experience no rate increase.=20
The "baseline usage" figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --=20
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes a=20
number of variables, such as climate, time of year and type of fuel used.=
=20
The PUC said about half of all utility customers statewide historically sta=
y=20
within 130 percent of baseline limits.=20
Heavy residential users whose electricity usage tops 400 percent of baselin=
e=20
figures would see power bills rise by as much as 40 percent. Heavy commerci=
al=20
and industrial users would see bills rise by more than 50 percent.=20
The average increase for all PG&E residential customers would be about 16=
=20
percent, the PUC said, although this number is skewed by the addition of al=
l=20
those customers whose bills would remain unchanged.=20
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights =
in=20
Santa Monica, questioned whether these rate increases will be sufficient to=
=20
motivate greater conservation among consumers and thus ease California's=20
energy woes.=20
He called instead for the state's political leaders to seize generating=20
plants from out-of-state power companies and impose a special tax on the=20
companies' "windfall" profits.=20
"Unless our elected officials take action, this is just the beginning of ou=
r=20
rate increases," Rosenfield warned.=20
FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN SIGHTS
One of the main differences between the two rate-increase proposals is=20
Lynch's inclusion of a "real-time pricing program" for federal agencies.=20
If enacted, she said, federal buildings in California would be fully expose=
d=20
to the volatile wholesale power market and would pay whatever California pa=
ys=20
to keep the lights on throughout the day.=20
Lynch denied that this is an effort on the part of California officials to=
=20
drive home to federal authorities the impact of sky-high wholesale=20
electricity prices.=20
"It's just an experiment," she said.=20
While California officials have called on federal regulators and the Bush=
=20
administration to assist the state by capping wholesale power prices,=20
Washington has provided only limited relief to date.=20
The Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein complained that the proposed rate=
=20
increases place a severe burden on residential customers when commercial an=
d=20
industrial users account for the greater percentage of power consumption.=
=20
"It was the commercial and industrial customers who were clamoring for=20
deregulation," he said. "You didn't hear any calls for deregulation from=20
residential customers."=20
Lynch said she was aware that residential users are being asked to carry a=
=20
high proportion of the load but said efforts to force industrial users to p=
ay=20
higher rates ran into political opposition.=20

(05-10) 00:43 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Only eight of the 300 small power=

plants in Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s territory remain shut down for=20
payment reasons, the struggling utility says. That means more vital megawat=
ts=20
have come back online that could help prevent rolling blackouts.=20
But operators of those so-called qualifying facilities say that's because=
=20
they're required to run their plants during periods of high demand to get=
=20
paid, not because of a change of heart over millions of dollars owed to the=
m=20
for past electricity deliveries.=20
``What I believe will start happening is you will see QFs operate for a=20
minimal amount of time during peak times in order to get their capacity=20
payments,'' said Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent=
=20
Energy Producers. ``They won't be fully available to California.''=20
All eight of the plants in PG&E's territory are natural gas-fired plants th=
at=20
deliver a combined 109 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 80,0=
00=20
homes.=20
Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the Independent System Operator, which=
=20
manages California's electric grid, said that more of so-called qualifying=
=20
facilities had indeed come back online throughout the state.=20
``Right now we have 1,400 megawatts offline statewide,'' O'Donley said,=20
though she didn't yet know how many QFs were offline in PG&E's territory an=

in other territories.=20
QFs harness solar, biomass, geothermal or wind power, as well as natural ga=
s,=20
to generate environmentally friendly electricity, and provide electricity t=
o=20
the state's investor-owned utilities under contract.=20
QFs contribute about 6,000 megawatts to the state's power grid, O'Donley=20
said. A few weeks ago, around 3,000 megawatts were offline. Many plants wer=
e=20
shut down in protest for not getting paid millions of dollars for past=20
electricity deliveries. That lack of power contributed to rolling blackouts=
=20
which swept the state.=20
The past debt, as well as a new pricing system ordered by the Public=20
Utilities Commission, would force QFs to operate at a loss if they start=20
producing power at full capacity, said Smutney-Jones.=20
The new PUC price structure ties how much they can charge for their=20
electricity to the price of natural gas coming in at the Oregon border, whe=

natural gas is cheaper. However, many plants can only ship and buy their ga=

``I don't think we're anywhere near out of the woods with respect to the QF=

its members "special interest groups" who could obstruct the proceedings.=
=20
The nine-member committee, with representatives from businesses, government=

Linda Ekstrom Stanley said her action was needed to give the public a voice=

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis, who has portrayed power generators as greedy=
=20
villains in the state's power crisis, met face-to-face with industry=20
officials yesterday, calling on them to forgive some of the debt racked up =
by=20
an insolvent utility.=20
In a three-hour meeting described as "businesslike," Davis said generators=
=20
will have to accept 70 cents on the dollar of past debt as part of a soluti=
on=20
designed to prevent Southern California Edison Co. from going bankrupt.=20
At least one of the companies flatly rejected the idea after the meeting,=
=20
putting the deal in jeopardy.=20
If the two sides are not able to reach an agreement, Southern California=20
Edison would probably follow Pacific Gas & Electric Co. into bankruptcy=20
court, where creditors face a lengthy and uncertain resolution to recoverin=
g=20
debts.=20
Davis has run into legislative opposition to the original terms of the=20
agreement he brokered with Southern California Edison, which includes the=
=20
state's purchase of the utility's transmission lines as a way to help it=20
regain financial stability.=20
But the governor said he now believes that the deal can win passage in the=
=20
Legislature if the generators "take a haircut."=20
"I indicated that passage of the (agreement) that we signed with Edison wou=
ld=20
only work if they agreed to reduce the amount of money they claim the=20
utilities owe them," he said.=20
Edison owes generators, including municipal utilities, between $1.1 billion=
=20
and $1.2 billion, Davis said. He said he agreed that talks would also take=
=20
place with municipal utilities about taking less money on the dollar.=20
Most of the generators refused to comment on the proposal, but a=20
representative of Reliant Energy dismissed the suggestion.=20
"That's simply an unreasonable number to start with," said John Stout, seni=
or=20
vice president of Reliant, who said that 67 cents on every dollar the compa=
ny=20
receives goes to pay the fuel bill, which doesn't include personnel and=20
maintenance of facilities.=20
"It doesn't get any supply built," Stout said of the idea. "I would much=20
rather get that 100 cents on the dollar" to invest in new generation.=20
The generators, who have reaped huge profits in the past year, said the mai=
n=20
thrust of the meeting was on short-term issues, such as lining up more powe=
r=20
for the summer.=20
Davis asked which companies were not yet selling to the state and said he=
=20
would work to get the Department of Water Resources to sign agreements with=
=20
them.=20
He also asked the generators to support the Edison deal, reportedly asking=
=20
them to try to win GOP support for it.=20
Davis agreed to a proposal from the companies to form permanent working=20
groups to deal with the crisis.=20
A handful of protesters led by former Senate candidate Medea Benjamin=20
condemned Davis for meeting with the companies. Dressed as pigs, with the=
=20
names of the companies on their masks, the five protesters brought a small=
=20
live pig into the Capitol, where it proceeded to defecate outside the=20
governor's office before the group was escorted out of the building.=20
Lawmakers have insisted that the generators must take a cut in the money th=
ey=20
are owed as part of any deal ending the energy crisis.=20
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said earlier in the=
=20
day that at least a 30 percent "haircut" would be necessary before he would=
=20
allow any deal to be approved.=20
"What we have here is a problem caused by the unfettered greed of generator=
s=20
that has brought capitalism to a new low," Burton said.=20
He said if the generators don't agree to some kind of cut, they will find=
=20
themselves in bankruptcy court.=20
Earlier in the day, the Senate approved a bill that allows the state=20
treasurer to issue $13.4 billion in bonds. The money, which will eventually=
=20
be repaid by ratepayers, will be used to replace the funds that have draine=
d=20
out of the state's general fund since January to buy electricity and pay fo=
r=20
future power purchases.=20
The state has spent about $6 billion so far -- money, Democrats argue, that=
=20
has to be replaced in order to fund other state services.=20
"Where do those revenues go?" asked Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Santa Monica, duri=
ng=20
the floor debate. "They create child care slots, pay in-home support servic=

and provide medical benefits for the poor."=20
But Republicans said the state's budget should take some of the hit, instea=

of pushing it all off on ratepayers.=20
Sen. Tom McClintock, R-Northridge, said the average ratepayer will see a $2=

bond.=20
The final vote was 23 to 15. Because not enough Republicans supported the=

Rate plans shield most households=20

Mercury News=20

State regulators on Wednesday painted the clearest picture yet of who will=
=20
bear the brunt of the biggest electrical rate hike in 20 years: Commercial,=
=20
industrial and agricultural users will be socked with power bills that coul=
d=20
soar by 50 percent or more.=20
But most residential customers will be shielded from huge rate increases,=
=20
regulators said. In two proposals unveiled Wednesday by the California Publ=
ic=20
Utilities Commission and to be voted on Monday, only the heaviest residenti=
al=20
users get hit with big hikes, potentially doubling their rates in an effort=
=20
to push them toward conservation.=20
``The moderate users will be largely protected,'' said PUC chairwoman Loret=
ta=20
Lynch.=20
The PUC has been grappling with designing a rate plan for customers since=
=20
March, when it announced an across-the-board rate hike of 3 cents per=20
kilowatt-hour. The PUC announced the increase -- designed to help the state=
=20
climb out of its ongoing power crisis -- before deciding how the rate=20
structure would work and considered at least 20 plans.=20
Details of the proposals were criticized Wednesday by energy experts who sa=
id=20
residential customers are not being charged enough to encourage conservatio=
n,=20
and by business representatives who said business and commercial users are=
=20
being unfairly targeted.=20
``This is not a real rate increase for the residential class and we need=20
one,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California=20
Energy Institute. ``This is ridiculous. This is not a way to respond. This=
=20
will send no price signal to people at all.''=20
Both proposals create a five-tier billing system for residential customers,=
=20
with heavy users -- nearly 10 percent of all households -- seeing their rat=
es=20
possibly double. Energy misers and moderate users -- the other 7.3 million=
=20
households -- would either see no change at all in their bills or only mode=
st=20
increases of up to about $12 month.=20
The consumer group the Utility Reform Network said it was generally satisfi=
ed=20
with the rate plans and how they spread the increase across all customer=20
groups.=20
``Yes, they've done a reasonable job of allocating the pain equitably,'' sa=
id=20
Bob Finkelstein, a staff attorney with the organization. ``But we shouldn't=
=20
be in this position in the first place. I think it's a shame we're even goi=
ng=20
to see a rate increase.''=20
Covering state's costs=20
Lynch said this rate increase, along with a statewide bond recently approve=
d=20
by lawmakers, should cover the state's costs in purchasing power.=20
But she left the door open for further rate increases, especially if energy=
=20
suppliers raise the price of electricity.=20
``If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise rates,'' she said,=20
``we'll have to look at those numbers again.''=20
Lynch and an administrative law judge both submitted similar plans. Because=
=20
Lynch is the commission president, her proposal would appear to be the most=
=20
likely to gain the support of fellow commissioners.=20
Industrial users appear to take the biggest hit under Lynch's plan. Those=
=20
equipped with special meters could see their rates double or more for power=
=20
they consume during peak demand periods. Small commercial users would pay=
=20
about 45 percent more for their ``on-peak'' electricity, Lynch said.=20
Lynch said she intentionally ``weighted'' the on-peak rates higher as a way=
=20
to encourage conservation.=20
``By promoting energy conservation during summer peak hours,'' she said in=
=20
her proposal, ``we attempt to limit blackouts and service interruptions in=
=20
order to preserve public health and safety.''=20
But industry representatives cried foul.=20
``These costs make it impossible to operate at a profit,'' said Jack Stewar=
t,=20
president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. ``You=
=20
can't add these kinds of prices to the product and try to sell it. This loo=
ks=20
like the beginning of the ringing of the death knell for the economy.''=20
Agriculture caps=20
For agricultural users, the proposals are a mixed bag. Agricultural groups=
=20
were hoping the PUC would endorse a recommendation by Gov. Gray Davis to ca=
p=20
their rate increases at 5 to 15 percent. Agriculture groups did get caps, b=
ut=20
they are higher than the governor's, ranging from 23 to 30 percent in both=
=20
plans.=20
Even before the rate increase, farmers and other agricultural businesses we=
re=20
bracing for a rough summer. Because of a statewide water shortage, farmers=
=20
will need to rely more on groundwater pumps, significantly driving up their=
=20
energy use.=20
``We are definitely going to be impacted significantly,'' said Michael=20
Boccadoro, executive director of the Agricultural Energy Consumers=20
Association.=20
Federal buildings=20
Lynch also slung an arrow at the federal government, proposing that federal=
=20
buildings in California be forced to pay market rates for electricity. Her=
=20
proposal that federal buildings be given real-time meters could drive up=20
federal government energy rates by 10 times or more.=20
Lynch is angry with the federal government's hands-off attitude toward the=
=20
state's power crisis and its insistence that Californians pay market rates=
=20
for electricity.=20
Lynch's idea -- which she said would be studied in the coming weeks -- was=
=20
derided by several critics.=20
``This is something you do in kindergarten,'' said fellow Commissioner=20
Richard Bilas. ``All it's going to do is make matters worse'' with the=20

The PUC considered rate proposals from utility companies, consumer groups a=

Without two-thirds support in both houses, the bonds cannot be sold=20

Without the two-thirds support, the bond measure cannot become law until 90=

Zane Mann, publisher of the monthly California Bond Advisor newsletter,=20
blasted Republicans for not throwing their support behind the bonds.=20
``I can't understand why the Republicans did what they did,'' Mann said. ``=

Task Force To Propose Legislation



By SCOTT LINDLAW
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
President Bush's energy task force plans to
propose legislation allowing the seizure of private property to
accelerate the construction of electrical power lines, three
administration officials said Tuesday.


The recommendation is contained in the final draft of a broad
energy blueprint to be unveiled by President Bush next week, the
officials said. The ``eminent domain'' authority allows the
government to appropriate private property for public use; the
property owners are usually compensated.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission already has eminent
domain authority over the siting of natural gas pipelines, but has
no such power over long-distance electricity transmission lines.
The lack of authority often requires electrical companies to get
approval from several states and numerous local jurisdictions.


Federal authority to locate transmission lines would quicken the
approval process, supporters of the provision contend. The shortage
of transmission lines has been cited by officials as one reason for
bottlenecks in the electric grids and a shortage of power in areas
of high demand.


New lines also are needed to connect new power plants to the
grid.


Vice President Dick Cheney said on CNN Tuesday that the energy
task force he heads will include a recommendation on eminent domain
for power lines.


``The issue is whether or not we should have the same authority
on electrical transmission lines'' as the government has on gas
lines, Cheney said. ``That's never been granted previously.''


He did not say what the recommendation would be.


But the administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the report would ask Energy Secretary Spencer
Abraham to draw up legislation allowing utilities to obtain rights
of way for transmission lines, presumably through FERC.


The energy strategy report is going to the printers in stages
this week. Officials said there was no talk of taking out the
eminent domain provision, though they could not rule out that
remote possibility.


Utilities, not the government, would own the property, one
official said.


Earlier this year, a draft of a Republican energy bill in the
Senate had included giving FERC eminent domain authority for power
lines. But that provision later was deleted when it was introduced
by Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.


The electric utility industry for some time has been lobbying
for a federal role in siting electric power lines, which now must
go through a maze of overlapping local jurisdictions and state
agencies for approval.


``If FERC has the eminent siting authority, that will help
facilitate siting of electric power transmission lines,'' said Jim
Owen, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, which
represents investor-owned utilities.


It especially would help in getting interstate transmission
rights of way approved, he said.


``But it's still not a silver bullet because ... it can still be
a cumbersome process,'' said Owen. Some natural gas pipeline cases
before FERC have taken years to resolve, he said.


Critics have questioned whether Cheney's task force will
emphasize power production and transmission over conservation.


Cheney said the report would use tax breaks to encourage
conservation.


``Most of the financial incentives that we recommend in the
report go for conservation or renewables, for increased
efficiencies,'' Cheney said.


The task force will likely recommend tax incentives for purchase
of ``hybrid,'' ultra-efficient automobiles that run on gasoline and
electricity, one administration official said. A similar provision
was included in the budget Bush sent to Congress earlier this year.


The report will also call for a new tax credit for builders of
certain new power plants.


Cheney outlined the energy plan at the weekly Senate GOP
conference Tuesday.


According to one Republican who was present, the vice president
said that while he supported energy price controls when President
Nixon used them three decades ago, he wouldn't advocate them now.


Caps that are too high cause voters to blame politicians rather
than the utilities, Cheney said, according to the Republican.
Excessively low caps undermine the incentives for developing new
power sources, Cheney said.


After Cheney spoke, Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., rebutted, saying
he came from a state where energy prices have risen enormously in
the past year, and he favors price caps.





Stage 2 Electrical Emergency Declaration; SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some=20
Customers



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 9 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) again declared a Stage 2 Emergency this afternoon, due t=
o
low power reserves and increased demand for power because of high
temperatures.  The agency called upon Southern California Edison and other
investor-owned utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment programs for
certain customers within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 11:45 a.m.
through midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all custom=
ers
to immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels =
do
not deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction during Stage 2, SCE is required to activate
its voluntary load curtailment program, under which large industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail
electricity usage during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced
rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's da=
ily
peak consumption period -- noon to 6 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of highest


electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an air


conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances (dishwashers,


clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and electrical


equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the "power-saver" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified compact


fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads; and


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.
