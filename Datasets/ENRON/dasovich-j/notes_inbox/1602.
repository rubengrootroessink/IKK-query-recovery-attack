Nancy, thank you for taking care of this.

FYI to the rest of the group.  CSC had been engaging in some discussions
with PG&E and SCE over when they expected the rate freeze would end.  The
interest from CSC's perspective was to be ready for billing changes.  I
received a call from Julie Logsdon (CSC) wanting to know Enron's view.
Nancy also was receiving calls from CSC people to find out Enron's view on
roll-off.

Nancy and I discussed the concern about CSC knowing anything about Enron's
view of roll-off, especially if they were making call to the utilities.  As
a result, we determined that GA would alert Nancy on any imminent rate
changes as a result of the rate freeze ending so that she can alert CSC.
Otherwise, there should be no direct communication to CSC on Enron's view
or between CSC and the utilities on this matter, especially on Enron's
behalf.

Well hopefully this will take care of the concerns that we had with CSC and
the utilities.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Have a great
weekend.

Please ensure this message is disseminated to your staff.

Diann and Nancy Hetrick has request us to immediately stop making contact
with UDC ESP Reps (for example Calvin Yee, Laura Clay).     Their
requirement for us ongoing is that we are to go through either Diann or
Nancy if a discussion is needed with one of the UDC ESP reps.   Some
specific examples were sited of our people contacting PG&E regarding CTC
roll-off .

It is OK for CSC to contact our UDC billing, metering, EDI, etc.  contacts
to handle day to day work issues and this contact should continue.
However, Enron wants to address escalations or future state (e.g. CTC
roll-off) issues directly with the UDC ESP reps.

Also - we need to remind everyone that we need to ensure that when we
participate in public meetings (utility, industry, etc.) that we are
careful in our choice of words to ensure that those listening understand
that we are speaking for CSC and not for Enron.

There are some very serious discussions underway between Enron and one of
the UDCs.    There is a concern that casual comments even though intended
to be innocent could create problems.   In order to control the
discussions, they are requiring our cooperation.

Please call if questions.

Thanks,
Teresa
