The only significant legislative development, in addition to the Senate vote 
on AB 265, is that the leg. council draft of the Siting Bill, SB 2167 is 
available.  We are getting our amendments out tonight.  Closed door 
negotiations are supposed to start at 6 p.m. this evening.  

Everything else (Assembly Bill on San Diego, SCE/PG&E bill) is still 
churning.  No reportable events.
