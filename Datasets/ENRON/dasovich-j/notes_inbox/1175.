It looks like SCE is proposing to increase frozen rate levels by 10% on=20
January 1, 2001.  SCE also recognizes TURN's proposal that the TCBA and TRA=
=20
should never have been artificially segregated, but criticizes it as a=20
short-term solution that puts utilities' at significant risk.  The major=20
problems I have with PG&E and SCE's attitude are:

They are trying to renegotiate the AB1890 compact after viewing history;
As TURN has pointed out, they are only focusing on their undercollections a=
nd=20
not overcollections;
They believe that they were able to extend the rate freeze at prices above=
=20
market when wholesale prices were low, yet end the rate freeze when prices =
in=20
the wholesale market are high resulting in an immediate rate increase.  Whe=
re=20
were the utilities' risk in CTC recovery?
There is no discussion how direct access will be impacted; however, we must=
=20
be careful that they are trying to move away from the current PX crediting=
=20
mechanism; and
They ignore how much CTCs they have recovered to date.

As you know, we believe the rate freeze under the current mechanism must be=
=20
maintained until the statutory date of December 31, 2001.  Although a=20
surcharge mechanism may be an appropriate solution, it should be implemente=
d=20
after December 31, 2001 and managed in a way to avoid sticker shock.  If ca=
sh=20
flow is an issue for the utilities, who were getting large sums of cash=20
inflow prior to the wholesale price run-ups, then securitizing an accounts=
=20
receivable may be a good solution.  In short, AB1890 should be preserved=20
through 2001 per TURNs recommended ratemaking accounting treatment.  We=20
should be amenable to a solution that allows utilities to recoup some of th=

undercollections past December 31, 2001, if necessary through securitazion.=

However, perhaps the amount of recovery may need to be discounted to reflec=

an appropriate sharing of risks between ratepayers and utility shareholders=

We probably do not want to be out in front on this issue, so we should=20
probably work through other parties such as TURN, CLECA, and CMA.

The following is a summary of the attached Edison prehearing conference =20
statement filed this afternoon in the proceeding dealing with its Petition=
=20
for  Modification of the end-of-the-rate-freeze decisions:
?
Edison says there are There are four key elements to managing the  situatio=
n:

Support market reform, including providing greater freedom for  utilities
to contract for longer term supplies of power, completing review  of SCE=01=
,s
bilateral contract proposals, and urging other agencies to help  rectify th=
e
market structure problems that have become apparent.
Confirm that the utilities will be permitted to recover their  reasonable
procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers.
Protect customers by implementing a post-freeze rate stabilization  plan
instead of the current plan which directs immediate pass through  of
volatile wholesale power costs. This should include a modest  near-term
energy rate increase of around 10% in the interest of avoiding a  much larg=
er=20
rate
increase in 2002 and thereafter.
Promptly decide whether the Commission is going to permit the sale  of
the utilities=01, remaining generation assets. If the answer is =01&no,=018=
  then
fundamental changes in the implementation of electric  restructuring
would have to be considered. Either way, all parties need  the
Commission=01,s answer to this key question as soon as possible.

Interestingly, Edison says that, "Based on the valuations SCE has filed for=
 =20
our hydro facilities, Palo Verde, Mohave and Four Corners (no one has argue=
d =20
that these valuations are too high), our stranded costs (for the purpose of=
 =20
Section 368(a)) were recovered no later than
mid-August  2000. The Commission should approve our pending plant valuation=
s=20
as  soon as possible so that the Commission can put in place a reasonable =
=20

n =20
January 2001, to deal with the necessary costs of procuring power."=20
