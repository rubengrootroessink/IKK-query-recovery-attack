Jeff:  Can't you keep your "California crazies" in California??!!??  As for 
the elections, I'm predicting the closest races in history with a Republican 
sweep of the White House, House and Senate.  I guess that Baldwin actor guy 
will have to make good on his threat and "leave the country."

I'm in the middle of physical therapy and praying I won't need the bone graft 
(come to find out it's "hardware" with a plate and six screws!!)  But, I'm 
confined to wearing burkenstocks for the next month!!!!  Not very 
fashionable!!!!

Thanks for the info.  That guy was truly out of control at the S.D. 
hearings.  Glad to hear that his rotten bills aren't going anywhere.  Who's 
gonna win the election?  Hope you and your ankle are doing well.

Best,
Jeff
