What about the questions I asked about whether the new entity would comply 
with Order No. 2000 (especially if the state has the vertically integrated 
utilities operate the system)?  See attached word version of my orginal 
E-mail.

Attached is a memo that addreses the FERC's jurisdiction over the 
transfer/sales of utility assets to the state of California.  At a minimum, 
FERC must approve the transfer.  Call if you have questions.  Joe

Please see attached memorandum.  We have also attached FERC's orders 
addressing LIPA's acquisition of LILCO's transmission assets and LIPA's open 
access tariff.  Please call if you have any questions.
