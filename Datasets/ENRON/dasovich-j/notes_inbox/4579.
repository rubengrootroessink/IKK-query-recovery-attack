Business and the Environment Day 
at UC Berkeley
April 19th - 

Seating is limited for all events - Come Early!
Free admission


12:45-2:00 pm: Second Annual Haas Earth Day Lecture on Business and the 
Environment
Amory Lovins, CEO (Research), Rocky Mountain Institute
"Natural Capitalism: The Next Industrial Revolution"
Introduction by Dean Laura Tyson
Wells Fargo Room, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley

Amory Lovins, co-author of Natural Capitalism, will discuss how changes in 
natural capital (the natural environment and ecosystems that support all 
human and economic activity) are already affecting the way we do business, 
and how leading corporations are gaining competitive advantage through 
superior environmental performance. He will talk about how corporations can 
employ advanced resource productivity strategies to move toward becoming 
ecologically sustainable, reduce environmental impact, and improve the bottom 
line. 

Mr. Lovins is the co-founder and CEO (Research) of Rocky Mountain Institute 
(RMI), a nonprofit organization that assists businesses, communities, and 
governments to create more wealth and employment, protect and enhance natural 
and human capital, and increase profit and competitive advantage through 
resource and operational efficiency. The Wall Street Journal named Mr. Lovins 
one of 39 people world-wide "most likely to change the course of business in 
the '90s"; Newsweek has praised him as "one of the Western world's most 
influential energy thinkers"; and Time recognized him with one of their Hero 
of the Planet awards.
