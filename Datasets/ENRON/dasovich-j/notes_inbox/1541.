Hi, Jeff  -

Wow, what a wild election.  I'm finding it hard to concentrate on
work!  But I finally picked up the business section of the UT and saw that
FERC will be coming to San Diego for a meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 14.  Will
you be coming down for the meeting?  If so, I'd like to meet up with you
for breakfast, lunch or just a quick cup of coffee.  I'm sure if you have
time that Jesse Knight will be on your schedule for something similar, so
if you have time to meet, that would be great.

I've been waiting to hear back from Rick Counihan.  The last he and I
talked, last Tuesday, he said that ARM had chosen one of the firms in
Sacramento as its first choice, but that budget issues had to be negotiated
before a final decision was made.  He said if they couldn't come to an
agreement The Gable Group was the coalition's second choice -- so I'm still
holding out a little hope.  If you know of any other coalitions or
companies that are looking for some public relations/media relations
assistance to support their business goals, would you mind please passing
my name to them?  I'd really like to jump back on the electricity train.

Let me know if you'll be in town next week.  Looking forward to seeing you --

Dana
