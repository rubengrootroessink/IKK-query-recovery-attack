Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of all 
the CEOs of the "generators".   This request has come through Julie 
Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm, Edson 
and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I asked her 
to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.  If Burton 
comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of Ken Lay and 
Jeff Skilling.
