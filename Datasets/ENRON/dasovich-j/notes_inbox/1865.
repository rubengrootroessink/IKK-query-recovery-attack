Should one of us plan to go with him. I have plans to go out of town that day 
(1:30 flight), so I won't be able to make it.

Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP 
regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly 
diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.

Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff.  
Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day 
that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to 
be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be 
grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of 
wisdom.

Two things:

1. I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said 
that the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to 
participate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.

2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies 
have gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to "Dear CEO of Energy 
Company."  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on 
Monday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it 
had to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with 
Davis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will 
send John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re 
their rep.  Rob was calling to see if we got a letter and, if we did, out 
thoughts re meeting before the Gov's meeting to discuss.  I said we could 
have gotten a letter, but I did not know.

		 Subject: Press Conference


Greetings:

IEP will be holding a press conference on Tuesday November 28 at 10:30 a.m.
in the Governors Press room to discuss the importance of long-term fixed
(that term is easier to understand than bilateral) contracts.

IEP will be stressing the importance of the contracts as part of the
solution for next summer. Several IEP members have offered (and have
continued to offer) long-term fixed contracts at terms under the current
retail rate freeze.  We will indicate that the utilities have been hesitant
to enter into these contracts due to the uncertain nature of the CPUC.  We
will point out that several different independent entities have agreed that
long-term contracts are one of the key solutions and that the PUC should act
immediately to set a benchmark and in so doing eliminate the reasonableness
review that is the main barrier for IOU's not entering into large long-term
fixed contracts.

IEP is also currently working to include other market participants in the
Press Conference.

We would like as many IEP participants as possible at the conference to show
that there are several companies who continue to be serious about long-term
fixed price contracts. We have already received a couple of responses and if
you are interested please let me know ASAP-no later than noon Wednesday- as
we are sending out an advisory on Monday.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
