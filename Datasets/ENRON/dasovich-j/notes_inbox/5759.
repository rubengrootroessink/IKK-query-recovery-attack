Jeff,
I tried e-mailing you last night to say how I enjoyed seeing you again, but
my computer keeps crashing and I don't know what if anything was sent.
Here is the e-mail I originally sent, my apologises if you now have
received it three times.
I understand from David Teece this afternoon that Larry Summers has agreed
to be involved.  You are making great progress.
All the best
Kieran Murray

RE:     industry processes

Jeff
this e-mail didn't appear to reach you last night, so re-sending

Jeff
I enjoyed seeing you again at the meeting earlier today.  I am not sure how
much of my background you might recall.  But I have spent much of my career
advising senior politicians, and more recently (past 6 years or so) leading
industry processes to influence policy outcomes and implement industry lead
reform.  Like you I find the issues the issues these processes through up
exciting and challenging.  Clearly, the scale of industry and political
administration is greater than NZ and Australia (with a combined population
of about 20m), but some of our experience in thinking through and managing
these processes to achieve useful outcomes might be useful.
Please call me if you need to think out loud or if I can help in anyway.  I
have attached my cv to give you an indication of the sort of issues and
processes with which I have been involved.  I am currently on a plane back
to NZ tomorrow (Sunday) night, but am up and down reasonably frequently.
My contact numbers are wk (64 4) 472 0590, mobile (64 21) 245 0161 (I have
this with me) and home (64 4) 971 7696.

All the best.
Regards
Kieran
