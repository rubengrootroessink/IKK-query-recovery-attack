  Kelly - here are a few pictures - most look like they were taken on 
Saturday or Sunday - when a lot of the water had already gone down.  
Fortunately most of it ran onto the freeways.  The pictures that show the 
arched bridges on I -59 are a good example - the freeway at that spot is 
10-12 lanes wide and at least 30-40' lower than the bridge.
