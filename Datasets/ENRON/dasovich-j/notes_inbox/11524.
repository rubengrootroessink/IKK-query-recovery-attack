Internet Daily for Tuesday, July 31, 2001
by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com

Web radio listening nearly doubles

The total time spent listening to Internet radio stations last
week rose 5.5%, according to MeasureCast Inc.
The research firm's index ended the week at 199, indicating Web
listenership has risen almost 100% since January. Nine of the 10
most popular Web channels are available only on the Internet,
including Mediamazing.com, VirginRadio.co.uk and Disney's
ESPNradio.com. Together, the top 10 signals reached a total of
128,517 listeners. "Now is the time for the industry to band
together to demonstrate to advertisers and ad agencies that
streaming audio and video are powerful new media for promoting
product and generating brand recall," said MeasureCast CEO Ed
Hardy.

Tech troubles affect Penton

Penton Media Inc. blamed weakness in technology markets for weak
results in its second quarter as it announced plans to cut staff
by 10% by the end of the year and eliminate some operations. "We
have experienced a profound impact on our print media properties
serving technology and manufacturing markets, as well as on our
Internet World Spring trade show," said Chairman Thomas Kemp.
Penton said revenues in the second quarter declined 2.1% from a
year ago to $106.1 million, resulting in a loss of $5.5 million,
or $0.17 per share. Kemp did not offer much optimism for the
trade magazine and conference company, saying the slump in
advertising revenues is the "most severe decline in a decade ...
we have extremely limited visibility." Publishing revenues fell
4.3% during the quarter, while sales in the trade shows and
conferences unit slipped 13.8%.

Yahoo to build site for Sony

Yahoo said a new 'Sony on My Yahoo' Web site would become the
default start page for the consumer electronics firm's new
Internet access service. The site is one of several elements
included in a multi-year agreement. Financial terms were not
disclosed. Yahoo personnel will also provide consulting services
to Sony to develop a portal for customers to use the company's
content, products and services including online games and
SonyStyle.com.

Amazon.com downplays auctions

Amazon.com has cut staff and resources dedicated to its
2-year-old online auction business. "If they're looking at areas
to trim the fat, obviously this seems to be one of them," Jeetil
Patel, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, told CNET news.
Among the cuts has been a reduction in customer service support
for sellers. Amazon's share of online auction sales was 2% in
May, according to Nielsen/NetRatings. Company representatives
told CNET that Amazon would stay in the auction business.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
AOL refocuses online photo service

AOL Time Warner's America Online is revamping its "You've Got
Pictures" service. In partnership with Eastman Kodak, additions
to the service will include free online photo storage and new
pricing for photo processing and online delivery.
