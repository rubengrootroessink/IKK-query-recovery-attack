Hi everyone.

It's that time.  Catered dinners are coming up next week.  Monday, April
30th to Thursday, May 3rd.  The dinners will be held in the Wells Fargo
Room from 7:30pm to 8:15pm

Now I know you're thinking, the time is great, because it's during your
break.  The location is great, because, it's in the very building that you
will be in.  And the price is awesome, it's FREE!  There's absolutely no
reason not to be there.  (Other than the fact, some of your fellow
classmates might be there. (-;   )

And here's the theme for each night.

Monday - Mexican Fiesta
Tuesday - Vegetarian Delight
Wednesday - Italian Buffet
Thursday - Delectable Delicacies

Yummy!  Hope you can make at least one night.  Two is great.  If you make
all four there's something wrong.
