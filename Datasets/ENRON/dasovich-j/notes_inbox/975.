All stakeholders are reminded to register early for the NARUC-DOE North
American Summit on Harmonizing Business Practices in Energy Restructuring to
be held in Dallas, Texas, from November 29th to December 1st, 2000.  Early
registration entitles you to a significant discount off the registration fee
and reserves your place at this important event.  Early registration closes
on October 27th, 2000.

The Summit will be the only event this year co-hosted by the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the U.S.
Department of Energy.  The Summit is intended to address the most pressing
issues facing the North American energy industry as we move towards a more
competitive, transnational marketplace.    A blue-ribbon group of energy
experts and leaders are committed to attend and discuss the issues with the
stakeholders.

Your participation and input are critical to the success of this effort.
However, time is short and the Summit is filling up fast.  Please plan to
join the leading regulatory and government officials, consumer advocates and
industry leaders by registering today.

To register early, you simply need to go to
www.energymarkets.org/registration.htm  For more information, please feel
free to contact Ken Malloy, President of the Center for the Advancement of
Energy Markets (CAEM), by responding to this e-mail or call the Summit
hotline at (703) 234-3375.  Be sure to sign up for program and speaker
updates via e-mail at www.energymarkets.org.

Please forward this email to colleagues who you think might be interested in
the Summit.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Dallas in November.

Sincerely,

Ken Malloy
