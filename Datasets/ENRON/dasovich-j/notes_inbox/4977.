Sounds like a cake walk for someone as talented as you.

Greetings:

Hope all is well in beautiful Southern California.

I'm on the call with all the EES lawyers as I write.  Trying to get folks to 
reconsider going forward in the complaint----the landscape could not be 
worse, i.e., the judge despises us and is a lunatic; Wood's the assigned 
judge; UC/CSU is getting nasty (as we predicted) in the press (see today's LA 
Times).  Having some success with getting them to reconsider.  Will keep you 
posted.

Best,
Jeff

Given everything that we've got on our plate, and the relative priority of 
the affiliate issue, and the fact that ARM and Wild Goose are involved, I 
would propose that we take a pass on this one.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

Dear Jeff and Sue:

Sorry to be a broken record on this one....but I don't know what you want to
do about the Affiliates case.  There is a PHC tomorrow and comments were
filed.  SCE's comments make a nasty jab at Enron for proposing the rules in
the first place.  I see that AReM is participating as well.  If your plan is
to participate in this proceeding only through AReM, that's fine but please
let me know so that I can remove my appearance.  I will be at the PHC for
Wild Goose but would like to be very clear about who I am representing in
the docket in order to avoid confusion.  

Thanks,
