Jeff:

Welcome back.  We did send the Analysis Memo last week to all, with some
small difficulty discerning correct email addresses for the various
folks.  Please let us know if anyone did not get their copy.

You have several electronic version of interconnection agreements for
California, and we can discuss at your convenience.  The process for
adopting an agreement "as is" is fairly straightforward in Calif and
will not take that long (a few weeks).

We are also filing updated pages for tariffs, including substantive
service changes which Steve mentioned.  We can show you any documents
before filing (9/5/00 is the last day).

Please feel free to let us know any questions,

Jeremy Meier
