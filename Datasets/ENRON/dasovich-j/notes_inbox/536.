In The Buzz this week:

San Diego Customers Seeking Lower Prices Choose EES: San Diego continues to=
=20
be a hotbed for EES National Energy Sales. At one point last week, an EES=
=20
representative closed four deals in one day. Conditions in the area are ver=

favorable for commodity sales, as prices for power remain volatile in San=

Facilitating efforts in San Diego are ready-to-use products from EES Market=

Development ( including a matrix of executable prices and a ready-to-use=20

Ken Lay Speaks at IOGCC Conference: At a conference held by the Interstate=
=20
Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay call=
ed=20
for regulators to allow the competitive natural gas market to continue to=
=20
offer solutions in reducing consumer exposure to rising prices. Lay warned=
=20
officials against overreacting to the recent run-up in prices and urged the=
m=20
to encourage utilities to take advantage of opportunities to protect=20
consumers against price volatility. Lay also extolled the merits of=20
deregulation, pointing to the fact that =01&the natural gas market has deli=

Opportunities for Energy Providers Wide-Open in the Supermarket Sector: A=
=20
recent Store and Equipment Design survey of supermarket operators reveals=
=20
that most retailers are not yet taking advantage of electricity deregulatio=
n.=20
It was noted that the typical survey respondent has stores in six deregulat=
ed=20
states, yet on average has changed energy suppliers in only two states. The=
=20
survey cited several reasons for this, including the fact that many retaile=
rs=20
find the process of bidding out energy procurement, comparing rates and=20
switching to be overwhelming. Some of the retailers who have considered=20
switching energy suppliers decided it would be too complicated to manage. I=
n=20
addition, many retailers reported that the fees charged by utilities to=20
transport electricity from another power supplier eat up any savings that=
=20
retailers might realize.=20

According to the survey, when retailers have issued RFPs (request for=20
proposals) for energy commodity or outsourcing, on average, only three=20
proposals were received. Nonetheless, of those switching suppliers, 69=20
percent cited price as the number one reason for switching, while 28 percen=
t=20
cited service. The survey reported that the majority of retailers are hopef=

Wisconsin and Other States Slow Their Deregulation Process: An article in N=
ew=20
York Times that also ran in the Houston Chronicle discusses how a number of=
=20
states, such as Wisconsin, are adopting a =01&go-slow=018 approach to dereg=
ulation,=20
so as to avoid the mistakes California has made. Initially, Wisconsin pushe=
d=20
for state regulators to give up immediate control over the production and=
=20
pricing of electricity. However, as a result of a 1997 power shortage and t=
he=20
developments in California, Wisconsin has decided to first build in an extr=
a=20
margin of reliable power to fully meet the state=01,s growing electricity=
=20
demand. According to the article, most experts agree that a system where=20
power generators compete openly to provide electricity at market prices sti=
ll=20
offers the best prospect of lower costs for business and consumers and high=
er=20
profits for utilities than is possible under the traditional system of=20
monopoly suppliers supervised by government regulators.=20
