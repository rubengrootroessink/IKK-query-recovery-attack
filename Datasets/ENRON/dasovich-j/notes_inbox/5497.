Thanks Jeremy.  I did receive the fax.  We are currently working internally 
at finalizing the tariff, which should be done well in advance of the April 
anniversary.  Will keep you posted on progress.

Subject: ICAs

Mona:

Trust you got the faxed CPUC Decisions on ETI - the first granted the
CLC CPCN and the second corrects the ALJ's overlooking of the NDIEC
(what you might call IXC) authority.

We still need, as you probably have heard before, to file the final
initial tariffs per the Decisions.  Jeff and/or Sue was going to approve
consumer forms and final service language, and we should file those no
later than April (one year), if not sooner.  Otherwise, you can get an
extension on exercising ETI's authority if necessary.

Also note that if ETI is using network facilities in Sacramento area
(collocation, etc) we will likely want to execute ICAs with Citizens and
Roseville in that area (small ILECs).  We can send additional ICAs for
these ILECs (and for Pacific and GTEC/Verizon) as warranted.

Thx.
