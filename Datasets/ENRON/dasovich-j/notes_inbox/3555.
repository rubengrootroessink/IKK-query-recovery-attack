Just one Republican voted for the measure that Gov. Gray Davis and other=20

Davis and other Democrats had enlisted various interest groups -- including=

Special report
How Californians got burned
The state electricity system is in a shambles, and the worst may be ahead.=
=20
How did things get to this point?


(Published May 6, 2001)

It isn't like California's political and business leaders got together and=

decided to wreck the state's electricity system. It just worked out that wa=
y.=20
From the very start, a series of critical miscalculations and=20
behind-the-scenes efforts of energy brokers, politicians and utilities=20
dovetailed almost perfectly to create a new era in California.=20
But a months-long review by The Bee of what led to the current fiasco revea=
ls=20
that state leaders ignored warnings -- in public testimony, insider memos a=
nd=20
trade journals -- that their new system would be prone to manipulation and=
=20
price gouging.=20
State officials were so eager to move deregulation forward that they even=
=20
kept some warnings from landing in the hands of federal authorities who=20
rubber-stamped California's plans.=20
Today, the results are well-known: California is drawing down its budget=20
surplus at a rate of $50 million or more a day to pay for electricity,=20
utilities are broke, rates are going up and summer blackouts are looming.=
=20
But the juggernaut that led to deregulation began a decade ago with the bes=
t=20
of intentions.=20
Part of it stemmed from a warning by former Major League Baseball=20
Commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Part of it came from the perilous state of=20
California's economy at the time.=20
And part of it began with O.J. Simpson.=20
The first days
The deck was stacked against Robert Levin from the beginning.=20
The expert on energy pricing flew to Los Angeles to warn that California's=
=20
Public Utilities Commission was making a huge mistake.=20

How it happened
Here's a look at key actions taken on the road to power deregulation in=20
California:=20
The PUC
The California Public Utilities Commission approved the state's deregulatio=
n=20
plan on Dec. 20, 1995, by a 3-2 vote. Voting yes were Daniel W. Fessler, P.=
=20
Gregory Conlon and Henry Duque. Voting no were Jessie Knight Jr. and Josiah=
=20
Neeper. All five were appointees of Gov. Pete Wilson.=20
WEPEX
Following the PUC vote, a revolving set of the dozen or so members of the=
=20
Western Power Exchange Steering Committee met at airport hotels up and down=
=20
the state to discuss the logistics of deregulation. Members included=20
representatives of the major utilities, such as PG&E, San Diego Gas &=20
Electric, Southern California Edison and SMUD. Also represented were power=
=20
regulators, such as the PUC and the Energy Commission, and a number of ener=
gy=20
providers, marketers and users, ranging from the Independent Energy Produce=
rs=20
to the California Large Energy Consumers Association (CLECA).=20
California Legislature
On Aug. 30, 1996, the state Assembly took the first vote on AB 1890, the=20
deregulation bill. Approval was unanimous, 77-0. The state Senate voted 39-=
0=20
the following day. The bill was signed by Wilson on Sept. 23.=20
FERC
A key vote by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was interim approval=
=20
for operation of California's bifurcated grid operation - the Power Exchang=
e=20
and the Independent System Operator - taken on Oct. 29, 1997. The three=20
members at that time, who approved it unanimously, were Vicky A. Bailey, a=
=20
Republican, and Democrats James J. Hoecker and William L. Massey.=20
In their words

- Independent System Operator CEO Jeffrey Tranen, recounting a sudden spike=

in one of ISO's side markets to $5,000 a megawatt hour, July 9, 1998.=20
--Bee metro staff=20

A consultant for the utility prepared a document describing how the new=20
electricity market would hamstring the people in charge of making sure the=
=20
state had enough electricity, and that the cumbersome system would drive up=
=20
electricity costs.=20
On June 28, 1996, the utility filed a 71-page statement with federal=20
officials explaining its opposition to the market structure supported by th=
e=20
state's other large, publicly traded utilities, Southern California Edison=
=20
and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=20
But the FERC, which had to approve any change in California's market, never=
=20
considered the statement. SDG&E withdrew its comments under pressure from=
=20
then-Gov. Pete Wilson's office and others.=20
"Officially, (those comments) don't exist," said John Chandley, a 20-year=
=20
veteran of the California Energy Commission. "You read those comments, and=
=20
it's a roadmap of what happened."=20
It was hardly the only map available.=20
The California Municipal Utilities Association issued a similar warning in=
=20
1996. The Public Utilities Commission cautioned legislators that a power=20
shortage could drive prices up in the new market, although the PUC then=20
turned around and predicted that would never happen.=20
A 1998 utility industry journal outlined ways to manipulate or "game" the=
=20
markets; and only three months after deregulation began, someone was able t=
o=20
drive up the cost of a megawatt of electricity from $1 to $5,000 in a matte=
r=20
of hours.=20
The system was so flawed that a dentist on an airplane figured it out using=
 a=20
pen and a cocktail napkin.=20
An unstoppable concept
Texas state Sen. David Sibley came to California in January 1998 to visit=
=20
with energy officials in preparation for moving his state toward=20
deregulation.=20
Yet something about California's new market perplexed him, and on the fligh=
t=20
home he started doodling.=20
"We got a napkin, and it looked like you could game the power exchange," sa=
id=20
Sibley. "We had our (PUC) guy and our staff and people just started talking=
=20
about how you could figure out how to withhold just enough electricity. We=
=20
were just kind of toying with it, kind of war games things on the airplane.=
"=20
"Now, I'm a dentist," Sibley said, "and if I could figure it out, it seemed=
=20
like someone else could, too."=20
Once California joined the rush to deregulate, however, it became=20
unstoppable.=20
The airlines had been deregulated, and airfares had gone down. The natural=
=20
gas industry had been freed up, and rates had dropped. Telephone deregulati=
on=20
had spawned entire new industries.=20
Electricity was the next obvious target, and California politicians were=20
under pressure from the state's largest manufacturers to do something --=20
anything -- to give them a break.=20
California was under siege in 1992. The recession and massive cutbacks in=
=20
military spending in California had hobbled the state's economy. The state'=
s=20
power troubles were noted in the 1992 Ueberroth Report, a study on the=20
state's economic competitiveness headed by millionaire Peter Ueberroth, the=
=20
former baseball commissioner and Olympics czar.=20
Energy costs were among the highest in the nation, and steel manufacturers=
=20
and other heavy industrial companies were clamoring for cheaper power.=20
Years of lobbying and millions of dollars in political contributions from=
=20
energy firms had softened resistance. Among those pushing was Enron Corp., =
a=20
Houston-based natural gas marketer nosing its way into the $200=20
billion-a-year electricity business.=20
In the mid-1990s, Enron was aggressively hopscotching from state to state,=
=20
urging deregulation and offering money and promises.=20
The company pushed for opening up markets in Iowa and Michigan, priming=20
politicians there with contributions. In 1997, it doled out more than=20
$858,000 in soft money and political-action contributions to members of=20
Congress, becoming the largest contributor from the energy industry. That=
=20
year it hired Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, to=20
preach its agenda.=20
At the time, Enron was a comparatively small ($8 billion a year in revenue)=
=20
marketer of natural gas. But it was on its way toward becoming one of the=
=20
world's most successful companies, a $100-billion-a-year giant that counts=
=20
President Bush among its friends.=20
Enron had qualms about the system California was leaning toward. In testimo=
ny=20
before the PUC in June 1994, it warned that the highly centralized market=
=20
structure could lead to higher prices.=20
But ultimately the company joined the chorus urging California to plunge=20
ahead. Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling told the PUC in 1994 that Californi=
a=20
could lower its $23 billion-a-year energy bills by as much as $9 billion --=
=20
enough money to triple the police forces of its largest cities.=20
"Commissioners, the patient is on the ground bleeding," Skilling testified.=
=20
"Delay kills."=20
The color books
As California's recession deepened, Wilson's approval rating plummeted, and=
=20
aides fretted about an economic snowball effect.=20
Wilson settled on a rescue plan -- full deregulation -- and appointed membe=
rs=20
to the PUC who shared his free-market leanings. Three PUC staffers set thin=
gs=20
into motion in February 1993 with the release of a 200-page report declarin=
g=20
that change was needed.=20
That report, nicknamed the "Yellow Book" for its cover, declared that the=
=20
century-old system was "ill-suited to govern today's electric industry."=20
Consumers would benefit from a change, the report concluded. Slightly more=
=20
than a year later, the PUC commissioners formalized their staffers'=20
conclusions in a report dubbed the "Blue Book."=20
The Blue Book outlined a tentative plan for opening up the energy=20
marketplace. Instead of guaranteeing the utilities a monopoly and capping=
=20
their rates, California would become one of the first states to let custome=
rs=20
choose their electricity provider while letting rates float.=20
By January 2002, the PUC envisioned, every Californian would shop for=20
electricity the way people shop for long distance telephone service.=20
The book hit with the force of an earthquake, according to one consultant.=
=20
Markets tanked as investors dumped energy stocks out of fear that competiti=
on=20
meant the staid but stable utilities would be shredded by nimble new=20
competitors.=20
"The barbarians were at the gates," said Tom Willoughby, a retired PG&E=20
lobbyist.=20
Those barbarians wanted more. Enron and other out-of-state power companies,=
=20
backed by consumer groups, told policy-makers that in order for everyone to=
=20
have a fair chance at attracting customers, the three big utilities had to =
be=20
defanged.=20
Their proposed remedy: Make them sell off most of their power plants.=20
Faced with this assault, the utilities set their own ground rules. They wou=
ld=20
break up their monopolies if the state let them charge customers for=20
"stranded costs" -- debts from nuclear power projects and other costs they=
=20
believed they'd eat in a competitive market. Wilson, who'd collected $120,0=
00=20
in campaign contributions from the utilities, agreed that the utilities=20
should collect $16 billion in stranded costs from ratepayers.=20
With that, the utilities became enthusiastic backers of deregulation.=20
"Competition will work to drive costs down," John Bryson, Edison's chairman=
,=20
told commissioners at their June 1994 hearing.=20
Behind the scenes, Edison was working to make sure it was the right kind of=
=20
competition.=20
Edison and the San Diego utility settled on a system where utilities would=
=20
buy their power from a centralized "pool" of electricity. They and others h=
it=20
upon the idea of a high-powered field trip.=20
In March 1994, the California Foundation for the Environment and the Econom=
y,=20
a utility-backed group, sent PUC members, lawmakers and utility executives =
to=20
the United Kingdom to see a pool in action.=20
During a weeklong, dawn-to-dusk blitz, the Californians toured power plants=
=20
and utility offices and visited the crown jewel of the U.K. system: the=20
National Grid, a kind of stock exchange through which every electron in=20
England and Wales was bought and sold.=20
The Californians came away impressed by the Grid and its disciplined tradin=
g=20
system.=20
"You just wring out the inefficiencies through the bidding," Conlon recalle=
d.=20
"It just kept driving the rates down."=20
The compromise
Gov. Pete Wilson was puffed up with pride on Sept. 23, 1996. It was a sunny=
=20
San Diego day, and Wilson was there to baptize one of his offspring: a bill=
=20
to deregulate California's electricity markets.=20
"What we are doing is more than signing a new law," Wilson said at the=20
signing ceremony. "We are shifting the balance of power in California."=20
That balance had begun to tip a year earlier, when Wilson and his top aides=
=20
stepped in to speed things up.=20
Edison and PG&E were squabbling over details of the new market, and=20
deregulation seemed to be stalled. PG&E was objecting to the "pool" system,=
=20
which it thought would stifle competition. Instead, PG&E favored a more=20
free-market approach that would let the utilities buy power from whomever=
=20
they wanted.=20
Wilson's own attention was more focused on the possibility of running for=
=20
president and the throat problems that temporarily stole his speaking voice=
=20
-- and his ability to campaign.=20
But his staff worked to hammer out an agreement with the utilities, the=20
California Manufacturers Association, energy marketers and others.=20
"CMA had access to the governor's office day-to-day," recalled Eric Woychik=
,=20
who was acting as an adviser to consumer groups. "We made jokes about how=
=20
they had their own office in the governor's office."=20
In the end, Wilson and his aides made a Solomon-like decision. They cut the=
=20
baby in half. Instead of a completely free-market system, they agreed to a=
=20
centralized pool for buying and selling power but also allowed buyers and=
=20
sellers to cut their own, independent power deals.=20
The pool would be further split in two: Most of the state's electricity wou=
ld=20
be traded on something called the California Power Exchange. Another entity=
,=20
called the Independent System Operator, would manage the state's transmissi=
on=20
grid and buy last-minute power to balance supply and demand.=20
Divvying up the pool was crucial to the deal, said George Dunn, then Wilson=
's=20
chief of staff, because it lessened the utilities' clout by ending their=20
stranglehold on the grid.=20
Nowadays, Wilson concedes the setup "was not a perfect free-market=20
institution," but at the time it seemed like the only workable compromise. =
In=20
December 1995, the PUC approved deregulation by a 3-2 vote, putting most of=
=20
the major elements into place.=20
The state's big utilities would be directed to sell off many of their power=
=20
plants. Individual customers, ranging from businesses to homeowners, could =
go=20
outside the Power Exchange to buy their electricity. But the three big=20
utilities had to rely on the exchange to purchase their electricity.=20
Most of the commissioners, all Wilson appointees, were sure that having the=
=20
utilities buy electricity on a daily basis would produce panic selling by t=
he=20
power generators.=20
And prices would drop like stones in a lake.=20
No dissent allowed
Not everyone was so sure. Officials with San Diego Gas & Electric believed=
=20
that the rules governing the pool were cumbersome, prone to secrecy and=20
inefficiency.=20
Some analysts even suggested the power generators and energy marketing firm=
s=20
would be able to play one organization off the other -- holding back=20
electricity from the Power Exchange, then selling to the ISO at the last=20
minute, when prices peaked.=20
But they were having trouble making themselves heard.=20
For months following the PUC's December 1995 vote, a group consisting of=20
utilities, government regulators, energy marketers and industrial and=20
commercial users had participated in a series of talks aimed at ironing out=
=20
the details of deregulation.=20
These coffee-and-doughnut sessions of the Western Power Exchange Steering=
=20
Committee were theoretically open to the public, but keeping track of them=
=20
was complicated because they rotated among airport hotels from San Francisc=
o=20
to Riverside.=20
At one of the first meetings, Woychik, who had been sent by consumer groups=
,=20
says he was told by the chairman that he was not welcome: The other members=
=20
had voted against seating him. Others involved confirmed the recollections =
of=20
Woychik, who was already known as a critic of the proposed electricity=20
market.=20
The pressure was on to present a united front. But Woychik still struggled =
to=20
air his concerns.=20
In January 1996, he told a conference of federal regulators that some parts=
=20
of the proposed electricity market "are invitations to classic gaming."=20
He elaborated the next month, writing to the Western Power Exchange that, f=
or=20
savvy operators, gaming the market "should be like shooting fish in a barre=
l=20
-- not great sport, but lucrative."=20
Later, in a January 1998 trade journal article, Woychik described in detail=
=20
four major "games" that could be played in the newly minted California=20
electricity market. One involved generators saying their plants were down=
=20
during times of peak demand to drive up prices -- a prophecy many believe=
=20
came true last year.=20
Deregulation had lots of cheerleaders. But Woychik was not the only one=20
raising red flags.=20
In a July 2, 1996, letter to the Legislature, even the PUC acknowledged tha=
t=20
in times of shortage, market manipulation would be a danger. But the PUC=20
predicted that such shortages wouldn't occur, and excess power would keep=
=20
prices down.=20
Chandley, meanwhile, had taken up the charge of criticizing the market rule=
s=20
at the Western Power Exchange meetings, speaking on behalf of the Californi=
a=20
Energy Commission.=20
The Governor's Office was considering whether to let the Energy Commission=
=20
file an official dissent with federal regulators, who had to OK the plan,=
=20
when Chandley set off on a business trip to Massachusetts. Changing planes =
in=20
Dallas, he stopped at a pay phone to check in with his office and got the=
=20
word: Wilson's office had ruled there would be no dissent.=20
Within a week, Chandley quit.=20
Federal regulators later accepted the California plan. As William Massey, a=
=20
member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recalls: "Essentially, =
we=20
deferred to the market plan that was handed us."=20
Death march
State lawmakers began taking up deregulation in summer 1996, and a bright,=
=20
ambitious and abrasive Democratic senator from El Cajon named Steve Peace=
=20
found himself at the forefront. Peace announced plans to scrap the PUC plan=
=20
in favor of something better and cheaper.=20
Then Wilson stepped in.=20
In a letter, the governor made it clear that no tinkering would be tolerate=
d,=20
saying he would "oppose any legislation which seeks to alter the decision's=
=20
basic framework or timeline."=20
The lawmakers backed off.=20
For months they labored over deregulation in a series of late-night=20
negotiating sessions that became known as "the Steve Peace death march" --=
=20
focused almost exclusively on side issues of deregulation.=20
Unions made sure that power plant employees got treated fairly.=20
Environmentalists got millions in eco-subsidies. Utilities saw to it that=
=20
billions in "stranded costs" would indeed be paid by ratepayers. Ordinary=
=20
consumers got a 10 percent rate cut, and consumer groups largely kept quiet=
.=20
Even Mother Nature nudged lawmakers forward.=20
At 2:06 p.m. on a blazing summer day in August 1996, a power line in an=20
Oregon forest began to sag until it touched a tree, shorting out the line.=
=20
Over the next two hours, four other lines came into contact with trees. By =
4=20
p.m. the shorts along the intricate web of power transmission lines caused =
a=20
blackout that affected 4 million people in nine U.S. states stretching from=
=20
Canada to Mexico.=20
Experts warned that the electricity system was too fragile, that there had =
to=20
be some sort of backup -- like the ISO -- to protect the grid, some kind of=
=20
independent organization standing ready to keep the lights on at all costs.=
=20
The legislation passed unanimously, Wilson signed it and deregulation was s=
et=20
in motion. The utilities, directed by the PUC to start selling their power=
=20
plants to establish a free market, went at it with gusto.=20
PG&E sold its plants for $1.5 billion, far more than the book value of $981=
=20
million. Southern California Edison got nearly $1.2 billion for plants valu=
ed=20
at $677 million.=20
Power generators ended up spending most of their capital buying those old=
=20
plants instead of building new ones. Dunn, Wilson's former chief of staff,=
=20
now sees that as an unanticipated flaw: "It was investment that didn't=20
generate new electrons."=20
Light-bulb cakes, free power

with publication of the "Yellow Book," California's deregulated energy mark=

On the first full day of deregulation, ISO officials celebrated with a=20
light-bulb shaped cake. Brochures boasted of "Securing Reliability" and=20
"Power to the people and by the people."=20
The system worked beautifully.=20
Competition among providers drove power prices so low that PG&E gave away=

electricity for free between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. that day. The biggest proble=

BRIAN WALSKI / Los Angeles Times

?????Bankruptcy looms like a dark hole of shame. Bryson decides, with his=
=20
board of directors, to do whatever he can to avoid it. He will try to salva=
ge=20
Edison through political compromise, to cajole and negotiate and plead. The=
=20
decision means that in the coming months he will have to make awful=20
concessions, allow himself to be humiliated and often hold his tongue. He=
=20
will do this out of the conviction that it is the only way to save hundreds=
=20
of Edison jobs, the retirement income of thousands of small investors and t=
he=20
very economy of California.=20
?????He came to Edison almost incidentally 17 years ago, an outsider, the=
=20
model of a new, environmentally sensitive energy executive. As 2001 dawns h=
e=20
is poised to go down in history as a bungler, the man who led a solid,=20
century-old utility into ruin. Such a legacy is unthinkable, but as he runs=
=20
from it, he embarks on a tortuous slide of disappointment.
?????Today, four months after the crisis hit public consciousness, there's=
=20
still a chance that Bryson will work out a political solution. But it's a=
=20
thin one, and it has come at a very high price.

?????January: Hope, Then Failure
?????Edison is several billion dollars in debt and losing millions more eac=
h=20
day as electricity prices soar. Banks cut off credit. Blackouts are=20
threatened across California. Bryson's mood is one of astonishment: How can=
=20
government regulators let it go this far? Why won't someone step in? Then, =
in=20
the waning days of the Clinton administration, he is called to a White Hous=
e=20
summit.
?????California Gov. Gray Davis, who refused to meet Bryson earlier to=20
address the crisis, is there. So are the electricity wholesalers accused of=
=20
price gouging. After weeks of blaming one another, all sides have finally=
=20
come to Washington to look for solutions. Bryson is hopeful. Everyone, he=
=20
says, takes the high road.
?????A vague plan is hatched: The state will jump in to buy wholesale=20
electricity. Suppliers will sign cheaper long-term contracts. Edison and=20
Pacific Gas & Electric, the troubled San Francisco utility, will pay off=20
their debts through a state-backed bond issue, regain credit-worthiness and=
=20
eventually return to normal business.
?????Back at Rosemead headquarters the next day, running on cold coffee,=20
Bryson and a handful of Edison lawyers, engineers and money managers fill i=
n=20
the details. They go without sleep and call co-workers out of bed to ask th=
em=20
the rate at which transmission lines lose electrons.
?????By the afternoon of Jan. 12, three days after the summit, the plan is=
=20
solid enough to talk about publicly.
?????"I'm very optimistic," Bryson declares, relieved that the crisis has=
=20
been addressed at last. "We'll know whether or not this works in the next t=
wo=20
to three weeks."
?????It won't.
?????A week later, President Bush, decidedly less fond of federal=20
intervention, is inaugurated, and the goodwill generated in Washington=20
evaporates. Energy prices climb even higher in California. Meanwhile, Davis=
=20
plans an auction for long-term energy contracts that he swears will bring=
=20
prices down. So much for a simple fix.

?????Insult to Injury
?????The following weeks bring showers of bad news. Edison defaults on loan=
s,=20
suspends dividends and forces some of its largest business customers to cut=
=20
power. Several times, the utility comes within a hair of rolling outages.
?????Bryson laments the lack of progress. He can't understand why the tone =
in=20
Sacramento has turned so hostile, why Edison is painted as a villain when=
=20
faulty state regulations created this mess. This is a private company, he=
=20
says, over and over. The state cannot force it to operate at a loss any mor=
e=20
than it can force a service station to pump gas below cost.
?????"There's some quality to this whole thing that makes it sound like the=
=20
utilities are supplicants, pleading for help," Bryson says, bewildered. "Th=
is=20
is our right [to cover costs] and the business doesn't work without it.=20
That's the most basic premise."
?????Often seething with anger, he tries to be discreet and diplomatic. The=
=20
route to a deal is too delicate to risk offense. Yet his anger turns to=20
outrage Jan. 19 when the state Public Utilities Commission issues an=20
aggressive restraining order that compels Edison to continue delivering=20
electricity to its customers no matter how much money it loses. There's no=
=20
need for such an order, Bryson complains, and it's an insult to all Edison=
=20
employees to suggest otherwise.=20
?????He paces the plush beige carpet outside his office. Edison is entitled=
=20
to cover reasonable costs, he says.
?????"These guys," he says of the PUC members, "are thumbing their noses at=
=20
the law." When a reporter asks a question about PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lync=
h,=20
Bryson nearly rants.=20
?????"She's a very negative person," he says, then feels the crack in his=
=20
veneer. With a laugh and wave of his hands, he wipes it away.
?????"Oh no," he says, "I'm not going to go there." He does it with an=20
easygoing boyishness that still serves him well at 57, despite the hair=20
that's nearly gone white.=20
?????Sometimes in this crisis, Bryson appears haggard, unwell. But more=20
often, and at the oddest times, he is buoyant, with a half smile that seems=
=20
to be choking back a snort of laughter. It's a disarming affectation, and=
=20
confusing. It makes him seem almost cavalier, almost masking the fact that =
he=20
has turned his life over to solving this crisis.
?????Bryson, the son of an Oregon sawmill operator, graduated from Stanford=
=20
University and went on to Yale Law School in the late 1960s. Bright and=20
idealistic, he co-founded the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, =
a=20
still-thriving environmental protection law firm.
?????He was barely into his 30s when Gov. Jerry Brown appointed him to chai=
r=20
the California Water Resources Control Board. Three years later, in 1979,=
=20
Brown made Bryson a member of the PUC. He later practiced law for a while,=
=20
then--through friendships cultivated at the PUC--joined Southern California=
=20
Edison as a vice president. Six years later, he took over the job of the ma=
n=20
who recruited him, Chief Executive Howard Allen.
?????Life at a regulated utility can be very good, and Edison grew on him. =
He=20
liked the easy pace, the terrific pay ($2.2 million last year). He liked th=
e=20
people around him. They were smart, steady, nice. Above all, he liked the=
=20
utility's integrity, its image as a reliable corporate citizen.
?????Life at a deregulated utility would be very different.
?????Edison's rescue plan circulates in Sacramento. To Bryson's great=20
annoyance, what he regards as a right to financial survival is being labele=
d=20
a "bailout" by critics. The criticism fuels the idea that if Sacramento=20
floats billions in bonds to help Edison pay its debt, the utility should gi=
ve=20
up something valuable. Perhaps its hydroelectric system. Or its transmissio=
n=20
grid. In a world of populist political rhetoric, the trade-off is sold as "=
a=20
dollar for a hot dog," in the words of Senate Leader John Burton (D-San=20
Francisco).
?????To Bryson, these assets are chunks of Edison's soul, designed by Ediso=
n=20
engineers, built by Edison linemen. They were marvels in their time, proof=
=20
that man could harness nature on a massive scale. How could he give up Big=
=20
Creek--Edison's legendary series of dams and powerhouses deep in the Sierra=
=20
Nevada? That was the first place Bryson called top Edison management togeth=
er=20
when he was named chief executive in 1990 because he wanted to start his te=
rm=20
with the stamp of history.=20
?????Photos of the massive powerhouses hang on his office wall. Bryson walk=
s=20
past them, to a bookcase on the far side of his spacious office, and pulls=
=20
out a photo book documenting Big Creek's construction.
?????"Take it," he tells a visitor. "Maybe it will help you understand."
?????Initially, Bryson and other executives say no deal on hydro or the gri=
d.=20
Then they waver: maybe, but only at a fair price. But already, Bryson is=20
making the mental adjustment, accepting the loss, doing whatever he can to=
=20
stay out of bankruptcy.
?????He is clinging to two hopes. The first is that a state audit will prov=
e=20
Edison did nothing wrong, but simply followed the misguided rules that=20
abruptly pushed California into a deregulated energy market. The second is=
=20
that Edison will prevail in its lawsuit against the PUC in which it seeks t=
o=20
increase electricity rates to cover its ballooning costs.
?????In the end, neither happens. The audit alleges no criminal wrongdoing,=
=20
but is extremely complex and open to interpretation. It does not explicitly=
=20
ask, or answer, whether Edison did anything wrong. The lawsuit fails to=20
produce an immediate rate increase, and a trial is years away. Edison's=20
stability continues to erode.
?????Bryson has to look hard for a few bright moments. On Jan. 23, he=20
receives a letter from shareholder W.R. Cate, a retired telephone company=
=20
manager in Henderson, N.C. He and his wife and children hold 1,500 shares;=
=20
they've lost more than $10,000 in the last month.=20
?????"We are behind you," Cate writes. "Bargain hard until you see some=20
blood."=20
?????Bryson writes back the same day: "Many thanks for your perceptive and=
=20
insightful letter. . . . It was a ray of light and fun. We do intend to=20
bargain hard until we see some blood."
?????His job becomes a blur of conference calls, predawn pages and=20
last-minute shuttle flights. His world is this Rosemead office, where he=20
often settles into a beige armchair and eats his lunch off a cafeteria tray=
;=20
airports, where he boards the Southwest shuttle to or from Sacramento, and=
=20
legislative hallways, where he trolls for allies.
?????The closest thing to a routine is the daily meeting with the inner=20
circle. At least once a day, Bryson strides across the plush-carpeted hall =
to=20
a conference room for an update on Edison's latest strategy. To each new id=
ea=20
from Sacramento, they respond earnestly, as if it were already law. The nex=
t=20

an allegation that the parent corporation stole money from its starving=20
utility to pay off shareholders.
?????In fact, Bryson insists, the transfer of funds, detailed in the state=

?????But his pleas produce no Times editorials reflecting his comments.
?????Two days later, a clear-headed Bryson addresses the Legislature with a=

taxes to the parent company, Edison International? The implication is that=
=20
Edison International found another way to drain the utility--and, thus,=20
ratepayers--of cash.
?????Bryson insists it's not that devious. The PUC required the utility and=

its parent company to figure their taxes separately. SCE paid those taxes t=

the parent. But losses from other subsidiaries lowered Edison International=

taxes and allowed it to keep some of the SCE money.
?????Did SCE overpay Edison International in taxes? the legislator asks aga=

?????It's complicated, Bryson says. But, yes, we did.

?????Bryson has to explain his decision to disheartened employees, many of=

Power Cut to Parts of State=20
Electricity: First blackouts since March may be the beginning of warm-weath=
er=20
outages, industry officials warn.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS, Times Staff Writers=20

?????The dreaded summer of 2001 cast its shadow over California on Monday a=
s=20
an early spate of hot weather forced an hour of scattered, statewide=20
electrical blackouts--a precursor of what could be a difficult season ahead=
.
?????With more warm weather expected today and tomorrow, state power=20
officials warned that more blackouts might be necessary before an expected=
=20
cooling trend later in the week. And they acknowledged that this could be t=
he=20
start of a long, dark summer.
?????"I hate to be the bearer of bad news," said Ed Riley, a spokesman for=
=20
the agency that operates the statewide electrical grid, "but yeah, this is=
=20
the start."
?????The blackouts, the first since March, were triggered at 4:45 p.m. afte=
r=20
a day in which the California Independent System Operator struggled to patc=
h=20
together enough electricity to keep the grid running without outages. That=
=20
worked for most of the day, but finally a combination of warm weather and=
=20
power plant outages proved to be too much for the grid jockeys, and they we=
re=20
forced to order the hourlong blackouts, which affected about 100,000=20
residential, industrial and commercial customers.
?????The customers hit by the outage were those served by the state's three=
=20
largest private utilities--Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edis=
on=20
and San Diego Gas & Electric--plus a number of people served by municipal=
=20
utilities in Pasadena and Vernon.
?????As has been the case throughout the power crisis, which began last=20
summer, customers of the municipally owned Los Angeles Department of Water=
=20
and Power were spared. The DWP operates independently of the statewide grid=
.
?????State officials have been warning for months that this summer would=20
probably bring frequent blackouts. Demand for electricity in California has=
=20
far outstripped the supply, and the state's ability to import power from=20
elsewhere in the West has been limited by a drought in the Pacific Northwes=
t,=20
which relies heavily on hydroelectricity, and by prices that have soared=20
beyond the reach of the private utilities.
?????The heat that triggered Monday's blackouts was far from the hottest th=
at=20
can be expected this summer. Temperatures ranged from the 70s along the=20
Southern California coast to 80 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, 95 degrees=
=20
in Northridge and Sacramento, and a statewide high of 104 degrees in Palm=
=20
Springs.
?????However, there also were more power plants out of service than officia=
ls=20
hope will be the case this summer. In all, about 12,500 megawatts of power=
=20
were unavailable, mostly because of planned outages for maintenance. That=
=20
amounts to about one-quarter of the state's peak summer demand for power.
?????California uses more electricity in the summer because air conditioner=
s=20
require vast amounts of power. Power officials said the latest blackouts we=
re=20
an ominous sign.
?????"This is probably typical of what we'll see this summer, but I would s=
ay=20
this was a less than full experience," said Dick Rosenblum, Edison senior=
=20
vice president for distribution and transmission.
?????"Here we go," said Michael Zenker, California director of Cambridge=20
Energy Research Associates, a Massachusetts energy consulting firm. "This i=
s=20
a bad omen for how bad the situation is."
?????Rosenblum said about 34,000 Edison customers lost power during the=20
blackouts. They were scattered across Edison's 50,000-square-mile territory=
,=20
and included such communities as Irvine, Barstow, Santa Monica, Long Beach=
=20
and Inglewood, he said.
?????The blackouts also affected about 54,000 PG&E customers scattered=20
through Northern and Central California, and about 8,600 customers of SDG&E=
=20
in parts of San Diego and Orange counties.
?????As is typical in such blackouts, the utilities received only a few=20
minutes' warning from Cal-ISO before they had to pull the plug.
?????No serious incidents were reported. "People are starting to get the ha=
ng=20
of this," observed Tustin Police Lt. Mike Shanahan, who said he was=20
pleasantly surprised at the ease with which drivers in his Orange County=20
community began treating blacked-out signals as four-way stops.
?????The blackouts came slightly more than two hours after Cal-ISO official=
s=20
expressed cautious optimism that they might squeak through the day. Worries=
=20
in the morning had eased when the state received 1,000 megawatts from a=20
Canadian supplier, and when "interruptible" customers--those who agree to=
=20
occasionally shut off power in exchange for lower rates--came through when=
=20
asked.
?????Riley guessed that the late-afternoon shortage occurred when the=20
interruptible customers turned their power back on. In the past, he said,=
=20
such customers--usually large businesses and institutions--typically quit=
=20
work for the day rather than wait around to turn the power back on.
?????"For some reason today, some of that load came back," Riley said.
?????He said it was difficult to immediately determine the extent to which=
=20
Californians were conserving electricity, and whether poor conservation=20
efforts could be blamed for the blackouts.
?????Gov. Gray Davis has been exhorting Californians to conserve energy as=
=20
part of a multi-pronged--and hotly contested--state strategy to cope with=
=20
power shortages and exorbitant prices.
?????On Monday, speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis thanked=
=20
President Bush "for what he has done to date"--a rare bouquet--but was=20
clearly critical of recent comments made by Vice President Dick Cheney that=
=20
energy prices should not be capped or regulated under any circumstances, ev=
en=20
if the problem threatens the nation's economy.
?????"By far the most important thing that the federal government could do=
=20
for us is to moderate prices, which are staggering," Davis said. He said it=
=20
would be a "grave mistake" for the Bush administration to "rigidly adhere t=
o=20
ideology even if it meant hardship for California."
?????Also Monday, Davis said he anticipates that a deal to purchase the=20
transmission system of San Diego Gas & Electric "will be resolved before th=
e=20
week is out." He has offered more than $7 billion to buy the transmission=
=20
systems of SDG&E, Edison and PG&E. So far, only Edison has accepted the dea=
l.=20
PG&E's ability to sell its grid has been complicated, if not thwarted, by t=
he=20
company's decision to file for protection in federal Bankruptcy Court.
?????Davis has faced difficulty at every turn attempting to rescue the=20
state's electrical system while staying afloat in a political tar pit.
?????The latest setback took shape over the past few days as chief executiv=
es=20
of several independent power companies turned down the governor's invitatio=
n=20
to a meeting in his office on Wednesday. Davis had sent out the invitations=

to a dozen chief executives last week. Most responded by offering to send=

?????Ely said the estimate of 10% savings is based on the experience of=20

?????Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency=

legislation that would authorize up to $13.4 billion in bonds to repay the=
=20
state budget, leading Democrats to push forward with a last-gasp strategy.
?????The Legislature's ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by=20
introducing an identical, nonemergency measure that required only majority=
=20
approval, not two-thirds passage. It was approved by the Assembly Monday=20
evening on a 49-29 vote, and is expected to receive final Senate approval=

Thursday.=20
?????Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in=
=20
full for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities, the=20
Democrats' action carries a series of negative consequences for the state a=
s=20
it seeks to escape the energy crisis.
?????The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of 90 days to become law aft=
er=20
the special session ends, effectively leaving the general fund with a massi=
ve=20
hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months.
?????"We can't sell the bonds as quickly, and will probably need a=20
contingency budget," said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Boulde=
r=20
Creek).
?????Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan wi=
th=20
different levels of funding--one from July, the time the next fiscal year=
=20
begins, to whenever the bonds are eventually sold. Lawmakers may also have =
to=20
consider a worst-case scenario: the possibility that the bonds will not sel=
l.
?????"If [investors] don't buy the bonds," Keeley said, "the situation we'r=
e=20
in is very, very dire because the general fund would be repaid very, very=
=20
slowly."
?????State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow $4.13 billion to=20
partially repay the budget until bonds could be issued, but lawmakers said=
=20
the new legislation will make that impossible. Angelides' tentative deal to=
=20
borrow the money from several Wall Street firms expires today. The deal=20
required authorization on the bonds, because bond proceeds were to be used =
to=20
repay the loan.
?????"The Assembly Republicans' refusal to support emergency legislation pu=
ts=20
the state's fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk, and does serious=
=20
harm to essential services from education to public safety to health care,"=
=20
Angelides said in a statement.
?????The delay also means that Gov. Gray Davis will fail to keep his promis=
e=20
to repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by=
=20
the end of June. That is crucial, because many of the contracts to purchase=
=20
electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may=
=20
make them void if financing is not secured by July 1. If the contracts=20
evaporate, the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive=
=20
spot market to avoid blackouts.
?????Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money o=
n=20
power purchases by floating a record bond issue, which would be repaid by=
=20
utility ratepayers out of their monthly bills. But the bonds cannot be issu=
ed=20
until the bill in question takes effect.
?????In a statement, Davis also accused Republicans of "obstructing the=20
solution" to the state's electricity problems, saying "their decision to pl=
ay=20
partisan politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget=
=20
process and could ultimately threaten our economy."
?????So far this year, California has spent more than $5 billion from the=
=20
budget buying power for the private utilities that were too financially=20
strapped to continue doing so.
?????Most critically, the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of=
=20
time for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before sta=
te=20
coffers begin to run dry in early fall. The $12.5-billion bond is expected =
to=20
be the largest in American history, and experts say it will require a=20
significant sales effort. The Democrats' bill authorizes a slightly larger=
=20
amount in case the bond issue needs to grow.
?????Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D--Sherman Oaks) said he will continue=
=20
working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the=
=20
bonds sooner.
?????"I'm still holding out an olive branch to Republicans," Hertzberg said=
.
?????Lastly, the bill's final passage will kill, temporarily at least,=20
hundreds of energy-related bills now winding their way through the=20
Legislature. That is because, for the bill to become law as quickly as=20
possible, Democrats would have to adjourn the current special legislative=
=20
session on the energy crisis.
?????Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this=
=20
week before the session is closed down. And Davis is expected to immediatel=
y=20
call another special session, said spokesman Steve Maviglio, so most of the=
=20
remaining bills could be reintroduced.
?????Nonetheless, the process would slow down passage of numerous=20
measures--especially for Republicans, who may have a harder time getting=20
their bills through both houses a second time. Republicans hold only 30 of=
=20
the Assembly's 80 seats, and 14 of the Senate's 40 seats, making them a=20
distinct minority.
?????Without question, the Democrats' move represents a ratcheting up of=20
partisan politics on the energy crisis.
?????Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis=
=20
and his Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the stat=
e=20
out of the crisis--even if it meant scaling back the next state budget.
?????Davis has proposed borrowing the $12.5 billion to repay the budget and=
=20
cover future power purchases over the next two years, which would allow his=
=20
next state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis.
?????GOP lawmakers, who are convinced that the size of the bond will need t=

Blackouts Mean More Than Inconvenience for Disabled=20
Energy: They say life-saving equipment could fail. Advocates will urge stat=

officials and utilities to provide a stronger safety net.=20

By JOHN M. GLIONNA, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--As she monitored the news of possibly more rolling=20
blackouts Monday, Lori Gray braced for another tense day in the projected=
=20
summer-long fallout from the state's worsening energy crisis.
?????For the 39-year-old Berkeley woman--who is blind and suffers from=20
epilepsy, asthma and chronic pain from aching joints that restrict=20
movement--losing electricity is more than just an inconvenience.
?????It could kill her, she says.
?????Gray relies on electricity to run several life-saving machines that do=
=20
everything from dispensing her asthma medication and opening her door by=20
remote control to relaying her emergency telephone numbers in a computerize=
d=20
voice.
?????Today, disability activists are calling on state officials and=20
California's utilities to do more to assist residents like Gray--disabled=
=20
people who are perilously vulnerable to any loss of electrical power.
?????In letters to Gov. Gray Davis, the California Public Utilities=20
Commission and Judge Dennis Montali, who is presiding over Pacific Gas &=20
Electric's recent bankruptcy filing, an Oakland-based disability watchdog i=
s=20
calling for a comprehensive statewide system to ensure that disabled people=
=20
do not fall through the energy crisis safety net.
?????Lawyers from Disability Rights Advocates want a state-mandated emergen=
cy=20
plan that responds to the "disproportionate and life-threatening impact of=
=20
the energy crisis on people with disabilities."
?????Activists are calling for a statewide early-warning system; the creati=
on=20
of charging stations on exempt circuits for recharging equipment during=20
blackouts; funds to buy backup batteries and generators and a toll-free=20
emergency hotline for the disabled.
?????They also seek a state investigation into remedies for the long-term=
=20
impacts--including rate increases.
?????Gray says the prospect of losing power and relying on unreliable=20
generators pervades even her dreams.
?????"I spend my days worrying," she says. "I worry over when the next=20
blackout will come. I worry about my friends who are in similar, if not=20
worse, predicaments than me--who rely on their respirators. Let me tell you=
,=20
this is no way to live."
?????At least two utilities said Monday they already employ an early-warnin=
g=20
system for many customers on life support, but were open to other suggestio=
ns=20
on how to improve services for the disabled. They added that the burden als=
o=20
rests with state officials.
?????Activists, who called the letters a first attempt to open discussions =
of=20
the issues, say they have not ruled out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of=
=20
what they say are 3 million people with disabilities in California.
?????"The response should not be an ad hoc process--one utility doing this=
=20
and another that," said Shawna Parks, an attorney for the Oakland nonprofit=
.=20
"We want an organized system that addresses some very serious needs. And as=
=20
for any lawsuit if this doesn't happen, we're not closing any doors."
?????Disability Rights Advocates recently won major concessions in settling=
 a=20
lawsuit it filed against health care giant Kaiser Permanente for failing to=
=20
address the needs of its wheelchair patients.
?????PUC Commissioner Carl Wood said Monday he would be open to any=20
suggestions to assist the sick, elderly and disabled in the event of=20
continued blackouts. "The energy crisis has put a huge burden on the most=
=20
vulnerable people in our society--people just trying to survive," he said.
?????But funding new programs presents problems.
?????"One utility faces bankruptcy and others could be close, so some might=
=20
question the wisdom of giving them new mandates when there may be no money =
to=20
fund them," Wood said. "The goals are reasonable. The question is where the=
=20
money comes from."
?????Dan Quigley, director of emergency communications for PG&E, said the=
=20
company contacts about 22,000 life-support customers before anticipated=20
blackouts. Another 48,000 are part of a medical baseline program in which=
=20
they receive reduced electrical rates.
?????"We didn't design the system to shut people off and cause them=20
inconvenience," he said. "We're eager to work with the PUC and disabled=20
advocates to figure out a system that reduces the disruption."
?????Quigley added, however, that some of the activists' suggestions--such =
as=20
community battery charging stations--would be better served by state=20
emergency response groups.
?????Anita Gore, a spokesperson for the state's massive health and human=20
services agency, said the suggestions will be considered. "This is all=20
relatively new," she said of the blackouts, "so we're gearing up to address=
=20
concerns of the disabled and everyone else."
?????Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for San Diego Gas & Electric, said the compa=
ny=20
notifies 3,500 life-support customers of impending blackouts and "calls tho=
se=20
customers back later to make sure the power has come back on."
?????He echoed concerns about the suggestion of an emergency hotline. "Some=
=20
of those calls might be better handled by 911," he said.
?????Disability Rights Advocates has recently heard from dozens of disabled=
=20
residents from across the state, including a woman who uses a respirator to=
=20
breathe at night--who says she must stay awake during blackouts because she=
=20
cannot afford a generator.
?????A deaf man who uses visual alarms for the phone, doorbell, smoke=20
detector and baby monitor has lost them during blackouts and fears going=20
without power at night--saying his family will have difficulty communicatin=
g=20
because they use sign language.
?????Another disabled woman who uses a wheelchair told advocates she was=20
stranded in her apartment during a blackout because the elevator did not wo=
rk=20
and she could not use the stairs.
?????Parks said activists want the utilities to expand services for the=20
disabled.
?????"There are situations faced by the disabled that aren't defined as=20
critical by the utilities," she said. "There are many more definitions of=
=20
being disabled than to be on a respirator or life support."
?????Lori Gray knows how the system can fail the disabled.
?????She was expelled from PG&E's medical baseline program last summer afte=
r=20
failing to respond to a company letter requiring her to recertify.
?????"They sent a printed letter, but I'm blind and can't see," she said.=

"But they bounced me anyway."

into the program. And when she asked utility officials to attach a staple t=

the return address of future letters so she could distinguish them as=20

In 1st Hearing, PUC Urged to Lift Rate Hike=20
Energy: Speakers call on the agency to rescind the increase approved last=

=20

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer=20

?????The lights were out to save energy in a Santa Monica hearing room, but=
=20
the heat was on as consumers and business representatives urged the=20
California Public Utilities Commission on Monday to spread the pain of rate=
=20
increases fairly--but differed substantially on how that could be=20
accomplished.
?????Many of the more than 30 speakers who appeared at the PUC's first publ=
ic=20
hearing on how to design new electricity rates spent their time trying to=
=20
persuade the commission to undo the increase of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour,=20
which was approved March 27 and is expected to begin appearing on bills in=
=20
June.
?????Although Commissioner Henry Duque and Administrative Law Judge Victor=
=20
Ryerson listened politely and court reporters took down every word, those=
=20
fervent pleas were largely wasted.
?????Ryerson admonished the audience of about 75 people that the hearing=20
would not determine whether rate increases are necessary to pay for soaring=
=20
electricity costs. That already has been decided by the PUC, he said.
?????Rather, the series of hearings this week throughout the state, each=20
attended by one of the five PUC commissioners, will focus on "who pays and=
=20
how much," Ryerson said.
?????That wasn't what consumer advocate Douglas Heller wanted to hear.
?????"The PUC is asking the wrong questions," said Heller of the Foundation=
=20
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "The question that the PU=
C=20
should be asking is: How do we get our state back?"
?????"Small consumers never asked for deregulation and never benefited from=
=20
it," Heller said. "The innocent victims of this public policy nightmare=20
should not bear the burden of the energy industry's greed and the governor'=
s=20
failure to confront it."
?????About 20 different rate plans have been submitted to the PUC, which is=
=20
expected to adopt a rate design at its meeting next Monday. PUC officials=
=20
said that rates will rise by an average of 30% but that some customers will=
=20
see no increases while some will see much larger increases.
?????The commission is under tremendous pressure to devise a new rate=20
structure that encourages conservation but doesn't damage businesses--and t=
o=20
do it in six weeks rather than the usual six months or longer.
?????Some who testified Monday in Santa Monica feared that the new rates wi=
ll=20
cause families to subsidize single users and will penalize those that are=
=20
already conserving electricity.
?????David Marshall, chief financial officer of El Monte-based Gregg=20
Industries, asked that the PUC retain lower rates for the hours when=20
electricity use is lower.
?????Gregg, which employs 400 people to make heavy iron parts for industry,=
=20
has shifted all its production to between midnight and noon, he said. That =
is=20
the only way Gregg can continue to compete, Marshall said.
?????His company does business in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asi=
a,=20
"and in every one of those markets we have direct competitors anxious to ta=
ke=20
business away from us," Marshall said. "California is not an island."
?????Encino resident Donald Tollefson argued that consumers should be spare=
d=20
the brunt of the rate increases because they will be forced to pay twice: f=
or=20
their own higher electricity rates and in the form of price increases as=20
businesses pass along their higher energy costs.
?????"Whatever you do," he said, "you should be fair and compassionate."
?????About 200 people attended a similar hearing in a dimly lit high school=
=20
auditorium in Rosemead.
?????Bob Wellemin, an air-conditioner mechanic from Temple City, said the=
=20
commission should take the blame for not pushing to build more power plants=
.
?????"How on Earth have you been representing the consumers?" he said,=20
evoking applause. "And what I don't understand is that we have three or fou=
r=20
meetings like this ahead. And we got a May 14 deadline to make a decision. =
I=20
don't want to sound skeptical. But how can I not be skeptical when you've g=
ot=20
one representative here and a week to decide."
?????Wellemin also criticized the commission's proposed rate increases,=20
saying that it would hurt people who already conserve energy. As a resident=
=20
with low-energy appliances and no central air-conditioning, he said he woul=
d=20
be penalized because it would be difficult to reduce his power from one mon=

to the next.
?????Others warned the commission to take a methodical approach in deciding=

the rate plan.
?????"If I have to act businesslike, I would expect state representatives t=

?????Ever grateful to the oil bigwigs who made him financially whole while=

the commitment to conservation, endorsed by a long line of presidents of bo=

Phil Verleger Jr., an oil industry analyst in Newport Beach, said the chanc=

Verleger said. "You can't just turn them off and on with a switch."=20

SIGNS OF SETTLING DOWN
However, there are signs that gas prices are stabilizing for now, according=

to Bronwyn Hogan, a spokeswoman for the California State Automobile=20
Association. She said prices are no longer increasing by a penny each day,=
=20
and may in fact be declining slightly in some locations.=20
According to the Energy Information Administration, the national mean gas=

the agency said.=20

Hot weather sparks new round of blackouts=20
SUPPLIES LOW: Usage keeps climbing as temperatures surpass 90 degrees=20

=20

California's long, dark summer began yesterday as the energy crunch forced=
=20
power officials to black out more than 200,000 homes and businesses around=
=20
the state.=20
Soaring temperatures -- and a supply situation so precarious that even a=20
highway project that shut down a gas line in Ventura County was cause for=
=20
concern -- forced the state to turn out the lights.=20
The decision to call for the first blackouts since March 20 came at 4:45 p.=
=20
m. and capped a day when the state's utilities thought they had dodged the=
=20
blackout bullet.=20
"The temperatures ended up well above what was forecast and really took off=
=20
at the end of the day," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the=20
California Independent System Operator. "And demand went right up with it."=
=20
The ISO ordered the state's three private utilities to cut a total of 300=
=20
megawatts. In Northern and Central California, 54,000 customers of Pacific=
=20
Gas and Electric Co. lost power for about an hour.=20
SCATTERED POWER LOSSES
The blackouts were scattered throughout the Bay Area. Among the areas black=
ed=20
out were South San Francisco's industrial area east of Highway 101 as well =
as=20
homes across town near Interstate 280. In Mountain View, an undetermined=20
number of homes and businesses across Highway 101 from Moffett Field lost=
=20
power, while parts of San Leandro also went dark.=20
Police reported no blackout-related problems.=20
"This wasn't too big an outage," said Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman. "March 20,=
=20
the last time we had blackouts, there were 438,000 of our customers=20
affected."=20
Power officials called the Stage 3 alert and blackouts when electricity=20
reserves dropped below 1.5 percent.=20
While power officials originally predicted no power blackouts for the rest =
of=20
the week, they were backing away from that forecast by yesterday evening.=
=20
A Stage 2 alert is likely today, meaning power reserves are expected to dro=
p=20
below 5 percent, and a new round of blackouts is a real possibility.=20
"We're stressing that it's a very dynamic situation," McCorkle said. "A lot=
=20
depends on the temperature, and we've heard it's going to be even hotter=20
(today). We're really preaching conservation."=20
SHADES OF SUMMER
Yesterday probably was just a sample of what the summer will be like. The=
=20
power demands that hot weather brings -- and the resulting energy shortfall=
=20
-- are likely to continue for the next four months.=20
"It's the first day of what will be many this summer," said Jim McIntosh,=
=20
director of operations for the ISO.=20
The unexpected loss of some electricity from Canada, along with the planned=
=20
shutdowns of some nuclear plants, nearly brought blackouts earlier in the=
=20
day. But planned emergency measures to limit power usage, along with some=
=20
conservation efforts, kept the lights on -- at least for a few more hours.=
=20
"At 11 a.m., we were within five minutes of going to blackouts," McIntosh=
=20
said.=20
The bulk of the conservation came from customers with interruptible service=
=20
agreements, who have agreed to accept short-term power cuts in exchange for=
=20
lower rates. But about 150 megawatts came from customers who decided on the=
ir=20
own to chop back their energy usage. Each megawatt is enough to supply powe=
r=20
to 1,000 homes.=20
"The 150 megawatts doesn't sound like much, but it made a difference today,=
 "=20
McIntosh said. "And during the summer, it would make a difference every day=
."=20
RISING TEMPERATURES
It was a record 93 degrees in San Francisco yesterday, and temperatures als=
o=20
reached new heights in Oakland, Santa Rosa and Hollister. As the mercury=20
soared in the Bay Area and Central Valley, people were thinking about the=
=20
energy crunch.=20
Lenshina Pendar, a pre-med student at the University of California at San=
=20
Francisco, said her family in Hercules had started using the air conditione=
r=20
again -- sparingly.=20
"Definitely, we turn it on, but not so high," Pendar said. "We leave it on=
=20
maybe for 30 minutes."=20
At the Pleasant Hill BART station, people said they were taking advantage o=
f=20
the heat.=20
"I hung my clothes on the line today," said Lisa Kelley of Walnut Creek.=20
She also has a backyard swimming pool. "It's almost swimmable," Kelley said=
.=20
"It's 73 degrees without heating or anything."=20
PRECARIOUS SITUATION
Yesterday's events showed the delicate balance of the state's energy=20
situation.=20
California's generation capacity already has been cut because the nuclear=
=20
power plants that supply power to the state are either shut down or working=
=20
at limited capacity. While the San Onofre plant near San Clemente has been=
=20
offline since a fire in February, the Diablo Canyon plant near San Luis=20
Obispo and plants in Arizona and Washington are down because of long-planne=
d=20
maintenance and refueling.=20
Meanwhile, a not-so-wet winter has cut the amount of hydroelectric power=20
produced by dams throughout the West, leaving California's power grid=20
vulnerable to almost any disruption.=20
Yesterday, for example, an expected 1,000 megawatts didn't materialize when=
 a=20
Canadian supplier stayed off the energy market for three hours in the=20
morning, forcing the ISO to scramble for replacement power.=20
Even some roadwork in Ventura County that shut down the gas line to a local=
=20
power plant was cited as a potential threat to the state's energy supply.=
=20
California's power grid is working on such a tight margin that the unexpect=
ed=20
loss of a power plant can quickly plunge part of the state into darkness,=
=20
McIntosh warned.=20
"It doesn't have to be a huge plant," he said. "Certainly today it didn't=
=20
have to be."=20
PG&E customers who are vulnerable to rolling blackouts are grouped into 14=
=20
blocks; when blackouts hit, customers in those blocks lose power for one to=
=20
two hours. Yesterday's blackouts started in Block 14; the next group hit wi=
ll=20
be the remaining customers in Block 14 and then those in Block 1.=20
Each block contains about 225,000 customers. PG&E customers can determine=

.=20

Officials ordered power to be shut off at 4:45 p.m. and restored service at=

year. The last was March 20.=20
Movie screens, popcorn-makers and video games went quiet for about 20 minut=

at the Century Capitol multiplex in South San Jose. ``I was just getting in=
to=20
it when a screen went blank,'' complained Luis Ortiz. ``Blam. No warning or=
=20
nothing. People just walked out of the theaters wondering what was going=20
on.''=20
The most immediate cause of the blackouts was the heat.=20
In San Francisco, the 93-degree high recorded Monday exceeded the previous=
=20
record of 91 degrees set on that date in 1987. Downtown Oakland's high of 8=
9=20
degrees beat out the 1987 record by one degree. The 91-degree high recorded=
=20
in Salinas outdid the previous high of 89 there in 1967. And in South=20
Monterey, 89 degrees exceeded the old record of 84, set back in 1959.=20
The hot weather prompted many people to switch on their air conditioners,=
=20
putting a heavy drain on the already severely crimped supply of power. Hot=
=20
weather across the West also limited the amount of power the state normally=
=20
imports from the Southwest by at least 500 megawatts -- or enough for about=
=20
375,000 homes, according to the ISO's McIntosh.=20
Nuclear plants off line=20
But an even bigger problem was the loss of four nuclear power plants. Two o=
f=20
them were in California: Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo, which is being=
=20
refueled, and San Onofre in Southern California, which is undergoing repair=
s=20
after a recent fire.=20
In addition, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station near Phoenix and the=
=20
Columbia Generating Station in southeast Washington state were undergoing=
=20
routine repairs.=20
All four plants are expected to be off line for several more weeks.=20
Some California plants that run on natural gas had to shut down because of=
=20
repair work on a natural gas pipeline near Ventura.=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Ramp said the utility was=
=20
ordered to cut 120 megawatts in its service area, which meant the blackout=
=20
affected about 54,000 homes and businesses from Bakersfield to the Oregon=
=20
border. PG&E has 4.6 million electricity customers.=20

Jones has bright ideas on electricity=20
In a Democrat-dominated state, Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones' pl=

to pull California out of its ongoing electricity crisis is unlikely to get=

serious consideration. That's especially true given that Mr. Jones is a=20

Still, Mr. Jones has detailed the most reasonable plan so far for dealing=

with the current mess in a way that moves in the right direction - toward=
=20
freer markets rather than government controls. His analysis is the first on=
e=20
in a while that doesn't use demagogy to shift blame from California=20
politicians to Evil Out of State Power Generators.
In a May 2 letter to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Jones captured the=20
nature and the seriousness of the problem: "California is on the brink of=
=20
fiscal insolvency. Our state budget has moved rapidly from an $8 billion=20
surplus to a potential deficit situation and our credit rating has been=20

failure of leadership - and the cost is staggering."
He argues, correctly, that although Gov. Davis did not cause the problem, h=

approach is only exacerbating it by attempting to "socialize" the electrici=

Power Scramble/ A Forbes.com Special Report



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 7, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Rolling blackouts ...
bankrupt utilities ... soaring gas prices. Will the lights go out in
your city this summer? Is California a harbinger of doom?


What would a new energy crisis mean for you and your business? Or
is all the talk of crisis phony? Check out the Forbes.com package,
Power Scramble, to find out.


This special report prepared by Forbes.com staff, continuing
through the summer, takes a hard look at power generation and
consumption in the U.S., and how utility deregulation impacts
consumers and businesses.


For the in-depth report and ongoing coverage, please go to:

Here are some highlights:


--  19 states plus the District of Columbia had a power deficit


during the first 11 months of 2000, and had to import power


from another state.


--  On the other hand, the U.S. and the world have tremendous


energy reserves and the U.S. is more energy-efficient than


ever.


--  New York needs to come up with about 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts


of additional capacity this year -- and New York City needs


most of it.


--  Texas is unique in that is does not export power.


--  West Virginia has the highest surplus of power generated and


not used within the state.

[B] Calif. ISO says power blackouts this evening unlikely



By Christine Cordner

San Francisco, May 7 (BridgeNews) - California is not expected to see power
outages this evening since the state is receiving 1,600 megawatts of import=
ed
power from a Canadian province, said Jim McIntosh, California Independent
System Operator Director of Operations, Monday. He said that the state was
prepared to initiate rolling blackouts earlier in the day before the Canadi=
an
supplier came though.



*                     *              *



"If imports remain where they are, we don't anticipate any supply
problems....We can handle it,"  McIntosh said during a conference call.


McIntosh said that Tuesday's supply situation looks similar to Monday.


The ISO issued a Stage 2 emergency this morning when power supplies dipped
below 5%. McIntosh said that the ISO was very close to initiating a Stage 3
emergency, which allows it to ask utilities to cut off customers' power.


California has already seen the consequences of Stage 3--rolling blackouts
Jan. 17 and 18 and then again March 19 and 20.


Monday's problems stemmed from high temperatures increasing demand in the
state as well as increased demand in Southwest states that import power. In
addition, several key power plants were closed for pre-summer maintenance. =

Stage 2 Electrical Emergency Declared; SCE to Curtail 'Load' for Some=20
Customers



ROSEMEAD, Calif., May 7 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
The California Independent System
Operator (Cal-ISO) declared a Stage 2 Emergency this morning, due to low po=
wer
reserves and increased demand for power because of rising temperatures.  Th=
e
agency called upon Southern California Edison and other investor-owned
utilities to begin voluntary "load" curtailment programs for certain custom=
ers
within their service areas.


Cal-ISO said the Stage 2 Emergency would be in effect from 10 a.m. to
midnight.  Cal-ISO and SCE are making urgent appeals for all customers to
immediately reduce their electricity consumption so that reserve levels do =
not
deteriorate further.


To achieve this load reduction during Stage 2, SCE is required to activate
its voluntary load curtailment program, under which large industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers have agreed to temporarily curtail
electricity usage during an electrical emergency in exchange for reduced
rates.


Should the situation worsen for any reason, and power reserves drop below
1.5%, Cal-ISO could declare a Stage 3 Emergency, the most critical status.
Cal-ISO could direct utilities to "drop load," necessitating involuntary
rolling blackouts for groups of customers across their service areas until
sufficient reserve levels are achieved.


SCE customers are asked to reduce power consumption by turning off any
unneeded electrical appliances and lights, especially during the state's da=
ily
peak consumption period -- 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.


Following are some effective ways customers can reduce their power use and
not be greatly inconvenienced:


LARGE ENERGY USERS


-- turn off all auxiliary or redundant machinery where possible;


-- consider shifting or staggering operations outside the hours of highest


electrical demand, typically noon to 6 p.m.;


AIR CONDITIONERS


-- set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees (F);


-- use electric fans instead of air conditioning if practical;


-- avoid using evaporative coolers or humidifiers at the same time an air


conditioner is running;


-- avoid cooling unoccupied rooms;


-- open windows during evening hours to take advantage of cool breezes;


APPLIANCES AND TOOLS


-- delay until evening hours the optional use of appliances (dishwashers,


clothes washers and dryers), chargers, power tools, and electrical


equipment;


REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS


-- avoid unnecessarily opening refrigerators;


-- keep your refrigerator or freezer set at the proper temperature;


-- be sure to use the "power-saver" switch if your refrigerator has one;


-- keep the condenser coils behind or beneath your refrigerator/freezer


clean (refrigerators represent approximately 25% of the electric bill


for a typical residence);


ADDITIONAL TIPS


-- run swimming pool equipment during early morning and evening hours;


and;


-- limit the reopening of a refrigerator, which is a major user of


electricity in most homes;


-- use drapes and blinds to keep out direct sunlight;


-- replace incandescent light bulbs with ENERGY Star(R) qualified compact


fluorescent bulbs;


-- always wash a full load of clothes or use the variable water level


adjustment for smaller loads;


-- be sure your home has adequate insulation.

Rolling Blackouts Hit California



By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer




SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) _ As temperatures soared to record
levels in parts of California, blackouts cut electricity to more
than 100,000 customers in what power grid operators warned was a
preview of summer.


Hour-long outages, ordered by power grid managers, hit portions
of selected cities Monday for the first time since March as
California slipped off the tightrope of electrical supply and
demand for the fifth time this year.


Signal lights went dark, rush-hour traffic jammed and police
officers were dispatched to control intersections. No major
incidents were reported.


The state remained in a Stage 2 power alert _ one step below the
threshold for blackouts _ until midnight Monday. Grid managers,
however, warned that conditions remained ``subject to change'' with
little notice. More heat was expected as high pressure dominated
the West.


Before the blackouts, the Independent System Operator urged
conservation because warm weather across the West was pushing up
demand for electricity. Imported power was scarce and several key
plants, including nuclear generating stations, were down for
pre-summer maintenance.


The ISO managed to stave off a late-morning threat of blackouts
by asking for cutbacks from ``interruptible'' customers who get
cheaper electricity rates in exchange for scaling back power use
during emergencies.


``We were able to take off the interruptible, but only for so
long,'' ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said. ``Then they started
coming back on and the temperatures were still high.''


The mercury climbed to a record 93 degrees in San Francisco,
while in the south, temperatures topped 100 in the deserts and a
record was set in Lancaster at 96 degrees.


``We expected demand to peak between 3 and 4 p.m. and it
didn't,'' O'Donley said. ``It just continued to climb.''


Grid managers ordered utilities to cut 300 megawatts between 5
p.m. and 6 p.m. One megawatt is enough to power about 750 homes.


Utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co. cut off about 54,000
customers in Northern and Central California. An additional 36,000
commercial, industrial and residential customers of Southern
California Edison were affected in portions of 40 communities.


San Diego Gas &amp; Electric cut power to about 8,600 customers in
Orange County, El Cajon and areas of San Diego. The Sacramento
Municipal Utility District cut 18 megawatts, affecting about 4,600
customers in southern Sacramento County.


Tight electricity supplies and high demand led to two days of
rolling blackouts Jan. 17 and 18 in Northern California. The ISO
ordered statewide blackouts March 19 and 20 because of scarce power
supplies.


The utilities blame the crisis on 1996 deregulation legislation
designed to open up California's electricity market to competition.
Among other things, the law temporarily capped the rate the state's
largest utilities could charge customers even while they were
forced to pay soaring prices for wholesale electricity.


In April, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy. SoCal Edison is teetering
on the edge of insolvency.

As political battle lines tighten in anticipation of the Bush=20
administration's announcement this month of a national energy strategy to=

buttress the country's economic development, some of America's largest=20
industry associations are expressing deep concern about the possibility of=
=20
being caught on the wrong side of public opinion across the country.

That fear sparked a move by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and like-minded=20
economic development groups, manufacturing councils and energy utilities an=
d=20
producers to establish the Alliance for Energy and Economic Growth (AEEG).=
=20
The alliance's aim: persuade a host of other institutions, corporate Americ=
a=20
at large and, ultimately, the public that its collective future lies in the=
=20
balance because the "energy crisis" is no mirage.=20

In an interview with Energy Insight, a key player in putting together the=
=20
AEEG, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President Bruce Josten,=20
explained its purpose and immediate objectives. Josten, the chamber's senio=
r=20
government and political affairs officer as well as second highest-ranking=
=20
official, maintained that the business community has done a weak job, by an=
d=20
large, of explaining energy-related concerns. And, more worrisome still, it=
=20
has failed to see beyond specific sector concerns to consider "over the=20
horizon" energy issues threatening to adversely affect industry and the=20
nation's economy as a whole.


"Freelance lobbying" and "cannibalistic tendencies" of different segments o=
f=20
the energy industry have been a significant part of the problem, Josten=20
contends. The fact that "we haven't built a refinery in this country in 25=
=20
years, or the fact that today we have half the number of refineries we had =
25=20
years ago only addresses one side or a sliver of this issue."

So how can the alliance make a difference? It's all about education, said=
=20
Josten, as he began rattling off statistics.

Educating consumers.
"You sit here, if you're me, and you wonder: Do the American people know th=
at=20
since the Arab oil embargo (of the early 1970s) energy use per dollar of GD=
P=20
has dropped by about 40%? Do they know that a single car today produces les=
s=20
air pollution than a fleet of 20 fuel-efficient cars did 30 years ago? Do=

they know that the amount of energy they are using in their homes for heat,=

light and appliances has decreased by a little bit more than 25%? Do they=

same amount of cooling as air conditioners (a generation go)? Do they know=
=20
that the average refrigerator today costs 40 bucks versus about $110 or $12=
0=20
on an annual basis to run then?"

The Arlington, Va.-based Electronics Industry Alliance, a national trade bo=
dy=20
that represents the full spectrum of U.S. manufacturers in the more than $5=
00=20
billion electronics industry, is a key player in the AEEG. The group=20

components for the defense industry to consumer products such as appliances=
.=20
Headed by former seven-term Oklahoma U.S. congressman and once House=20
Intelligence Committee Chairman Dave McCurdy, the Electronics Industry=20
Alliance is a key backer of Vice President Dick Cheney's approach of framin=
g=20
national energy policy in a national security context.

But the necessity of linking energy security to economic growth in the=20
public's mind, as the AEEG intends, will be rooted in down-to-earth concept=
s,=20
said Josten. "We think we have a unique role in defining the problems and=
=20
educating the American people to the gigantic strides that have been made (=
in=20
terms of energy efficiency) and to get them to understand just what's in=20
their homes today versus what was in their homes even a decade ago."

In terms of the bigger picture: "You just cannot continue to have the kind =
of=20
GDP growth that we have enjoyed as a country without energy to fuel it. You=
=20
can't have the ability to pay for the kinds of environmental performance=20
(improvements) that we want and seek, nor can you have the kind of=20
technological innovation that we want and seek unless of course you have a=
=20
growing and prosperous economy with the ability to pay for those items," he=
=20
said. Josten added that his political take on the situation is that the=20
environmental community is gearing up to "pummel" the Bush administration f=
or=20
opening up natural resources in the U.S.

For all the "gyrations in the stock market" in recent months and anxiety=20
about an economic downturn as consumer confidence indices have dropped, "Ne=
w=20
jobs were still growing, and up until a month ago were still outpacing job=
=20
losses," he observed. However, continued erosion in consumer confidence=20
creates the risk of "creating a recession."

Some critics "are going to accuse (AEEG) of basically being a front or a=20
shill for the (Bush) administration in one way or another," he acknowledged=
.=20
"On the other side of that, this issue is so big that the need to build and=
=20
develop a national consensus, for the need to have a sound and sustainable=
=20
national energy policy, is going to require a cacophony of different voices=
,=20
comprised of consumers and producers."

Josten said his role is to try to help get industry across the nation to=20
start singing from, as he calls it, "the same hymn sheet." His choice of th=
e=20
word "cacophony" can only be interpreted as an invitation to bring on the=
=20
dissonant voices.
