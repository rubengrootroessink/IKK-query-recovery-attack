Paul, Joe, & Harry --

We've all talked about holding a meeting to outline our strategy for the next 
12 months in the Western states (wholesale and retail) and so I propose the 
following.

1. GA Strategy Meeting

We should come together as just GA before meeting with the business people.  
I think that we want to have the following people in attendance (like your 
input) - Paul Kaufman, Joe Hartsoe, Sarah Novosel, Mary Hain, Marcie Milner, 
Steve Walton, Jim Steffes, Harry Kingerski, Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich, Bruno 
Gaillard, Mona Petrochko, Sandi McCubbin.

The meeting output would be a Strategy and Tactics Plan for June 2000 - June 
2001.

2. GA meeting w/ Business People

A few of us could go to Belden, Calger, Yang, Benevides, Condon to discuss 
the above.  

I would like to have these meetings soon (maybe Thursday, Sept 7 for #1).

Please let me know.

Jim
