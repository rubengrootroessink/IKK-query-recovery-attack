All I know is as follows    On March 27,2001 the Commission issued a scoping 
memo in 00-11-002.  The scoping memo added the issue of the adequacy of 
SoCal's transmission system to the issues to be addressed in this proceeding.

An ALJ ruling dated April 26,2001, provided that the adequacy of SoCal's gas 
transmission system and the effect on its customers be bifurcated from the 
other issues in this proceeding.  The ALJ's ruling provided that any party 
filing testimony on March 23,2001 would be allowed to file supplemental 
testimony on the SoCal capacity issue.

SoCal filed supplemental testimony.

We are not a party. We need to know if it is too late to become a party, if 
we wanted to. Also was any other supplemental testimony filed by other 
parties??
