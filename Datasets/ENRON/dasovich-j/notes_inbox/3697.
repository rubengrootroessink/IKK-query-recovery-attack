> On April 15th, I sent the following e-mail about a series of SCE advice
> filings.  The one which I highlighted for potential concern was 1534-E
> which starts the process of implementing the MOU with the governor and
> DWR.  On April 20th, SCE filed a supplement to 1534-E which it states
> replaces 1534-E in its entirety.  Accordingly the clock for protests was
> reset and protests on the advice filing are now due on May 11th.  The
> changes made by SCE are not of a nature to drastically impact the summary
> of the advice letter sent to you on April 15th.  I will forward the
> amended advice letter under separate cover.  Please let me know as soon as
> possible if we want to protest.

> On Thursday, April 12th, I forwarded to you a series of Advice filings
> which SCE made on April 11.  The attached document summarizes those
> filings.  While two the three appear to be fairly innocuous, one (1534-E)
> apparently starts the process of implementing the MOU with the governor.
> Please pay careful attention to your review of that advice. If we are to
> protest, such protest would be due on May 1.
