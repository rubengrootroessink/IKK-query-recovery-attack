Attached find the latest draft of Alan's technical paper.  This is still a 
work in progress.  The paper will serve as the basis for our comments on the 
FERC's November 1 order on the California market.  Alan developed this paper 
in close coordination with Tim Belden and Greg Wolfe.  I wanted to run this 
by you so you would have an opportunity to give us any input from EES's 
perspective.  Ron Carroll will also be sending us a draft pleading that will 
accompany this paper.  However, the pleading will simply summarize the 
positions set out in Alan's paper and lay out a few additional legal 
arguments, so it is most important for you to focus on this paper.  Ron will 
be getting us a draft by the end of the day today so we can discuss it in our 
conference call early tomorrow.

This is the Tues late a.m. (PST) version of the technical affidavit.

Since yesterday's version, the following is most new
conversion to Q/A format
addition of my quals (are they sufficient?)
argument that forward contracting is liquid TODAY (in price caps section)
section on information provision has been simplified 
new arguments with regard to load-based penalties and why they should not 
apply to generation.

Would there be anyone available in DC to do a formatting pass either late 
tonight your time or early a.m. Wed?  (Don't start such a process with out 
checking Mary or I, however.)
