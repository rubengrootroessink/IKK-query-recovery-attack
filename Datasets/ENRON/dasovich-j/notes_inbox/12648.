Energy Committee Members:
As you recall, John Wilson and his colleagues presented the CEC's proposed
Real Time Pricing Tariff to the committee on Wednesday, June 6.  The
committee members that were present agreed to review the proposed tariff and
to provide comments and questions to the CEC, as we were asked by John to
support the proposal.  I would like to remind you that the final proposal is
scheduled to be presented on Monday, June 18.  John has asked that we
provide our comments and questions to him no later that close of business on
Tuesday, June 12.  I will be coordinating with the John as to the best way
to provide the comments to the CEC and will keep you updated.  To be safe,
you can always feel free to send me an electronic version.  Thank you.
Laura
