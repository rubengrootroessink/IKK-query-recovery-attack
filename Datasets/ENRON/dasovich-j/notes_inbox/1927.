Please consider this request for Agenda items, if any, for the next weekly 
Staff Meeting, 
currently (tentatively??) scheduled for Wednesday, November 29th, as Paul 
*may* be here in the office and would prefer to have it then (Sue will be 
unavailable, however, so this is TBD).

Please respond to this request by end of business Tuesday, November 28th.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Joseph
