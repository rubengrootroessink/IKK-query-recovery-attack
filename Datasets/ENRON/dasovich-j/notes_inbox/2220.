Here is what I have for the CAPM explanation.  Ideally, we would pull some
data from Yahoo.  If anyone has time tomorrow, I will work with them over
the phone and seaching Yahoo to improve this.  Unfortunately, I am not
familiar with Yahoo enough to pull these numbers quickly.  Call me at work
408-292-7841.
