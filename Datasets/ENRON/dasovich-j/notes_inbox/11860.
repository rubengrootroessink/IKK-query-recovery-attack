Secretary of State Bill Jones on Monday asked the state attorney general an=

while buying electricity for the state.=20
Jones said recent reports that show several energy buyers held such stock,=
=20
coupled with the fact that they failed to file reports of their financial=

"This is either a miserable failure in executive management and leadership,=

Budhraja reported that he began working for the department on Jan. 25.=20
On Jan. 17 and 22, Budhraja acquired stock in Edison International valued a=

between $10,001 and $100,000. He also bought stock in Dynegy, an energy=20

noting on the form that he "divested holdings upon first opportunity after=

He also reported that he had received income of more than $100,000 from=20
Edison International as "a retainer to provide consulting services upon=20
request." He noted that there was "none requested since the third quarter o=
f=20
2000."=20
Jones said the contract Budhraja signed with the state, however, was dated=

Jan. 17, showing that he "entered into a $6.2 million contract with the sta=

and the same day that Davis ordered a state of emergency and put the state=

into the power-buying business. Mr. Budhraja sold this stock within days an=

Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said the contract was simply dated Jan. 17=

"for administrative payroll purposes." He said Budhraja met with Davis on=

showed that 45 percent of Americans approve of Bush's handling of the energ=

Davis aide foresees an end to rate hikes =20


\
objattph=20
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 16, 2001  LOS ANGELES -- The state is spending far=
=20
less to buy power now than two months ago, and as a result there should be =
no=20
more immediate rate increases, the governor's senior energy adviser said=20
yesterday.  S. David Freeman told reporters in a conference call that the=
=20
recent drop in spot market prices for power means that no new rate increase=
s=20
will be necessary "for the foreseeable future."  In May, the state was=20
spending close to $100 million per day for power. In the past week, that=20
figure stood at $30 million or less per day, said B.B. Blevins, assistant=
=20
director for energy at the state Department of Water Resources.  So far in=
=20
July, the state has paid on average $82 per megawatt hour for power purchas=
ed=20
on the spot market. That compares with an average cost in May of $271 per=
=20
megawatt hour on the spot market.  Overall, the state has paid on average=
=20
$133 per megawatt hour this month, compared with an average of $243 per=20
megawatt hour in May, Blevins said.  A megawatt hour is enough electricity =
to=20
serve 1,000 typical homes for one hour.  In May, spot market purchases=20
accounted for close to 45 percent of the state's power buys. So far in July=
=20
they have made up closer to 5 percent.  The officials attributed the lowere=
d=20
prices to residents' conservation efforts, milder weather, long-term=20
contracts the state entered into with power suppliers and a recent federal=
=20
order imposing market-based price limits when energy reserves run low.  The=
=20
Department of Water Resources plans to file its revenue requirements with t=
he=20
state Public Utilities Commission -- the agency that sets rates -- in the=
=20
coming week. After that, the state's utilities will stake their claims. =20
There has been widespread speculation that another rate increase would be=
=20
necessary, in part to back bonds the state plans to issue to repay the=20
state's general fund about $8 billion.  That's how much the state has spent=
=20
since January, when it got in the power-buying business because generators=
=20
began refusing to sell to the state's crippled utilities. The PUC ordered a=
=20
50 percent rate increase in May for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric a=
nd=20
Southern California Edison.  The state's utilities also may claim they are=
=20
owed for the power generated at power plants they still own, but Freeman sa=
id=20
new rate increases would not be necessary even if that was taken into=20
consideration.  "In my opinion, the existing rates are plenty high to cover=

the needs for the foreseeable future," Freeman said. "There may be a=20

if they weren't paid the extra money.  "San Francisco appears to be one of=

Churches Help Edison Aid the Poor
Energy: With an assist from the pulpit, a program to provide discounted=20
electricity to those in need flourishes.
WILLIAM LOBDELL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 17 2001

Southern California Edison has enlisted the help of an unlikely=20
ally--churches--to sign up thousands of low-income customers for hefty=20
discounts on rising utility bills.

In just a few months, pastors, priests and church volunteers have become=20
Edison's most effective tool in telling the poor about a state-mandated=20
program that offers 20% off electric bills and exemptions from skyrocketing=
=20
rate increases.

Refugio Gomez, 62, a part-time janitor, signed up for the program last mont=
h=20
at Our Lady of Victory in Compton, the church where he works. Since then, h=
is=20
monthly electric bill has been cut from $48 to $18. "I hadn't heard about t=
he=20
program before," Gomez said. "[Church volunteers] helped me with the forms.=
"

The pioneer faith-based program began with 22 Orange County Catholic church=
es=20
in April and now is being rolled out throughout Southern California. Edison=
=20
employees will be at five churches in the South Bay this weekend.

The utility is concentrating its efforts initially in Catholic and=20
African-American churches, primarily because of their large congregations=
=20
and, in the case of the Catholics, their large-scale organizations. But=20
Edison officials say they plan to use a wide range of religious=20
organizations, including synagogues, mosques and temples, before the campai=
gn=20
ends in the fall.

"It's a really fantastic way to get the word out," said Pastor Steve Overto=
n,=20
who had Edison workers hand out information Sunday at his Christian Chapel=
=20
Foursquare Church in Moreno Valley. "The church is called to help the poor.=
=20
We're doing what the Lord wants us to do."

Church leaders say they are aware that their endorsement of an Edison progr=
am=20
can produce a halo effect for the besieged company. But getting lower=20
electric rates for their low-income congregants overrides those concerns.

"We're not doing this to help Southern California Edison," said Jaime Soto,=
=20
auxiliary bishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We're doing thi=
s=20
to help our parishioners."

About 62% of an estimated 1 million eligible customers participate in the=
=20
discount program started by the state Public Utilities Commission in 1989,=
=20
Edison officials said. A family of four must earn less than $31,100 a year =
to=20
be eligible for the program, which is also offered by the Southern Californ=
ia=20
Gas Co.

Religious institutions based in low-income areas have been able to knock do=
wn=20
barriers that have hindered Edison's past efforts to reach out to the poor:=
=20
suspicion from recent immigrants, language and cultural differences, and=20
ineffective marketing campaigns.

When the energy crisis began, Frank Quevedo, an Edison vice president,=20
decided religious organizations offered the best chance to reach customers=
=20
who would suffer the most from rising electric bills.

He met with Soto, who provided demographic information from the diocese's 5=
6=20
parishes.

"He knew the [community] in a way we couldn't," Quevedo said. "He knew whic=
h=20
churches had the most seniors, low-income parishioners, limited-English=20
speakers. We had great results."

Energy Crisis Prompts Change in Church Policy

The Catholic church sometimes allows other information to be distributed at=
=20
Mass, but it usually revolves around health programs, immigration issues an=
d=20
education on voter registration.

"We generally do not do business with business," Soto said. "But the extent=
=20
of the energy crisis and its impact on the poor made me rethink that policy=
.=20
I've been pleasantly surprised at how many people we've reached."

A priest's endorsement of Edison's discount program, plus church volunteers=
=20
helping fellow congregants fill out Edison forms, has proven far more=20
effective than inserting fliers in monthly bills or trying to engage shoppe=
rs=20
outside retail malls.

In Orange County, more than 1,000 church-going customers took advantage of=
=20
the discount in a single day. At Compton's Our Lady of Victory, more than 2=
00=20
congregants joined the program. Edison also had handed out 80,000 sign-up=
=20
forms that parishioners have taken home.

At a booth in a Los Angeles shopping center, Edison workers earlier this=20
month signed up only two dozen customers in a half-day of work.

Edison workers volunteer time on Sundays to pass out information at churche=
s.=20
More than 100 employees turned out on a single Sunday in April to volunteer=
=20
at nearly two dozen sites in Orange County.

"It's really a humbling experience for us," said Rocio Contreras, a board=
=20
member of the company's Latino employees association. "What was really neat=
=20
was to have the priests and fathers there, letting the parishioners know wh=
o=20
we are and why we were there. That made a difference."

Churches are a natural go-between wary immigrants and large institutions th=
at=20
provide relief services, said John Wilcox, chair of religious studies and=
=20
director for the Center for Professional Ethics at Manhattan College in=20
Riverdale, N.Y.

"It's really using churches in an area where they're already very effective=
,"=20
he said. "My only concern would be that the church needs to be an honest=20
broker. The church probably has the greatest amount of trust among the poor=
.=20
[Immigrants] are so vulnerable."=20

California electricity customers should find out this week whether they wil=

State regulators have already approved two rate increases this year, of 9=

Power of lies=20
Davis, Legislature ruin two electrical companies and try to cover it up

GLEN EVANS Mr. Evans, who lives in Lake Forest, is an employee of Southern=
=20
California Edison and invests in its stock.
Billy throws a ball through Mrs. Smith's window. But when she comes out, he=
=20
blames it on Bobby, the neighborhood bully. Mrs. Smith believes Billy becau=
se=20
he seems nice, and, well, nobody likes Bobby.=20
If you knew you could get away with blaming someone else for your own=20
mistake, would you do it? That's exactly what the California Legislature an=
d=20
Gov. Gray Davis have done.
Polls say most people believe SCE and PG&E are responsible for California's=
=20
energy crisis. Truth is, our politicians bear full responsibility. No one,=
=20
except those very politicians, claims otherwise. I challenge Gray Davis and=
=20
the California Legislature to find one reputable expert in any relevant fie=
ld=20
who doesn't agree on a simple fact: If retail prices for electricity had=20
followed the wholesale cost, none of the problems we now have would have=20
happened.
Moreover, If SCE and PG&E had been treated fairly, they would have been sav=
ed=20
from financial ruin. Davis and the Legislature have many folks believing=20
these utilities were somehow responsible for the law which forced them to=
=20
sell power, their only product, for less than cost. But public gullibility=
=20
does not justify public servants lying, just like Billy, and blaming somebo=
dy=20
else to save themselves.
Rather than simply admit their mistake, Davis and the Legislature were=20
willing to let two reputable, century-old utilities go $15 billion in debt =
-=20
obligated to deliver power, but allowed to recover only a tiny fraction of=
=20
the cost. They knew it was dishonest, but the alternative - asking the publ=
ic=20
to simply pay for the electricity they used - was too dangerous politically=
.
When SCE and PG&E attempted to defend themselves, our politicians made it=
=20
known that the utilities had "funneled cash" to their parent companies,=20
rather than use it to pay down their debt. Truth is, the amount of money wa=
s=20
insignificant compared to the utilities' debts and it would have been just=
=20
plain stupid for a company to take its last bit of cash and throw it after=
=20
all the rest so blatantly "appropriated" by the state.
This transaction was common knowledge within the Legislature, having been=
=20
arranged and approved by members, and its own audit acknowledged the money=
=20
was handled properly. Many people expressed shock at this "news'' and vowed=
=20
there would now be no "bailout" of these utilities.
But then came the state's own crisis - the utilities' debt was so massive=
=20
nobody would lend them any more money. The state was forced to step in to=
=20
keep the lights on, and everything changed.
Within weeks the state found out just how enormous the expense was they had=
=20
been forcing the utilities to bear. The Public Utilities Commission voted t=
o=20
raise rates and, reluctantly, Davis acknowledged that an increase might be=
=20
necessary after all.
Now came perhaps the cleverest deception. The rate increase had nothing to =
do=20
with the utilities. All of the money from the increase went straight to the=
=20
state to pay its bills. Even knowing they caused the utilities' debt, and=
=20
could fix it, they wouldn't even share this increase. But because the=20
increase would show up on the utility bill, everyone would naturally assume=
=20
it was the utilities who were now raking in even more money. So with a simp=
le=20
lie of omission - just don't say anything - nobody would ever know every=20
penny of that rate increase went straight to pay the state's debt. Not one=
=20
cent went to the utilities, still strapped with huge debts and one, PG&E, n=
ow=20
driven into bankruptcy.
Finally, a personal response to another common accusation - that SCE and PG=
&E=20
somehow took all the money out before they went into debt and the=20
stockholders got it all. I'm an SCE employee. I've worked in field service=
=20
for Edison for more than half my life.
I've had such confidence in my company and it's management that I considere=

The State Consultants' Stock Buys Questioned Energy: State official urges=

conflict of interest probe into purchases of shares in power firms.

Secretary of State Bill Jones on Monday urged California 's attorney genera=
l=20
to investigate possible conflict of interest violations by consultants hire=
d=20
to help the Davis administration navigate the energy crisis.=20
Jones, a Republican candidate for governor, said at a Los Angeles news=20
conference that Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and the state Fair Political=20
Practices Commission should determine whether seven of the consultants have=
=20
conflicts of interest because they own stock in one or more energy companie=
s.=20
He also asked the state's chief law enforcement officer to immediately=20
determine whether the governor's office violated state law by exempting 21 =
of=20
the 45 consultants from financial disclosure requirements.=20
"I am gravely concerned that a cloud of illegality and collusion exists at=
=20
the highest level of our state government due to the actions and the=20
conscious policy of secrecy of Gov. Davis," Jones said.=20
That brought a sharp retort from the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio,=
=20
who attacked Jones for engaging in campaign politics.=20
"The secretary of state has a five-person team bankrolled by the taxpayers=
=20
attempting to dig up dirt for political reasons," Maviglio charged.=20
"This is politics pure and simple being played by a candidate desperate to=
=20
get his name in the paper," Maviglio said. If there are any violations of t=
he=20
law, he added, "they're going to be addressed."=20
The secretary of state's entry into the energy controversy poses yet anothe=
r=20
headache for Davis as he prepares to run for a second term next year.=20
Already, the GOP and some power producers have begun airing commercials=20
critical of Davis' handling of the power crunch, forcing the governor to di=
p=20
into his own campaign funds to fight back.=20
Jones, as the state's chief elections officer, contends that his concerns a=
re=20
not just political. He noted that he appoints one of the five members of th=
e=20
Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces campaign finance and=20
conflict of interest laws.=20
Among other things, Jones questioned why Vikram Budhraja, head of the=20
Electric Power Group, a Pasadena energy consulting firm, bought stock in=20
Edison International and Dynegy Corp. in the days before he went to work fo=
r=20
the state.=20
Budhraja was hired under a $6.2-million contract between his firm and the=
=20
state Department of Water Resources that was signed on Jan. 18. Like two=20
dozens of the consultants hired by the state, he did not complete a financi=
al=20
disclosure statement until last week, more than six months after he went to=
=20
work for the department, which now buys power for the state's three largest=
=20
utilities.=20
The financial disclosure statement filed by Budhraja last Thursday shows th=
at=20
he bought between $10,000 and $100,000 worth of Dynegy stock on Jan. 11. Si=
x=20
days later, he bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of Edison stock.=20
That was the same day that Davis declared a state of emergency because of t=
he=20
energy crisis and ordered the Department of Water Resources to begin buying=
=20
power on behalf of the state's financially troubled major utilities.=20
On Jan. 22, Budhraja again bought between $10,000 and $100,000 of Edison=20
stock. On his disclosure statement, he indicated that he began work for the=
=20
state Jan. 25 and sold the stock on Jan. 29--the first opportunity he had t=
o=20
divest his holdings.=20
Jones told reporters that Budhraja's investments in Edison grew by 44% to=
=20
47%, while his Dynegy investment increased 28% in that brief period.=20
Budhraja was also on retainer as a consultant to Edison International,=20
earning more than $100,000 in the year before becoming a contractor for the=
=20
state.=20
Maviglio said Budhraja wrote a letter to DWR Deputy Director Ray Hart sayin=
g=20
he had no dealings with Edison International. He also was not involved in a=
ny=20
long-term contracting with Edison.=20
Any profits Budhraja made from the stock are irrelevant because the stock w=
as=20
sold by the time he was on the job, Maviglio said.=20
Another consultant, Bernard Barretto, who describes himself as an energy=20
trader/scheduler for the state, disclosed last week that he purchased stock=
=20
in power producer Enron Corp. But no date or amount of the purchase was=20
listed.=20
Financial disclosure forms filed last week by five other consultants show=
=20
they all own stock in Calpine Corp., a major California -based power=20
wholesaler.=20
Energy trader Elaine L. Griffin bought between $10,000 and $100,000 worth o=
f=20
Calpine stock on Feb. 1. Her contract with the state began Feb. 20. Griffin=
's=20
newly completed economic disclosure statement does not show her selling the=
=20
stock. Herman Leung, who went to work as an electricity scheduler in March,=
=20
bought between $2,000 and $10,000 worth of Calpine stock on Jan. 22.=20
Schedulers William F. Mead, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie also disclose=
d=20
that they own stock in Calpine. Mead, in fact, said his holdings ranged=20
between $100,000 and $1 million. But their forms contain an important=20
omission: The consultants do not say when they purchased the shares.=20
Oscar Hidalgo, a Water Resources spokesman, said the agency's attorney is=
=20
reviewing all the past purchases to ensure that no laws were violated by=20
contractors buying power or negotiating long-term contracts with companies =
in=20
which they held stock.=20
"We're reviewing all that to see if [there were] any problems with any past=
=20
negotiations," Hidalgo said. "We're looking at all the records in past buys=
=20
or trades so we understand who exactly did what."=20
He said it's a "very big task" that will take weeks to complete.=20
In the meantime, those contractors who have disclosed stock ownership have=
=20
been recused from working with generators in which they have a financial=20
interest.=20
The governor's spokesman said several of the contractors who own stock in=
=20
Calpine are not traders, and thus do not have direct dealings with the=20
company.=20
"If you own Calpine stock and aren't doing any business with Calpine, then=
=20
you're fine," Maviglio said.=20
Calpine is one of a number of firms that negotiated long-term contracts wit=
h=20
the state and that have come under fire from critics who say they will sadd=
le=20
consumers with artificially high electricity costs for years to come.=20
For weeks, Jones has been sharply critical of the administration's failure =
to=20
require its consultants to file conflict of interest forms, which must be=
=20
completed within 30 days of a person starting work.=20
The governor's spokesman said the administration was told by the state's=20
political watchdog agency that only consultants serving in a staff capacity=
=20
or participating in decisions must file the forms.=20
As a result, he said, only two dozen of the 45 consultants were required to=
=20
complete the paperwork--most of them "hastily and clumsily" prepared last=
=20
week, according to the secretary of state.=20
Two of those who have not filed are Wall Street executives Joseph Fichera a=

companies, are "squeaky clean," but he would not elaborate.=20

"Lawmakers have attempted to wrap the utility bailout plan in a protective=

=20
shots ring out, and the aide, emerging blood-spattered, delivers the=20
punch-line: "Tell the governor his Reliant problem is solved."=20
While Gov. Davis hasn't gone that far in his fight with suppliers such as=
=20
Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc., he is in other ways trying to blast his=
=20
way out of the crisis. His moves are coming in rapid succession after month=
s=20
of criticism of the governor for inaction, and they are fast reshaping the=
=20
state's electricity system.=20
With the acquiescence of other state leaders, Gov. Davis has put California=
=20
on the road to creating what amounts to a mammoth state-owned electric=20
utility, answerable largely to the governor. Moreover, though designed to=
=20
solve a short-term emergency, the governor's policies are loading consumers=
=20
with obligations that could affect the economy of the most-populous state f=
or=20
15 to 20 years.=20
His actions in some ways hark back to the system of central control that=20
preceded the disastrous 1996 foray into utility deregulation. But they aren=
't=20
simply a return to the days of monopoly utilities strictly regulated by the=
=20
state's Public Utilities Commission. What is emerging now is a California=
=20
power colossus that operates in important ways beyond the reach of regulato=
rs=20
or the public.=20
Mr. Davis says his actions will ensure that Californians have a secure supp=
ly=20
of reasonably priced electricity . "This is not a power grab," the Democrat=
ic=20
governor says in an interview. "I had no desire to intervene. I would get o=
ut=20
tomorrow if you would let me out. This is my least-favorite thing to do."=
=20
Yet in the past six months, pushed by what he calls the "colossal failure" =
of=20
a deregulation plan hatched under his Republican predecessor, the governor=
=20
has put the state deep into the power business. In January, Mr. Davis order=
ed=20
the state Department of Water Resources to begin buying power in place of=
=20
California 's cash-strapped utilities. Since then, the state has purchased =
or=20
committed to purchase $45 billion to $50 billion of electricity , with some=
=20
contracts as long as 20 years.=20
The governor has in effect seized control of the state's electricity -grid=
=20
operator, the California Independent System Operator, installing his=20
hand-picked team as board members. As its name implies, the ISO was suppose=
d=20
to manage the grid without favoring any one participant.=20
Mr. Davis also is pushing to have the state buy huge chunks of the=20
transmission system that are owned by the financially beleaguered utilities=
.=20
He recently signed into law a bill that creates a state power authority,=20
whose director will be appointed by the governor. This agency, which so far=
=20
exists just on paper, could be used to build power plants and help run a=20
state-owned transmission system. Mr. Davis says that the authority is part =
of=20
what he sees as a "hybrid" system where public power plays an important rol=
e=20
augmenting private enterprise in the electricity business.=20
Having healthy utilities is extremely important, says the governor. He adds=
=20
that he has been working hard to revive the state's two biggest utilities,=
=20
the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit of PG&E Corp. and the Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison Co. subsidiary of Edison International. But as the state's role in t=
he=20
electricity business has grown, the utilities don't seem as essential as th=
ey=20
once did.=20
This is one reason the governor has had difficulty getting a rescue package=
=20
for Edison through the state legislature. The plan, among other things, cal=
ls=20
for the state to buy Edison's transmission system for $2.76 billion and=20
envisions the utility eventually resuming some power-buying chores. Talks=
=20
over a similar rescue package for Pacific Gas failed and that utility filed=
=20
for bankruptcy-law protection.=20
With the state locking up so much of the California 's future power needs,=
=20
legislators openly wonder whether utility-rescue efforts are worth the=20
billions of dollars they would require. In 2003, for instance, long-term=20
contracts will cover 90% of the state's projected buying needs. "What does =
it=20
mean for Edison to take over the role [of buying power] if the state alread=
y=20
has signed all these contracts?" asks State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Democrat wh=
o=20
heads the senate's energy committee.=20
Nonetheless, the governor says he is "cautiously optimistic" the legislatur=
e=20
soon will approve an Edison rescue package.=20
Mr. Davis has been deeply enmeshed in almost every aspect of the electricit=
y=20
mess this year, after having once been relatively aloof from the burgeoning=
=20
crisis. The state's utility-deregulation law, which was enacted in 1996,=20
worked fairly well until May of last year. Under the deregulation plan, the=
=20
state's investor-owned utilities sold off many of their power plants to oth=
er=20
companies and repurchased that electricity through a state-sponsored auctio=
n.=20
Consumer rates were frozen and customers were given the option to buy=20
electricity from nonutility retail suppliers.=20
But tight electricity supplies and a flawed auction system led to a sharp=
=20
rise in wholesale power costs. With retail rates frozen, Pacific Gas and=20
Edison racked up multibillion-dollar deficits. In January, Mr. Davis declar=
ed=20
an emergency and put the state into the power-buying business.=20
Since then, he hasn't been bashful about exercising his emergency powers.=
=20
When Mr. Davis couldn't get legislative permission to borrow money short-te=
rm=20
for power purchases, he signed an executive order authorizing the state to=
=20
borrow up to $5 billion from commercial lenders. That borrowing is supposed=
=20
to be repaid from a roughly $13 billion municipal-bond issue, the biggest i=
n=20
U.S. history, scheduled for later this year.=20
In another executive order, the governor suspended emission standards for=
=20
power plants to let them run more hours during the peak-demand periods. And=
=20
the state has hired a small army of energy consultants and traders.=20
Despite such actions, some think Mr. Davis isn't being forceful enough. For=
=20
example, the state senate last week passed a resolution supporting the=20
governor's power to "commandeer powerplants" if he deems such a step to be=
=20
necessary. Mr. Davis has said he doesn't have any plans currently to take=
=20
such an action.=20
The electricity mess has produced "the most extraordinary crisis of=20
governance we've had in California in the postwar period," says Bruce Cain,=
=20
director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of=20
California at Berkeley. Mr. Cain says more power has been placed in the=20
governor's hands and, as a result, the state has "gotten away from the=20
separation of powers and the checks and balances that we expect in American=
=20
government."=20
Mr. Davis says his actions have been essential and are working. He credits=
=20
the long-term power contracts with helping to cool the spot market for=20
electricity , where prices in recent weeks have dropped sharply. In June, t=
he=20
state paid an average price of $167 a megawatt hour for electricity . That=
=20
was down from $243 in May, though still far above the $25-to-$27 range of t=
wo=20
years ago.=20
But some worry about how this rush to address a short-term problem will=20
affect the longer-term future. An economic forecast issued late last month=
=20
warned that continued heavy state involvement and spending in the electrici=
ty=20
business could produce enough of a drag on the California economy to reduce=
=20
state output by a total of $90 billion by 2005 and lead to higher=20
unemployment. " California is at a crossroads" between what amounts to a=20
"state takeover of the electricity industry" and a more market-oriented=20
approach to fixing the problem, says the joint study by the Anderson busine=
ss=20
school at the University of California , Los Angeles, and Cambridge Energy=
=20
Research Associates.=20
Under a law enacted in February, none of the tens of billions of dollars of=
=20
state electricity purchases or related costs can be challenged as imprudent=
=20
by the Public Utilities Commission. That's an immunity that regulated=20
utilities in the old regime could only dream of. Then, if they spent too=20
much, the PUC could make their shareholders take a hit. Under the new syste=
m,=20
any purchasing missteps the state makes will be borne by consumers.=20
"It scares the hell out of me," says Henry Duque, a Republican PUC member=
=20
appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson. "The state is so busy looking after i=
ts=20
own interests . . . . Who's looking out for the ratepayer?"=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, acknowledges that the=20
commission's authority has been seriously eroded. Under the new law, the=20
commission is supposed to charge consumers for whatever sum the Water=20
Resources Department spends on energy. She hopes to hold hearings to review=
=20
the spending "even if we can't do much about the result."=20
Gov. Davis says concern about less oversight of power purchases is a "bogus=
"=20
issue. "It is not as if a private company or utility was making the=20
decisions. The PUC doesn't need to second-guess the decisions of a public=
=20
body," he says.=20
But other state moves suggest there's a role for oversight. The state is on=
ly=20

The rush to beef up an outgunned state energy team may have contributed to=

The state has since hastily assembled a group of about 20 energy traders,=

Even so, Mr. Davis argues, state negotiators did well enough. They managed =

says Carl Wood, one of Mr. Davis's three Democratic appointees to the=20

Some Davis allies are troubled. "Decisions are being made, with almost no=
