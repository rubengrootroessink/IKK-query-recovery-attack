Hi all:

I am glad to announce that due to the great sales results, the
deadline for student tickets to SF Symphony concerts is extended to
10/28/00! So if you missed the previous date, you have more than a week to
sign up! Please see the end of this email for details.
I'll now she my "wolf-skin" as a marketer, and share a few personal
notes here re classical music:

-Why classical, when early Beatles is quite cool to my ears?
* Lovely sounds. Such as the strings in a well-played "Four Seasons",
or the spacious trumpet sound in John Williams.
* Emotional appeal. You find expressions of emotion that are simply
impossible in words.
* Beauty of composition. A good score is like a maze of accoustic
wonders.
* You already like it. Many of us don't realize how common our
encounter with classical music is. Do you know the title music in Kubrik's
"2000: Space Odyssey" is from Wagner? Or Hitchcock's music score inspired by
Stravinsky?
* Enjoy pop music more. For example, Pink Floyd.

-Why concerts, when CDs are readily available?
* The sound wth its full depth, and the atmosphere. For those of you
who are not familiar with orchestral music, a concert, where you can relate
the sound to the sight of various instruments working, is the best learning
opportunity. A sense of magic comes from this aural-visual relation. I
myself got hooked to it by reluctantly going to my first LA Philharmonic
concerts when I was in grad school.

-I am still not convinced. Give me one good reason, really...
* Well, even if you hate the concert, the very experience gives you
the "hands-on" confidence to say, "Classical music is bonk"!

Now, details:

Subscribe to the San Francisco Symphony's 2000-2001 season and save up to
60% off full-price tickets!

Subscribing to the San Francisco Symphony as a student means that you
purchase a package of six concerts for half the price. (Subscribe to a 12-
or 24-concert package, and save nearly 60%.) Symphony subscriptions start at
only $14 per concert, and you can purchase two subscriptions with one
student ID.

This year's highlights include:
Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand
Dvorak's Cello Concerto
Ravel's Bolero
MTT's world-renowned interpretations of Stravinsky and Copland

Soloists include:
Violinists Itzhak Perlman and Sarah Chang
Pianists Lang Lang and Andras Schiff
Percussionist Evelyn Glennie

Hayes Valley, the neighborhood surrounding Davies Symphony Hall, is full of
restaurants and bars in every price range to make your evening complete.
BART and MUNI both stop only a few blocks away (and the concerts end by
10pm), so taking public transportation is easy.

Many San Francisco Symphony concerts were sold out last season, but student
subscribers already had these hard-to-get tickets in hand, and they paid
just half-price. To order your tickets or to receive a free brochure, call
Symphony Ticket Services at (415) 864-6000, or visit us online at
sfsymphony.org for information.

Deadline to order: October 28.
