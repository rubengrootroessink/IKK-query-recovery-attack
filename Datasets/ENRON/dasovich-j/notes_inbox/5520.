Here are the reservations I made  Tuesday for Nancy and Eldon to go to El
Moro:

Leaving SFO on Flight 262 at 8:00 AM on March 26 (Monday).  Arriving LAX at
9:20 and departing 10:21.  Arriving MZT at 1:47 PM.  Seats 3F and 3D.  First
Class.   Then leaving MZT at 2:27 PM on Flight 211 on April 1 (Sunday).
Arriving LAX at 4:13.  Seats 25C and 24C.  Coach.  Leaving LA on Flight 291
at 7:24.  Arriving SFO at 8:48.  Seats 11C and 11D.  We land at
International Terminal-Bradley at LAX, go through Customs and leave from
Domestic Terminal.  All  on Alaska Airlines.  We have electronic tickets via
e-mail and do not have to wait in regular line at SFO.  We go directly to
machine in  terminal and an agent there will handle passports and baggage.
I suggest we don't do what we did last  year when we had to take all the
luggage to a different terminal.  Going is not a problem because we don't
get off the plane at LAX.  There  is no better way to go than on Alaska.
All other airlines go by way of the  Mohave Desert.  Jeff remembers vividly.
Confirmation letters  for NRS are SIILEC and for ELS are SIKHZZ.  If anyone
needs help making reservations please let me know  The last time I heard,
Cameron and Scotty were making  different arrangements so I haven't  done a
thing about that.   I made tentative reservations for Prentice and Jeff and
the confirmation code  is VPKQBE.  The fare is $545.82 round trip per person
at this time, but the reservation and fare will expire at 11:00 PM PST
today.  I told Prentice this  yesterday.
