I spoke with Elain Cory from San Francisco's NPR bureau, who  called Hedy 
Govenar's office earlier today regarding a story she's doing on  plant siting 
and air emission laws.? She's in Sacto today (currently  meeting with IEP), 
but I told her that our experts are in SF rather than  Sacramento.? I also 
told her I was checking with you to see if we could  offer someone (Dave 
Parquet seems the logical choice); if he (or someone else)  is available, she 
can meet with him on Monday.? 
?
Give me a call ASAP so I can follow up with her or so you can  take the 
appropriate steps.? I'll probably be on my cell -- (916)  947-0927.
?
Thanks,
Ken
