Hi Evening MBA Students,

A tentative schedule of classes for Fall 2001 is available for you in the
Evening MBA office, at the front desk.

We plan to send Fall 2001 registration materials (along with the class
schedule) to you at your home address the first week of April.  Telebears
registration takes place April 19 and 20.  Please mark your calendars.

Thanks,
TJ
