Jim,

Page 4 in my draft, right before the question "Is there any analysis of
market power that relied upon actual market performance?"

In summary, it is evident that the modeling analysis
relied upon by the MSC is so flawed that it cannot be relied upon by the
Commission in making any conclusions with regards to market power.    Given
that use of prices above SRMC is not  the existing Commission test for
measuring individual generator market power, it would be imprudent to use it
as the basis of removing market based rate authority.  Rather than continue
to focus on building new and complicated measures of market power, the
better approach is to focus on long-term improvements to market structure
and the availability of resources, which will bring about competitive
benefits in the most rapid manner.

This is the only place in the affidavit or the brief that I have found that
refers to "removing market based authority."  This is most certainly a FERC
issue and not my bailiwick but it seems to me it pops up out of nowhere and
is not fully discussed.   My understanding is that this would be the
ultimate threat against any marketer.  If I am right, my suggestion is that
the last clause be reworded to say ", it would be imprudent to start using
that test now."

Page 7 my draft, right before Q: Are there other examples of power markets
that have avoided the reliability problems exacerbated by the price caps?


Phrase "stay out of California market" could be rephrased to "sell
into other markets in the WSCC"

I believe the changes to market power definitions are fine.  I also believe
the rewording of the penalty discussion for imbalance is fine.

Sorry for the delay.  Believe it or not, we had a power outage in San
Francisco that took our computers offline...

Thanks
Gary
