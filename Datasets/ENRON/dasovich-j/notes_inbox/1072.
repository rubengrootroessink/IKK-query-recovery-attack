Jeff:

To follow up on your call, there is no looming deadline for filing the
updated/revised tariffs for ETI in California.  The changes we redlined are
reflective of service changes and specific PUC telecom staff directives.
(You never know what one staffer or another will require be added depending
on their view).

We also will need an approval on the consumer forms. Any comments solicited
will be incorporated prior to filing.

This should prove to be a fairly smooth process, and next week is fine.
Steve is out of town today and I will want him to approve the changes
anyway.  So, feel free to contact us at your convenience. Thanks

Jeremy Meier
