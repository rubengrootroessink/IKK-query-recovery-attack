Tom,

I appreciate the background on issues with Peter's funding.  I'll be sure not 
that we do not incur any expenses as a result of any collaboration.  

Catherine Dalton of AEP explained during the course of the meeting that the 
AEP/APS proposal (which I will now mail to you) incorporates some features of 
earlier drafts of IEEE 1547, which have been expunged in the current working 
IEEE draft.  I asked her to characterize what had been expunged and why, and 
she only offered that sections had been eliminated in a political process, 
since the draft is being finalized on the basis of consensus.  This piqued my 
interest, since it's very conceivable that AEP and APS have reinserted issues 
that are objectionable from our point of view.  Catherine Dalton made the 
point in the meeting that the current IEEE draft has holes that the utilities 
believe are necessary to fill.

If you have a copy of the current IEEE draft, I'd appreciate seeing it in 
order to compare/contrast with the AEP/APS proposal.  And as I said, I'll 
mail a copy of the utility's proposal to you.

Thanks for the help!

First, as a "heads-up" the DPCA is somewhat in disarray after terminating the 
Executive Director and resignation of the Chairman and several members (most 
of it caused by retaining an attorney for the California DG proceeding 
without getting authorization from the members and then scrambling to figure 
out how to pay for it).  Therefore, before working with Peter Chamberlain 
make sure that the DPCA is funding him from dues and not an assessment that 
we might end up having to pay for (I think Peter may not be retained by DPCA 
since the DPCA is restructuring including looking at substantial increase in 
dues).  Just be very clear who is paying for Peter and understand our 
financial liability before you commence any effort with him (I could be wrong 
but I'd rather err on the side of conservancy).

I would be happy to take a look at what AEP/APS are proposing as long as 
there's no immediate time frame.  Also, I'm not sure what you mean about 
earlier versions of P1547 having sections deleted.  Please clarify.  Thanks.

DG interconnection is the subject of a concerted effort in W Va that 
commenced yesterday.  AEP and Allegheny have proposed interconnection 
standards that allegedly are based on earlier drafts of IEEE 1547.  Over the 
next several weeks, we have the opportunity for input.  Distributed Power 
Coalition of America is aggressively involved as well, and will be advocating 
its Model Standardized Interconnection Package for Distributed Generation.

Jeff and Tom, I would like to send copies of AEP's?APS's requirements for DG 
connection for your review, if you are interested.   Do you know why the 
content of earlier versioins of 1547 has been removed (i.e., stuff that has 
been reinserted in the utilities' proposals?)

I will be reviewing the materials, and have arranged with Peter Chamberlain 
(representing DPCA) to work cooperatively on a response, to the extent our 
interests coincide.

YEs, I think so.  If the Ohio utilities agree to defer to the IEEE standards 
once they are approved, is that good for us?  What is our view on this?
Thanks

I assume you are referring to the IEEE effort to develop a standard for the 
interconnection of distributed resources (IEEE P1547).  I was following this 
development but have since reduced my efforts in this area.   The status is 
that they are working to get an approved standard released in the 3rd quarter 
of 2001.

Is anyone from Enron involved in the IEEE discussions for uniform standards 
for interconnection?
