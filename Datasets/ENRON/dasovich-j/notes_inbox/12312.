Energy-refund talks open on divisive note=20
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published June 26, 2001)=20
WASHINGTON -- More than 130 lawyers and corporate chiefs crowded into a=20
courtroom Monday to begin secret talks aimed at ending months of bitterness=
=20
and accusations over who should pay for California's haywire energy market.=
=20
But the largely closed-door sessions before a Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission judge could be doomed from the start by sharply divided estimate=
s=20
of how much money it will take to leave the past behind and launch Californ=
ia=20
toward a new energy future.=20
The state says its consumers have been overcharged by at least $8.9 billion=
,=20
but Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge who is presiding=
=20
over the settlement negotiations, said he believes at most it will be $2=20
billion to $2.5 billion.=20
"We told everyone that $8.9 billion is the floor. It is the most conservati=
ve=20
possible number," Michael Kahn, a power grid official who is heading the=20
state's delegation, told reporters after Monday's talks.=20
The state's firm stance and Wagner's 15-day deadline for results had many=
=20
predicting that little would come of the talks.=20
"I believe California is going to scuttle the talks. I believe that nothing=
=20
will be good enough for them," said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of California=
=20
Energy Markets, an industry newsletter.=20
More than $6 billion of the state's claims involve deals that are ineligibl=
e=20
for refunds because of the seller or the date sold, O'Donnell said. FERC=20
doesn't have jurisdiction over all traders, and it already has excluded man=
y=20
months of trades from refunds.=20
If the parties fail to settle within 15 days, Wagner has another week to=20
submit his own recommendations to the five FERC commissioners on how he=20
thinks they should resolve the disputes.=20
Wagner warned the parties that settlement would be the far preferable cours=
e.=20
"I can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issu=
e=20
in these settlement proceedings," the blunt-speaking judge said. "The time =
to=20
put California's past energy problems to rest and (to) structure a new=20
arrangement for California's energy future is now."=20
Wagner held out a carrot to the generators, who have been pummeled by Gov.=
=20
Gray Davis and state Attorney General Bill Lockyer over allegations of mark=
et=20
manipulation to drive up prices and their profits. "There are questions=20
concerning whether the settlement should offer immunity from existing and=
=20
future lawsuits and prosecutions against generators," Wagner said.=20
California argues that power plant owners and traders manipulated a badly=
=20
flawed market to drive up prices, racking up $9 billion in overcharges from=
=20
May 2000 until May 2001. But electricity sellers say they obeyed the law, a=
nd=20
they contend it's unfair to change the rules retroactively.=20
Assuming the refund issue is resolved, Wagner said there are at least six=
=20
other issues on the table. They include agreement on moving power out of th=
e=20
volatile spot market and selling it under long-term contracts; eliminating=
=20
natural gas transmission constraints blamed for the high cost of gas in=20
California; and settlement of financial issues connected with PG&E's=20
bankruptcy filing.=20
Wagner began the brief, public opening of the negotiations by reading a=20
statement from FERC's two newest members, Patrick Wood III and Nora Mead=20
Brownell, the forces behind the order convening the talks.=20
Wood and Brownell said in a statement that it is in "everyone's best intere=
st=20
to bring closure" to the crisis, and urged the participants to resist tryin=
g=20
to blame each other for the power debacle. "Everyone must leave (the=20
negotiations) with more than they came in with," they said.=20
But skepticism remained high Monday. "We didn't take two weeks to get into=
=20
this," said one participant late in the day. "It's hard to see how we'll ge=
t=20
out of this in two weeks."=20
Among the participants are legal teams representing about 50 government=20
agencies, utilities and power generators, including Pacific Gas and Electri=
c=20
Co., Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and their corpora=
te=20
parents and subsidiaries.=20
The talks also include municipal utilities such as the Sacramento Municipal=
=20
Utility District, more than a dozen California towns and irrigation=20
districts, and utilities in Washington, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexic=
o=20
and Arizona.=20
Meanwhile, FERC commissioners Wood and Brownell were in Sacramento to confe=

Brownell and Wood, Davis said, are "committed to working together with us t=

Daniel Weintraub: Davis' energy contracts preserve long-term pain


(Published June 26, 2001)=20

With blackouts held at bay, federal price controls taking effect and the sp=
ot=20
market cost for wholesale electricity declining toward historic lows, thing=
s=20
are looking good for Gov. Gray Davis. If current trends continue, the=20
governor's public approval ratings might soon resemble one of those fever=
=20
charts tracking the meteoric rise in electricity prices last winter.=20
But even if his strategy turns out to be a political success, a major probl=
em=20
created by the governor's approach will loom as a quiet threat to the state=
's=20
economy for years to come.=20
The centerpiece of his solution to the energy crisis was a series of 38=20
agreements with electricity generators under which the state will buy power=
=20
for the next 10 years. Davis signed those deals in desperation, just when=
=20
prices were peaking, with the very companies he has been accusing of gougin=
g=20
the state.=20
Now that prices have begun to fall, Davis is taking credit. His advisers ar=
e=20
even trying to suggest that the existence of the long-term contracts has=20
contributed to the more favorable conditions in the market.=20
"It's economics 101," says David Freeman, one of the governor's closest=20
energy advisers.=20
But the most famous rule of economics 101 -- the law of supply and demand -=
-=20
suggests that the contracts have little, if anything, to do with the recent=
=20
decline in electricity prices. In a properly functioning market, prices=20
decline when supply exceeds demand. When demand chases a limited supply,=20
prices climb. It's true that the contracts have reduced the state's demand=
=20
for power on the spot market. But they also have reduced, by an identical=
=20
amount, the supply of electricity available on the spot market. That=20
shouldn't have any effect on the price.=20
Long-term contracts, used prudently, are a fine idea, but they are not=20
necessary for a stable market to exist. For two years after California's=20
deregulation plan took effect, the state's utilities bought power at=20
rock-bottom prices without the benefit of any contracts at all. By state=20
edict, all electricity was bought and sold on the spot market, and as long =
as=20
supply was plentiful, the price was low. The generators were standing in li=
ne=20
to sell us their electricity.=20
Then, a little more than a year ago, things went haywire. Demand caught up=
=20
with supply, and at the same time, the price of natural gas, which is used =
to=20
produce most of our electricity, rose rapidly. The design of the electricit=
y=20
system created by the state also appears to have allowed the private=20
generators to game the market. It's still not clear whether their behavior=
=20
was legal or not, but they did gain the upper hand. We needed their=20
electrons, and the generators suddenly were in the position to demand any=
=20
price they liked.=20
It was at just this moment that Davis decided to lock up as much electricit=
y=20
as he could under contract. Wanting to avoid a retail rate increase that he=
=20
feared would prove unpopular, Davis sought the lowest possible price. To ge=
t=20
it, he signed contracts with the longest possible terms. Shorter terms woul=
d=20
have preserved the state's flexibility for the future. But the governor sai=
d=20
he was willing to pay a price for stability, and so he locked every custome=
r=20
of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison into his plan.=20
Some suggest it's unfair to second-guess Davis now that prices have begun t=
o=20
decline and his contracts are starting to look expensive. Severin Borenstei=
n,=20
an economist and energy expert at UC Berkeley, compares the governor's=20
strategy to buying homeowners insurance.=20
"If your house doesn't burn down," Borenstein says, "that doesn't mean it w=
as=20
a mistake to buy the insurance."=20
The trouble is that Davis bought his policy after the house was already on=
=20
fire. Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine economics professor and consumer advocate,=
=20
warned at the time that the governor was pursuing a faulty strategy. He=20
correctly saw then that the same private generators on whom Davis was=20
declaring war were rubbing their hands at the prospect of signing deals wit=
h=20
the governor at top-of-the-market prices.=20
"They know there is going to be a highly competitive market in a couple of=
=20
years," Navarro told me in March. "Rather than have to fight it out in the=
=20
spot market at that point, of course they'd want to lock in 10-year=20
contracts. The governor is adopting a long-term strategy to address what is=
=20
essentially a short-term problem."=20
Now, with prices drifting back down even sooner than expected, Navarro is=
=20
more convinced than ever that Davis erred.=20
"The contracts were bargained in a panic from the utmost position of=20
weakness," Navarro said last week. "The cumulative effect of this strategic=
=20
error will be a cost in the billions. It will be like driving the Californi=
a=20
economy with the emergency brake on."=20
Voters may never notice the drag. But if companies start eyeing lower=20
electricity rates in Nevada and Arizona, and jobs get harder to come by, al=
l=20
of California will be paying a long-term price for the governor's desire to=
=20
avoid some short-term pain.=20

State, generators lock horns in talks=20



Davis' $8.9 billion refund call too high, judge says
By Toby Eckert=20
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
June 26, 2001=20
WASHINGTON -- California officials staked out a tough bargaining position=
=20
yesterday at the start of talks aimed at resolving disputes over refunds an=
d=20
other thorny issues arising from the state's power crisis.=20
California's lead negotiator, Michael Kahn, called the $8.9 billion in=20
refunds Gov. Gray Davis has demanded from power sellers "an extremely=20
conservative estimate" and indicated the state would reserve the right to=
=20
press for more in court.=20
The judge overseeing the hearings has called the state's refund estimate to=
o=20
high.=20

Some power industry sources, meanwhile, were pessimistic about whether the=
=20
negotiations would lead to a settlement between the long-warring sides, giv=
en=20
the state's position.=20
Some 150 representatives from state agencies, cities, utilities and numerou=
s=20
power-generating and marketing firms packed a hearing room at the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission for the first day of the talks. The negotiator=
s=20
will attempt to settle the state's claim that power sellers have gouged=20
California for more than a year, and the sellers' contention that they are=
=20
still owed billions of dollars for power they provided.=20
Pacific Northwest states were also invited into the discussions and are=20
seeking $6 billion in refunds from the power companies.=20
The electricity sellers deny wrongdoing, saying several factors converged t=
o=20
drive up prices, including California's faulty power deregulation law, a hu=
ge=20
spike in the price of natural gas that is used to generate most electricity=
=20
in the state, and a short supply of electricity.=20
Speaking to reporters during a break in the closed-door session, Kahn said=
=20
the state would not trim its estimate of what it believes it is owed for=20
electricity overcharges. Kahn chairs the Independent System Operator, the=
=20
organization that manages most of California's power grid.=20
"Let there be no mistake. We are not going to ask the courts or FERC in=20
proceedings for $9 billion. We're going to ask for a lot more money than th=
at=20
in our litigation position," he said. "The governor has said that he believ=
es=20
FERC should order refunds at $8.9 billion now."=20
FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr., who is mediating the=
=20
talks, has said he believes the refund amount the state is seeking is far t=
oo=20
high. A more realistic figure would be around $1 billion to $2.5 billion, h=
e=20
said.=20
Wagner also said that one of the issues up for discussion would be whether=
=20
power generators should be offered immunity from current and future legal=
=20
action if a settlement is reached.=20
Kahn argued that the time period subject to refunds should start in May 200=
0,=20
when power prices started a dramatic upward spiral in California. Wagner ha=
d=20
indicated he would scrutinize prices going back only to October, when FERC=
=20
started examining the market.=20
When California officials took the price curbs that FERC approved last week=
=20
for future power sales and applied them to power charges going back to May=
=20
2000, the refunds owed to the state would came to roughly $9 billion, out o=
f=20
$43.8 billion in total sales, Kahn said.=20
"I am absolutely confident that we have valid legal claims back to May. The=
re=20
is no way that we are going to do anything to compromise those claims. That=
=20
includes last summer, when San Diegans were terribly overcharged," Kahn sai=
d.=20
"Last summer is a very important period to Californians that are seeking=20
redress. And we are not going to abandon those claims just because .?.?. FE=
RC=20
has decided not to include them," he added.=20
Wagner asked the California officials to provide more information to back=
=20
their numbers.=20
Power sellers continued to maintain that Davis' estimates of excessive powe=
r=20
charges are wildly inflated. One group that represents generators gave a=20
bleak prognosis on the chances for a settlement.=20
"It's hard for us to contemplate how we're going to come to some agreement=
=20
with 130 players in the room," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of th=
e=20
Western Power Trading Forum.=20
"We stand by our business dealings in California," said Richard Wheatley, a=
=20
spokesman for Reliant Energy, one of the companies targeted by the state fo=
r=20
refunds. "Our power was priced competitively."=20
But Wagner, a courtly veteran of such complex discussions, appeared to take=
=20
the sparring in stride.=20
"Everybody has to stick to their guns for a while," he told reporters after=
=20
the first day of talks ended. "Everybody has their say, and now we're getti=
ng=20
ready to get down to brass tacks."=20
Still, the starkly different positions taken by the state and the power=20
sellers illustrate the daunting task facing Wagner after months of bitter=
=20
charges and countercharges between the two sides. FERC, which ordered the=
=20
settlement talks as part of its price-curb order, gave the parties 15 days =
to=20
reach an agreement.=20
If they fail, Wagner will have an additional seven days to make a=20
recommendation to FERC.=20
"I can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issu=
e=20
in these settlement proceedings," Wagner admonished the parties before the=
=20
hearing room doors were closed to the media. "The time to put California's=
=20
past energy problems to rest and structure a new arrangement for California=
's=20
energy future is now."=20
Wagner, who underlined his role as a broker by sitting among the parties to=
=20
the talks instead of presiding from the bench, also warned the participants=
=20
not to talk to reporters about specific negotiations.=20
While most of the attention has focused on refunds, Wagner laid out a broad=

Davis commends 3 'heroes' in generator refunds fight=20

June 26, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis praised three former employees at Duke Energy=
's=20
Chula Vista plant as "heroes" yesterday for coming forward with allegations=
=20
that Duke policies created power shortages that raised electricity prices.=
=20
For the second time in recent days, the three plant veterans dominated even=
ts=20
in Sacramento with explosive allegations of mismanagement and market=20
manipulation by a company that has reaped enormous profits in California.=
=20
Ed Edwards, Glenn Johnson and Jimmy Olkjer made those claims, under oath, o=
n=20
Friday before a state Senate committee.=20
Davis and other Democratic politicians yesterday said these first insider=
=20
accounts of how power plant operations might have manipulated prices will=
=20
help the state in its attempt to get $9 billion in refunds from Duke and=20
other energy generating companies.=20
"There's no question in my mind a lot of money has been stolen from=20
California, and these men are going to help us get it back," said=20
Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews, D-Tracy.=20
The ex-employees told Davis that Duke risked jeopardizing equipment by=20
constantly powering the 706-megawatt plant up and down, dumped new spare=20
parts and took working turbines off-line for "economic reasons."=20
Davis said the power plant workers confirmed his suspicions that North=20
Carolina-based Duke and other companies engaged in price gouging.=20
"There's a concerted effort to suck every dime out of California and send i=
t=20
back to Houston or North Carolina," he said.=20
Davis cautioned that he hadn't yet heard Duke's version of events. "The=20
company is entitled to their point of view," he said. "But they've got some=
=20
explaining to do."=20
Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams called the governor's meeting with the=
=20
former workers "unfair and unproductive."=20
Williams said a review of company logs shows that during a Stage 3 energy=
=20
alert the Chula Vista plant powered down under orders from California's=20
electricity grid manager, the Independent System Operator.=20
He said the company was doing its job by supplying the state with "spinning=
=20
reserves" that could be added to the system in 10 minutes to balance the lo=
ad=20
-- that is, to make sure that supply equaled demand.=20
ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said the agency buys four types of=20
ancillary services to balance the load, including spinning reserves.=20
But she said only Duke can release information from Jan. 16. Williams said=
=20
Duke soon plans to release logs from that day and several others.=20
Meanwhile, another former Chula Vista plant employee confirmed the=20
allegations of the other three workers. All of them had worked for San Dieg=
o=20
Gas & Electric when the utility owned the plant before Duke took over its=
=20
operation. Duke was required to keep the SDG&E employees on for two years,=
=20
but it then let many of them go.=20
Rick Connors, a former operator who turned down an offer from Duke to stay =
on=20
at the South Bay plant, said the plant output frequently was down for=20
"economic reasons."=20
The governor brought up those allegations during a subsequent meeting with=
=20
two new FERC commissioners, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell. Davis asked the=20
federal regulators to look into possible price gouging, the high price of=
=20
natural gas and the $9 billion in refunds he is seeking.=20
After meeting with Davis, Wood said he thinks California will emerge from t=
he=20
energy crisis in 2003 or 2004 and become an energy trendsetter. He said he=
=20
believes California leaders have the will to build more power plants and=20
improve natural gas pipelines that fuel new generators. But he cautioned th=
at=20
there will be "some short-term pain."=20

State, Power Firms Urged to Make a Deal=20
Energy: Mediator says a refund pact would benefit both sides. Meanwhile,=20
Davis tones down his rhetoric as regulators come calling.=20

By MEGAN GARVEY and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers=20

?????WASHINGTON--After being vilified for months by Gov. Gray Davis, federa=
l=20
energy regulators here and in Sacramento took steps Monday to show they are=
=20
determined to respond to California's energy crisis.
?????A top federal regulator began mediating Davis' demand for nearly $9=20
billion in what the governor says are overcharges by power generators--and=
=20
warned a room full of dark-suited lawyers, energy executives and state=20
officials here that they will be "far better off" if they decide among=20
themselves how big a refund the state is due.
?????Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Patrick H. Wood III and Nora M. Brownell,=20
President Bush's first appointees to the five-member Federal Energy=20
Regulatory Commission, spent the afternoon conferring with Davis and=20
legislative leaders. Then they held a fact-finding hearing with California=
=20
regulators on the high price of natural gas, the fuel that spins most new=
=20
electricity turbines in California.
?????"We're going to be working together through tough issues," Brownell=20
said. "We're going to work through them and solve them and move forward. It=
=20
is a lot easier when people have sat down and gotten to know each other."
?????Davis has been attacking federal energy regulators--a majority of whom=
=20
are holdovers from the Clinton administration--for failing to take a variet=
y=20
of steps to bail California out of its energy woes.
?????On Monday, however, Davis toned down his bellicose attacks on the=20
federal commission. Brownell and Wood, Davis said, are "committed to workin=
g=20
together with us to drive down the price of natural gas in California to ge=
t=20
it closer to what the rest of the country is paying."
?????"I think we are turning a corner," Davis said, as temperatures across=
=20
the state were moderate and electricity demand was low. "Conservation has=
=20
been spectacular. Californians have responded heroically. The federal=20
government is now finally taking some positive actions. The outlook looks=
=20
much more positive than it did two months ago."
?????The developments in Washington and Sacramento come as Davis issues=20
campaign-style demands for more aid from the federal government and as poll=
s=20
show that voters are skeptical of how Davis and Bush are handling=20
California's energy crisis.
?????Republican lawmakers in Sacramento contend that the regulatory=20
commission has granted Davis virtually everything he has sought. The=20
commission earlier this month imposed temporary price restraints, a step=20
Davis said is helping to lower wholesale electricity prices paid by the sta=
te.
?????Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte said Monday that he has "no doubt"=
=20
the commission, known as FERC, will order power generators to issue refunds=
=20
to California, as Davis has requested.
?????But Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, also predicted that Davis will find t=
he=20
order wanting: "The governor's game is a political one. . . . The Davis=20
administration has a clear strategy--that no matter what FERC does, it isn'=
t=20
enough."
?????In Washington, the roughly 150 participants who showed up for day one =
of=20
a 15-day settlement conference on refunds showed little sign they were read=
y=20
to agree, at least not yet.
?????For now, the differences remain considerable: about $9 billion in=20
refunds demanded by California's representatives at the talks, plus $6=20
billion more that other Western states say they have been unfairly charged.=
=20
Power generators hotly dispute those figures.
?????"The time to put California's past energy problems to rest and structu=
re=20
a new arrangement for California's energy future is now," said Curtis L.=20
Wagner, the chief administrative law judge for FERC. "We can do it if we tr=
y."
?????Wagner, who told reporters last week he believed refunds of about $2=
=20
billion were probably justified, is mediating the closed-door talks. Davis =
is=20
asking that the refunds cover the period since May 2000.
?????"These out-of-state energy companies are taking us for a ride," Davis=
=20
said in a brief interview in Sacramento on Monday. "I am determined to get=
=20
every penny back that California is owed. The generators have bilked us=20
mercilessly, and I'm fighting back. I'm not giving up nothing."
?????Consumers wouldn't see refunds directly. Rather, the money would go to=
=20
the state or to private utilities, such as Southern California Edison, for=
=20
electricity purchases made during the energy crisis.
?????Participants in the Washington meeting represent about 70 entities wit=
h=20
stakes in the electricity dispute. If they fail to reach agreement among=20
themselves within the allotted 15 days, Wagner will have seven days to make=
 a=20
formal recommendation of his own to FERC's five-member governing board.
?????The settlement negotiations are confidential; Wagner promised those=20
present he would shred his notes and transcripts at their completion. He=20
allowed reporters in the hearing room, where oversized pots of coffee perch=
ed=20
on every table, only long enough to listen to his opening remarks and to a=
=20
prepared statement he read from two of the five FERC commissioners.
?????Wagner, who asked that all sides send advocates with the authority to=
=20
reach an agreement, said the issues to be resolved include:
?????* Refunds for past electricity purchases, including how much money is=
=20
involved and who needs to be paid.
?????* Moving additional quantities of electricity off the spot market and=
=20
into long-term contracts.
?????* Ensuring that generators receive payment for electricity already=20
provided.
?????* The bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric.
?????Wagner said the talks also should address whether any settlement=20
provides generators with immunity from existing and future lawsuits and=20
prosecutions.
?????The statement from FERC commissioners Wood and Brownell encouraged=20
participants to "focus on what they absolutely need and not what they want.=
"=20
But sorting out which is which may prove challenging.
?????The head of California's delegation, for example, reiterated Davis'=20
demands for $8.9 billion in refunds.
?????"We want our refunds. We want them now," Michael Kahn, one of Davis' t=
op=20
energy advisors, told reporters during a break in the negotiations.
?????Kahn said the officials he is representing--the governor, state=20
legislators, the Electricity Oversight Board and the Public Utilities=20
Commission--consider the $8.9 billion figure to be an "extremely conservati=
ve=20
estimate."
?????He indicated the delegation had little interest in relinquishing the=
=20
right to sue for additional funds, even if power generators offered to make=
=20
refunds for time periods before the Oct. 2 cutoff that FERC has proposed.
?????As they have in the past, electricity generators staked out a far=20
different position, characterizing as "absurd" the state's overcharge=20
estimate.
?????"We've done absolutely nothing wrong," said Tom Williams, a spokesman=
=20
for Duke Energy Co., adding that his company was "gratified that all the=20
parties are at the table to discuss this."
?????The settlement negotiations were mandated by FERC last week as the=20

Sensible Concept for Low-Income Tenants=20
Although some may be surprised that a building intended for low-income=20

makes sense for people with limited incomes, said Robin Raida, project=20

A host of public and private entities--including the cities of Santa Monica=

d=20
a group known as Regional Energy Efficiency Initiative, which has contribut=

about $250,000 to energy-saving devices in the building. In addition, Santa=

=20
The building will be loaded with energy-saving and environmentally benign o=
r=20
"sustainable" devices. Heat from the micro-turbine will produce hot water,=
=20
eliminating the need for a conventional water heater.=20
The project also uses compact fluorescent lighting throughout the building,=

energy-saving refrigerators that do not use chlorofluorocarbons, the widely=

used refrigerant linked to damage in the Earth's ozone layer.=20
Prevailing breezes will cool the building, which will have no mechanical ai=
r=20
conditioners. The U-shaped structure "acts like a giant wind scoop," said=
=20
architect Larry Scarpa, a principal of Santa Monica-based Pugh & Scarpa.=20
In yet another "green" flourish, the building will collect all the rainwate=

by the city of Santa Monica.=20
The concept of a building that would be energy self-sufficient emerged abou=

ak=20
of more than 200,000 to about 88,000 in mid-May. Figures from the Californi=
a=20
Energy Commission show that these customers--including hotel and hospital=
=20
chains, factories, farms, the state's university systems and about 78,000=
=20
residences--accounted for about 2.1% of the power consumed in California .=
=20
The level of participation by residential customers was 1.1%--about a third=
=20
as high as for large commercial and industrial customers.=20
The penetration rates were much higher early this year, when about 13% of=
=20
industrial users had direct-access contracts. But many providers sent their=
=20
customers back to Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric, as wholesale=

rates were frozen by the 1996 deregulation law.=20
One provider, AES NewEnergy, claims 60 to 70 customers, ranging from=20

"Direct access is at the heart of the concept of competition and choice,"=

said Aaron Thomas, the company's manager of government relations. "The [PUC=

Said Rick Counihan, a spokesman for Green Mountain Energy: "Unless we see a=

Green Mountain, a Vermont-based company that sells power from renewable=20

Although they have never fled en masse to direct access, many businesses an=

it is uncertain whether the state's power contracts will prove to be a=20

Bill Dombrowski, president of the California Retailers Assn., representing=

Energy users and providers are billions of dollars apart in their estimates=
=20
of how much the power crisis in the Western states has cost. The federal=20
official overseeing confidential settlement talks wants them to come to ter=
ms=20
quickly.=20
With just two weeks to reach agreement, Federal Energy Regulatory Commissio=
n=20
chief administrative law judge Curtis L. Wagner said he wants all sides to=
=20
start using realistic numbers when they meet Tuesday for the second day of=
=20
negotiations.=20
"Now we're getting ready to get down to brass tacks," Wagner said Monday,=
=20
after the first day of talks.=20
Led by California, Western states say power-generating companies overcharge=
d=20
them by $15 billion in the past year.=20
Michael Kahn, California's chief negotiator, said the $9 billion in refunds=
=20
his state claims it is owed should be the first order of business. "We want=
=20
our refunds. We want them now," said Kahn, chairman of the California=20
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid.=20
The states claim that the companies unfairly drove up prices to take=20
advantage of a power shortage. Prices frequently surpassed $300 a=20
megawatt-hour, 10 times what they were in 1999. One megawatt is enough to=
=20
power about 750 homes.=20
The power companies argue that the charges were justified. In some cases,=
=20
older, more costly power plants were pressed into service to deal with the=
=20
high demand and tight supply.=20
Wagner attributed the states' claims to the rhetorical flourishes that ofte=
n=20
accompany the start of negotiations. "Everybody has to stick to their guns=
=20
for a while," he said.=20
The judge, who is playing a mediator's role in the negotiations, said he ha=
s=20
seen nothing to change his previously stated view that refunds in any=20
settlement probably would not exceed $2.5 billion.=20
He cautioned all sides that a brokered settlement would be preferable to a=
=20
plan he would recommend to federal regulators should talks fail.=20
More than 150 people representing about six dozen entities gathered in a=20
government hearing room for negotiations. The talks were one result of a=20
federal order last week extending price controls on spot power sales in=20
California and imposing limits in 10 other Western states.=20
Wagner laid out several issues negotiators will have to tackle, including h=

much generators are owed for power they supplied to California without=20
getting paid.=20
The size of the refunds and the unpaid bills "must be, both ways, resolved =
at=20

settlement probably would also have to answer whether the generators should=
=20
have immunity from existing and future lawsuits and prosecution, he said.=
=20
The parties also have to try to reach agreement on additional long-term pow=
er=20
contracts, which would reduce the amount of power California would have to=

Washington -- With armies of lawyers on each side, California officials and=
=20
representatives of the nation's power generators began the first day of=20
federally ordered settlement talks yesterday far apart on the issue of=20
electricity refunds.=20
California officials, including attorneys for the investor-owned utilities,=
=20
stuck to their claim that the state was owed nearly $9 billion in alleged=
=20
overcharges by the generators.=20
But electricity suppliers were equally adamant in their opposition to=20
refunds, arguing the prices they charged were legitimate. Suppliers are=20
demanding payment for billions of dollars they are owed for electricity=20
already sold into the state.=20
The mediator in the talks, veteran Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20
administrative law Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., warned both sides they would=
=20
have to compromise -- or accept a settlement imposed by federal regulators.=
=20
"The time to put California's past energy problems to rest and structure a=
=20
new arrangement for California's energy future is now," Wagner said. "We ca=
n=20
do it if we try."=20
The difficulty of the task was made clear when the judge asked those in the=
=20
hearing room yesterday to stand and identify themselves. About 140 people -=
-=20
nearly all lawyers -- stood to declare which state, city, power exchange or=
=20
generator they represented.=20
In addition to a host of energy firms, other Western states are involved in=
=20
the talks. Officials in Washington and Oregon say they may ask for up to $6=
=20
billion in refunds.=20
Wagner opened the talks by reading a letter from new FERC Commissioners=20
Patrick Wood and Nora Mead Brownell urging both sides to compromise.=20
"Parties must only focus on what they absolutely need, not what they want,"=
=20
the statement read. "This is not the place to debate the shopping list, nor=
=20
is it the place to assign blame."=20
If the parties can't settle the money fight in 15 days, Wagner will have=20
seven days to recommend action to FERC's five commissioners.=20
"I can tell you now that you are far better off to work out the refund issu=
e=20
in these settlement proceedings than to have me recommend an answer to the=
=20
commission," Wagner said.=20
As the talks started in Washington, Wood and Brownell met yesterday in=20
Sacramento with Gov. Gray Davis, legislative leaders and other groups=20
involved in solving the energy crisis.=20
Davis said in a statement that he was more encouraged by FERC's actions=20
recently since the two joined the regulatory body.=20
"In a refreshing change . . . these commissioners offered a problem-solving=
=20
approach in resolving California's energy challenge," Davis said.=20
Wood expressed optimism the settlement talks would be fruitful.=20
"I think it is far better to settle than to stretch out through litigation,=
=20
even if the state were to ultimately prevail," he said. "This is really=20
(about) businesspeople who need to re-establish a business relationship tha=
t=20
has been poisoned."=20
Although the divide between California officials and the generators is vast=
,=20
some have faith in the mediator, a 72-year-old judge with a track record of=
=20
reaching settlements in difficult cases.=20
"He's a miracle worker," said FERC commissioner William Massey. "He's very=
=20
good at persuading parties that it's in their best interests to settle rath=
er=20
than proceed" with lawsuits.=20
Wagner set the tone yesterday by ordering reporters out of the hearing room=
=20
after half an hour explaining the ground rules. And Wagner warned=20
participants to keep the discussions confidential.=20
"I would hate to read something in the business section tomorrow that=20
somebody said here today," Wagner said.=20
Michael Kahn, chairman of California's Independent System Operator, said th=
e=20
state would hold firm to its request for $8.9 billion in refunds. Any refun=
ds=20
would go to the electricity buyers -- the utilities and the Department of=
=20
Water Resources, which has bought energy on behalf of the state since=20
January.=20
But to suppliers, even the word "refund" is an unacceptable term.=20
"Certainly, you will not find a supplier who will agree that they have been=
=20
overcharging anyone in California, so clearly any refund obligation will be=
=20
contested," said Mark Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply=
=20
Association, which represents the generators. "The suppliers will argue the=
=20
charges were appropriate for the market conditions."=20
State officials may face difficulty recovering the full amount, based on=20
electricity sales from May 2000 to May 2001. Under FERC rules, overcharges=
=20
can only be authorized after a formal investigation is ordered, which began=
=20
Oct. 2,=20
2000.=20
"There is no way that we're going to do anything to compromise those claims=
,=20
" Kahn said. "That includes last summer, when San Diegans were terribly=20
overcharged. That includes last summer, when there were no credit problems,=

WASHINGTON -- The warring parties in the California electricity crisis=20

y=20
and agree how much in refunds the state will get from energy suppliers.=20
Billions of dollars are at stake as legal teams from California, its=20
utilities and dozens of power suppliers try to negotiate a settlement by Ju=
ly=20
10. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission set up the settlement conferen=
ce=20
to resolve California's claims that energy suppliers have overcharged the=
=20
state $8.9 billion for power since last spring.=20
The commission has ordered about $124 million in refunds for a small portio=
n=20
of that time. Power companies balk at the suggestion they overcharged, sayi=
ng=20
it is they who are owed billions by state utilities that haven't paid their=
=20
bills for electricity purchases.=20
Deadlock warning=20
If the parties can't settle the dispute during the talks, Judge Curtis=20
Wagner, a straight-talking, 72-year-old administrative law judge, will=20
recommend a solution to the commission.=20
``I can tell you now that you're far better off to work out the refund issu=

Early indications were that a settlement will be difficult, although state=
=20
and federal officials in Sacramento talked with optimism about a new level =
of=20
cooperation.=20
But at the meeting in Washington, the head of California's team gave no=20
ground Monday, reiterating the state's position that it wants all of the $8=
.9=20
billion Gov. Gray Davis demanded during congressional testimony last week.=
=20
Michael Kahn, chairman of the state's Independent System Operator, said tha=
t=20
all the parties in California -- the governor, the attorney general, the IS=
O,=20
the Public Utilities Commission and the three investor-owned utilities -- a=
re=20
presenting a unified front.=20
``We are all together along with representatives from the Legislature,'' Ka=
hn=20
said, ``in saying the same thing to FERC and saying the same thing to the=
=20
generators: We want our refunds. We want them now, and we want that to be t=
he=20
first order of business.''=20
Kahn said the $8.9 billion figure is bolstered by initial estimates by the=
=20
state of overcharges if a new price-limit formula approved by the commissio=
n=20
last week had been in effect since May 2000. The total is ``an extremely=20
conservative estimate,'' he said, and the state will ask for ``a lot more=
=20
money'' if the issue is referred to the commission for action, or if the=20
whole dispute goes to court. The total amount of electricity purchases by=
=20
California and its utilities during that 13-month period was $43.8 billion.=
=20
But how far back the state could seek refunds is one of several issues Wagn=
er=20
said must be determined in the settlement talks. The commission has said it=
=20
has authority to order refunds only from last October, though everything is=
=20
subject to negotiations. Wagner said last week he believes the amount=20
suppliers owe the state is about $2.5 billion.=20
The state estimates it was overcharged $2.94 billion from May 2000 to=20
September 2000, according to a confidential ISO breakdown obtained by the=
=20
Mercury News. The breakdown of alleged overcharges by 44 suppliers goes onl=
y=20
through February 2001, when the state estimated overcharges at $6.8 billion=
,=20
a figure recently updated through the end of May to $8.9 billion.=20
For the whole period from May 2000 to February 2001, the biggest=20
over-chargers were Williams Energy Services Corp., $861 million; Duke Energ=
y=20
Trading and Marketing, $805 million; and Southern Company Energy Marketing,=
=20
$754 million.=20
Other concerns=20
Among other subjects to be negotiated are who should get refunds and immuni=
ty=20
for suppliers from future lawsuits for overcharges. In convening the=20
negotiations, FERC commissioners said they hoped many issues could be=20
addressed in addition to refunds, including more long-term contracts betwee=
n=20
the state and power suppliers.=20
At the end of the first day of talks, Wagner said the state and some others=
=20
were digging in. In all, about 50 parties sent representatives, ranging fro=
m=20
energy suppliers to utilities to municipalities. Wagner admonished them all=
=20
to keep the talks confidential.=20
``Everybody has to stick to their guns for a while,'' he said, noting the=
=20
negotiations may have to go late into the evenings and into weekends to mee=
t=20

In Sacramento on Monday, the newest commissioners to join FERC -- Pat Wood=
=20
and Nora Brownell -- praised California for its handling of the energy=20
crisis.=20
Wood, a Texan appointed by President Bush and expected to become the next=

FERC chairman, said he had come to California to help ``patch up'' the=20

plant, told The Orange County Register that he supports the testimony of=20
three former colleagues who Friday told a Senate committee that new parts a=
t=20
the plant were destroyed, routine maintenance was neglected and generators=
=20
were unnecessarily throttled down.=20
Rick Connors said that unlike the three Chula Vista plant workers who=20
testified earlier, he was offered continued employment by Duke and cannot b=
e=20
dismissed by the company as a terminated employee with an ax to grind.=20
"I listened to the entire hearing. I can tell you that everything they said=
=20
was the truth; nothing they said was even a stretch,'' said Connors, who ha=
s=20
decided to retire and become a card dealer instead of working for Duke, whi=
ch=20
took over the plant from San Diego Gas & Electric and laid off many of his=
=20
experienced co-workers.=20
Connors and another new witness, Dan Davis, a former electrician at the=20
AES-owned Huntington Beach plant, each on Monday said they saw maintenance=
=20
schedules at their respective plants abandoned and generators constantly=20
turned on and off, which damaged them.=20
"They learned that they would operate one generator and make more money tha=
n=20
if they were operating three,'' said Connors.=20
Conners had worked at the plant 20 years before Duke took it over in 1998 a=
nd=20
said he was familiar with generation levels before and after the takeover.=
=20
Conners said that even though Duke dramatically cut back on how much it ran=
=20
its generators in the first year, Duke executives boasted to employees at a=
=20
company party that they had made as much money in their first year as SDG&E=
=20
had made in the previous five.=20
Similarly, Davis said, the generators at the AES plant in Huntington Beach=
=20
would be ramped down and quickly ramped up again.=20
He believes this wear and tear coupled with a lack of maintenance not only=
=20
helped create an immediate scarcity in the market but also created an=20
environment of constant breakdowns - which created further scarcity.=20
"At first I thought they were stupid,'' said Davis, who now works for the=
=20
union representing plant workers. "I had been there 10 years and I was=20
watching them destroy the plant. But then I saw how it made them money.=20
Breakdowns made them money."=20
Both companies vigorously denied the allegations.=20
"Any talk of us intentionally breaking down equipment is ludicrous,'' said =
Ed=20
Blackford, manager of the AES plant. "When our units break down, we lose=20
money. We have commitments and if we can't produce that electricity, we hav=
e=20
to go out into the market and buy it."=20
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said he is sure the workers saw changes in the=
=20
way the plants were operated after deregulation - but said their conclusion=
s=20
of price-fixing and gouging are off base.=20
"It's highly offensive to us,'' said Williams. "They were seeing things fro=
m=20
their own viewpoint and they don't see the full picture."=20
Duke took out a full page ad in today's Orange County Register and other=20
newspapers that says the powering up and down was done at the order of the=
=20
Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Williams=
=20
acknowledged, however, that some of those orders were made by Duke itself,=
=20
but couldn't say what percentage.=20
The advertisement doesn't address the allegation that equipment was=20
intentionally mistreated or replacement parts scrapped, although Duke said=
=20
earlier that the parts were obsolete and it was more cost-efficient to orde=
r=20
parts as needed.=20
ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said its orders to power suppliers to ra=
mp=20
generators up and down are confidential and she could not verify Williams'=
=20
explanation. However, the ISO, she said, would give Duke orders to ramp up=
=20
and down no more often than every 10 minutes.=20
A review of three days of logs obtained by the Register showed that on more=
=20
than a dozen occasions, orders were given in two-, three- or four-minute=20
intervals - the so-called dramatic "yo-yoing" of the generators that some=
=20
legislators say indicates Duke was acting by itself.=20
Williams said the bottom line is that forced outages at the Chula Vista pla=
nt=20
were done under Duke's control just 1.1 percent of the time, compared to 1.=
8=20
percent under SDG&E.=20
Those numbers, however, are disputed. Frank Wolak, a Stanford economics=20
professor who oversees the ISO's market-surveillance committee, said the=20
forced outage numbers have only been reliable for the past six months.=20
"There is no independent verification of these numbers until Jan. 1, 2000,=
=20
until the governor required that they report this information every single=
=20
day,'' Wolak said. "That information isn't any good."=20
Wolak also said the employees are correct about the destructive results of=

the constant ramping up and down, comparing it to the wear and tear on a ca=

testified Friday, calling them "brave individuals."=20

said just before having breakfast with the men.

Kahn and the rest of the state delegation met for 90 minutes with Wagner on=

Monday afternoon. Kahn then got on a plane for California. The state has=20
until Wednesday to produce more information for the judge.=20
Wagner later met with power sellers in an effort to understand their=20
position, which is that the state's refund figure is laughable.=20
"Now we're ready to get down to brass tacks," Wagner said. The veteran ener=

figure, even though Wagner signaled last week that a couple of billion in=
=20
refunds is more likely.=20
"Everybody has to stick to their guns for a while," Wagner said. The judge=
=20
wouldn't say how he arrived at his refund estimate. But within Davis' $9=20
billion estimate is more than $4 billion that he says is owed to the state =
by=20
entities over which the FERC has no control, such as municipal power=20
companies. In addition, the state has calculated the $9 billion based on=20
alleged overcharges from May 2000 to May 2001. The FERC began calculating=
=20
overcharges in October 2001.=20
There's no way, Kahn said, that the state will abandon its overcharge claim=
s=20
for last summer.=20
The first day's proceedings were largely theater. The conference started wi=

a statement from Wagner, including his reading of a letter from new FERC=20

"This is not the place to debate the shopping list," the letter said. "Nor =

Then representatives from the power sellers, the utilities, the state and=

California 's energy crisis presents at least a dozen major policy issues,=
=20
but perhaps the most complicated question -- and the one with the least=20
satisfactory solution -- is who should pay for past power usage.=20
Specifically, who should pay wholesale electricity suppliers for juice that=
=20
was consumed after wholesale prices rose fiercely above fixed retail prices=
?=20
Between May 2000 and January 2001, before the state of California intervene=
d,=20
a $14 billion gap opened up between what the suppliers charged and the=20
utilities could pay.=20
Right now, nobody is paying. To be sure, Gov. Gray Davis has issued a=20
memorandum of understanding in which he suggests that ratepayers would bear=
=20
part of the repayment burden in the form of a surcharge on their electricit=
y=20
bills, and taxpayers would bear another part in helping fund the state's=20
purchase of utilities' transmission grids. But the memorandum is just a vag=
ue=20
promise, and is already in deep political trouble.=20
It isn't fair to leave power suppliers hanging; the power was used and must=
=20
be paid for. The problem is that, just as in love and war, the California=
=20
energy mess no longer has a fair solution.=20
There are several groups of potential payers. The No. 1 target group is=20
consumers, or ratepayers, on the grounds that they used the power and thus=
=20
should pay its market cost. Yet consumers demanded the amount of power they=
=20
used based on its low retail price. It's hardly fair to now go back and rai=
se=20
the price retroactively. After all, if the price had been higher, consumers=
=20
would have used less of it.=20
A second group of potential payers are the taxpayers, on the grounds that=
=20
this is a big political and regulatory problem for the entire state of=20
California . Since most taxpayers are voters and since voters are ultimatel=
y=20
responsible for the acts of officials they elect, fairness dictates that=20
taxpayers ought to suffer the punishment for the botched deregulation schem=
e.=20
But this solution, too, has flaws. Although sticking taxpayers with the bil=
l=20
might result in taxpayers (to the extent they are voters) throwing the=20
political and regulatory bums out, it doesn't locate the economic burden=20
efficiently. As distinct groups, taxpayers and consumers may overlap, but=
=20
they aren't identical.=20
And then there is a third group -- the utilities themselves -- on the groun=
ds=20
that they shouldn't have been running around buying power they knew they=20
couldn't afford. Although this may satiate a certain blood lust (who doesn'=
t=20
loathe utilities?), utilities are regulated companies and operate under=20
regulatory constraints and imperatives. Accordingly, they bought power on=
=20
behalf of ratepayers and they bought it like mad until they went bankrupt.=
=20
Too, it might be argued that shareholders have already "paid" -- shares of=
=20
Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison have lost 50% to 60% =
of=20
their value since the crisis began.=20
There is one other group of sitting ducks, the suppliers, on the grounds th=
at=20
they are, in the words of Gov. Davis, pirates and marauders who profited fr=
om=20
California 's crisis. But aside from basic questions of equity, suppliers=
=20
have already paid a price in the form of (still mounting) legal bills to=20
defend themselves from charges of profiteering, as well as in the lost=20
opportunity to deploy the money owed to them. Moreover, suppliers already c=
an=20
be expected to bear some of the payment burden since Mr. Davis has indicate=
d=20
they will not be repaid dollar for dollar,=20
Finally, there is the group who is most at fault but the least likely to=20
suffer -- the regulators and politicians -- on the grounds that they pretty=
=20
much created the mess and they surely haven't moved to clean it up.=20
Regulators, most pointedly, because they refused to let the utilities hedge=
=20
their purchases of electricity when they pleaded to do so in 1999.=20
Politicians, in particular the governor, because they dithered for over a=
=20
year, preferring to blame the problem on someone else. Although putting thi=
s=20
group out of work might be the most satisfying civic outcome, the solution =
is=20
a flop if financial restitution is the goal.=20
The latest, most popular approach to solving the mess is to look at the=20
transfer of wealth, required in any case, that would take place under each=
=20
payment scenario. This is what some of California 's politicians mean when=
=20
they complain that full restitution means transferring $14 billion from the=
=20
state of California to the evil out-of-state power suppliers. But, as Irwin=
=20
Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute, points out, there is a long=20
history of wealth transfers to tote up.=20
Initially, when the botched deregulation plan was agreed to several years=
=20
ago, it involved a transfer of wealth from ratepayers to shareholders. That=
=20
is, the utilities were concerned about making back their so-called stranded=
=20
costs, mostly from overbudget nuclear power plants. Those stranded costs we=
re=20
to be paid by fixing, or freezing, rates at a level that would provide "pay=
=20
back" to the utilities for their nuclear construction. However, when=20
wholesale prices shot up a year ago, the utilities (and their shareholders)=
=20
were caught paying much more money for power than the rates they were allow=
ed=20
to charge. And so the transfer of wealth reversed itself -- shareholders=20
subsidized ratepayers.=20
Now, if Mr. Davis's memorandum of understanding becomes operative, the=20
transfer of wealth changes again. Ratepayers will get socked by a surcharge=
=20
on their electricity bills and taxpayers by the state's purchase of=20
transmission lines. Taxpayers might also get hit if the bond issue goes off=
=20
as planned in August and, as expected, erodes California 's credit quality.=
=20
That erosion would mean that all state agencies that issue bonds would be=
=20
required to pay higher interest rates. (In fact, California 's bond rating=
=20
has already been downgraded by two major rating agencies.)=20
Simply put, looking at the transfers of wealth doesn't yield a clear-cut or=
=20
fair solution to the payment problem either.=20
All this leaves politics to dictate the answer, and the shape of it is=20
already apparent. Suppliers, ratepayers, taxpayers and shareholders will be=
ar=20
the cost while the politicians and regulators evade the consequences. In=20
short, the unfairness of love and war doesn't hold a candle to politics in=
