Additional agenda item for discussion this afternoon:

Opportunity to comment in EL00-95-20 on the issue of emergency relief for 
QF's, and the possibility they may go off line.

A short blurb on the issue follows.  Ray

Ridgewood Power submitted a Request for Emergency Relief and an Updated 
Request for Emergency Relief requesting the Commission to take action to 
prevent QF capacity from going off- line in the State of California.  
Ridgewood asks the Commission to take actions that will permit those QFs in 
California that have not been paid fully for past power deliveries to enter 
arrangements to temporarily sell to third-party buyers within California.  
Ridgewood asks the Commission to declare that California electric utilities 
cannot deny transmission access to QFs or otherwise frustrate the ability of 
QFs to sell to third-party purchasers.    

The California Cogeneration Council filed a Motion for Emergency Relief 
requesting the Commission to take action to prevent QFs from going off-line 
in California.  The Cogeneration Council requests the Commission to require 
interconnection, transmission, and related services under section 210(d) of 
the Federal Power Act on a temporary basis pending the resolution of accounts 
receivable issues.

The Commission is also instituting a proceeding in which it will consider 
whether and to what extent it may need to order the provision of 
interconnection, transmission, and related services under Section 210(d) to 
alleviate generation capacity supply shortages in California.
