I am  going to Berkeley right now to pick up the case, so I could talk about 
it  potentially tonight or tomorrow night.? I usually have class on Tuesday,  
but I am not going to go tomorrow.? Let me know what works for  everyone.? I 
would prefer discussing via conference call if  possible.

Hi Team,

I was in class all day yesterday, and could not bear to be indoors  on?yet 
another awesome day!! Purnima and I spend all day hiking. So -  I have 
not read the Home Depot case yet - and am only just starting on it  :-(? 
Good thing we don't have a case to prepare for Tiffany's class  Wed!

Let's get an email dialog going once we get Mark's spreadsheets? 
I'd  also be up for?a meeting/conf call late Mon/Tue eve to do the writeup.  

-Anil

Hi  Carolyn. I'm running the numbers and the rest of you, team, are  
responsible
for the strategy and interpretation of the numbers for case  2. Case 1 was 
fine.
I have a few questions for our beloved professor and  when she responds I'll
e-mail out my spreadsheet  models.
