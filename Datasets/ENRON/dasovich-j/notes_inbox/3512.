Energy Systems Update for Wednesday, May 9 at 11:45am:
The California Independent System Operator has declared a "STAGE 2
EMERGENCY" from the hours of 1145 to 2400 due to forecasted high loads and
temperatures throughout the control area.

Consumers are requested to voluntarily curtail nonessential electric load to
avoid more severe conditions including involuntary curtailments.

The ISO indicated a Stage 3 emergency and firm load shedding is possible
today.

If outages occur they will begin with Block 1.

Communications are expected to be similiar to yesterday. Any further
specific changes in operating conditions will be communicated with
additional Grid Updates.
