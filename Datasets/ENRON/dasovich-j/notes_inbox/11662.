Markets usually evolve in the way that I always envisioned complex molecula=

however, looks like it's going to form a different sort of compound.=20
The market is badly splintered right now. According to Updata Capital, a=20

mindshare. The research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) tracks 46=

"The business will aggregate around a few players, and we want to be an=20

Mr. Thompson says any deals Symantec makes must fit with its strategic=20

security products fall into three categories: interface technologies, war=

technologies, and back-end transaction technologies. For instance, most of=

Symantec's revenue involves warfare: antivirus software, firewalls, and=20
intrusion detection software. But Symantec also sells PCAnywhere, which fal=

into the back-end category.=20
So would it make sense for Symantec to add interface technologies like acce=
ss=20
management or collaborative computing? Maybe. Mr. Thompson isn't saying.=20
But there's a very real possibility that many of the non-war functions will=
=20
get sucked into the features set for front-end application makers or for=20
transaction-oriented companies like Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and Siebel System=
s=20
(Nasdaq: SEBL). In other words, security is ultimately just a feature.=20
Updata's Don More likes my theory, saying that non-security companies will=

Others disagree. Chuck Jones of Salomon Smith Barney thinks that security=

Neither analyst, though, thinks any clear winners in the security market wi=
