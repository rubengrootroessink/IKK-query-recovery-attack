Team,

I've started the project and am still trying to figure out exactly what our
dear
prof. is looking for.  My guess is that the assignment is a review how the
ROA
ratios would change or have changed when one takes into account various
one-off
charges, restructurings, accounting changes, and off-balance sheet items.
I'm
in LA tomorrow and will send you all my work tomorrow night.  I suggest that
everyone take a crack at reviewing the data and coming with your own
insights.
One person should be responsible for bringing it all together.  Any
volunteers?

Hey Guys,

Just sat down to read about the first write up that is due
this Thursday, and realized that this is supposed to be a
group assignment!!  Ooops - I had no idea... Did you ;-)
Anyone read the case and/or taken a crack at it? Should
we try and co-ordinate a conference call?

Carolyn is out for the week and excused from the
assignment - just had a baby girl last Fri!!
Jeff, did you hear from teacher if OK to join ?
