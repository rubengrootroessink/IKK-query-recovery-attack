Good Afternoon,

On Tuesday, June 26 the San Jose City Council will be hearing the Metcalf
Energy Center item for the final time.  As you are aware, the SVMG has
endorsed the need for this energy project from the beginning stages.
However encouraged we have been, the Metcalf Energy Center continues to
witness objection from some groups.  It is important that the SVMG be
present at this hearing to provide as much support as possible!

We need at least 10 member company representatives to attend the evening
session of the SJ City Council Meeting tomorrow at 7:00pm to speak on behalf
of this very needed energy project.  This will provide an opportunity to see
your work pay off.  Thanks to those who have already committed to
representing the SVMG at tomorrow's hearing (Terry Thomas, Lockheed Martin
and Don McIntosh, AMD), but we need a handful more to sign on.

Please help to endorse the Metcalf Energy Center!  For more information or
to sign on to participate e-mail lgoldseth@svmg.org or call 408-501-7870.

Sincerely,
Carl
