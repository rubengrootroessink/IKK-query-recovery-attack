Subject: Negative CTC Complaint

As a result of the CPUC's chastisement of UDCs for not suing generators and 
marketers at the recent hearings, SoCal Edison is unwilling to join in a 
request for a stay of the Negative CTC proceeding (in which, as you know, it 
has filed an "abuse of market power" counterclaim against EES).  EES and PG&E 
alone will not be able to convince the ALJ to stay the proceedings.  This 
means we will not be able to continue the proceeding.  As a reminder, the 
Negative CTC proceeding is on a separate, and faster, track than the "abuse 
of market power" counterclaim.  The hearing in the Negative CTC proceeding is 
scheduled for late April.  No procedural schedule for the "abuse of market 
power" counterclaim has been established.  If our motion to dismiss the 
Counterclaim is granted, it will end.  If not, the ALJ will enter a separate 
procedural schedule.

Please call me with any questions.
