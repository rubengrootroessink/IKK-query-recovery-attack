Dear fellow evening students,
We are into the thick of golf tournament planning and are at the
moment considering opening the tournament up to the day students as well.
It was originally designed as a special recruiting and networking outlet for
the evening students only, but due to other circumstances, we may want to
combine our tournament with one the day program is also currently
considering.  A combined tournament may seriously limit the amount of
students that can play and I want to be sure that all evening students who
want to play are able to.  To help in estimating demand and making this
decision, I am asking you to respond to me with your intent to play or not
play given the following preliminary information......
Dates:  A Saturday or Sunday in late September/early October
Cost: $65-$80 per player
Location: A higher end golf course located in the South Bay, East Bay or
possibly even East of the Altamont Pass.

Please remember that golf skills are not required since it will be a
scramble format.  All I recommend is visiting a driving range a couple times
with instruction before heading out to the tournament (and borrowing or
renting a set of clubs).  Thanks for your time!
