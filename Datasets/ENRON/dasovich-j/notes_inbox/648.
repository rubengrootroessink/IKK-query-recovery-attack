I am a Registered Proffessional Engineer who has specialized in Electrical 
Transmission and Power Plants. I have designed and built facilities in most 
of the U.S. and many overseas countries. I Started as a Transmission Engineer 
for Houston Lighting and Power Co, in 1950. I had previously worked as a 
serviceman while enrolled in Rice University. My father was a lineman since 
1917 . I had a 12 year career as a Professor  at the University of Houston. I 
don" know just who is at Enron San Francisco now. Dave Parquet and Sam When 
know me and perhaps there are others.

What I asked Jim Steffis about was getting a heads up from you whenever any 
thing was coming up that I needed to be aware of with an RTO or ISO that 
would help me to understand the rules as they change rather than be hit in 
the face with them afterwards. In some cases I have been know to influence 
the rules indorsed b y the Engineering Committee before they go to Executive 
Commities or to other authorities.

If you have questions or want to talk you can reach me at Houston 
713-345-7867 or by e-mail.
