Jeff just called and asked us to prepare the following charts for his 
presentation at the Commonwealth Club:  

1 -- forward price of power in California (today, tomorrow, next day, 5 
years, 10 years, 20 years)

conceptual charts of Economics 101:
2  -- example of a supply/demand curve
3  -- supply/demand curve for short-term power
4  -- supply/demand curve for long-term power

5 -- 3-4 quotes from testimony in '95/'96 where Enron made the arguments that 
there would be no forward market, structure was silly 

6 -- chart with the estimate for the number of states or utilities and what 
percentage of power-buying is long-term versus short-term.  Jeff wants to 
show that all other states and utilities have a minimal percentage of power 
purchasing on the spot market.
