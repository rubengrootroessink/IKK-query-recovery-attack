o Government Rejects One Argument in Napster Appeal

NEW YORK -- The United States Copyright Office and
the Department of Justice have rejected one facet
of Napster's defense that claims it is protected
by the Home Audio Recording Act. Record labels and
music industry organizations have charged Napster,
operator of a site for sharing copyrighted music
files in MP3 format, with copyright infringement.
In an advisory brief filed with the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California,
the Copyright Office stated the "Audio Home Recording
Act does not protect Napster from the plaintiff's
claims of copyright infringement." The U.S. Copyright
Office and the Justice Department argue that the
Audio Home Recording Act addresses a different phenomenon,
specifically the use of DAT recorders used for home
taping. "We have great respect for the Department
of Justice, but in this instance we believe their
position is incorrect, " said Napster's attorney
David Boies. In a statement Mr. Boies also noted
that the government did not address Napster's liability
and the precedents cited in Napster's appeal. A&M
Records and other record labels, the Recording Industry
Association of America, and the National Music Publishers
Association have filed the suit against Napster.
The company is backed by Hummer Winblad Venture
Partners and individual investors.
