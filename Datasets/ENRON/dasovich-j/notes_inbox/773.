Come find out why Level 3 Communications is one of the fastest growing
"next-generation" data communications providers in the world. It=01,s uniqu=
e
business strategy - to build the world=01,s first continuously upgradeable
all-IP network - is so compelling Wall Street has raised over $13 billion i=
n
debt & equity to support it. Yet our $32 billion market cap is less than 2%
of the estimated $2 trillion market cap attributed to our marketplace - a
marketplace we plan to dominate. Our Outperformance Stock Option plan
rewards us with multiples of value for beating the S&P 500 index. Now THAT=
=01,s
upside.


The Level 3 team has grown from a handful of senior executives to a dynamic
group of recent top tier MBA's, ex-consultants, ex-bankers, ex-telecom
professionals and e-commerce entrepreneurs who share the exuberance and
excitement that comes from building a company from scratch. The difference
is that we are in a market with real revenues, real assets and real
challenges. You won=01,t stand on the sidelines as we make this happen. MBA=
's
serve in key roles and are responsible for projects vital to the company=01=

success. Our headquarters sits on a brand new campus in Broomfield,
Colorado; 20 minutes from Denver and 10 minutes from Boulder. So forget
consulting, investment banking and the latest dot.com "someday we will make
money" business plan. Join the company that is already collecting checks
from most of the dot.com community. They call in "paying for bandwidth," we
call it our bread and butter.
