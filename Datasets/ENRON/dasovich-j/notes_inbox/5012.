Update re schedule for SB 28X and status of bill:

During my meeting with Kip Lippert of Sen. Sher's office today he had a
conversation with the Senator during which Sher indicated that he did not
feel SB 28X was ready to go to Senate Approps on Monday.  Sher's office will
work on language to clarify the bill's main program--the emission mitigation
fee in lieu of offset credits, and prepare the bill for a hearing later in
the week.  Our suggestions to clarify the bill's language on this key
proposal are being incorporated into the amendments along with similar
provisions offered by IEP.  Our "new" langauge on creating more offsets by
limiting local district discretion to interpret the rules on offset creation
arbitrarily will require negotiation with the air districts and the enviros
before Sher will consider them in the Assembly.  Mike Day
