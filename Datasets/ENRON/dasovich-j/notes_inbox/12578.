Burton accuses Davis of veto talk=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 13, 2001)=20
State Senate leader John Burton charged Tuesday that Gov. Gray Davis=20
threatened lawmakers earlier this week in an attempt to gain support for a=
=20
struggling deal with Southern California Edison.=20
While answering questions on the Edison deal, Burton alleged that Davis=20
suggested he would veto non-energy legislation if Senate Democrats did not=
=20
back a deal he struck with Edison in April.=20
Davis aides denied the charge, as did some lawmakers, but the episode=20
suggested that support for the governor's plan remains distant.=20
Davis met Monday with 13 senators as part of an ongoing lobbying effort for=
=20
the Edison deal. Under Davis' tentative agreement, the state would pay the=
=20
utility $2.76 billion for its transmission lines and dedicate a portion of=
=20
electricity rates to help pay off its debts. The deal requires legislative=
=20
approval.=20
Burton said he was not invited to the Monday meeting. His claims were based=
=20
on reports from colleagues, he said.=20
The Senate leader said the governor told senators that their past support f=
or=20
his proposals "didn't mean anything if they voted against this."=20
"If that turns out to be the case," Burton said, "I've been around long=20
enough to know how to play that game with the executive branch as well."=20
"He's too smart to do that," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio, referring=
=20
to alleged threats. "I think he expressed his strong support for the=20
legislation, but he's too smart to do that."=20
Three senators who attended the meeting with Davis disagreed with Burton's=
=20
characterization. One declined comment; others did not return telephone cal=
ls=20
on the subject.=20
"I heard no threats in anything (Davis) said," said Sen. Sheila Kuehl,=20
D-Santa Monica. "He said, 'Look, I want my bill to go up for a vote.' And w=
e=20
said, 'As it stands, we're not sure how much support it has.' "=20
Two months after the Edison deal was first unveiled, most lawmakers have=20
rejected it as written. Leaders in both houses are discussing various=20
alternatives to the governor's plan, which is contained in legislation by=
=20
Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles.=20
"As it is before us, it is nothing more than a bailout for the utilities,"=
=20
Burton said.=20
He reiterated Tuesday that he wants to see generators and creditors take a =
30=20
percent cut in the debt they are owed for energy purchases. He is supportiv=
e=20
of a plan that would shift costs to big energy consumers and protect=20
residents.=20
Burton also unveiled three new energy proposals Tuesday. One would require=
=20
the California Energy Commission to provide backup power for high-priority=
=20
traffic signals. Another would prevent a 10 percent rate increase scheduled=
=20
to take effect next year. The third is a resolution that would support the=
=20
governor in seizing power plants.=20
"We're going to show him that there is support in the Senate for seizing=20
these power plants from these generators who, in fact, have been ripping us=
=20
off," Burton said.=20
Discussions on the governor's Edison proposal could begin as soon as next=
=20
week. Three Senate committees -- judiciary, energy and natural resources --=
=20
are likely to take up the bill.=20
Maviglio said that the governor remains open to changes to the deal -- a=20
compromise Davis will have to make given that few lawmakers are willing to=
=20
support the existing plan.=20
"I don't think there's a lot of support for (the deal) as it is, in every=

?????Gov. Gray Davis in recent days has largely credited these contracts wi=

details of the contracts--raise concerns that the 18 energy companies may=

have gotten the better end of the deals.
?????Perhaps adding to the downward pressure on prices, senior officials of=
=20
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Tuesday that the agency is=20
considering new ways to curb California electricity prices this summer.
?????Among other things, the commission might extend its current wholesale=
=20
price limits--now in effect only during power emergencies--to 24 hours a da=
y,=20
seven days a week.
?????The contract records obtained by The Times show that the state is=20
committed to buying power at prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour for peak=20
electricity and more than $95 for energy that includes times of day when=20
demand is lowest.
?????By contrast, with a recent tumble in wholesale power prices, the state=
=20
purchased peak daytime electricity at less than $100 an hour and less than=
=20
$20 at night when demand trails off. On Tuesday, prices for last-minute pea=
k=20
power in California were under $58 a megawatt-hour, according a Bloomberg=
=20
news service survey.
?????In some contracts, the state may pay more or less in the years ahead,=
=20
depending on the price of natural gas. Under terms negotiated by the Davis=
=20
administration, one company receives $80 million to $90 million a year simp=
ly=20
to be ready to produce, even if no electricity is sold.
?????The good news surrounding current market prices could change rapidly=
=20
this summer as temperatures climb and use of air conditioning surges.
?????Nonetheless, experts say, the recent prices could be an omen of the=20
future, when as many as 15 new power plants come online, adding thousands o=
f=20
megawatts to the California grid.
?????"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a=
=20
short-term crisis," said Peter Navarro, an economist at UC Irvine, who=20

?????State officials, including Davis, say they are proud of the hard-fough=
t=20
concessions they won from the power merchants, who have reaped immense=20
profits from the state's failed deregulation scheme.
?????They say the benefits of the power contracts, while less predictable i=
n=20
the long term, have already helped alter the marketplace. Perhaps most=20
important, they say, the contracts have freed the state from a nearly total=
=20
reliance on last-minute purchases in the costly spot market.
?????Officials say the contracts have locked up nearly half the state's pea=
k=20
power needs this summer. The remainder will come from short-term contracts,=
=20
last-minute purchases and reduced demand from conservation programs. "This=

David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power=

"The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we are rolli=

?????Freeman seemed less confident, however, when asked whether the state m=

he said, "we certainly don't know the future."
?????Ray Hart, deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, said t=

state is absolutely not overpaying for power under the contracts his agency=

is helping to negotiate. He acknowledged that the average price the state i=

paying under the contracts is higher than current market prices.
?????And that is the way it should be, he said, because the state has=20
dampened the volatility of the spot market by reducing last-minute purchase=
s.
?????"If we didn't have contracts," Hart said, "we'd be buying 100% on the=
=20
spot market . . . spending $300-plus [a megawatt-hour] for energy."
?????Many of the contract details remain shrouded in mystery, making it=20
difficult to gauge the true extent of the state's financial commitment.

?????News Organizations Seek Disclosure of Deals
?????The Times and other news organizations have sued the state to release=
=20
the contracts and provide details on the state's daily power purchases, now=
=20
totaling more than $7 billion. The Davis administration previously refused =
to=20

to=20

?????But on Tuesday the governor announced that he intended to release the=
=20
contracts as early as today "with only very minor redactions."
?????The about-face came after state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said publicly=

?????The records obtained The Times show that the contracts vary widely in=

?????For example, in a series of agreements for power in Southern Californi=

the state has agreed to pay Dynegy Inc. some rates fixed at a $119 a=20

Federal Panel May Extend Price Limits=20
Utilities: Regulatory commission weighs expanding the plan beyond emergenci=
es=20
and throughout the West.=20

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer=20

?????WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, responding to=20
pressure from lawmakers, state officials and consumers, is considering a=20
significant expansion of its plan to limit California electricity prices th=
is=20
summer, senior agency officials said Tuesday.
?????Commissioners and staff members are engaged in intense negotiations in=
=20
advance of a key meeting Monday to finalize an emergency plan for Californi=
a=20
and the West.
?????According to several commission officials, the options being discussed=
=20
include:
?????* Extending FERC's current price limits--now in effect only during pow=
er=20
emergencies in California--to 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The limits=
,=20
intended to prevent price spikes, were invoked during two emergencies last=
=20
month and resulted in immediate cuts in the price of wholesale electricity.=
=20
FERC is also considering applying such limits throughout the West.
?????* Requiring power generators in the entire Western region to sell=20
available electricity to California or into their local power grids during=
=20
emergencies, reducing the threat of blackouts.
?????* Establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell=20
electricity back into the grid during peak usage times. Some companies that=
=20
have long-term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by=20
scaling back their operations and selling electricity.
?????* Tightening rules on what energy marketers--firms that buy and resell=
=20
power contracts much like stockbrokers trade shares--can charge for their=
=20
electricity.
?????* Expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for=20
excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies. That refund=20
order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies.
?????The measures under consideration stop short of the price caps being=20
sought by Gov. Gray Davis and California Democrats. But they may go far=20
enough to provide an acceptable compromise.
?????"The whole thing is in flux, but it is moving toward a much more=20
effective price mitigation plan, not only for California but for the West,"=
=20
said an agency official.
?????Strong political pressure from Senate Democrats and House Republicans=
=20
appears to have galvanized FERC into taking a more decisive role. "We're so=
rt=20
of the last to get it," the official said.
?????FERC has been bitterly criticized by Davis for abandoning California.=
=20
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. has responded by citing dozens of modest=
=20
FERC actions to assist the state.
?????But Hebert has resisted Davis' central demand that FERC use its legal=
=20
authority to order a temporary return to fixed electricity rates. Such fixe=
d=20
rates, based on the cost of producing power plus an allowance for profit,=
=20
were standard before deregulation.
?????"The politics of the situation have changed significantly, and=20
commissioners are not immune to politics," said another senior agency=20
official. "The message from Capitol Hill has gotten stronger with a=20
Democratic Senate. Even the Bush administration is saying we should make su=
re=20
there is no price gouging."
?????FERC members have been summoned to testify before the Senate=20
Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.=
)=20
a week from today. Meanwhile, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), the new Senate=
=20
Energy Committee chairman, has told FERC he will move legislation to cap=20
electricity rates in the West unless it acts soon.
?????Agency officials said commissioners do not want to face Lieberman next=
=20
week empty-handed.
?????House Republicans have also been prodding the agency. On Tuesday, Ener=
gy=20
Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote Hebert to urge=20
Western-wide, round-the-clock price limits.
?????"We strongly urge the commission to implement a comprehensive plan to=
=20
mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor wholesale sales of=20
electric energy . . . within the entire Western Systems Coordinating=20
Council," wrote Tauzin, referring to the Western power grid.
?????FERC officials said a strong effort is underway to achieve a consensus=
=20
on the five-member commission, lately riven by ideology but now bolstered b=
y=20
two new pragmatic commissioners who favor active oversight of industry.
?????Commissioner William Massey, who for months has been a lonely dissente=
r,=20
is continuing to press for the traditional price caps sought by Davis,=20
officials said. Once marginalized, Massey apparently is now being actively=
=20
wooed by the other members.
?????S. David Freeman, an energy advisor to Gov. Davis, said Tuesday that=
=20
expanding FERC's current price limits would be a positive step. But he adde=
d=20
that the governor continues to advocate a return to traditional, fixed rate=
s.
?????"Any strengthening of the [FERC] plan is in the public interest,"=20
Freeman told reporters at a Washington news conference.
?????FERC's price limits are not keyed to a particular dollar amount but ar=
e=20
flexible.
?????When a power emergency is called by the state, FERC's plan limits the=
=20
price that generators can charge to what it costs to produce power at the=
=20
least efficient plant running at that time. (The costs of all the plants ar=
e=20
determined beforehand by California's grid operator based on data filed by=
=20
the generators.)
?????Another requirement of the FERC plan forces generators using the=20
California grid to sell any power they have available during emergency=20
conditions.
?????When the price limits were tested in two emergencies late last month,=
=20
prices came down quickly. But power sellers complained that the limits were=
=20
too strict. And by the second emergency, there was evidence that some selle=
rs=20
had started finding ways around the limits.

the U.S., said Graef Crystal, a Las Vegas-based expert on executive=20

Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who chairs the Senate Energy, Utilitie=

?????Government Agencies Investigating Firms
?????Indeed, the stock sales have taken place against a backdrop of acrimon=

between state officials and the power companies.
?????Last month, Lynch told The Times that state investigators have uncover=
ed=20
evidence that a "cartel" of power companies shut down plants for unnecessar=
y=20

=20
did not name the companies.
?????State and federal agencies are investigating the actions of several of=

the big energy companies, seeking to verify charges that they have conspire=
d=20
to boost prices by limiting construction of power plants, in one case, or b=
y=20
limiting the amount of natural gas available in the power-hungry California=

market.
?????Executives at firms not accused of price gouging also have cashed in.
?????Ann B. Curtis, chief financial officer of Calpine Corp., a San=20
Jose-based power plant builder and generator, has netted more than $10=20
million in option transactions in the last year. That compares with a total=
=20
of $5 million in the four previous years.
?????Some analysts say the transactions are to be expected, considering the=
=20
changing nature of the power industry.
?????"Unlike at the old-line utilities where insiders rarely sell, we've=20
grown accustomed to insider sales at the diversified power producers," said=
=20
Paul Elliott, a First Call/Thomson Financial analyst. "I'm not convinced th=
at=20
these sales raise any red flags at this point."
?????Although no one is saying that any of the stock trades were illegal,=
=20
critics link the value of the transactions to the profits streaming out of=
=20
California.
?????"The generators have no shame," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for=

California Gov. Gray Davis. "It speaks to how there has been a massive=20

"
?????In reporting record financial results for the first quarter of this=20

did note that it sold nearly twice as much electricity in North America=20

?????Lay, the Enron chairman, "has given himself very generous stock option=

over the years," compensation expert Crystal said.
?????"You might think of him as a farmer who has planted thousands of acres=

?????A spokesman for AES also declined to talk about stock sales by its=20

to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Duke's sto=

is up," said Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke Energy.
?????Francisco said many of the sellers at Duke continue to hold large=20
amounts of the company's stock. That also holds true for executives of the=

other firms.
?????Calpine Chief Executive Peter Cartwright, for example, sold nearly $20=

?????El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn noted that Arledge, one of the largest=

?????"They may feel that this power game is not going to go on forever, so=

they are getting out while the getting is good," said David Moreland, a=20

?????Much of the executives' gains stem from the common practice of grantin=

?????"We hope this agreement will help bring stability back to this segment=

?????About 700 of the small producers generate more than one-fourth of the=

?????The PUC ordered the utilities to begin paying the generators in late=

California Public Utilities Commission late Tuesday, other than to say that=

?????"I hear it's a good deal," said Joe Ronan, chairman of the Independent=

Energy Producers Assn., which has been involved in the negotiations.
?????Ronan, a Calpine vice president, said he learned the deal calls for a=

though the prices are lower than historic highs of $200 or more for=20

?????Gas-fired plants, he said, would be protected from volatility in the=

?????The PUC is scheduled to consider a proposal for resolving the issue=20
today at a special meeting.
?????An earlier proposal called for Edison and PG&E to make payments of 15%=

of the amount due to the small energy providers that demonstrate a need for=

?????The PUC recently deferred taking action on the order because the=20

he was unaware of the settlement and noted that Freeman was in Washington o=

Sacramento -- California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said yesterday he wi=
ll=20
convene a criminal grand jury to investigate whether power generators=20
illegally manipulated energy prices.=20
Lockyer said the investigation will look into whether generators worked=20
together -- directly or indirectly -- to drive up electricity and natural g=
as=20
prices by withholding energy, shutting down plants or exploiting the biddin=
g=20
process. The investigation will begin shortly after July 1, when a new 19-=
=20
member Sacramento County grand jury is seated.=20
"This doesn't indicate we've reached a conclusion. It's a process to get at=
=20
the truth," Lockyer said in an interview with The Chronicle. "This is the=
=20
beginning of the criminal focus."=20
Since August, Lockyer has been investigating whether generators manipulated=
=20
the market or used unfair business practices or if their executives engaged=
=20
in criminal behavior.=20
Generators deny any manipulation of the market. They say their electricity=
=20
prices simply reflect a lack of supply, plant breakdowns and the high cost =
of=20
natural gas, which fuels most power plants.=20
Lockyer would not say whether he has evidence of market manipulation but=20
indicated that the grand jury will be an investigative tool.=20
"The purpose of the effort is to make sure no stone is left unturned in our=
=20
investigation of electrical and natural gas businesses," Lockyer said.=20
Working with Lockyer, the PUC will be checking into whether generators time=
d=20
maintenance and shutdowns to drive up prices -- a charge generators=20
repeatedly deny.=20
"We've had the Public Utilities Commission visit our facilities 65 times.=
=20
They were here today for the second time in a couple of days. They've yet t=
o=20
prove manipulation or withholding because we have not manipulated and we ha=
ve=20
not withheld," said Pat Dorinson, a spokesman for Mirant, which operates tw=
o=20
power plants in the Bay Area.=20
"If they have hard evidence to the contrary, they should bring it forward,"=
=20
Dorinson said.=20
Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, laughed when he was told of the=
=20
grand jury convening.=20
He said the North Carolina-based company had been running its plants hard, =
at=20
the state's request, and charging "below the clearinghouse price" this year=
=20
and last year.=20
"Those are two fundamental things, both on price and supply, that will be a=
=20
fundamental component of anything we present" to an investigation, Williams=
=20
said.=20
Gov. Gray Davis talked by telephone with Lockyer Monday about the status of=
=20
his investigation.=20
Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary, said in a statement: "There is a=20
growing body of evidence that may give the attorney general the opportunity=
=20
to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions."=20
Lockyer said he did not know how long the grand jury would investigate the=
=20
issue.=20
It takes 12 of the grand jury's 19 members to return an indictment. Each=20
grand jury serves for a year.=20
Lockyer's investigation is not related to one by the Senate Select Committe=
e=20
to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale Energy Market. It has=20
subpoenaed documents from the state's biggest generators.=20
"I don't know about criminal activity. I wouldn't put it in those terms,"=
=20
said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate investigative=

committee. "Has there been market power exercised in a collusive fashion? T=

Alameda County's main jail has begun drawing juice from the sun as workers=
=20
lay out what will be the largest array of rooftop solar panels anywhere in=
=20
the Western Hemisphere.=20
When the giant project is finished next month, Santa Rita County Jail in=20
Dublin will resemble a power plant, with one-third of its buildings covered=

with nearly 5,000 panels with photovoltaic cells -- generating enough energ=
y=20
to power 500 homes.=20
"We're producing clean, reliable power," Matt Muniz, Alameda County's energ=
y=20
program manager, said at a news briefing yesterday. "The real importance of=
=20
this is reducing energy costs for the county."=20
The jail project highlights the growing popularity of solar energy,=20
particularly in sunny California in the middle of a power crisis, said Dani=
el=20
Shugar, an executive at PowerLight Corp. of Berkeley, which is installing t=
he=20

Another big solar project is planned at the Neutrogena Corp.'s facility in=
=20
Los Angeles, and last week PowerLight started up a huge rooftop system at t=
he=20
Tompkins County Public Library in Ithaca, N.Y., said company spokeswoman=20
Susan DeVico.=20
At Santa Rita, the first batch of about 4,700, 4-foot by 4-foot panels were=
=20
switched on at the 113-acre jail last week, and they generate about 65=20
kilowatts of power, Muniz said.=20
The system will produce about 500 kilowatts, Muniz said, saving the county=
=20
about $300,000 a year in energy costs. It will also help the jail deal with=
=20
the expected rolling blackouts in the coming hot months. Santa Rita is not=
=20
exempt from blackouts.=20
Aki Nakao, director of the county's general services agency, said the sun-=
=20

is=20
being funded with the help of state grants.=20
"We're in the sunny side of the county," he said. "So it made sense."=20
Muniz said that of all county facilities, the jail also had the largest roo=
f=20
and is the largest user of electricity.=20
Shugar said the solar array will generate the most power during hours when=
=20
the need is greatest.=20
"In Alameda County, you are blessed with a phenomenal solar resource," he=
=20
said. "It's not just energy, but very high value energy. It's produced at a=
=20
time of greatest need."=20
High costs once prevented the widespread use of solar energy, but new=20
technology has paved the way for cheaper and more efficient systems that ta=
p=20
the sun as a main source of power, he added.=20
The world's largest rooftop system is in Germany, Shugar said. In the Unite=
d=20
States, PowerLight also built some of the largest roof-mounted solar power=
=20
systems anywhere, including one at a commercial building in Fountain Valley=
=20
(Orange County) that produces about 400 kilowatts of power, he said.=20
In the Bay Area, the largest rooftop solar energy array can be found at the=
=20
company's own manufacturing plant in Berkeley, Shugar said.=20
Less than 1 percent of electricity generated in California came from solar=
=20
sources in 1999, the latest year tabulated by the California Energy=20
Commission.=20
The vast bulk of that, more than 95 percent, came from solar thermal=20
installations in deserts that heat a liquid core connected to steam=20

'Dig-it-out-burn-it-up' methods won't work=20

WE ARE FACING a tough summer here in California. With rolling blackouts and=
=20
higher electric rates, everyone agrees that we need an energy plan.=20
But just what kind of plan is the question.=20
The oil and gas industries, who have much to gain by the energy crisis, are=
=20
pushing plans to increase energy supply via the same old "dig-it-out-burn-i=
t-=20
up" methods that are dirty, dangerous and won't deliver secure, affordable=
=20
energy supply to the public.=20
Unfortunately, our politicians may be listening.=20
Last month, President Bush released his energy plan that calls for building=
=20
more than 1,000 power plants; drilling on public lands; rolling back=20
clean-air standards; increasing taxpayer subsidies for coal and nuclear pow=
er=20
and reducing investments in efficiency and renewable energy.=20
Gov. Gray Davis and the state Energy Commission have already repealed=20
California's clean-air laws during Stage 3 energy emergencies, allowed gas-=
=20
fired plants to surpass clean-air quotas as long as they sell the energy to=
=20
the state, and approved 13 new fossil-fuel fired power plants. The governor=
=20
also supports building more than 13 more power plants, 28 "emergency" plant=
s=20
and allowing diesel generators to run during Stage 3 alerts.=20
The oil and gas industries claim that we can drill for oil, burn fossil fue=
ls=20
and generate nuclear energy in ways that don't harm the environment.=20
But look at the facts:=20
-- Although natural gas burns cleaner than oil or coal, fossil fuels are=20
dirty no matter what, emitting pollutants that create soot and smog, which=
=20
could aggravate asthma and other serious health effects. Already 600,000=20
children in the state have asthma -- more fossil-fuel pollution could make=
=20
this problem worse.=20
-- Oil drilling has permanently altered the once-pristine area around Prudh=
oe=20
Bay, Alaska. British Petroleum (BP) is responsible for the second- largest=
=20
oil spill in California history and, since 1995, has paid $47 million in=20
fines for pollution violations.=20
-- Despite safety claims, no safe way exists to deal with nuclear waste fro=
m=20
nuclear power plants.=20
-- Additionally, experts estimate that U.S. oil and natural gas supplies wi=
ll=20
run out in 30 to 50 years.=20
One might get the impression that we have no choice but to "dig it out and=
=20
burn it up" to meet our energy needs.=20
But is the dirty, old fossil-fuel path really the only solution to the ener=
gy=20
crisis?=20
Absolutely not.=20
With abundant sunshine, windswept plains and plenty of geothermal heat,=20
California is a perfect place to use renewable energy.=20
The Energy Commission estimates that more than 50 percent of California's=
=20
energy needs could be met through solar, wind and geothermal energy. The U.=
S.=20
Department of Energy reports that 65 percent of the United States' energy=
=20
needs could be met from tougher auto standards, conservation and renewable=
=20
energy sources.=20
For example, by making sport utility vehicles comply with current passenger=
=20
car fuel-efficiency standards, we could save as much oil found in the Arcti=
c=20
National Wildlife Refuge.=20
The state Energy Commission estimates that we currently generate less than=
=20
half of the possible geothermal power in California. The U.S. Department of=
=20
Energy estimates that we could generate twice as much electricity as we=20
produce now from wind power.=20
Renewable energy systems can be built much more quickly than fossil-fuel=20
plants -- a few weeks for rooftop solar, six months to two years for wind a=
nd=20
one to three years for geothermal.=20
The public could get vast energy savings with more focus on energy=20
efficiency. Two conservation measures that were signed by Davis this spring=
=20
-- if implemented well -- will save enough energy to eliminate "emergency"=
=20
diesel generators and still power roughly 2 million homes.=20
This spring, the governor signed an $850 million energy conservation packag=
e=20
that included rebates for consumers who buy energy-efficient appliances and=
=20
programs to distribute energy-efficient lightbulbs.=20
Unfortunately, it is now mid-June and little has been done to implement the=
se=20
programs on a large scale, despite the program's energy-saving potential.=
=20
If we were serious about harnessing the potential of replacing 1 million=20
standard lightbulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs, for example, we could=
=20
have done any one of a number of things, including calling out the National=
=20
Guard to distribute them within a week's time. Ten percent of California's=
=20
energy is currently powered by renewable sources. Now, it is time to improv=
e=20
on that. State Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, is sponsoring SB531, which wou=
ld=20
require that by 2010, 20 percent of California's energy come from renewable=
=20
resources, such as wind and solar power.=20
Davis should endorse Sher's bill and incorporate its elements into his ener=
gy=20
plan for California.=20
By doing this, he will send a strong message that he supports solutions to=
=20
the energy crisis that protect the public health and meet our energy needs.=

The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government recor=

The contracts, which total nearly $43 billion, could burden consumers with=

Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power a=

"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a=20

State officials defended the long-term contracts, crediting the agreements=

=20
and small power generators, it also could help the utility avoid bankruptcy=
.=20
The deal is meant to ensure that the small generators, or "qualifying=20
facilities," keep operating.=20
Several rolling blackouts in January were triggered, in part, by the=20
unavailability of power generated by the qualifying facilities, which were=
=20
strapped for cash because they hadn't been paid by Edison and Pacific Gas &=
=20
Electric Co. The small generators, many of which have sued the utility,=20
account for about one-third of the state's power supply.=20
The proposed PUC order would raise the rates being paid to generators that=
=20
use natural gas and offer a stable rate for five years to generators using=
=20
wind, solar, geothermal or other renewable sources.=20
The proposed order would also require Edison to pay at least 15 percent of=
=20
what it owes generators.=20
The PUC action is expected to reflect elements of the Edison agreement.=20
The deal removes the threat of legal action against the utility if full=20
payment for power bought since January is made within six months after the=
=20
PUC order becomes final.=20
"I think it's a good, balanced deal for both sides and the only issue will =
be=20
making sure the PUC will adopt the deal," said Jerry Bloom, a spokesman for=
=20
the California Co-generation Council, which represents many small, natural=
=20
gas-fired power generators.=20
Edison officials agreed.=20
"We hope this agreement will help bring stability back to this segment of=
=20
California's energy market," the company said in a statement.=20
The small generators are owed more than $1 billion by bankrupt Pacific Gas =
&=20
Electric and Edison.=20
In March, the PUC ordered the utilities to make payments to the qualifying=
=20
facilities for power delivered in April and beyond. Both utilities began=20
making those payments in mid-April.=20
According to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the=
=20
state's power grid, many small generators have come back online since the=
=20
beginning of May.=20
The ISO said the small generators account for about 5,800 megawatts of=20
potential power. At times earlier in the year, as much as 3,000 megawatts=
=20
have been unavailable to the state. Since May, that number has decreased to=
=20
about 400 megawatts, or what would normally be expected because of mechanic=
al=20
problems or maintenance, according to the ISO.=20
One megawatt is enough to provide power to approximately 750 homes.=20
The agreement with Edison comes the same week the utility persuaded a state=
=20
judge to consolidate about a dozen lawsuits brought against the utility by=
=20
the qualifying facilities.=20
Once a trial judge has been appointed to hear the case, Edison intends to a=
sk=20
that another 15 or 16 other lawsuits be added, according to Barbara Reeves,=
=20
Edison assistant general counsel. The cases remain on hold until then, she=
=20
said.=20
If the PUC acts Wednesday on the Edison deal, those cases could disappear.=
=20
Bloom said that if the PUC decision is not appealed, generators have agreed=
=20
to put their lawsuits on hold for 180 days.=20
"If they pay back what they owe us, the lawsuits would be dismissed and the=
=20
claims would be settled," Bloom said.=20
Those lawsuits have been a growing source of concern for Edison, which has=
=20

In March, a group of qualifying facilities were one day away from filing a=

Expanded power price caps studied=20

Under mounting criticism to ease California's power woes, federal regulator=

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will meet Monday to=20
reconsider its position on California, and an agency official confirmed tha=

the proposal to broaden the controls is on the table.=20
``The worm has turned politically,'' said the commission official, who spok=

on condition of anonymity, adding that ``we're moving toward 24-7 in=20
California'' and the Western region.=20
The proposal, supported by some Republican lawmakers, stops short of the=20
price cap that state Democratic leaders have been pushing for. State=20
officials were encouraged by the talks but remained skeptical.=20
``If they're finally for price relief, hallelujah,'' said Roger Salazar,=20
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. ``But the devil's in the details.''=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has sponsored legislation to force the=

expressed doubts about expanding existing measures.=20
``This sounds good on the face of it, and it may well be,'' Feinstein said.=
=20
``However, this situation is ripe for manipulation.''=20
The federal commission, charged with ensuring just and reasonable wholesale=
=20
power prices, has drawn widespread criticism from Western officials who say=
=20
it has fallen down on the job and allowed electricity prices to soar.=20
In April, the commission rejected pleas for a Western price cap and instead=
=20
approved limited ``mitigation measures'' for California that apply only=20
during power shortages.=20
Those measures, which took effect May 29, base prices on the production cos=

hinted at more flexibility.=20
In addition, Democrats, who generally favor price caps, have taken control =

controls.=20
The idea of extending the commission's April order around the clock and=20
throughout the West has been floating around Washington for weeks. Rep. Dou=
g=20
Ose, R-Woodland, introduced legislation May 23 to do that, but it was=20

his national energy policy: Drill more wells. Build more power plants. Eat=

Want to know why else California has every reason to fear Texas? Here are=
=20
three:=20
First, our greatest fear in Texas is not earthquakes. Here, cheap oil=20
qualifies as a true natural disaster.=20
Historically, our livelihood in Texas has depended on whatever people could=
=20
take out of the ground -- this means oil, natural gas, sulfur and uranium.=
=20
This dependence has put Texas at significant odds with the rest of the=20
country.=20
Remember the last energy crisis when Jimmy Carter was president and the=20
entire East Coast feared the kinds of blackouts that California now fears?=
=20
There was so little compassion for our countrymen back then that all over=
=20
Texas, bumper stickers appeared that said: ``Freeze a Yankee in the Dark.''=
=20
The point is that when Bush says he's a compassionate conservative, you hav=
e=20
to keep in mind that in Midland -- Bush's hometown of choice -- compassion =
is=20
a relative term. It means that Bush II is too nice a guy to tell California=
ns=20
to ``Rot In the Sun,'' but he's not so compassionate that he would do=20
something truly useful -- such as limiting the price of electricity to=20
forestall summer blackouts.=20
Second, Californians should fear Bush and his merry band of Texans because =
in=20
Texas there is no concept whatsoever of the idea of ``public'' land, and ve=
ry=20
little concept of the ``public good.''=20
When Texas entered the nation, it did so as a sovereign nation, not a state=
.=20
What that meant is that Texas got to keep title to all the land that wasn't=
=20
in private hands. The federal government got nothing. The state kept it all=
.=20
And the state sold most of it as quickly as it could to private owners who=
=20
put fences around it and built vast oil and ranching empires.=20
The federal government got almost none of Texas land. What the government h=
as=20
acquired in modern times -- a national park here and there, a few military=
=20
bases -- it has paid good money for.=20
Despite Hollywood's best efforts to portray Texas as a mythic land of=20
romance, Texans have a very unromantic, realistic view of land. Land is to =
be=20
used for making money. Bring in the railroads. Plow the plains. Round up th=
e=20
cattle, and -- above all -- drill for oil so that you don't have to stumble=
=20
around in the dark, like those fuzzy-headed people in California.=20
It's difficult to exaggerate just how much importance Texans place on priva=
te=20
ownership of property. Property owners in Texas can do damn near anything=
=20
they want on their own land. They can pump all of the water they want out o=
f=20
public rivers that run in front of their land. They can -- and do -- shoot=

In Texas there is an obligation to mind your own business -- and let everyo=
ne=20
else mind theirs. If your neighbor has an energy problem, the feeling is th=

your neighbor -- not the federal government -- better find a way to solve i=

Finally, Californians should fear Texas because we sooooo envy you.=20
Who wouldn't envy a state that is synonymous with a dream, where imaginatio=

markets. In a nutshell, the ?ads charge that because the Bonneville Power A=

tracting for more power than ?it generates, the agency is now forced to rai=
se rates so high the aluminum ?industry cannot profitably operate.??It's no=

at some aluminum companies resold their allocation of BPA's cheap ?power to=
 the spot market at an astronomical rate this past summer, pocketing ?milli=
