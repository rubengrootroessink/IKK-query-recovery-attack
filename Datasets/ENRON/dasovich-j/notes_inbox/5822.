THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20

"If you think nobody cares, try missing a couple of payments."=20

The bigger the missed payment, the more they care.? And how we Californians=
=20
care about the potentially biggest missed payment of the Century (Hey, I ca=
n=20
say that now and be telling the truth.).? John Yurkanin, COO of the PX was=
=20
telling me at the end of our phone conversation yesterday, "You know, Gary,=
=20
you might be the only friend I have left anymore."? I informed John that if=
=20
my friendship was so prized, then he was in big trouble.?? A situation like=
=20
that rates 3.4 TPCs (Totally Pathetic Circumstance).? But, hey, John, stick=
=20
with me, don't worry about a thing.? We're going to get through this.=20

Now, let's take an inventory of this week's crises.? There is the electric=
=20
shortage crisis.? We entered the Stage 3 Alert zone Thursday afternoon, and=
=20
early this morning. There is the natural gas pay-as-you-burn crisis.? Most =
of=20
you natural gas sellers have determined that PG&E might not be the secured=
=20
buyer they once were.? There is the cash crisis. Our two major utilities ha=
ve=20
no liquid funds to pay their energy bills.? Mush all three crises together,=
=20
and you get a new word =01( E-gash!? Like our State Motto, Eureka, which me=
ans "=20
I have found it", we can exclaim "E-gash.? I'm Screwed."=20

And everyone is starting to feel some of the pain.? The ESPs, or what remai=
ns=20
of that class of market participants, were informed by PG&E that the paymen=
t=20
of the PX credit for the direct-access customer bills the ESPs are due unde=
r=20
consolidated billing are henceforth suspended.? The rate freeze ended last=
=20
August, so, the logic goes, PG&E doesn't need to acknowledge the PX credit.=
?=20
That puts a serious breach of contract kink in the ESP/Utility relationship=
.?=20
Of course, who is going to write about hundreds of millions of dollars of=
=20
short payments when you can write about billions of dollars of short=20
payments.? I mean, who cares about the financial well being of the remainin=
g=20
competitors to the UDC's.? Let them fold their tent.? California customers=
=20
don't want a choice of energy provider, do they? I don't know.? It's gettin=
g=20
too easy to be cynical.=20

Commissioner Carl Wood also handed out a couple of late Christmas gifts.? H=
e=20
ruled that QFs under Standard Offer Contracts could at most be paid=20
$67.45/MWH, regardless of the SO formula for energy payment.? The QFs have =
to=20
buy winter-time natural gas at market prices, and their production costs ar=
e=20
easily in the range of +$200/MWH. What a great idea.? Force 2,500 MW, or so=
,=20
of remaining SO-QF capacity to voluntarily shut down at a time when that=20
capacity is so desperately needed.=20

I know I have been picking on Mr. Wood a lot.? This week we served on the=
=20
same FM radio talk show, KQED's Forum.? I hate to admit this, but Carl is=
=20
really a nice person.? I don't like disagreeing with people who are basical=
ly=20
decent. That's is why I would rather gently tease people like Mike Florio=
=20
rather than out-and-out disagree with him.?? I figure that deep inside thes=
e=20
misguided souls there is a crossed wire that gives them the wrong answer to=
=20
every major policy question.? Carl and I started talking about good places =
to=20
get corned beef sandwiches as we were leaving the studio, and he was=20
positively effusive about some delicatessens he has frequented in Orange=20
County.? I asked, "Carl, are you Jewish?"? He said yes, that he grew up in =
a=20
Jewish section of Baltimore.? "Carl," I confessed, "you don't look Jewish,=
=20
and you talk like a Communist.? What's your story?"? So we laughed about th=
at=20
and chatted away as he walked to his car at the radio station parking lot,=
=20
and I walked to mine.? I asked him, "Carl, what did you think of that Mark=
=20
Twain quote I used to dance on your 'Deregulation is Dead' statement, when =
I=20
said that rumors of deregulation's death have been greatly exaggerated?"? H=
e=20
replied, "From the moment I uttered those words on the dais of the PUC=20
hearing room, I feared someone was going to tag me with that Twain quote."?=
=20
And it was I.=20

Nettie Hogue was the other panelist on the FM show.? She spoke of the desir=
e=20
for a core/non-core split of the default customers whereby the small=20
customers would be core, and the large customers would be non-core. The UDC=
s=20
would be required to procure for the core, but not for the non-core. The=20
larger customers, who have the ability and the resources could negotiate=20
long-term contracts with suppliers other than the UDC.? If you take her=20
platform, and tweak it a little, you get something that looks very much lik=
e=20
our Morro Bay principle for releasing the greater than 100kW connected load=
=20
customers from UDC default service.=20

There is wrinkle in TURN's plan, however.? They want to keep all the retain=
ed=20
generating assets (e.g., PG&E's hydro plants) for the core procurement=20
portfolio.? I don't think the customers in the non-core group are going to=
=20
like that.? They contributed revenue requirement to those retained plants,=
=20
too.? They will want a credit for their contributions.? On the other hand, =
if=20
PG&E and SCE were to transition to the core/non-core split, you can be=20
assured the Utility Company's will charge both core and non-core classes fo=
r=20
the carried stranded costs (the undercollection of revenue from today's=20
frozen rate debacle).? The saw cuts both ways.=20

Speaking of saws, our Governor simply did one bang up job on the State of t=
he=20
State message last Monday night.? Now that I am a semi-professional talking=
=20
head (Give Us Quote), I was lined up by four news reporters prior to the=20
address to standby with my opinion on the Governor's speech.? I was=20
diplomatic, sort of, to the press.? Let me tell you what I really thought.?=
=20
He stunk up the joint.? I couldn't believe how nervous he was during the=20
delivery. I can understand a few slurred words, or a mispronunciation or=20
two.? But Gray was grim.? As he rock-and-rolled into the guts of his=20
comments, he sounded more and more like Mr. Rogers.? Can you say, "Eminent=
=20
Domain"? He said at the outset that he wasn't going to assign blame or poin=
t=20
fingers.? I was just a little hopeful that he would be conciliatory in tone=
.?=20
Not.? He ranted and raved for forty minutes, half of which was bashing you=
=20
folks for being, well, you folks.? You are selling his power out of State.?=
=20
What is wrong with you people?? Portland based Avista's Linda Hamilton wrot=
e=20

?=20
Somehow I have yet to put together how he intends to solve the problem ".? =
We=20

Okay, E-gash heads.? Let's get it on.=20

?@@@=20

Things in the People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ PX has Writ all over it=20

The California PX did something that SCE couldn't do last week.? That is,=
=20
they got a federal court to take notice on a Writ for a stay on aspects of=
=20
FERC's December 15 Order.? The Writ asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal=
s=20
to:=20
? 1) Stay the FERC Order's prohibition against the IOU's selling into the=
=20
PX.? Make such sales voluntary, rather than mandatory.=20

2) Stay the April 30 termination of the PX's CTS rate schedule because a=20
termination halts forward long-term trading in the PX's block forward marke=
t=20
for contract deliveries that extend beyond April 30, and=20

3) Stay the requirement that the PX implement the $150 breakpoint.


The WPTF Board deliberated on whether or not the group should support the P=
X=20
in their petition.? The discussion was lengthy, and the vote took several=
=20
days of e-mail correspondence between Directors.? Yesterday, the Board=20
approved it's support and filed such with the Court, all parties, and FERC.=
=20

At the same time, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals acted to set the=20
question of whether it should grant a writ of mandamus to the PX and a stay=
=20
of the December 15th order. The Ninth Circuit set the matter for oral=20
argument on Wednesday, February 7,2001, at 3:00p.m. in Pasadena. Each side=
=20
will be allowed 20 minutes to present their argument. The three issues to b=
e=20
argued are the issues raised by the PX in its motion for rehearing and stay=
.=20

Good luck, gang.=20

Things in the People's Republic of California=20
?@@@ What are they doing in DC?=20

This segment of the Burrito should be hilarious.? I will attempt to describ=
e=20
what I think is happening at the negotiations in Washington D.C. between th=
e=20
utilities, our generator and power marketing members, and the State.? The=
=20
reason this will be laughable is that I don't have a clue what those people=
=20
are doing, nor does the press.? Some press people have called me to see if =
I=20
know.? That is a sure sign they are raking the bottom of the barrel.? Plus,=
=20
when you folks in D.C. read this, you will mutter, "It didn't happen that=
=20
way, at all."=20

But, without hard evidence, the best thing to do is make it up as you go=20
along.? Hey, it works for the PUC.=20

There are several issues on the table.? In the general area of deferred=20
payments, and the like, I think there is general agreement that something c=
an=20
be worked out.? I bet that was concluded early on in the discussions.?=20
However, I believe the sticking point in the negotiations is the long-term=
=20
forward contract prices. The State wants to "look tough" and get a 5? to 6?
/kWh price.? The sellers need a lot of back-end revenue recovery and securi=
ty=20
to provide such.? Contract length of a decade or more may be required.? But=
=20
more difficult than contract term are the payment safeguards required on th=
e=20
part of the buyers to secure a lengthy contract.? How will the sellers hold=
=20
the buyer's feet to the fire, forcing the buyers to pay the contract price=
=20
when future spot prices are well below the contract price?? Will the State=
=20
guarantee "no regulatory out"?? No State agency, much less the Governor's=
=20
office could make assurances that bind future administrations.? So how can=
=20
the sellers be sure they will be paid during the out years when the contrac=
ts=20
are attractive to the sellers, and less attractive to the buyers.=20

Banks will not finance deals, especially multi-billion dollar undertakings,=
=20
if there is a regulatory out clause in the contracts.? That clause, alone,=
=20
could make the contracts worthless.=20

The clock is ticking, too.? The Bush team is set to move into the White Hou=
se=20
in ten days, and in preparation for the new FERC, Chairman Hoecker announce=
d=20
his resignation effective January 18.? The Chairman, despite the faults we=
=20
may assign to him, did one hell of a stand up job during his tenure.? I thi=
nk=20
his greatest failure led to his greatest success.? He failed when he=20
negotiated with the ISO and the State of California to allow the State some=
=20
role in the governance of the ISO and the PX, vis a vis SB96.? That was a=
=20
regrettable slip for which we are still paying the consequences.? Hoecker's=
=20
greatest moment was his fierce opposition to the barrage of political=20
pressure from California politicians to solve California's problems with a=
=20
regional price cap.? I never thought he would stand up to that kind of=20
pressure.=20

Back to our folks in DC.? If I were one of them, I would let the utilities=
=20
talk their hearts out about the need for reasonable long-term contract=20
prices.? I would then show them the security I would need to provide those=
=20
"reasonable" prices without me taking on any incremental risk.? The utiliti=
es=20
would tell me they are unable to provide the necessary assurances, and I=20
would sit back and say to them, "Okay, let's talk about a higher average=20
price."? And around, and around it would go.? Time is on our side.? The new=
=20
federal administration will be more sympathetic to my goals of competition=
=20
and deregulation.? So why not wait?? If the contract talks fail, then whose=
=20
fault would that be?=20

Here is my advice to you folks freezing in the Nation's Capital.? SIGN=20
NOTHING. Help the utilities with deferred payment schedules, but hold the=
=20
line on the long-term forward price until the buyers, and the buyers'=20
regulatory agencies get realistic.=20

Things in the People's Republic of California=20

We also issue a companion award for the longest coffee order at Starbucks.=

Okay, I'm not making this one up.? The Chief Legal Counsel for the Californ=

Letters=20

A letter from APX's Jack Ellis who is based in London, and soon to return t=
o=20
the Bay Area for more than just a week's visit, sent me the following:=20

"There's so much being written about this whole situation that it is=20
impossible for a mere mortal to read it all every day.? California has turn=

from a mess into a disaster, which raises an interesting question.

"The Governor and Commissioner Wood, among others, have made very strong=20

obvious to you why the Dark Ages lasted 500 years.=20

The next letter is from BPA's Don Wolfe who asks the philosopher's stone=20
question, "Why?" He says,=20

"Concerning the CPUC proposed criteria for forward procurement, you specula=
te=20
that they are confusing physical hedging with physical delivery.? Although =
I=20
don't claim to have mastered the nuances of hedging versus delivery, my=20
impression was that their goal was less technical: that is, to eliminate th=
e=20
traders and any intermediate transactions, likely based on the belief that=

prices are marked up as power changes hands.? The result is de facto=20
re-regulation, with suppliers and loads bound to one another in long-term=
=20
forward contracts (with prices subject to close scrutiny and approval),=20
leaving only a residual near-term and real-time markets.? When that's done,=
=20
what sort of competitive market is there?"

From an anonymous friend, I received this critique of my style.? The author=
=20
said,=20

"I'm sorry Gary, but your Gou Jing and Speedy Bailout analogy is just too=
=20
damn one-sided.? The generators are gouging in a very imabalanced market, a=
nd=20
you're pretty much saying that the utilities should bear the brunt of the=
=20
failure of the market.? What viable business ever made a deal to absorb the=
=20
cost when prices got out of whack?? Why shouldn't the consumers pay the=20
"fair" market price for the electricity they're consuming?? If the price=20
isn't fair, and they don't want to pay it, why not use less energy?? It is =
a=20
commodity, for chrissakes!!!? I just turn off the lights when I think my bi=

accept, the State of California actually needs [the utilities] to transmit=
=20
and distribute electricity...do you know any other entity with the means to=
=20
keeps your lights on?"=20

Well, yes and no.? Any transmission operator can do the same job regardless=
=20
of the location and type of physical assets. One can buy that kind of=20
expertise in the labor market.? As to market failures, and such, I suppose=
=20
this letter demonstrates that there is a deep hurt, or emotional wrench, fr=

being on the wrong side of an unhedged bet.? I know I would feel the same w=

if the decision were mine to hedge against the downside.? If I didn't, and=

risk, pick positions, and relentlessly pursue opportunities.? Sorry. I thin=

the anger directed toward the generators and power marketers is totally=20
misplaced.=20

Finally, Phil Muller of SDC Energy responded to last week's anonymous=20
ruminations about those greedy power marketers.? Here is what Phil said:=20

"As I look back on this week's burrito and in particular the anonymous=20
critique of high prices, I can't help but working on these analogies a bit =
to=20
add in some forgotten reality.=20

Let's start with the cattle business analogy. This is exactly the way cattl=
e=20
producers run their businesses. Let's say the rancher actually grazes his=
=20
cattle on government range land at low cost which allows him to raise many=
=20
head of cheap cattle that is sold to McDonalds to make Big Macs.? The price=
=20
that McDonalds is willing to pay for his beef has not gone up (he doesn't g=
et=20
to set the price for his product, remember) in fact it is at a low level=20
because people are eating fewer big macs.? The reason that hay is worth $80=
=20
per bale is that there's a shortage of hay and ranchers who are raising pri=
me=20
beef for Morton's or breeding stock or thoroughbred race horses are willing=
=20
to pay that much because of the value of their livestock.? By selling his h=
ay=20
for $80, Old McDonald is making it possible for more valuable animals to be=
=20
fed rather than "wasting" hay to feed scrawny cattle that no one wants to=
=20
buy.? The fact that he's idling his land and equipment means that he might=
=20
have the time and money to invest some of his "excess profits" in upgrading=
=20
his ranch to maybe allow him to grow more beeves more efficiently in the=20
future.? This is a damned good way to run a business.

"The gas station example is another good one.? In this case a monopoly sell=
er=20
uses his market power to achieve the maximum possible return.? Just suppose=
=20
this actually happened.? What would you do if you pulled into a gas station=
=20
and were told that you'd be charged $200/gallon for gas because your tank w=
as=20
empty?? If it were a matter of life or death you might buy as little as=20
possible to get you to the next gas station.? Otherwise you might call AAA =
or=20
someone to come to your rescue and deliver enough gas to get you out of=20
there.? Or you might just leave your car there and hitch a ride to the next=
=20
gas station.? If this gas station owner were able to pull this off with any=
=20
frequency, however, you might decide to get into the gas business yourself=
=20
and open a station nearby to provide gas at slightly lower prices.? We all=
=20
know what happens then - competition.=20

"Finally, moving to the airline analogy - going from the bottom and working=
=20
up - is exactly what happens in the electricity market.? If you have demand=

responsiveness, the first consumers to stop using are those unwilling to pa=
