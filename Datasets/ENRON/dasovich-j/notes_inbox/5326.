Exclusive Deal from Down Under 
Great Wines 
A Tale of two Australias 
Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines 


Exclusive Deal from Down Under

This week www.wine.com travels to the Southern Hemisphere, where 
some of the world's most attractive wines are now being made. As 
evidence, we're offering newsletter subscribers a special deal on a 
dynamite pair of reds from Tapestry, an Australian label that we 
represent exclusively in the United States. 

Before we tasted Tapestry's 1998 bottlings, we'd only heard rumors 
about this unusual vintage Down Under - a rare confluence of warm 
ripening conditions with a long growing season that conferred great 
depth of character. As soon as we sampled the Bin 338 Shiraz and Bin 
388 Cabernet Sauvignon, we realized the talk was true. Both wines are 
profoundly complex, but also deliriously enjoyable because of their 
rich, fat, berry fruit. They're classic examples of serious wines 
that are delicious now but will also improve for years to come. 

Eventually, Wine & Spirits magazine caught on, awarding both of these 
beauties 90+ scores. That made us feel rather cagey, since we'd 
already imported them and own their American rights. Australian wines 
of this caliber commonly command prices around $50, but we're able to 
offer these to you for less than half that. Just our way of saying, 
"Good on ya."

wines, visit our website: www.wine.com.

A Tale of Two Australias

Among wine enthusiasts, it's now a commonly held belief that the 
world's most exciting region is Australia. Why? A constellation of 
factors including old vines, new technology, and, not 
insignificantly, the famous Australian mindset, which is 
straightforward, unpretentious, and fun loving. 

"Australians aren't wine snobs," observes wine.com senior merchant 
Jeff Prather. "They're down to earth. They have a European heritage, 
but they started their own culture, which didn't kowtow to tradition. 
American wine lovers have always seemed to think that they had to 
emulate Europe." 

Vibrant wine culture
Interestingly in that light, Australia has the highest per-capita 
wine consumption in the English-speaking world. It covers about the 
same amount of surface area as the United States, but has only 6 
percent of the population. 

"Australians have huge amounts of arable land, but they don't have 
the population base to tend it," says wine.com merchant Bo Thompson. 
"As a result, they've had to learn to practice winemaking through 
technology." From computerized 70,000-gallon tanks to state-of-the- 
art refrigeration to horizontal "rotofermenters" that punch down 
grapes automatically, Australia is the world's trendsetter in 
winemaking technology. 

In addition to enabling the industry to get its work done, this 
gadgetry has developed with an eye to serving the national palate. 
Its enthusiasms can be described in three words: fruit, fruit, 
and fruit. The trademark Australian wine style is big, ripe, and 
extracted, emphasizing the flavor -- and power -- of the grape 
above all. 

Advanced yet artisanal
Curiously, this is consistent with another important though seemingly 
opposite trend in the Aussie revolution: the renaissance of Old World 
artisanal winemaking, a decidedly low-tech approach that focuses on 
ancient vines, some dating to the 19th century. 

"[The Australian artisanal approach] has everything to do with what's 
going on in the vineyard," says Thompson. "The recent generation has 
drastically improved its vineyard techniques through different types 
of trellising and experimentation with irrigation and dry farming. 
They're bringing back a lot of old vines that had been left to the 
wild - for example, d'Arenberg's Dead Arm Shiraz is made from vines 
that have been half-killed by disease -- divided right down the 
middle. But the fruit extraction they're getting is amazing." 

"If you name the greatest wines in Australia," says Prather, you'd 
have to include d'Arenberg, Penfolds Grange, Clarendon Hills, 
Elderton, and Henschke Hill of Grace.... A lot of them are old-vine 
fanatics, and for that you have to pay a price -- those wines are 
expensive. But the other gift that Australia gives the world is 
oceans of really good wine that doesn't pretend to be great. Wineries 
like Rosemount, Penfolds, Punters Corner, and Yering Station produce 
gigantic amounts of bargain-priced wines with consistently terrific 
flavor. So what you've got, really, is a tale of two continents: a 
tiny amount of great artisanal wines and gigantic amounts of 
friendly, quaffable wines." 

What they all have in common, Prather sums up, is that "they're flat- 
out delicious. Australians have hit the sweet spot of the modern 
palate: wines with consistently ripe and juicy flavors due to their 
warm climate, but with really friendly textures that aren't overly 
tannic, astringent, or acidic. In the contemporary wine business, 
that is a sure-fire formula for success."

Wine Team Picks: Julian Davies on Sainted Brothers Wines

It's widely known that yesterday, February 14, was St. Valentine's 
Day. But now that you're finished pandering to the candyman, can you 
name the saints who are honored today? 

I thought as much. February 15 is a day that commemorates St. 
Faustinus and St. Jovita. Born in northern Italy in the second 
century, this pair of brothers preached the word with such fervor 
that they enraged a heathen lord named Julian (no relation), who 
ordered them arrested and tortured. Ultimately Emperor Hadrian had 
them beheaded. 

A modern analogue of Faustinus and Jovita might be Ethan and Joel 
Coen, a pair of steadfast siblings who have maintained their filmic 
faith despite ceaseless heathen persecution -- the most recent result 
being their movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" Hence, herewith, in 
observance of St. Faustinus and St. Jovita Day, five wines paired 
with five films from St. Ethan and St. Joel. 

1999 Torres Sangre de Toro, Catalonia, Spain
"Blood Simple" 

1997 Bouchard Beaune Premier Cru Les Greves Vigne de l'Enfant Jesus, 
Burgundy, France
"Raising Arizona" 

1999 Backsberg Pinotage, Paarl, South Africa
"Miller's Crossing" 

1997 Ch. Leoville-Barton St. Julien, Bordeaux, France
"Barton Fink" 

1995 Pieve di Santa Restituta Brunello di Montalcino Sugarille 
(1.5 L), Tuscany, Italy
"The Hudsucker Proxy"
