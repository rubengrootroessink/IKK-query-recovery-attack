I just wanted to let you know that starting on September 5th, CEA's phones
will be answered by an automatic system.  This is being done so that we can
free up Carin to focus more on office management and client services.  As a
result, when you dial the CEA number (415-421-4213) you will hear a recorded
message asking you to enter the three digit extension of the person you are
trying to reach.  If you do not know the extension, you can select an option
that puts you into the company directory.  If you know the extension, you
can enter the three digits as soon as you hear the voice from the automated
system (i.e., you don't have to wait).  For your information, here are the
three digit extensions for everyone at CEA:

Carin D'Oliva - 101
Kirk Marckwald - 102
Peter Okurowski - 103
Darcy Whaley - 104
Andreas Merkl - 105
Tisha Mercado - 107
Darcy Wheeles - 109
John Claussen - 110
Jill Kaufman Johnson - 113
Lauren Johnson - 114
