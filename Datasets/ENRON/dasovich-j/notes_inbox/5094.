Subject: New York Demand Response Programs

Attached is an excellent summary of the various demand response programs 
developed over the past few months and being implemented in New York by the 
ISO, the PSC and the Energy Research and Development Authority. The summary 
was prepared by our Price Responsive Load Coalition Exec Director and 
recently presented at the NARUC Winter Committee Meeting. The incentive 
program referred to on Slide 7 was formally approved at the ISO's Management 
Committee meeting on March 1. It has already been approved by the ISO Board.

Rick, I thought you might want to forward this on to the California team 
since it may provide some useful ideas for programs that could be put in 
place for this summer if not already under consideration.

		 Subject: PRLC: NARUC Presentation & RSVPs for PSC Meeting


Greetings All,

I had an excellent opportunity today to give a presentation at the NARUC
Winter Committee meeting during a session addressing demand response
issues. Gotta love Southwest Air as well, travel to/from Albany and BWI
combined with MARC train into Union Station all for less than $200, Best
of all, I booked it two days ago.....;-)

The presentation was well received and people were very impressed with
our progress here in New York. A copy is attached. Please give me any
comments or corrections you might have. We will probably be using this
PowerPoint show alot in the future.

Next issue.

Current PSC Meeting Attendees:

Ruben Brown, E3
Stephen Wemple, ConEd Solutions
Larry Sutkowski, Electrotek
Bill Conway, Metrogen
Larry Dewitt, Pace

We have room for a couple more people, three at most. I'd like to
finalize the list by COB tomorrow so I can get back to Maureen's office.

Aaron
