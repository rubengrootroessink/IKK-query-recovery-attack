We will be discussing (among other things) a number of issues:

generation.
-The decision and risk analytical model for RTP, developed by Doug Charlton,
Joe Desmond, and Justin.
-Rate increases to prop up the utilities.
-An update on air regulations for backup generators.

A detailed meeting agenda will follow shortly.  RSVP as soon as possible.
We look forward to seeing you all Wednesday.
