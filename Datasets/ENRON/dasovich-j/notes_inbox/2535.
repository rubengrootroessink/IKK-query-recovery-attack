Our last weekly call before the new year will be Monday, December 18.  The 
following items are on the agenda:

Update on our state licensing strategy
2001 outside services and training budget
2001 EBS Government Affairs meetings
Request for information from the Telecom Hedge Fund
Trade publications that are available to our group
EBS GA database
Identifying terms and concepts you want to know more about
Inaugural events (since it is looking like there will be an inauguration)

Please let me know if there's anything else I should put on the agenda.

Also, I'm attaching (1) a copy of the slides Kevin Hannon and Ken Rice used 
at the EBS All-Employee meetings last week, and (2) a list of the types of 
information the people at the telecom hedge fund are requesting.

Finally, in case any of you have extra reading time these days, a great book 
is Tele-Revolution: Telephone Competition at the Speed of Light by Richard 
Tomlinson.   It's a great description of the technical, business and 
regulatory developments leading up to competition in the local loop, and, in 
the words of Lisa Yoho, is "a real page-turner."  (Although I wouldn't 
necessarily recommend it as a last minute gift idea for friends and family).  
It's available from Amazon.com.
