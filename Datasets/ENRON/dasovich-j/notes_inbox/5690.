Proposed pricing mechanism:

Dow Jones Electricity Indexes, specifically their NP15/SP15 indexes.
- the indexes are based on weighted average prices and total volumes
- they measure "bilateral one-day prescheduled, financially firm transactions"
=> therefore the Dow Jones Index more accurately reflects market pricing
- Dow Jones has the right to randomly audit the data providers

why not the ex-post ISO?
- generators are not selling to California's ISO because of the $150/MWh 
price cap,
=> therefore prices coming out of the ISO do not reflect real market prices
- if generators are not selling into the market, there is no liquidity, 
therefore prices are not reflective of the prices that buyers must pay

why not use the ex-post ISO price on an interim basis?
- because putting a false cap on the market price will result in price 
increases to DA customers, contrary to AB1890, without due process
- Decision 99-06-058 set the foundation for the PX credit to reflect real 
market prices, PG&E's proposal does not adhere to this.
