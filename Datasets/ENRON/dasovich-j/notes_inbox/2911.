Of The Examiner Staff=20
Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov. Gray Davis'=

plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with=
=20
one of their own.=20
The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San=
=20
Diego-area utility, and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase=
=20
PG&E lines through bankruptcy proceedings.=20
And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his=
=20
own transmission line deal.=20
A week ago, Davis finally found a term-limited senator, Richard Polanco,=20
D-Los Angeles, to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso=
n=20
lines. Now, the governor's office admits that talks will not proceed until=
=20
the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edison's lines=
.=20
Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi=
s=20
plan, giving the state a five-year option to purchase all power lines for=
=20
$1.2 billion. While a much lower price, the bill would also lower Edison's=
=20
debt by forcing power marketers to accept 75 percent of the $3.5 billion ow=
ed=20
them.=20
Under the terms of that proposal, the state would still have to loan Edison=
=20
money -- around $1 billion -- and would guarantee SoCal Edison's sale of a=
=20
further $2 billion in bonds. The state would also receive a conservation=20
easement on 21,000 acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land.=20
As in the Davis bill, SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively low-cost=
=20
electricity for 10 years from one of its power plants, and force parent=20
company Edison International to repay $400 million in transfers.=20
A Republican plan labeled "Plan R" now making its way through the halls of=
=20
the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister, except it allows the=
=20
state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build.=20
The Democratic bill's sponsors, Assemblymen John Dutra, D-Fremont; Joe=20
Nation, D-San Rafael; and Joe Canciamilla, D-Pittsburg; believe they can=20
persuade Edison's board of directors to approve their deal, even though it =
is=20
not as attractive as the governor's offer. Edison refused to comment on the=
=20
plan.=20
Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge, were trying a=
=20
different strategy Wednesday. The minority party's "Plan R" has not been=20
introduced as official legislation, but instead floated among Republicans a=
nd=20
Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction.=20
Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edison's only real alternative =
to=20
bankruptcy, and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern=20
neighbor, PG&E, in bankruptcy.=20
So far, Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators=20
charging high wholesale prices. PG&E declared bankruptcy April 6.=20
A governor's office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all=
=20
attention away from any deal-making, but that the two sides continued to me=
et=20
frequently.=20
Another adviser, Joe Fichera, said "there are lots of moving parts" to the=
=20
deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electric's transmission lines, bu=
t=20
that he continued to meet with company representatives, including an all-da=
y=20
meeting Monday. In San Diego, a spokesman for SDG&E referred all calls to t=
he=20
governor's office.=20
But the sponsor of the Davis bill, Polanco, is not one of the legislature's=
=20
power brokers, and most lawmakers said the $2.76 billion memorandum of=20
understanding is now in serious jeopardy.=20
A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos, including the threat of an=
=20
increase in blackouts. The governor and business leaders have said the=20
economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages=20
rises.=20
Legislators, policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne=
ed=20
and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the=

state, especially if the bulk of them -- now owned by Pacific Gas and=20

Critics such as Senate President John Burton, D-San Francisco, one of the=

For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn
By Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver Teichert
Bee Staff Writers
(Published May 25, 2001)=20
As summer slouches toward Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve=
=20
electricity, doctors and advocates for the elderly are sounding a=20
counter-theme.=20
Heat can kill. And most often, it kills seniors.=20
Year after year, heat waves around the United States are deadlier than=20
hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to the National=
=20
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.=20
In California, a single Los Angeles heat wave killed more than twice as man=
y=20
people as the 1906 San Francisco quake, according to research assembled by=
=20
the state Energy Commission.=20
And national weather disaster statistics show that more than two-thirds of=
=20
those felled by the heat in recent years were age 60 or older.=20
"Heat and the elderly are not a good combination," said Dr. Cheryl Phillips=
,=20
a Sutter Medical Group geriatrician. "It's a real concern this year."=20
As people age, their bodies begin to lose the ability to sense when they ar=
e=20
thirsty or to bounce back quickly from dehydration, she said.=20
The very people who are most vulnerable to heat also often have a tradition=
=20
of thrift and public spiritedness that might lead them to use less=20
electricity than is safe, doctors and energy officials fear.=20
"Their conservation ethic was from the '40s and '50s, when we didn't have a=
ir=20
conditioning as prevalent as we do now, and they were much younger. So they=
=20
probably feel like, 'I can do this, this is important,' and they're not=20
recognizing the change in their body," said Claudia Chandler of the Energy=
=20
Commission.=20
The California Department of Aging is concerned enough that it will soon=20
begin a special outreach to warn seniors about the dangers of hot=20
temperatures, especially when air conditioning may be low or turned off=20
because of high utility bills.=20
In a public education campaign aimed at the 3.6 million Californians who ar=
e=20
65 or older, officials will preach conservation, preparedness for outages a=
nd=20
the need for drinking eight glasses of water each day.=20
Relatively simple steps can keep people safe -- if they are alert to the=20
danger.=20
Some are as obvious as staying out of the sun and moving less on the hottes=
t=20
days.=20
Others are more arcane. People of all ages need to be aware that certain=20
medications, including some anti-depressants and diuretics, can increase=20
their sensitivity to heat. So can too much alcohol, too much weight, heart=
=20
disease and other illnesses.=20
Allergies and heart problems underscore Margueritte Ranney's juggling act. =
At=20
72, she has already had to refinance her house to keep up with rising bills=
=20
on a fixed income. She does her laundry with cold water, shuts off unneeded=
=20
appliances and opens the door each morning to cool her home.=20
But when the day's heat builds, Ranney faces a stark choice. It's "very, ve=
ry=20
rough," she said -- but she puts her health first. She closes up her=20
two-bedroom home and turns on her evaporative cooler.=20
"If I had to turn off my cooler it would be pretty bad," she said. "If I ha=
ve=20
to turn it off I have problems."=20
People who want to cut back on air conditioning while still protecting thei=
r=20
health should use portable fans at home, spray themselves with small mister=
s,=20
and take "cool breaks" to an air conditioned movie theater or store.=20
And seniors, especially, should "drink lots of water. Don't wait until you'=
re=20
thirsty. Drink constantly on hot days," said Phillips.=20
Two heat-moderating mechanisms weaken with age, she said, and doctors still=
=20
don't understand precisely why.=20
In some ways, the human body is like a glass of salty water. Sweat makes th=
e=20
water level drop and the salt level rise, and in young people two hormones =
--=20
aldosterone and angiotensin -- kick in to restore the balance.=20
Those hormones are "the ones that signal to the brain, 'dang I'm thirsty,' =
"=20
said Phillips. They also tell the kidneys to hold onto water.=20
But as people age, their sensitivity to both hormones declines, making it=

Davis Orders 3-Tiered Warnings of Blackouts=20


By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????SACRAMENTO--In a significant policy change aimed at minimizing busines=
s=20
and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday =
to=20
enact a three-tier blackout warning system.
?????Forecasts of blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said.=
=20
General areas will be identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely=
=20
outages. Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu=
t,=20
he said.=20
?????Business executives, police and consumers have complained that the=20
current warning system--in which blackouts can come with less than 10=20
minutes' warning--does not give them sufficient time to save information on=
=20
computers, shut down assembly lines, safeguard traffic intersections and=20
otherwise prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out.
?????In the past, state grid operators only gave short notice because they=
=20
often found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts. They said=
=20
they did not want to repeatedly alarm people. Utility officials have said=
=20
they feared that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to=20
looters and burglars.
?????But crime has not been a problem during California's six days of=20
blackouts so far this year. And with experts predicting dozens of days of=
=20
forced outages this summer, state and utility leaders say Californians are=
=20
better off prepared.
?????"If blackouts are going to occur," Davis said, "there is no reason to=
=20
keep the public in the dark. We all deserve as much advance notice as=20
possible."
?????Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio=
=20
and television announcements. Starting with June utility bills, Southern=20
California Edison customers will be given "block" numbers that allow them t=
o=20
learn through the Edison Web site, www.sce.com, if they are scheduled for=
=20
rotating blackouts on days of short supply.
?????Under the governor's order, Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said,=20
consumers can expect 24-hour warnings about general areas--Santa Monica or=
=20
Santa Ana, for example--that might be targeted for hourlong blackouts.
?????At 60 minutes before a blackout is triggered, Bennett said, the warnin=
gs=20
delivered through radio, television and the Internet will get much more=20
precise. "For example," he said, "One hour before, we'll say Main Street in=
=20
Santa Monica . . . will be affected."
?????Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be=
=20
triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governor's order by June=
=20
15. And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear =
of=20
blackout warnings, they said, the governor's order will ultimately help the=
=20
state avoid blackouts.
?????"I think we're going to save power, potentially lives; we're going to=

help save jobs and California's economy," said Carl Guardino, a member of t=

board that oversees the California Independent System Operator, which manag=

?????Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law=20
enforcement officials, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, who=
=20
said he intends to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today.=20
?????For some, the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the=

PUC to Reassess Rate Hikes=20
Energy: State regulators vote to reexamine baselines used to determine how=
=20
much customers will pay for power. Consumers say allotments are too low.=20

By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer=20

?????SAN FRANCISCO--Nine days after structuring the largest electricity rat=
e=20
increase in California history, state regulators on Thursday launched a=20
reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine how much each=20
residential customer will pay.
?????If the indicators are revised upward, as most expect, that would grant=
=20
some customers relief from the rate hike but could necessitate future ones =
to=20
generate enough revenue for power purchases.
?????The energy crisis put the esoteric term "baseline" on the minds of=20
millions of utility customers. During recent hearings on a $5.7-billion rat=
e=20
increase, the California Public Utilities Commission heard a chorus of=20
complaints from consumers who said their baseline was unrealistically low,=
=20
exposing them unfairly to the rate hike.
?????"The most visible and controversial issue, other than the overall=20
increase ordered, was the methodology used to spread the increased revenue=
=20
requirement to residential customers," the PUC said in voting unanimously t=
o=20
reassess baselines.
?????On March 27, the PUC approved rate increases for Southern California=
=20
Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. but exempted people in a low-income=
=20
program and customers consuming less than 130% of their baseline, which is=
=20
50% to 60% of average residential usage, with allowances for climate and=20
season. But other customers will pay more, depending on how much their=20
consumption exceeds the baseline.
?????Reassessment of the baselines, commissioners said, will not be complet=
ed=20
for the summer, when new rate hikes go into full swing, but it could be don=
e=20
by winter. Public hearings are scheduled for July.
?????Several commissioners acknowledged that an upward adjustment in=20
baselines would bring in less money from utility customers and could create=
 a=20
funding shortfall for future power purchases.
?????"There is no question [the baseline] is out of whack," Commissioner=20
Richard Bilas said later. "But if the revenue base falls, where do you get=
=20
the money? Another rate increase. This is the problem."
?????Thousands of consumers contacted the PUC about the last rate increase=
=20
and hundreds complained about difficulty in achieving their baseline=20
allotments, even when they worked hard to conserve.
?????Baselines have been used to chart utility bills for the past=20
quarter-century, and they are periodically updated.
?????The levels vary by area and utility. They are not adjusted by househol=
d=20
size. And, critics say, they do not accurately reflect power needs of homes=
=20
with computers, VCRs and microwaves.
?????"We heard lots of customers complain it's not fair," said Mindy Spatt,=
=20
spokeswoman for Toward Utility Rate Reform. "For example, if you have lots =
of=20
children who do not contribute income but use electricity, you could be at =
a=20
disadvantage."
?????Living below baseline may not be easy for many. Spatt, whose baseline=
=20
for her San Francisco home is 258 kilowatt hours, goes so far as to dry her=
=20
laundry on a clothesline, but was slightly above 130% of baseline in March.
?????Bilas' home in Mendocino County has a baseline of about 280 kilowatt=
=20
hours and he says he consumes more than 500. "I don't know how anyone can=
=20
live on the baseline," he said. But he added, "I have a hot tub I can turn=
=20
off."

An air of discontent over diesel backups=20

Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that he may ask companies to run their=20
emergency generators during Stage 3 electricity alerts as a way to stave of=
f=20
blackouts. And when blackouts do occur, thousands of tractor-trailer-size=
=20
generators will whir to life, powering elevators and lights, hospital=20
equipment, even assembly lines.=20
But that prospect has created major concerns. Most of those industrial-=20
strength generators run on diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because the=
y=20
were intended for emergency use, generators have escaped most environmental=
=20
regulations. What's more, they are likely to be called into service on the=
=20
hottest, smoggiest days of the year.=20
"We think our air quality will be significantly worse this summer because o=
f=20
diesel generators and peaker plants," said Dan Jacobson, a legislative=20
advocate with the California Public Interest Research Group in Sacramento.=
=20
Identified as a toxic air contaminant by the state, diesel fuel spews out=
=20
nitrogen oxides, which cause smog and acid rain. It also emits particulate=
=20
matter -- tiny soot and dust particles that can lodge in the lungs and may=
=20
increase cancer risk.=20
Diesel generators produce as much as five times more pollution per megawatt=
=20
hour of operation than even the oldest, dirtiest coal-fired power plants,=
=20
according to the California Air Resources Board. They are 600 times as=20
polluting as modern gas-powered plants.=20
Practically every hospital, large office building and apartment complex has=
 a=20
diesel generator standing by on the roof or parking lot, in basements and=
=20
boiler rooms.=20
The air board estimates there are 11,000 diesel generators in California,=
=20
which produce an average of 373 kilowatts, enough to power essential=20
functions for a sizable building. But the number is probably much higher=20
because businesses have stampeded to acquire generators over the past few=
=20
months.=20
"Generators operate in an urban setting, close to where people work and=20
live," said Kenneth Lim, supervising air quality engineer for the Bay Area=
=20
Air Quality District. "If there were widespread rolling blackouts, and thes=
e=20
engines fired up all at the same time, the impact could be very significant=
."=20
INCREASED CANCER RISK
The California Air Resources Board said that operating a one-megawatt diese=
l=20
engine for 250 hours per year "would increase cancer risk to nearby residen=
ts=20
(within one city block) by 250 in a million" -- 50 percent more than the=20

=20

Diesel generators largely avoided air-control laws because regulators assum=
ed=20
they would be used only in case of an earthquake or other once-in-a-=20
blue-moon catastrophe.=20
Stage 3 alerts and blackouts are likely to be everyday occurrences this=20
summer. Predictions range from 260 hours to as high as 1,100 hours of=20
blackouts.=20
Most blackouts and Stage 3 alerts will occur on hot days when air quality i=
s=20
already poor.=20
"Our worst-case scenario would be if we get into a two-, three- or four-day=
=20
episode where it's really hot and really stagnant," said Lucia Libretti,=20
spokeswoman for the air quality district.=20
"It's bad enough smogwise on those days, but when you add these dirty diese=
l=20
backup generators to that mix, it's not going to be a pretty sight."=20
This summer's predicted blackouts have brought a surge of business for=20
generator companies.=20
GENERATING FAST SALES
Caterpillar Inc., the leading manufacturer of big generators, said it has=
=20
sold and rented more than 900 megawatts of portable power on the West Coast=
=20
so far this year, enough to power almost 1 million homes. That's seven time=
s=20
as much backup power as Caterpillar provided to the region last year. The=
=20
customers include factories, data centers, banks, utility substations and=
=20
planned communities.=20
"Everyone in the state is now claiming that they need a backup generator,"=
=20
said CalPIRG lobbyist Jacobson. "It's not just the hospitals; every busines=
s=20
says they need a backup; the rich people who live in Beverly Hills say they=
=20
need it. The door is open and everyone is trying to get one."=20
Small backup generators sold at Costco and Kmart that provide enough power=
=20
for, say, a TV, some lights and a blender run on gasoline, which emits fewe=

pollutants than diesel.=20
But most business, commercial and agricultural users turn to diesel engines=
,=20
which can handle heavier loads, kick on in 10 seconds and provide a steady=

stream of power.=20
One positive about the rush to get new generators is that they pollute less=

than older models.=20

Currently, only people who know which Pacific Gas and Electric Co. block th=

"If blackouts are going to occur, there's no reason to keep the public in t=

"For several months, we've been looking at ways to improve our customer=20

Businesses and consumers favor greater warning of impending blackouts. The=

Democratic governor said such warnings would also allow law enforcement mor=

Within an hour of Davis' announcement, the California Independent System=20

The electricity supply-demand equation is simple: Match supply to demand an=
d=20
things are dandy. Demand overwhelms supply: build more supply.

Throughout the country, but particularly in California, there is no questio=
n=20
more supply is mandated=01*NIMBY (not in my backyard) be hanged. But what a=
bout=20
the demand side of the issue? What about getting customers involved in the=
=20
solution by allowing them to sell their excess power back into the system?=
=20

'Negawatts' nothing new
Granted, the concept of negawatts is nothing new; it was coined roughly a=
=20
quarter-century ago by the founder of the Boulder-based consulting firm E=
=20
Source: Amory Lovins. Many utilities today use customer curtailment to get=
=20
them through wattage rough spots from time to time.=20

All the existing independent system operators have actively considered=20
demand-side bids at one time or another, according to Richard Rudden,=20
president of the consulting firm R.J. Rudden Associates in Hauppauge, N.Y.=
=20

But what about a negawatt program serving the entire Western Interconnectio=
n?=20
Rather than a supply exchange, aka an independent system operator, put in=
=20
place a "demand exchange" where customers could make a choice: Do I produce=
=20
widgets, run my milling machines, build product or take the power I would=
=20
have used, bid it out and see what happens?=20

Just such a demand exchange within the Western Interconnection is being=20
championed by an unlikely proponent: Reliant Energy Inc.=20

The Houston-based energy giant already has testified in Washington, D.C.,=
=20
concerning the proposal, has had meetings with key Western state government=
=20
leadership and pitched its idea to trade associations and environmental=20
groups.=20

The scorecard: Thus far, no one has laughed, no one has walked away from th=
e=20
conversations=01*no one has said "no," according to Reliant's John H. Stout=
,=20
senior vice president of asset commercialization.=20

"You're taking forced, rotating outages and prioritizing the interruption,=
=20
with the customer (that) can take the outage doing so," said Stout.=20

Much of what Reliant proposes is included in Texas Republican Congressman J=
oe=20
Barton's Electricity Emergency Assistance bill, but no big generator is=20
pushing from the industry side like Reliant.=20

A demand exchange
Like generators, including Reliant, bidding load into the independent syste=
m=20
operator pool, a demand exchange allows retail customers to determine what=
=20
they could spare and bid in a specific load and acceptable price.=20

The negawatt dispatch clearinghouse would develop a bid stack and make it=
=20
available throughout the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC). If a=
=20
particular system needed more power, it would contact the clearinghouse,=20
which would match the least cost set of bids that could be shipped, keeping=
=20
in mind additional transmission charges.=20

Once the bids were identified, the clearinghouse would contact the customer=
=20
and its local control area. The customer would interrupt and the host utili=
ty=20
would move the curtailed megawatts onto an export schedule.=20

One key to the program's success is that no one loses money. The customer=
=20
that gave up its designated electrons would continue to pay its retail=20
supplier for what it didn't actually use, and the customer would receive it=
s=20
bid price, times the megawatts curtailed, minus its regular retail charges,=
=20
plus any payment to the transmission provider.=20

"The key is it gets the incentives right at the margin," said William Hogan=
,=20
a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.=
=20

Another key to the Reliant-championed negawatt program is that it is not=20
seasonal; it doesn't lock a potential megawatt-shedder into a long-term=20
contract.=20

"You can bid into the market every day," said Stout.=20

"It offers a tremendous advantage in that it allows distributive decisions =
to=20
be made, how much a customer is willing to take for an energy entitlement,"=
=20
said Richard Tabors, president of the Cambridge, Mass.-based energy=20
consulting firm Tabors, Carmanis & Associates.=20

As Tabors points out, customers who sell back into the market obviously are=
=20
doing so to play the margin, to make money. But their efforts also will hav=
e=20
a serious impact on the spot market price.=20

"Every megawatt not consumed is a megawatt which doesn't have to be=20
produced," Tabors reasoned. "That lowers the marginal cost, the spot market=
=20
cost. It really comes down to what (specific megawatts) are worth to someon=
e=20
and not worth to me."=20

Heavy users thrilled
Heavy industrial users already are thrilled with the regional negawatt=20
proposal. "We think it is a well thought-out program. We feel customers hav=
e=20
the right to buy power, they should have the right to sell power and ought =
to=20
be compensated like the generators," said John Anderson, executive director=
=20
of ELCON, the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, which represents larg=
e=20
industrial users from nearly every manufacturing sector.=20

Anderson favors this particular plan because it gives the customer choice=
=01*
sound familiar?=01*allowing it to determine when it shuts down or gives up =
its=20
power.=20

"This is voluntary. You know when you will be shut down and thus you won't=
=20
incur any damages," said Anderson. "Many proposals tell the customer to cut=
=20
usage, but it costs money for industrial users to just shut down. Command a=
nd=20
control proposals treat everyone alike=01*and they're not."=20

Stout said at least two vendors have expressed interest in taking part in t=
he=20
Reliant proposal, with discussions already taking place with Automated Powe=
r=20
Exchange Inc. (APX).=20

"We have had discussions with Reliant; we're in the business of working wit=
h=20
generators," said John Melby, vice president for North American marketing f=
or=20
Santa Clara, Calif.-based APX.=20

According to Melby, APX represents more than half the demand response in th=
e=20
California ISO. He said the company could utilize key computer programs and=
=20
systems previously developed to get the region-wide negawatt program up and=
=20
running.=20

The down side
There could be a number of problems in moving forward with such a large pla=
n.=20
Consultant Tabors, for example, pointed to the White House and the Bush=20
administration's seeming preoccupation with supply.=20

Harvard's Hogan said having the power available when needed was key, while=
=20
Reliant's Stout said the biggest hurdle was that many states prohibit retai=
l=20
customers from selling load back into the wholesale market. An obvious=20
solution to that would be passage of the Barton bill; however, nothing is=
=20
certain in such a divided Congress.=20

Thus, Stout continues to travel the West pushing the negawatt program.=20
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the plan some two weeks ago when =
he=20
called a meeting of all California's generators.=20

"We thought he (Davis) generally liked the idea," Stout said.=20

Reliant Energy to lower Calif. peaking unit power prices





New York, May 24 -(BridgeNews) - Reliant Energy said Thursday it will lower

the price of its power bids from emergency limited run time peaking units t=
hat
have environmental permit operating restrictions despite Reliant's concerns
that the state will deplete the available power of these plants too soon. T=
he
company had received criticism for recent high bid prices from these plants=
.



*                    *                     *



Reliant said in a release that it initiated this move in anticipation that
local air quality control boards will lift restrictions on the run time for=
=20
the
units.


In letters sent to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the
Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District and the Ventura County =
Air
Pollution Control District, Reliant said it resubmitted their request for a=
n
extension on the run time limits of its emergency peaking units.


The company said the extensions would reduce the price of bids associated
with these units from the $1500 to $1900 per megawatt hour level to $150 to
$250 per megawatt hour.


Extensions also would help increase the available supply of power during
power emergencies. Currently, the emergency peaking units are allowed to ru=
n
for only a few days per year.


"Reliant has recently been sharply criticized for bids from these plants,"
Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief operating officer of Reliant Energy
Wholesale Group said in a statement. "To show we are committed to working w=
ith
all parties, we are voluntarily reducing prices in the hopes that all the
decision makers in California understand the need to lower restrictions dur=
ing
times of emergencies.


"In essence, we are doing exactly what Governor Gray Davis has suggested,"
Perkins said.  "But if restrictions are not lowered, we will run out of pow=
er
from these units very quickly."


Reliant's position has been that it has purposely bid the power from the
units in question at prices designed to discourage premature use preserve
availability for when the state is forced into emergencies because of low=
=20
power
reserves.


Extensions from the air quality control boards would allow Reliant Energy
to operate these plants without penalty during emergency times and alleviat=
e
the need to ration the units operating time.


But the company said it Reliant Energy intends to lower the prices of the
megawatts produced at this plant, in hopes that restrictions will be raised=
.


The units affected by this commitment include units at Reliant Energy's
Mandalay, Etiwanda, and Ellwood facilities.


Perkins said in his statement that the focus should be on the supply
problem, which he considers to be the root of the current power crisis in t=
he
state.


"It is astonishing that many decision makers continue to take the focus
off of supply in the name of political finger pointing,"  Perkins said.  "A=
s a
result, many Californians still do not believe there is a serious supply
problem."


Independent power generators have come under increasing scrutiny and are
being investigated by the state's Attorney General Bill Lockyer's office fo=

Shaklee Corporation Headquarters Model for Energy Efficiency and Ecology=20
Efforts; Bay Area Company Wins State Award CEO Adds Hybrid Gas-Electric=20
Vehicles to Fleet



PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 24, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation =
 -=20
With energy
costs soaring and electric companies near bankruptcy, authorities and
businesses in California are scrambling for answers. Utilizing
endeavors that can serve as a guide for other California businesses,
one Bay Area company's creative thinking about the environment and
energy conservation has received statewide recognition and acclaim
rather than heftier electricity bills.


In a luncheon event scheduled for May 30th at the Sterling Hotel
in Sacramento, the California Council for Environmental &amp; Economic
Balance (CCEEB) will honor health and wellness company Shaklee
Corporation by presenting it with the Edmund G. "Pat" Brown Award for
its cutting edge climate change initiative designed to create genuine
environmental improvements. Working with the Climate Neutral Network
and four leading U.S. environmental organizations, Shaklee became the
first Climate Neutral Certified enterprise by completely offsetting
its greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that the company has achieved a
net zero impact on global warming. The award, named after the late
California Governor Edmund G. Pat Brown, is the highest honor bestowed
by the CCEEB.


Energy Costs Down by 1/3 at new headquarters


The new world headquarters for Shaklee located in Pleasanton,
California boasts numerous cutting edge energy-saving features and was
constructed using sustainable materials. The company's move from a San
Francisco skyscraper and converted warehouses in Hayward to a freshly
built, environmentally and energy sensitive building in November 1999
reduced Shaklee's energy consumption by more than 900,000 kilowatts of
electricity during the last calendar year resulting in approximately a
30% reduction in energy costs. Just a few of the buildings innovative
features include:


--  Under-floor air system uses gravity and the natural cooling


provided by the concrete subfloor to provide a more effective


way to heat and cool the building.


--  High performance glazing on the windows that limits the


absorption of solar heat and maximizes daylight as well as


shades that are raised or lowered automatically based upon the


solar load.


--  "Lightshelves" that bring daylight deep into the building's


interior and also work to shade the building during the


hottest parts of the day, reducing the amount of energy needed


for heating and cooling.


--  Timers that control exterior and interior lights and motion


sensors that turn on lights and equipment, and dimmers that


reduce light when natural light is sufficient.


Hybrid Gas-Electric Car Added to Shaklee Fleet


In a further environmental/conservation effort, Shaklee CEO Bob
Schults recently traded in his company SUV for a Prius. The car is the
world's first mass-produced hybrid vehicle that combines a highly
efficient gasoline engine with an electric motor. Its energy-efficient
and environmentally friendly features include an average 52 miles per
gallon in the city and an emission rate of 50 percent less carbon
dioxide than most other cars.


Schults was so pleased with his Prius that he added it as an
option to Shaklee's Bonus Car Program, one of the top 25 company-owned
commercial fleets in the country. "It's only appropriate that we made
this car a part of Shaklee's automotive fleet to encourage everyone to
become more eco-friendly," Schults said. "The U.S., not to mention the
world at large, needs it now more than ever before."


The CCEEB is not alone in recognizing Shaklee's environmental
efforts. In 2000 Shaklee has also received the Earth Day New York
Environmental Business Leadership Award, the Business Environmental
Network Award from Bay Area Action and the Peninsula Conservation
Center Foundation, and the City of Pleasanton Mayor's Commendable
Commute Awards for the highest rate of employee use of mass transit
and telecommuting.


CCEEB is a coalition of California business, labor and public
leaders who work together to advance collaborative strategies for a
sound economy and a healthy environment. CCEEB was founded almost 30
years ago by the late Governor Pat Brown because he and other key
leaders believed that new thinking was needed to effectively address
challenges facing California. As the only statewide private,
nonprofit, nonpartisan association to represent the interests of both
industry and labor, CCEEB takes pride in its ability to achieve
results by bringing creative and effective solutions to the forefront
of policy debate.


Founded in 1956, Shaklee is a global consumer products company,
recognized as an industry pioneer with a trusted name in health and
wellness. For more information, visit www.shaklee.com.

Asked about the conversation, Mr. Lay praised Mr. Hebert, but recalled it=

during their talk. But Mr. Lay had an unusual opportunity to make his case=
=20
about candidates in writing and in person to Mr. Bush's personnel adviser,=

Clay Johnson. And when Mr. Bush picked nominees to fill two vacant Republic=

Senior Bush administration officials said they welcomed Mr. Lay's input but=

''We'll make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy,''=
=20
Mr. Cheney said in an interview, not what ''Enron thinks.''=20
The Bush-Lay bond traces back to Mr. Bush's father and involves a personal=
=20
and philosophical affinity. Moreover, Enron and its executives gave $2.4=20
million to federal candidates in the last election, more than any other=20
energy company. While some of that went to Democrats, 72 percent went to=20
Republicans, according to an analysis of election records by the Center for=
=20
Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group.=20
''He's for a lot of things we're for,'' said Mr. Johnson.=20
But when it came to deciding on nominees for the commission, Mr. Johnson sa=
id=20
that Mr. Lay's views were not that crucial. The two most important advisers=
,=20
he said, were Andrew Lundquist, the director of Mr. Cheney's energy task=20
force, and Pat Wood 3rd, the head of the Texas public utility commission.=
=20
As governor, Mr. Bush named Mr. Wood to the utility commission. This year,=
=20
when the White House filled the two Republican slots on the federal agency,=
=20
Mr. Wood was the first choice, Mr. Johnson said.=20
Consumer advocates and business executives praise Mr. Wood. But Mr. Lay als=

In all, there are five seats on the commission, two held by Republicans, tw=

tug of war: power marketers like Enron are trying to break into markets and=
=20

The commission's chairman has considerable latitude in setting its agenda.=
=20
As part of its oversight of the wholesale electricity markets, the commissi=
on=20
ordered several companies to refund what it considered excessively high=20
prices this year in California. One lesser offender named in the commission=
's=20
public filings -- $3.2 million, of a total of $125 million -- was an Enron=
=20
subsidiary in Oregon.=20
Enron owns few generating assets, but buys and sells electricity in the=20
market. Many of those transactions resemble the complicated risk-shifting=
=20
techniques used by Wall Street for financial instruments.=20
Mr. Hebert, after he became chairman, initiated an examination into the=20
effects those techniques have on the electricity markets. ''One of our=20
problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex=
=20
arbitrage activities of a company like Enron,'' he said, adding, ''we're=20
trying to do it now, and we may have some results soon.''=20
William L. Massey, one of the agency's two Democratic commissioners, said h=
e=20
supported the inquiry but had not been aware of it -- an indication of the=
=20
chairman's ability to set the commission's agenda.=20
Finally, the commission is trying to speed the pace of electricity=20
deregulation by opening up the nation's transmission grid, much of which is=
=20
owned by privately owned utilities that enjoy retail monopolies. Some Enron=
=20
officials say the commission has been moving too slowly to open the grid.=
=20
They attribute some of the problem to utilities. But they also fault Mr.=20
Hebert.=20
''Hebert still has undeserved confidence in some of the vertically integrat=
ed=20
companies coming to the table and dealing openly'' with transmission access=
=20
issues, said Richard S. Shapiro, an Enron senior vice president.=20
The utilities, however, maintain that they provide cheap and reliable servi=
ce=20
for their customers. Washington lobbyists for one Southern utility said tha=
t=20
Enron was really interested in focusing on the utility's big-business=20
clients, which under state regulation pay higher rates than residential=20
customers.=20
Since 1996, about half the states have moved to open their retail markets t=
o=20
competition, and the commission has begun to make it easier for outsiders t=
o=20
use the nation's transmission grid. But the promise of cheaper rates has be=
en=20
largely unfulfilled. So the push for more deregulation, in which Enron has=
=20
been a leader, has slowed, especially when California's flawed program led =
to=20
skyrocketing rates and chaotic markets.=20
Mr. Hebert is a free-market conservative who favors deregulation but also=
=20
recognizes the importance of state's rights. A former Mississippi regulator=
,=20
he is a protege of Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader from Mississipp=
i.=20
Mr. Hebert said Mr. Lott was instrumental in his nomination to the commissi=
on=20
in 1997 by President Clinton.=20
President Bush elevated Mr. Hebert to chairman on Inauguration Day, a move=
=20
Mr. Lay said he told the White House he supported.=20
Mr. Johnson, the White House personnel chief, said that Mr. Lott and Mr.=20
Hebert had both been told that Mr. Hebert could remain chairman at least=20
until the administration's nominees -- Mr. Wood and Nora Brownell, a=20
Pennsylvania utility regulator -- are confirmed by the full Senate. The=20
Senate energy committee voted earlier this week to approve the two nominees=
,=20
after a hearing last week indicated strong support.=20
It is widely expected that President Bush will name Mr. Wood to replace Mr.=
=20
Hebert as chairman after the Senate acts.=20
In an interview for a forthcoming episode of ''Frontline,'' the PBS series,=
=20
Mr. Cheney suggested as much. ''Pat Wood's got to be the new chairman of th=
e=20
F.E.R.C., and he'll have to address'' various problems in the electricity=
=20
markets, he said.=20
Mr. Hebert said that no one had told him he was being replaced. If someone=
=20
else is named chairman, Mr. Hebert can remain a commissioner until the end =
of=20
his term, which expires in 2004.=20
It was a few weeks after President Bush made him chairman that Mr. Hebert=
=20
said he spoke by telephone with Mr. Lay.=20
Mr. Lay told him that ''he and Enron would like to support me as chairman,=
=20
but we would have to agree on principles'' involving the commission's role =
in=20
expanding electricity competition, Mr. Hebert said of the conversation.=20
A senior commission official who was in Mr. Hebert's office during the=20
conversation said Mr. Hebert rebuffed Mr. Lay's offer of a quid pro quo. Th=
e=20
official said that he heard Mr. Hebert's side of the conversation and then,=
=20
after the call ended, learned the rest from him.=20
Mr. Hebert said that he, too, backed competition but did not think the=20
commission had the legal authority to tell states what to do in this area.=
=20
Concerning the issue of opening transmission access through the creation of=
=20
regional networks, Mr. Hebert supports a voluntary process while Enron seek=
s=20
a faster and more compulsory system.=20
Mr. Lay said that while he might have discussed issues relating to the=20
commission's authority concerning access to the grid, ''there was never any=
=20
intent'' to link that or any other issue to Mr. Hebert's job status.=20
The commission is a quasijudicial agency, so decision-makers like Mr. Heber=
t=20
must avoid private discussions about specific matters pending before the=20
commission. Mr. Hebert and Mr. Lay both said that line was not crossed, but=
=20
Mr. Hebert said he had never had such a blunt talk with an energy-industry=
=20
executive.=20
Mr. Lay added that his few recent conversations with Mr. Hebert were nothin=

SACRAMENTO -- In a significant policy change aimed at minimizing business a=
nd=20
consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state officials Thursday to=
=20
enact a three-tier blackout warning system.=20
Forecasts of blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said.=20
General areas will be identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely=
=20
outages. Precise locations will be announced an hour before the power is cu=
t,=20
he said.=20
Business executives, police and consumers have complained that the current=
=20
warning system--in which blackouts can come with less than 10 minutes'=20
warning--does not give them sufficient time to save information on computer=
s,=20
shut down assembly lines, safeguard traffic intersections and otherwise=20
prevent financial loss and mayhem when the power goes out.=20
In the past, state grid operators only gave short notice because they often=
=20
found enough power at the last minute to avert blackouts. They said they di=
d=20
not want to repeatedly alarm people. Utility officials have said they feare=
d=20
that advance warning would leave neighborhoods vulnerable to looters and=20
burglars.=20
But crime has not been a problem during California's six days of blackouts =
so=20
far this year. And with experts predicting dozens of days of forced outages=
=20
this summer, state and utility leaders say Californians are better off=20
prepared.=20
"If blackouts are going to occur," Davis said, "there is no reason to keep=
=20
the public in the dark. We all deserve as much advance notice as possible."=
=20
Utility customers will be notified through company Web sites and radio and=
=20
television announcements. Starting with June utility bills, Southern=20
California Edison customers will be given "block" numbers that allow them t=
o=20
learn through the Edison Web site, http://www.sce.com, if they are schedule=
d=20
for rotating blackouts on days of short supply.=20
Under the governor's order, Edison spokesman Brian Bennett said, consumers=
=20
can expect 24-hour warnings about general areas--Santa Monica or Santa Ana,=
=20
for example--that might be targeted for hourlong blackouts.=20
At 60 minutes before a blackout is triggered, Bennett said, the warnings=20
delivered through radio, television and the Internet will get much more=20
precise. "For example," he said, "One hour before, we'll say Main Street in=
=20
Santa Monica . . . will be affected."=20
Leaders of the agency responsible for deciding when blackouts must be=20
triggered said Thursday they intend to launch the governor's order by June=
=20
15. And if Californians redouble their conservation efforts when they hear =
of=20
blackout warnings, they said, the governor's order will ultimately help the=
=20
state avoid blackouts.=20
"I think we're going to save power, potentially lives; we're going to help=
=20
save jobs and California's economy," said Carl Guardino, a member of the=20
board that oversees the California Independent System Operator, which manag=
es=20
75% of the state's transmission system.=20
Davis announced his order at a news conference attended by law enforcement=
=20
officials, including Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, who said he inten=
ds=20
to unveil a more detailed plan for the county today.=20
For some, the decision to give warning was an acknowledgment that the state=
=20
is failing to solve the energy crisis.=20
"It obviously says we're surrendering to the electricity crisis," said Sen.=
=20
Tom McClintock (R-Northridge. "Here we've arrived in the 21st century, with=
=20
all the electronics, and we don't have the power to run them."=20
Utility spokesmen lauded the plan, but said that much of the responsibility=
=20
rests with Cal-ISO, which is the only entity that has the ability to track=
=20
supplies.=20
"If the ISO only gives us 60-minutes warning, our customers will get=20
something less than 60-minutes notice," said John Nelson, spokesman for=20
Pacific Gas & Electric.=20
As it works now, Cal-ISO informs utilities of pending blackouts. The utilit=
y,=20
in turn, informs county offices of emergency services. Using computerized=
=20
calling, e-mail and manual dialing, the utilities also inform law=20
enforcement, major industrial users, people on life support and other=20
consumers for whom electricity is vital, Nelson said.=20
Californians at large are expected to learn of the warnings through the med=
ia=20
and the Cal-ISO Web site, http://www.caiso.com.=20
Also on Thursday, Davis met with officials of California's publicly owned=
=20
utility districts and came away, he said, with promises that they would sel=
l=20
excess power to the state at prices significantly lower than on the spot=20
market.=20






Legislature hangs Davis out to dry=20
By Nick Driver
Of The Examiner Staff=20
Democratic and Republican legislators are vying to scuttle Gov. Gray Davis'=
=20
plan to buy transmission lines from electric utilities and replace it with=
=20
one of their own.=20
The confusion in Sacramento sidelines what was an imminent deal for a San=
=20
Diego-area utility, and throws further in doubt any future deal to purchase=
=20
PG&E lines through bankruptcy proceedings.=20
And all this is happening before President Bush arrives Tuesday to tout his=
=20
own transmission line deal.=20
A week ago, Davis finally found a term-limited senator, Richard Polanco,=20
D-Los Angeles, to sponsor legislation to purchase Southern California Ediso=
n=20
lines. Now, the governor's office admits that talks will not proceed until=
=20
the Legislature agrees on how to finance the buyout of SoCal Edison's lines=
.=20
Some Assembly Democrats have proposed an innovative alternative to the Davi=
s=20
plan, giving the state a five-year option to purchase all power lines for=
=20
$1.2 billion. While a much lower price, the bill would also lower Edison's=
=20
debt by forcing power marketers to accept 75 percent of the $3.5 billion ow=
ed=20
them.=20
Under the terms of that proposal, the state would still have to loan Edison=
=20
money -- around $1 billion -- and would guarantee SoCal Edison's sale of a=
=20
further $2 billion in bonds. The state would also receive a conservation=20
easement on 21,000 acres of Sierra Nevada watershed land.=20
As in the Davis bill, SoCal Edison would sell the state relatively low-cost=
=20
electricity for 10 years from one of its power plants, and force parent=20
company Edison International to repay $400 million in transfers.=20
A Republican plan labeled "Plan R" now making its way through the halls of=
=20
the legislature is similar to its Democratic sister, except it allows the=
=20
state to take stock in all new plants SoCal Edison is forced to build.=20
The Democratic bill's sponsors, Assemblymen John Dutra, D-Fremont; Joe=20
Nation, D-San Rafael; and Joe Canciamilla, D-Pittsburg; believe they can=20
persuade Edison's board of directors to approve their deal, even though it =
is=20
not as attractive as the governor's offer. Edison refused to comment on the=
=20
plan.=20
Republicans led by Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge, were trying a=
=20
different strategy Wednesday. The minority party's "Plan R" has not been=20
introduced as official legislation, but instead floated among Republicans a=
nd=20
Democrats alike to get momentum before introduction.=20
Both groups say their bills represent SoCal Edison's only real alternative =
to=20
bankruptcy, and that the beleaguered utility may soon join its northern=20
neighbor, PG&E, in bankruptcy.=20
So far, Edison has been able to renegotiate debts with power generators=20
charging high wholesale prices. PG&E declared bankruptcy April 6.=20
A governor's office staffer said the legislative impasse had diverted all=
=20
attention away from any deal-making, but that the two sides continued to me=
et=20
frequently.=20
Another adviser, Joe Fichera, said "there are lots of moving parts" to the=
=20
deal to purchase all of San Diego Gas and Electric's transmission lines, bu=
t=20
that he continued to meet with company representatives, including an all-da=
y=20
meeting Monday. In San Diego, a spokesman for SDG&E referred all calls to t=
he=20
governor's office.=20
But the sponsor of the Davis bill, Polanco, is not one of the legislature's=
=20
power brokers, and most lawmakers said the $2.76 billion memorandum of=20
understanding is now in serious jeopardy.=20
A bankruptcy could lead to even greater chaos, including the threat of an=
=20
increase in blackouts. The governor and business leaders have said the=20
economy would suffer as the likelihood of blackouts and service outages=20
rises.=20
Legislators, policy wonks and consumer groups continue to argue over the ne=
ed=20
and desirability of the state owning the aging lines that snake across the=
=20
state, especially if the bulk of them -- now owned by Pacific Gas and=20
Electric Co. -- are still not for sale.=20
Critics such as Senate President John Burton, D-San Francisco, one of the=
=20
bill's strongest proponents three months ago, now say the state should not =
be=20
in the business of replacing or upgrading dilapidated lines at a cost of=20
upwards of $1 billion.=20
Others see the state as the best candidate for improving a system long=20
neglected by utilities.=20
"State ownership of the transmission grid would be a better way to help gri=
d=20
problems such as connecting wind generators," said Joe Ito, an energy analy=
st=20
at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. "It has been extremely difficult to buil=
d=20
new transmission capacity over the last 10 years, especially into bottlenec=
ks=20
like San Francisco."=20
Bush unveiled his Energy Plan last week, including a key plank that would=
=20
allow the federal government to use eminent domain to purchase private land=
=20
and build more transmission lines. Bush arrives Tuesday for talks with Davi=

on this and other solutions to the energy crisis.=20
