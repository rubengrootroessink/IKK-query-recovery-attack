Lisa - Security has confirmed your access to the system, please try to get 
into it again.  If if doesn't work right away, follow the steps below to 
re-load the icons.  If you still have problems after that, please let me know 
and we'll loop in the developer to find out what's going on.

Thanks!

Ginger - This has been tested and should now work for everyone.  Please 
forward this message to Rick's group.

Project Tracking (with RCRs) has been moved from the EES server to the Corp 
server.  We need to re-establish everyone's connection to the application.

To check to see if you have a link to the correct copy of the application, in 
Lotus Notes right click on each link to the application, then select 
Database, Properties, and check the server name, which should be ENE-NS05.  
If it is this server name, you can skip the rest of this message.

If that's not the server you're accessing for each link, follow these steps.

- Delete from your Lotus Notes workspace your existing links to the project 
tracking system.  You should have three links - Project Tracking, Projects 
and Contacts.  To delete each link, click on the link and press the delete 
key.
- Click on each of the attached links to re-load the system on the new 
server.  When you click each one, it will add the link to your Lotus Notes 
workspace.  You should be launched into the database as each database loads.


Please double check each link following the directions at the beginning of 
this message to make sure it's linked to the ENE-NS05 server.
- If the server name is different, please leave me a voicemail or send me an 
e-mail.

The Projects database is the one you'll access for project management and 
RCRs.  The Contacts database was created for future use, and the Project 
Management database is necessary for administrative purposes.
