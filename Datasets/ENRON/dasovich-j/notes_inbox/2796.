Subject: Invited to speak at UCI Corporate Retreat in Ojai by Sen Joe Dunn


The lead Senator for the California Senate Select Committee of Manipulation 
of Electricity in the Wholesale Market invited me to a Univ of California - 
Irvine CEO Executive Roundtable retreat at the Ojai Valley Inn on June 9 
(Saturday).? It's just me, Sentaor Dunn, and Anjali Sheffrin of the ISO on 
the panel.? The audience is 144 CEOs from businesses located in the Irvine, 
and the south Orange County area. 

If you have any special bullet items you want to send me in preparation for 
this, then do so.? Don't send me things you think I already have from you 
(e.g, info in preparation for the Kathleen Connell Conttroller's Quarterly 
article).? This crowd should be more business friendly than, say, Women of 
LA.
