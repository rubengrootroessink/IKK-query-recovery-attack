Judging from a number of e-mails I've gotten, this note may not have gotten
through.  So here it comes again.

HI Everyone,

It's just about time to think about registering for Fall 01 classes.  Early
next week, TJ will be sending materials to your home addresses, and it's
very important that you read through them carefully.  In the meantime, I've
attached a preliminary list of electives that will be offered.

Most importantly, please remember that there are two rounds of
pre-enrollment for Fall 01 classes.  You must enroll in classes during
Round I to retain your seniority status in classes.  So, for example, if
you are going to be a fifth semester student in the fall and forget to sign
up for classes during Round I, and then try to get into an oversubscribed
class in Round II, you will have lost your seniority status because you did
not sign up in Round I.

For those of you who would like to get academic advising (e.g., "Which
courses do I take if I want to be a consumer products marketer?) or program
planning (e.g., "How do graduate in five semesters?") please feel free to
make a telephone or in-person appointment with me.  (Advising by e-mail is
nearly impossible because of the level detail required for effective
advising.)

As course descriptions become available, they will be put up on the web.

UPDATES ON UNKNOWNS IN THE EvMBA ELECTIVE COURSES

E220, Corporate Financial Reporting, Brett Trueman:  Brett Trueman is the
Accounting group chair and is a fabulous teacher, winning the Outstanding
Teacher of the Year Award in the day program.  If you're interested in
Corporate Finance or Investments, you should take this course eventually.

E234, Corporate Finance, Levy:  Amnon Levy has a PhD from Kellogg, did his
undergraduate work in economics here at Berkeley, and is visiting next year
from NYU.

E236, Futures and Options, Manuel Ammann:  Prof Ammann is a visitor from
the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.  He visited here last year,
and I heard he is great.

E259-1, Leadership, Nancy Euske:  Nancy teaches the core course in OB and
has done an excellent job.  This will NOT be Jenny Chatman's Leadership
course taught by Nancy Euske.  It will be Nancy's Leadership
course.  Please check the web site for a detailed description.

E264, High-Tech Marketing; Rajiv:  Surendra Rajiv has a PhD from Carnegie
Mellon and will be visiting here next year from the University of
Chicago.  He's taught High Tech Marketing and Pricing Strategies in both
the full - and part-time MBA programs at Chicago.

E268, Branding, Upshaw:  Lynn Upshaw is principal of Upshaw & Associates, a
national brand and marketing consulting practice.  Mr. Upshaw was formerly
Executive Vice President/Brand Marketing for Ketchum Communications
Worldwide and has written two books "Building Brand Identity:  A Strategy
for Success in a Hostile Marektplace" and "The Masterbrand Mandate."

E278-1, Deals; Shelanski:  Howard Shelanski is a professor at Boalt, and
the basic premise of the course is to tie contract theory, contract law,
and business strategy together.  "How do structures of relationships
between firms, or more generally contracting parties, change with contract
law and strategic imperatives?  The course will give students some tools to
think about 'business development' from both a legal and economic standpoint."

E296-4, E-Business Supply Chain Management, Hamid Noori:  Hamid is a
Professor of Technology and Operations Management at the Laurier Business
School, Wilfird Laureir University in Waterloo, Ontario.

E296-5, New Telecom Ventues, Bob Harris:  Bob Harris is a (young) retired
faculty member, who went on to establish a very successful consulting
company.  Bob is a great teacher (I had him for Macro), and he is thrilled
to be back teaching a course on Entrepreneurship in Telecommunications.

E296-6 Pricing Strategy, Scott Davis:  Scott is teaching this course this
semester and is doing a great job.  He used to be a faculty member at
Washington University in St. Louis where he won the Outstanding Teacher of
the Year Award, but he moved out here and established a successful
marketing consulting practice in the Sacramento area.

COURSES YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT IN THE DAY PROGRAM:
BA235 Portfolio Management (Th 2 - 4:00 pm), Jim Wilcox:  Jim teaches our
E201B class (though he has been serving in Washington DC as Comptroller of
the Treasury for the past two years)  and won the Outstanding Teacher of
the Year Award in the EvMBA Program just before he left for DC.  This
course will be banking related covering topics such as interest risk and
measuring and controlling credit risk in financial institutions.

BA278 Contemporary Philanthropy (Th 4:00 - 6:00  pm), Fran Van Loo:  Fran
is a Haas economist who also runs the Public and Not-for-Profit Program.

BA295C Entrepreneurship Workshop (M 2 - 4:00 pm), Danner:  This course is
for those students who are actually in the process of "going live" with an
entrepreneurial idea.  Please check the website for details.

BA299D Strategic Marketing Planning (Th 4 - 6:00 pm), Peter Wilton:  Some
overlap with E210, but definitely a great class taught by a great instructor.


SOME GENERAL COMMENTS:

(1)  You should try to take Competitive Strategy as late in your program as
you possibly can.  You will get a lot more out of it if you bring to the
course as much previous coursework as possible.  Obviously, you need to
balance this against the risk of the course not being offered in subsequent
semesters, but it is best to take that course later in your
program.  Currently, Katz is scheduled to teach the course in Spring 02 as
well as F01.

(2)  Finance is divided into two main areas:  Corporate Finance and 
Investments
- Corporate Finance:  if you are interested in corporate finance you would
probably want to take some combination of  E234, E220, E232, E285 (for
companies doing a lot of international/global operations), and perhaps
E233, and perhaps E222 (Valuation - for large companies involved in a lot
of acquisitions).

- Investments:  if you're interested in Investments (investment banking,
financial services, etc.), you should probably want to take some
combination of  E234, E220 and/or E222 (for individuals going into Mergers
and Acquisitions), E233 and/or E236, and E285 (if your company is  involved
in intl markets).

(3)  If you don't want to go into finance but feel like you need a little
more finance that just E203, Money Markets (E232) is a great class taught
by a great instructor.  Please see web for more detail.

(4)  If you are truly interested in concentrating in marketing, the two
"core electives" for marketers are E261, Marketing Research, and E262B,
Product Management.  These two courses will  give you the critical basics
needed for careers in marketing.  Additionally, Pricing Strategy is an
important course.  The many other marketing classes are more specific to
particular industries (e.g., Internet Strategy, High-Tech Marketing, etc.).

(5)  I believe very strongly that EVERYONE should graduate with at least
one OB elective.  In addition to the very popular Negotiations course, we
have some other great OB classes:  Org Strategy with Bahrami; Leadership
with Chatman or Euske; Power and Politics in Orgs with Schroth in Spring
02, etc..  When alums are surveyed, they always say "I wish I took more
OB!"  (I know - you've heard me say this a million times!)

If anything else comes up, I'll keep you posted.

Cheers,

Diane
