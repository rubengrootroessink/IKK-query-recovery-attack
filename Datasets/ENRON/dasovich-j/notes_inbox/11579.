The only thing in particular I think you need to be ready for are the 
"federalism" questions.  If past history is an indication, there will 
probably be a split in the group between those who support giving FERC 
greater authority and control and those who oppose it on the grounds that it 
takes power away from states and smaller, more localized entities.

You will do a great job with this.

I think it would be neat to begin with the old Blue Book vision that you were 
so involved with and then fast forward to the present and let Davis have it!  
The crowd needs to understand the political "why's" behind his strategy and 
where we are now.

Also, a look at what the industry did right and wrong would be interesting to 
this group.

How can the think tank crowd help us going forward on the general issue of 
"trusting" and de-politicizing the market?

Thanks Pat.  

Do you know who will be in the audience?  And how many folks we are 
expecting?  Also, if there are specific things that you folks want/don't want 
me to say, please let me know.

Best,
Jeff

The Enron-sponsored briefing on energy policy will be from 5-6:30 pm in the 
Booth Room on the 5th floor of the Marriott Marquis on Friday, August 3.  Our 
presentation will be done by Jeff Dasovich.  Grover Norquist and Americans 
for Tax Reform will be carrying out all logistics.  

There should be time for the presentation, questions, and discussion.

Best,

Pat
