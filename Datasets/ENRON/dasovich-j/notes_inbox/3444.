EMISSIONS CONTROLS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE
 July 23-25, 2001
 Crowne Plaza Hotel at the Crossings
 Providence, Rhode Island

 Ray Ganga

Communication, Education and Outreach Committee Chairman


Ronald C. Lutwen
SFT, Inc
 Conference Chairman


 Have you had a chance to consider the potential impacts of pending new
regulations on industrial powerplant facilities, what you might have to do
and what your alternatives may be?  The Boiler Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) Standards to be proposed this year; the Regional Haze
Standards that will begin to be implemented; the consideration of short
term SO2 standards again; and, the implementation process for the Fine
Particulate National Ambient Air Quality Standards (PM NAAQS) will all
impact existing sources, big and small. The permitting process for any new
or existing facility is demanding Best Available Control Technologies
(BACT) or Lowest Achievable Emission Rates (LAER) on almost all sources for
Particulate, Sulfur Dioxide, Mercury, Chlorine, and a host of other
emissions.  How will this impact your company and your job?

 If you are an industrial corporate environmental or energy engineer or
manager with the responsibility to make sure there is sufficient energy to
run the company and comply with environmental regulations, you should be
represented at this conference.  If you are an Architect/Engineer or
energy/environmental consulting firm, you should be represented. If you are
an equipment supplier with interest in the industrial market place, you
should be represented.  And, if you are a state regulator with interest in
what can actually be accomplished in the industrial sector, you should be
represented.  CIBO conferences have been noted for bringing the full range
of stakeholders together for practical discussions and education on energy
and environmental issues to promote progress on environmental issues and
secure a competitive and strong energy future for the United States.

 The time is now for the consideration of what will be required over the
next two to ten years.  What you learn from attending this conference could
save you countless hours of frustration, provide a foundation for current
and future planning and open a host of alternatives not before considered.
