> This afternoon, PG&E filed an emergency application with the CPUC asking
> it to declare there is a gas supply emergency on PG&E's system, and asking
> it to compel Southern California Gas to provide mutual assistance to PG&E
> by purchasing gas for PG&E's core customers.  The filing is attached,
> along with the declarations from Kent Harvey and Kirk Johnson which
> supported it, which explain the gas supply emergency and the possible
> consequences.  After the filing was completed, PG&E received notice from
> Sempra that effective Saturday, it will be cutting off over ten percent of
> the total supply currently available to PG&E's core customers.  I added
> that late breaking news to the filing letter, which is also attached.
